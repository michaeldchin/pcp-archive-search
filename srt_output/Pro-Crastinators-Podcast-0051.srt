00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:21,320
guy ever. Check the encyclopedia for best. That's me. We've also got Hippocrit is here.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I want Wuya to be my parent.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,080
Mumkey Jones is here.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,080
Hey everybody I'm Mumkey Jones. You look up Mumkey in the dictionary. That's a picture

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
of me.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Tom Oliver is here.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Yeah. I have nothing witty to say.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,080
And our last guy is Mumkey Jones is here.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Hey guys it's me, Munchy.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,080
And to exercise my independence from my parents I'm about to order a pizza and I'm going to

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,080
have to get it on air like 30 minutes from now.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
That's fascinating.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,080
When you said you want Wuya to be your mom, do you mean like Wuya from Shallown Showdown?

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Or the game console, the Wuya.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Well either.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Now what's your favorite Shen Gong Wu from Shallown Showdown?

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
It's been a long time.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Just say the Mikey stuff.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Mummy! My pizza! Can you get it for me, Mummy?

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,080
She's such a good woman.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,080
I know. I have seen her vagina and it has served me well.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Okay moving on.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Speaking of having sex with people we're talking about Munchy's parents today.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Munchy, is your mom actually hot?

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Nah.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,080
I've kind of got a thing for Mexican chicks.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
No, she's not the Mexican one.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
What the fuck?

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,080
You're another one of those mixed breed fucking dogs?

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Cuckolds.

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Did your dad get thrown over the wall?

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Is that what happened?

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Dad!

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,080
My Mexican pizza dad!

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Munchy, I thought it was revealed that I'm your father and I'm also the Zodiac killer.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Well yeah, that's why you're over the wall, bro.

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
You're going to get deported.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,080
And I voted for Trump. It was the ultimate betrayal.

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Okay, so Trump is my real dad.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,080
We're talking about parents. That's what's going on.

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,080
So where do we fucking take a discussion about parents?

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
I guess we can start with the tales of our own and the various rapes they've committed.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Are we going to discuss childhood and parents or just the parents or just the wife fucking?

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
It's all connected, man.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Whatever tickles your face.

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Everything that goes with parenting and parents and stuff.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
I guess I'll begin.

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,080
I like my dad. He's cool. He's a cool guy.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,080
He's confident and he's reserved, but he knows how to do things.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
He's a business man. He's a smart man.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
He's always been on the right side of debates.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Always? Always?

54
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,080
When it comes to like stuff on the news.

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
What did your dad vote for in Brexit?

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,080
He's the sort of person who would like,

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,080
you know what, I'll give Trump a chance, but I don't like, I mean, you know.

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Sounds like a misogynist.

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
So he voted to leave the European Union.

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
No, I don't know what he voted.

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
A real hero.

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
But like he's got that nuance.

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,080
He's got that understanding of like nuance that I like in people that it doesn't exist in anyone except my dad.

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
And he's like actually cool.

65
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,080
You know, I was going to say, you know, we all have a strong bias in that we all know our parents,

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,080
like especially our parents, we know better than anyone else in our lives for the most part,

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
except maybe our siblings.

68
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,080
But in any case, it's a lot easier to look at them and see the complexities going behind them

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,080
as opposed to like some guy who voted for Trump.

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Like who knows what his complicated reasonings are other than, you know, hating immigrants, you know, being racist.

71
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Because he thought it would be funny. I'm right here, Nate.

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
But in any case.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,080
It's like, it's just sort of, you know, he introduced me.

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Like he is always like the sort of sensible one when it comes to like things that happen on the news.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
He's like, well, you know, this isn't that.

76
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
And it's not just that I grew up with him.

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:32,080
It's that stuff on the internet that has influenced me is sort of like the smart people on the internet also are doing what dad's saying.

79
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,080
And he goes on Facebook and that's like, whoa, how could you be like smart and a Facebook user?

80
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,080
I thought they didn't allow dads on Facebook.

81
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,080
I thought that was an infamnia, as the Italians say.

82
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Also, he's really funny and that's why I'm funny.

83
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Now, Hippo, I got a question for you about your parents.

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,080
How much do they know about your internet presence and do they support your YouTube dreams?

85
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
I think we should all go to that at some point.

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,080
My parents know basically that I do YouTube stuff and make money from it.

87
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,080
It was a bit awkward the first time I tried to explain it because they had no idea that that was, you know, internet.

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Like because like they're wary of scams.

89
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Like there was one time where I was like looking up how to be a ninja and it was like a course that you had to pay for.

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
And I was like, no, it's real.

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Like they show you like how to do it.

92
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Now, was this when you were six or was this like six days ago?

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
It's like 16.

94
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Like it's like, you know, it's embarrassing, but it's funny.

95
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
So it's funny.

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
It's fine.

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:43,080
But like, you know, they think, yeah, it's basically just a bunch of crap like dude's press ups and whatever.

98
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,080
But anyway, they're wary of like things scamming me as a kid.

99
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,080
So if I, you know, I wasn't sure whether to tell them I do internet jobs, money, YouTube adsense and they wouldn't understand it.

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,080
But they, they surprisingly, you know, just understood it as like, oh yeah, it's just like a thing.

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
You know, it's like new.

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
It's like the new wave.

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,080
We don't understand it, but it's new and that's cool and go on and do it.

104
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I don't know.

105
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:17,080
I think my mom watches most of my videos and it's kind of embarrassing sometimes because that means she knows that I swear and I don't know how to feel about that.

106
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
But she's, yeah.

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Your mom watches your videos about video games, but she doesn't play video games herself.

108
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Are you saying your mom's a fucking fake gamer?

109
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

110
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
It's okay because she plays Bejeweled and like cow clickers on her iPad.

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
She's a real gamer.

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
She played, you know, she's a Farmville mom.

113
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
She's one of those.

114
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Now, can we all, can we all assume that your mom is not subscribed to Gibbon Take because I think you would have been like arrested at this point if she knew about it?

115
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
No, no, she subscribed to that.

116
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
She subscribed to Gibbon Take because it was my first one.

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Oh my God.

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Hypocrite.

119
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,080
She probably likes Gibbon Take more because it's more personal, you know?

120
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
She must think that her son is crazy.

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
No.

122
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Well, I mean.

123
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Now, now Gibbon, what is a shit post?

124
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
I don't understand.

125
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
I can't do a British accent.

126
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I understand her mom voice.

127
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Yeah.

128
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,080
It's a woman voice, first of all, because they're all shrill and retarded.

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
And also, I can't do a British accent.

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
It is me a foreigner.

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm a foreigner in Turkey.

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Hello, Gibbon.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
This is me, your mom.

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I want you to understand your videos.

135
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Oh, that reminds me.

136
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
My dad's like a really good cook.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Like he cooks like all types of things like curries and Italian food.

138
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Italian accent reminded you.

139
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,080
No, because he's really good at cooking Italian things and he knows a lot of things about Italians.

140
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
I am a quarter Italian, all right?

141
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
And how dare you say my people are good at cooking.

142
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
That's very offensive.

143
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Italian's not a fucking race.

144
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
What are you talking about?

145
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
It's not a fucking race.

146
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Get rid of Italians.

147
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Number two, get rid of Russians.

148
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Those are the worst people.

149
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Italians and Russians.

150
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Russian girls are hot.

151
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Monkey.

152
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
You're about to order pizza, monkey.

153
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Why are you saying this about Italians?

154
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
I don't know.

155
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
They're poison.

156
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,080
I think Russian girls have the objectively hottest accent.

157
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I've done the studies and that's what the survey says.

158
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,080
They're talk like they got the dick already in their mouth.

159
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
You know.

160
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Halfway there already.

161
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Of course.

162
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Women are objects.

163
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Continue.

164
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Hashtag women are objects.

165
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
You're talking about your dad and how he's going to cook it.

166
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
How your mom's an object?

167
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Yeah.

168
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Oh, no.

169
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
What should I talk about specifically?

170
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Why don't you just tell us about growing up with your parents

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,080
and what use did they provide to you?

172
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,080
What objects and needs did they serve

173
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,080
that could have been better performed by a machine or something like that?

174
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
How late did you get from them?

175
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Well, aside from the obvious food and water

176
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,080
and clothing and roof under my head.

177
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
You have to sleep on the roof.

178
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,080
They have been supportive of my creative endeavors in general.

179
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,080
They've never really forced me to say,

180
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,080
you've got to get a job or you're getting out of here.

181
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I know they want me.

182
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
When I wasn't making any money or doing anything,

183
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
they wanted me to leave and I was like, yeah, I know.

184
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
But they didn't force me.

185
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,080
They're very supportive and they don't take bullshit from my teachers.

186
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
They were always on my side when it was like the teacher being a piece of shit.

187
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
So that was cool.

188
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
That's nice.

189
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Like that time you got in trouble at school

190
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
for saying you were going to kill somebody or something?

191
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Yeah.

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
That's a real story.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Yeah.

194
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
The time I got in trouble...

195
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Wait, that same shit happened to me.

196
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
I thought you were making fun of me.

197
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
No, no.

198
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
It's real.

199
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Oh, man.

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Oh, gee.

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
He will kill you at school if he sees you, kids.

202
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Watch out.

203
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
It wasn't exactly that.

204
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
I wrote in my art book.

205
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Ah, fuck all this shit.

206
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,080
It was basically the fact that I was frustrated

207
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
and I was writing swears in my art book.

208
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
My teacher saw it and instead of talking to me,

209
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:16,080
she just reported my potential dangerous tendencies to the head teacher

210
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,080
so that I was suspended for a few weeks to calm down.

211
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
I'm sure that's like policy they have for reporting.

212
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
It's like that.

213
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,080
But what a fucking cowardly, backhanded way to deal with the situation like that.

214
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,080
When I came back, I really made an effort to be kind of a bitch to that teacher

215
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
because fuck her.

216
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Good.

217
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,080
She does not deserve my respect after not even trying to approach me about it.

218
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Yeah.

219
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Anyway, yes.

220
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Awful.

221
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Put her in the fucking garbage.

222
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
My parents' school sucks too.

223
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah, this is kind of linked.

224
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Yeah, I wanted to be on the school podcast to talk about that.

225
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Fuck the PCP, hippo.

226
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
We'll do a school sucks later.

227
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Yeah.

228
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Yeah.

229
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Shooting your school as if it wasn't easy.

230
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,080
By the way, to all my followers, why is that the new default thing now?

231
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
I get a comment blank as if it was easy all the time.

232
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
It's so easy to add on to something.

233
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
It could be anything you could edit.

234
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,080
You know what I like to add to the end of like titles of things is we're going to make

235
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,080
X look like a fucking joke, you know, like Columbine or 9-11, things like that.

236
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
That's a good name for a sequel.

237
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
The bug wars look like a fucking joke.

238
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Just kidding.

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Oh, no.

240
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
It's too fucking serious.

241
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
You can never make such a jest out of such.

242
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Everyone, make sure you're following Munchy at Munchy Wears Tiny Hats on Twitter to get

243
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
the full bug wars saga documented.

244
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
The bug wars were the most depressed I've ever been in my entire life, especially after

245
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,080
I fell down the stairs after I slipped on a puddle of chocolate in that place by myself.

246
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Fuck.

247
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
The bug wars were awful.

248
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,080
People discussed them no longer.

249
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
A new person, new person.

250
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
This man's too upset.

251
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Okay.

252
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Munchy, why don't you tell us about your...

253
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Wait, I'm sorry.

254
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I meant to say Mumkey.

255
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I meant to say Mumkey.

256
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
I can't sound myself.

257
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Okay.

258
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Mumkey.

259
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
What's up with your parents?

260
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
What, you know, how disappointed?

261
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
I don't know who you mean.

262
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Me or him?

263
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm talking about you, god damn it.

264
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Mumkey.

265
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I can't fucking tell.

266
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
The meat runs too deep.

267
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Mumkey.

268
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Yeah, Mumkey.

269
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Right.

270
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
All right.

271
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Munchy, this question does not apply to you because of your age.

272
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,080
But are you guys aware of the show Viva La Bam?

273
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Yes.

274
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
No, I don't think so.

275
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Okay.

276
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,840
So for anybody at home, it's this old show about the adventures of Bam Margera just harassing

277
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,080
his parents all the time.

278
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,680
And the reason why I bring it up is because I think my relationship with my parents is

279
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
almost identical.

280
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh no.

281
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,240
Where they're like these two just like normies, you know, and then I'm like the rambunctious

282
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,320
crazy child who just fucks with them all day.

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
But it all, it all comes from a place of love in some way.

284
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,600
To bring this in a way I understand, is this similar to Johnny Test, you know, he's like

285
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
a rambunctious kid.

286
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I wouldn't compare Johnny Test to Bam Margera.

287
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,760
We need a really carbon copy of Johnny Test.

288
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Now I understand.

289
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Okay, okay.

290
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,640
Dude, if I had twin older sisters who were hot, I would have been incesting the fuck

291
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
out of that show.

292
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
And they are super hot.

293
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,200
And voiced my premier My Little Pony voice actor, Tara Strong.

294
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Does she do both of them?

295
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
No, she only did one.

296
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,480
I like the one with the curly hair, not the straight hair.

297
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
She's hot as fuck.

298
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,880
I can never tell them apart.

299
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
You are racist.

300
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Yeah.

301
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
That's white people.

302
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
That's twins.

303
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
So go on.

304
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
So what did you do?

305
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Did you torment them?

306
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,880
It's almost perfectly analogous because my mom, much like Bam's mom, April, is just

307
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,640
always confused and wondering where this torture is coming from and what she did to

308
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
deserve it.

309
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,280
Whereas my dad kind of like tries to go with the flow and laugh and have fun.

310
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,360
One example I can provide is because I've had my parents, both of them in a video at

311
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,680
some point way back in the day, I did a movie missions podcast with me, Manimal, and my

312
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:09,360
dad because the audience voted for us to watch a Serbian film, which is a movie about a man

313
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,520
who is drugged and fucks his son in the ass.

314
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Nice.

315
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Nice.

316
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Whoa.

317
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,000
Did he start the day thinking he was going to do that and kind of just end up in that

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
situation?

319
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So about a week before the end, I was like, you know what, dad, we're doing this movie

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,280
podcast and I want you to be on this episode and you'll see why once we watch the movie.

321
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,280
And he was like really nervous all week because he's probably like camera shy.

322
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,280
He doesn't want to like get on mic and talk because he knows that there's going to be

323
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,520
a few thousand people who watch it.

324
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,400
And like he knows all about my monkey shit and he's, I don't know if he's ashamed or

325
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,240
proud or what, but he's like it is what it is.

326
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
So he clearly didn't want any part in it.

327
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,400
But I guilt-tripped him kind of into like, oh, come on, come on the podcast, dad, it'll

328
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
be fun.

329
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You know, like we need a guest.

330
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
It'll be cool.

331
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,120
He's like, oh, fine.

332
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,040
So we watched a Serbian film, a movie that not only should you never watch with your

333
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,960
parents, but some might argue you should never watch ever, like in general.

334
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,880
My dad was, he was absolutely mortified.

335
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,760
I'd never seen him in the state of being before where he was.

336
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,880
He was just like, like he was possessed by some like demonic ghost and he was just like

337
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,520
an empty shell of a human being.

338
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,520
So if you want to hear that podcast, it's like an hour and 10 or 20 minutes long.

339
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:31,360
And my dad probably says three sentences the whole time because he just, he's so aghast

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
at the film that I forced him to watch.

341
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,280
The fact that he's there though and saying nothing, I think would really add an ambiance

342
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,320
to a video like that, knowing that a dad is there, silently observing this shit.

343
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,680
I'd like to see that.

344
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Yeah.

345
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
That's, you know, that's what our podcast needs.

346
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
We need a dad.

347
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,400
I would really spice things up.

348
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Oh my God.

349
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,560
You've been kidnapping them lately.

350
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
I know.

351
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
You got to spare some.

352
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,280
I do have a few that I could spare, but they're, they're a rare breed, dude.

353
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
They're a rare breed.

354
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,120
Dads are a rare breed.

355
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,280
They're like diamonds, you know, out there.

356
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,000
They're like 30% of the population.

357
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They're rare.

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
All right.

359
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
A good dad is rare.

360
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,920
We should, we should say non-rapist dads, you know, because most of them, you know.

361
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,680
Who's the best kinds?

362
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,240
So the one time my mom was in a video was during my recent Spyro series, my brother

363
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
Pachi was on.

364
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,640
And we thought, you know what'd it be funny if I called my mom on speakerphone and told

365
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,200
her that Pachi was saying bad words?

366
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,520
So naturally when my mom answers, she is absolutely wasted because she loves to just, Friday and

367
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,800
Saturday nights, it's rare that my mom doesn't have a drink.

368
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,080
So the only time my mom probably will ever be recorded in any of my videos is her fucking

369
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,280
plastered and she doesn't even know that it happened.

370
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
That poor woman.

371
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
That poor woman.

372
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,440
She's going to come at you with legal action one of these days.

373
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Watch out.

374
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
If she ever finds out.

375
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,400
The episode is called, Munk His Mom If You Want to Find It.

376
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Okay.

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Nice.

378
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I'm looking forward to it.

379
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Hippo.

380
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
What were you saying?

381
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I didn't say anything.

382
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
You said something you piece of shit.

383
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Okay.

384
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Never mind.

385
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Just like we always try to.

386
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Good job.

387
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Hashtag kickmate.

388
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,120
So even though I torture my parents constantly with this retarded bullshit of watching awful

389
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,760
movies and calling them when they're drunk and recording it, they still do whatever they

390
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,320
can I guess to support me.

391
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,640
I mean, just yesterday I moved from Iowa to North Carolina, which is a fucking 17 hour

392
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,880
drive and instead of me wasting like what, $3,000 on movers and shit, my dad's like,

393
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,440
no, I'll just fucking do it.

394
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,960
So we loaded up his truck and me and my mom and dad spent all of yesterday.

395
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,680
We left at 2 AM, got here at about like 8 PM and drove all the way down here and they

396
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,440
helped me move in just because I guess they love me and shit.

397
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
I don't know.

398
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
It's weird.

399
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,600
I wouldn't do that for somebody.

400
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,240
You know, that's cool.

401
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,600
And when I moved out to Cincinnati from Massachusetts, it was about like a 16 hour drive.

402
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,720
And my mom came with me and we did the same thing.

403
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
She helped me move in.

404
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,520
Not the place I'm in now, but like my old apartment and what a sweetheart.

405
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Yeah.

406
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
It's really nice.

407
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,720
I really like parents who do that shit.

408
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,360
And the weirdest part is at least Bam Margera is a millionaire and can give his parents

409
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
money, but I have fucking nothing.

410
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
So I'm just doing it for no reason.

411
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
You have something far more valuable.

412
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,520
Minor internet fame.

413
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,440
Hashtag kick monkey.

414
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Yeah.

415
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,400
So that's pretty much while administering that kick, you would accidentally kick me.

416
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
Yeah, not only are our names similar, but we look similar too.

417
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Yeah.

418
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
And that's pretty much all I.

419
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
You are the same guy.

420
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
That's, you know.

421
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Right.

422
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,960
That's all I really have to say about my parents unless you guys had more questions like we

423
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
did for Hippo.

424
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Yeah.

425
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,040
Oh, we already said what you fucking, are they ready killed as fuck?

426
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,560
Well, the first time I ever voted in a presidential election was this last one because it was

427
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,720
the first time I was old enough because the last Obama election, I was only 17.

428
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,240
But me and my dad went together and we both voted for Donald Trump.

429
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,440
So I guess you can say my dad is read as fuck.

430
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,880
I'm just curious, does that mean your mom didn't vote?

431
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,880
My mom, I think is no pilled because she knows literally nothing.

432
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,720
She didn't know which political party Michelle Obama would have been associated with.

433
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
That's how little she knows about the entire process.

434
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,360
So no, she did not vote.

435
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,880
Would you say that your mother is an object?

436
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
She is a woman.

437
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Right.

438
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Okay.

439
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
All right.

440
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Okay.

441
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I see.

442
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Good to know.

443
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Excellent.

444
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
All right.

445
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Well, we now have a thorough understanding of a monkey's parents political views.

446
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Excellent.

447
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
That's what I was hoping to get.

448
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,600
How about Tom?

449
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,320
I know you've got stuff to say about parents.

450
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Yeah.

451
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
How about a dog?

452
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
How about it?

453
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,200
I have, I mean, my parents, I love them.

454
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,880
They love, they would, they'd go to war for me.

455
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
But there's no need to lie here.

456
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
There's no need to lie.

457
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
No.

458
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,520
I mean, I have this, this like this confusing relationship, I suppose.

459
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,640
Because my dad, like it's interesting, they were talking about having like your parents

460
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
and videos.

461
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,120
I did a whole series of videos with my dad two years ago.

462
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Godzilla shit, right?

463
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Yeah, we did.

464
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,200
Because like, oh yeah, we grew up, I grew up watching Godzilla all the time and Ultraman

465
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,040
like all these fucking cheesy shit because my dad's like a nerd in denial because he's

466
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,920
a nerd, but he was also a fat kid in high school and got bullied, so he's like, fuck

467
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,320
this and he got super fucking ripped, turned into a ninja and kicks ass now.

468
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
So you're like, nice.

469
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
He pretends to be that, but on the inside he's still.

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
Does he run the ninja school that Hippo applied for?

471
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,280
Actually, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.

472
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,880
He like, he told me one time that like in college, he had like these like ninja things

473
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,040
so like climb walls just climbed on the top of his dorm just because he could, like just

474
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,600
for shits and giggles and like trained with the black dragons and like could kill people

475
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
with his bare hands and shit.

476
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Wait, what?

477
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
What's the black dragon?

478
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Black people?

479
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Yeah.

480
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
I mean, it's the most hardcore thing you can do.

481
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Man, he got away with his life.

482
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,120
He met black people and lived.

483
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Fucking crazy.

484
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Wow.

485
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,240
No, but like my dad, like if you want to talk about someone who's red pill, my dad is

486
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,360
like the stereotypical, like red pill conservative.

487
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Like he's an outdoorsman.

488
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
He has guns.

489
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
He has fucking crossbows.

490
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Just super.

491
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Crossbows.

492
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
So red-pilled.

493
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:39,800
No, like the outdoorsman kind of archetypal kind of, kind of like, you know, wants to

494
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
drive.

495
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Usually drives a pickup truck.

496
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Doesn't have one right now.

497
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,320
But like that kind of guy, but he's also a fucking dork at the same time and to talk

498
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,040
about Godzilla for like three hours or something.

499
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,800
So my relationship with my dad's pretty good.

500
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,680
Pretty cool.

501
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
He's also an author.

502
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,400
He's written like five books now, I think, and he's published.

503
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,840
He has like an actual publisher and shit.

504
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Like small time.

505
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
But very...

506
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
That's awesome.

507
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
And then like, I don't know how he does it.

508
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Like I feel...

509
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,040
My dad makes me feel like a retard because like I'm sitting here trying to do stuff and

510
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,520
I have like my whole schedule open and he like works 60 hours a week and wrote like

511
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,160
five books in his spare time.

512
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,280
It was like, huh, where...

513
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,400
I did not inherit that work that sucks.

514
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
Teach me your ways and that kind of shit.

515
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,040
Like, fuck it.

516
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:33,760
But the downside is that because he's so like conservative, he can't like nobody in the

517
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,240
house really understands what I'm doing and they're all just like, but you can't move

518
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
out.

519
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
So clearly you're not...

520
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
This isn't good.

521
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Like this isn't working.

522
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,480
You need to get like a real job and be a real boy and stop doing this.

523
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,880
And my mom is way more aggressive about that because my dad has like a creative outlet.

524
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
Like he writes and stuff.

525
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,240
So he understands kind of like, even though like what I'm doing doesn't make enough money.

526
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,280
He understands why I'm doing it because he actually has passions and he's like, he wants

527
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,720
his books to succeed and if he could, he would just sit, you know, and write all day.

528
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,200
My mom doesn't have that.

529
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,600
She doesn't have that...

530
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,200
We had an argument today about me doing creative stuff and she just like, it's like, well,

531
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,560
right, you're fucking miserable in a failure right now.

532
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,720
So you might as well be miserable in a failure at a real job and actually get money.

533
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
What are you getting out of this?

534
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,600
And just like, yeah, you know, doing something I like has no value.

535
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Right?

536
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
It was, it was dumb.

537
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,360
That's fascinating.

538
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,200
That's really a fascinating perspective on life.

539
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:41,680
Well, if you want to understand my mom and how it works is that the reason I started my

540
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,320
Patreon and started like monetizing my content in the first place because I got fired from

541
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,320
my job that I had after college because I was working full time at Whole Foods doing graphic

542
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
design stuff for them.

543
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Rolling in red bank bro.

544
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Very blue pill.

545
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Working at Whole Foods.

546
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
The very blue pill.

547
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
The bluest of blue pill.

548
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,240
I did not fit in there at all.

549
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,400
But I got fired from that job because I was too red pill and I'd like to think that.

550
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,840
But I started doing Patreon and my mom in particular was freaking out because I have

551
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,680
student loans to pay because I made the foolish mistake of going to college.

552
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,920
She's like, it's been like three months, you haven't looked for a job.

553
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
How are you, you're going to run out of money.

554
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,640
How are you paying for these things?

555
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,920
I just find I said, oh, I have this Patreon thing and I got money and like people like

556
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I'm succeeding.

557
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,560
I'm like, I'm following my dreams and it's working and I have money and people care about

558
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
it.

559
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Like this is amazing.

560
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,080
Well, now you can pay us rent and took like half of the money, the entirety that like

561
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,240
I was successful and never asked for, never asked for rent before or since, but the one

562
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,240
time I was successful, she needed to siphon half of my money.

563
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,360
And when I asked about it, it was because, oh, you weren't working towards anything.

564
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,240
So we decided to charge you rent.

565
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,880
If you were actually, if you had a real job and we had some sort of plan, we would stop

566
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
charging you rent.

567
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,440
That's why we haven't charged your sister rent.

568
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,920
You know, I sort of understand that logic, but it just shows a fundamental misunderstanding

569
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
of what you're trying to do is really what's going on there.

570
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,760
The whole thing that I didn't, I didn't like it's because like their excuse was that, is

571
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,880
that we gave you a year rent free and then started charging you rent.

572
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,120
And I'm like, the timeline kind of worked on that because I, because I was like, why

573
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
aren't you charging my sister for rent?

574
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
Cause she just graduated college at this time, like two, three years ago.

575
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,200
And they're like, well, she's going to get a year rent free and then she has to pay too.

576
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Never happened.

577
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
So I'm, I'm completely.

578
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Yeah.

579
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Well, that's just not, that's fucking, that's deceit.

580
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,880
So, so I'm just, I'm just convinced that it was, um, trying to.

581
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Psychological warfare.

582
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Yeah, exactly.

583
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Well, yeah.

584
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
There's, there's no, there's no.

585
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,400
They're trying to pressure you into like one of these, yeah, another path that that seems

586
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
clear to me.

587
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,800
So I mean, my mom, my mom's really, she's, she's like done like a personality 180.

588
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,960
She used to be super religious, maybe go to church till all the 16, CCD, all that shit,

589
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
hardcore.

590
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,920
Like, uh, I was, I, all my friends got into magic gathering and I've saved up my allowance

591
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,680
to buy a bunch of cards and then she's like, actually, these are the devil and took them

592
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
from me and burned them.

593
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Oh boy.

594
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Burned them.

595
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Yeah.

596
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
And then.

597
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Whoa.

598
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
And then got rid of.

599
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Red pill.

600
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
That is pretty red pill.

601
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
That's true.

602
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
That's true.

603
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Got rid of my Harry Potter books.

604
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
I still haven't read the rest of them.

605
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Um, so I don't know.

606
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
You're not.

607
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
You still haven't read the rest.

608
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Oh no.

609
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
It's a long lasting impact.

610
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,240
I don't, I don't know anything about that shit.

611
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,580
So that, and, but now she's like turned into this like a party animal and just goes drinking

612
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,080
like all the time.

613
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Jesus drank.

614
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,500
Jesus was into that shit.

615
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
That's consistent.

616
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
So I don't, I don't really know.

617
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,760
I don't really understand her.

618
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,240
We have like a working like, like relationship, but that's about it.

619
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Yeah.

620
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,680
Uh, we don't see eye to eye at all.

621
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,120
And she stole like a lot of money from me for no reason and, uh, I don't take kindly

622
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,920
to that.

623
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,440
Is this like a separate thing or is the same issue?

624
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,880
No, it's, it's, I mean, we, we have a problem.

625
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,840
I mean, if she just walked into your room, beat you up and took two grand, like that's

626
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,080
a separate offense to, you know.

627
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,040
Like Tom ever had two grand.

628
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Yeah.

629
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
That's funny.

630
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Yeah.

631
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
You think I have money?

632
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
No.

633
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,400
Um, it would just be like she'll ask for money and then won't pay it back.

634
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,120
And when I asked for it back, she'll deny that it never happened.

635
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,800
So she, I am sensing that there's some mental gymnastics going on in this person that is

636
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,400
justifying some things that are being done that may not as strictly adhere to the laws

637
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
of logic.

638
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,800
Um, well, she's also the person who, uh, disconnects the wifi every night because she's

639
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,300
convinced that she can't sleep with it on, even though we're in range of seven other

640
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,160
wifi networks besides the one in our house.

641
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
What the fuck?

642
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,560
Hey, you know, can I comment on that real quick?

643
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,200
There is a real illness called something I forget.

644
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,560
It's where people think that electrical, uh, like for us all season one and two.

645
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Oh, that, that's right.

646
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Is that thing people?

647
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Yeah.

648
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
That's exactly who the thing I'm thinking of.

649
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,680
Maybe it's true that if she thinks it's on, it will cause her pain because she thinks

650
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,800
it's that way.

651
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Maybe she's got that thing.

652
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't know.

653
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Maybe.

654
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
I don't know.

655
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Because I, I mean, I use my phone as a wifi network all the time when the wifi's off.

656
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,080
So there's a wifi network right there anyway.

657
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Yeah, right.

658
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Right.

659
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
And nobody cares.

660
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
So I don't,

661
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,240
How has nobody in your family tested her and said, okay, we're going to put the wifi

662
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
in the other room.

663
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,720
You tell us if it's on and then see what happens.

664
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
You don't have to raise these things.

665
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,360
The thing, the thing with my mom is that you can't fight with her.

666
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,280
You can't, you can't do it.

667
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,760
She, you, you try and have a discussion and it instantly falls apart and then you turn

668
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,880
into a horrible person and it's, that's the thing with parents, man, and this is like

669
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
the big thing.

670
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
They're, they're the authority.

671
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,520
If you, I mean, especially if you live with them and you financially depend on them, what

672
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
are you going to do?

673
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
They, they, they hold all the cards.

674
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,440
They can just fucking kick you out.

675
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
If you go against them too hard.

676
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,360
Get a dad who isn't a pussy and beat her ass.

677
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Get a dad.

678
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Yeah.

679
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Go out.

680
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Go, go talk to Munchy.

681
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
He's got plenty of dads that you can swap out.

682
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Okay.

683
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Can I borrow a dad?

684
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,440
I, it's like puts like a, like a, like a note across the table, Tom.

685
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,520
It may interest you to know, Tom, that killing women is actually good for your Christ consciousness.

686
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Whoa.

687
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,920
It's not actually, it doesn't actually negatively impact your Christ consciousness.

688
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,080
In fact, it makes it go up.

689
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
This, this changes everything.

690
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,240
I think that before the Muhammad consciousness, not Christ.

691
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Yeah.

692
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Well, no, that's true.

693
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,480
Mumpgee, you dog fuck, as I explained before, Christ consciousness has nothing to do with

694
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Jesus Christ.

695
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,480
It has everything to do with crystals, the Christal light.

696
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
That's right.

697
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
The Christal lights.

698
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
My Christals.

699
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Oh man.

700
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,200
This is some hardcore lore.

701
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
This is good to know.

702
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Yeah.

703
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
This lore is too retarded for my brain.

704
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
My J.O. Christals.

705
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,200
All I'm saying, Tom, is to kill you all.

706
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
J.O. Christals.

707
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Okay.

708
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Wow.

709
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
You know.

710
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Oh yeah.

711
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
It's killing your mom because she's a bitch.

712
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
All you need is more money.

713
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,360
What Tom needs is more money.

714
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Yeah.

715
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
He needs more money.

716
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
He needs all of these problems here.

717
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,320
It only had some sort of a platform for you to donate money to him.

718
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Oh wait.

719
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,040
Take it away, Tom.

720
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,000
I've actually, I've changed my old Patreon to patreon.com slash save me.

721
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
That's the actual URL.

722
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Really?

723
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Really?

724
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Whoa.

725
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's awesome.

726
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,280
I can't believe that wasn't taken.

727
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,960
I was surprised too.

728
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,400
I guess no one is begging on Patreon as hard as I wanted to start doing.

729
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,840
Patreon.com slash save me for Tommy Oliver.

730
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Please.

731
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Please go.

732
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Press one for death.

733
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,160
We need one of those like this animal fucking died because no one gave you shit.

734
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,080
But then, the armistice allowed him Oliver.

735
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,640
And that guy is in way worse shape right now.

736
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:46,160
In the arms of an angel, how would I get through one night without you if I believe in you?

737
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Don't stop believing.

738
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Oh, oh, oh, monkey.

739
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm gonna start singing and then you get that ready.

740
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
You get that ready.

741
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
You get that ready.

742
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
Okay.

743
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm getting it ready.

744
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I'm getting it ready.

745
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
I know what you mean.

746
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,200
How could I go through one night without you if I had to live without you?

747
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,520
What kind of life would that, there it goes.

748
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,520
I wonder if people could tell what that was when I tried to quit.

749
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
We are familiar.

750
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I bet it's famous.

751
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
It's world famous.

752
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,680
Okay, Tom, any further points you'd like to add?

753
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,160
No, I think that's pretty much it.

754
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,040
But I, fuck it, patreon.com slash save me.

755
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Yeah.

756
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I love that.

757
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
I love that.

758
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
God, who's that?

759
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Munchy.

760
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Munchy, what's up?

761
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,800
Tell us about your hot Mexican mom who isn't Mexican.

762
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah, it's upsetting, upsetting to say the least.

763
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,600
My mother is the only parent that I will discuss currently.

764
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,280
And she's a nice person.

765
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
But I'm your dad.

766
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Well, I know.

767
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,320
Ergo, why would I need to talk about Munchy?

768
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
You all know him.

769
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
He makes the same five jokes over and over again.

770
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,520
He doesn't have any worthwhile content.

771
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,680
You all know him already.

772
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,120
Munchy, we should do a grandparents episode where you just talk about my parents.

773
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Yeah, we should.

774
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,840
That's a good idea.

775
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,480
Your dad, pretty good, gonna be stolen soon though.

776
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
No.

777
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
My mom don't know.

778
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,440
No, I needed him.

779
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
He's mine now.

780
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll hold some ransom.

781
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,640
If you can get me five doubloons, I'll give you back your dad.

782
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,320
How many Christ conscious crystals is that?

783
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,200
It's like about like 50 or so comprised of 10 different doubloons.

784
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
I've only got like zero.

785
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Yeah, because you're a fucking fag.

786
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,240
Okay, so go on.

787
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
What about your folks?

788
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,400
No, I think we gotta keep this shitty meme train going for another five minutes.

789
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,760
I can't take any more, all right.

790
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,240
Tell me about your mom.

791
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,640
My mom is a nice person.

792
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,040
She's always been a pretty fucking soft bitch.

793
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,560
She's not hitting the gridiron every day on the b-ball court.

794
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,400
Okay, that's all right.

795
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,520
But she's a really nice person and she doesn't hate me.

796
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,040
There are ergo.

797
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
She's okay.

798
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
One of the few.

799
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,200
If she were to stand in my way, she would be evaporated.

800
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:26,200
However, she's minding her own business and therefore she shall live to see another day.

801
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Reasonable.

802
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:35,240
I think the big question, Monchi, the question on everybody's mind is what sort of parents

803
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,440
slash parents would allow their 15 slash 16 year old son to fly out to something called

804
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,120
a radcon full of a bunch of former bronies in their mid 20s who are probably gonna molest

805
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
their son.

806
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,840
I mean, you're right about that.

807
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,640
But even like two years, I think before that, he was allowed to fly, or maybe even three,

808
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,480
I can't remember, when he was like 13, he was flying out to bronicon across the entire

809
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,080
country just to fucking goof around with a bunch of pedophiles.

810
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,120
How did you convince your mom to let you do that?

811
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Two words, punitive damages.

812
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,120
Can you go into more detail on that?

813
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,120
What more punitive you need, he just spelled it out for you.

814
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,720
All right, I'm done.

815
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,120
What's a punitive damage?

816
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,000
You know, he was offended or there was a civil trial and he won and his mom had to give him

817
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
billions of dollars to fly to bronicon.

818
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, exactly.

819
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What was the trial from?

820
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, there's a lot of cereal.

821
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You ate too much cereal.

822
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh, I thought you ate too much cereal and you sued your mother.

823
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
No, no, no.

824
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, correct.

825
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Okay, good.

826
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That's the one.

827
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I know that one.

828
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I know that song.

829
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I know it.

830
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's real.

831
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I was opposed to a fake song.

832
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's real.

833
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I know it.

834
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You made my four local come out of my mouth when you said that.

835
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You only knew underpants because now they're soaked in four loco.

836
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
My undertails are soaked in piss.

837
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, no.

838
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay, fucking my mom.

839
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The reason why all that was allowed to transpire was because I just explained myself properly

840
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and she was like, yeah, I've trained you to be self descent from when you were like three.

841
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Right.

842
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But not how to pronounce things.

843
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, but unfortunately, you inherited retard talks.

844
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Maybe if she had been born in this country and hadn't hopped the wall

845
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to infiltrate this America.

846
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Maybe you'd be able to speak properly.

847
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
She's one of the rare Mexican immigrants who was white and jumped over the wall.

848
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's right.

849
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

850
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
He was raised in Mexico City.

851
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
He didn't illegally immigrate.

852
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That's what you think.

853
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
All immigration is illegal, Mumky, especially in Mexico.

854
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
What does CK mean in Spanish?

855
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Cock.

856
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know.

857
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, there you go.

858
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That means yes, cock.

859
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So, you know, one thing I was curious about.

860
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So just specifically, I was curious about the finances of your trips, Mumky.

861
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Munchy.

862
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
God, fucking dammit.

863
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm sorry.

864
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So, I know that you do a lot of entrepreneurial type of work,

865
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
mowing lawns and shit.

866
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes.

867
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Have you had all along your trips been self-financed?

868
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
No.

869
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Like, okay.

870
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I've been to three bronycons, I think.

871
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, that sounds right.

872
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And the first bronycon was completely,

873
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
the pizza's here!

874
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The pizza's here!

875
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The pizza's here!

876
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You guys, I can finish the story as Munchy since we're the same person,

877
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if that's okay.

878
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah, please do.

879
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So, my mum, I went up to her when I was 12,

880
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and I said, hey, mum, I want to go with the bronycon.

881
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And she said, well,

882
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
what level is your Christ consciousness, son?

883
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And I said,

884
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
There's the dog delivery man.

885
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm really excited.

886
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
They live in the Rick and Morty episode where dogs become sentient,

887
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and they're like walking around with their robotic legs,

888
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and they deliver pizzas and shit.

889
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And yet they're still serving humans by delivering pizza.

890
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, they know, they gotta make a living like everybody else.

891
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, this is an alternate universe where they became friends.

892
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's not like a universe that would spawn something like Munchy.

893
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Are you sure this isn't just Mexico, and that's where Munchy actually lives?

894
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
In Mexico, it's like the Amazon drone program where drones deliver your packages,

895
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
instead they tie it to a dog and just make it dirty.

896
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What do you think about it?

897
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He's in California, that's basically becoming Mexico right now.

898
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That's right, it's been absorbed.

899
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm pretty sure Trump's signing the legislation as we speak for it to be absorbed.

900
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
No, he would sign to stop that.

901
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
He wouldn't make it happen.

902
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
No, there's too many Mexicans there already.

903
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's a lost cause, it's gone.

904
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He's gonna put a wall around California.

905
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
California, that's right.

906
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I guess they didn't vote for him.

907
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Possibly the whole West, yeah.

908
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
California is way too liberal though.

909
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We should put up a wall.

910
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It is.

911
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You guys want us to see from the union?

912
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Fine, wall.

913
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You should put a wall between every state border.

914
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That'd be, yeah, I mean.

915
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And then through, and then a wall all the way around the ocean of the U.S.

916
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and then the border to Canada as well and then just put a roof on it.

917
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know what we really need to do?

918
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We need to put a wall around the actual barrier that matters,

919
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
around the entire earth to keep those real illegal aliens out of our country

920
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
because those guys, I don't want them anywhere near my earth.

921
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
We need to block out the sun like they did in The Matrix,

922
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
put a giant cement wall around the entire earth.

923
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Do you remember when the aliens illegally immigrated to Roswell, New Mexico?

924
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Fuck those guys.

925
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That was bullshit.

926
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That was bullshit.

927
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
They're still under arrest.

928
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They're stealing our fucking jobs.

929
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
They never left.

930
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
They never left.

931
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
They dropped anchor babies and now they're hanging out.

932
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They're getting subsidized by the government in a secret lab that we can't go to.

933
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Hey guys, this is me, Munchy.

934
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Hey, Mumpeat, what's going on?

935
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Okay, okay.

936
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Munchy, important question before we get started.

937
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Pan pizza or stuffed crust?

938
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Stuffed crust, baby.

939
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Fuck yeah, dude.

940
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Press one for stuffed crust.

941
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No, there's too many ones in the comments.

942
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Make it stop.

943
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
There's so many.

944
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You can't make it stop, Mumpeat.

945
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If you look at it in a different way, there's just a bunch of 11s instead.

946
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
In fact, nine sets of 11s.

947
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Press 11 for Munchy.

948
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
At least nine sets of 11.

949
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
11 is a very racist term against the Japanese people in Code Geass.

950
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But anyway, Munchy...

951
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What were you asking me?

952
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The finances or something?

953
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Fuck, yeah.

954
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
How did you pay for your trips?

955
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's what I was curious about.

956
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Oh, okay.

957
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The first running counter was completely her.

958
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And then like, I think it was like, for the second trip it was like the hotel and her

959
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
ticket was on her and I just had to pay for like 75% of my ticket.

960
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And then for the third one, just the hotel was her and I paid for both tickets.

961
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
She had to attend as well for the Bronycons because she was like, you know, kind of fucking

962
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
weird.

963
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But then for Radcon and future installments of the shit, I just paid for myself.

964
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Wait a minute.

965
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Wait a minute.

966
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You're saying that your mom was at Bronycon?

967
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes.

968
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What the fuck?

969
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Did she stay in the hotel?

970
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Well, she didn't attend Bronycon.

972
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
She was just at the hotel.

973
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Did she get Tara Strong's signature?

974
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

975
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It's funny you mentioned that actually.

976
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,000
One poster is directed directly towards my mom because she stood in line for me at Bronycon

977
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
2012.

978
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh, that's pretty nice.

979
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
She stood in line for me to get a poster because I wanted to do something else.

980
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And the voice actor assigned it to her and said, my mom was awesome.

981
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And then she was like, hey, I was like, yeah, you know what, my mom is awesome.

982
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Which voice actor was this?

983
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It was some fucking bitch.

984
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Was it Andrea Libman?

985
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
No, it was Andrea Hussie.

986
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
No, no, it was the one that Digi almost killed.

987
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh, that's Jeff.

988
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Nicole Oliver.

989
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Hey, that's cool.

990
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But it was his birthday, bitch.

991
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's my birthday, bitch.

992
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Did Digi just walk in the room?

993
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Dude, you need to watch this video that GiveMate of this event that happened, Momkey, if you

994
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
haven't seen it.

995
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, I've seen it.

996
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It is legendary.

997
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, OK.

998
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You better fucking believe us.

999
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I watched all the Bronycon episodes.

1000
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Good man.

1001
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
They're all good.

1002
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
They're all good.

1003
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That wouldn't say that.

1004
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
How else would he have gotten the elusive content of me looking at the camera intensely

1005
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
for his Procrastinators episode?

1006
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's true.

1008
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
That's true.

1009
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And I saw the footage of all you fuckers up on a stage yelling cuss words at a crowd full

1010
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
of children.

1011
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I was like, why did you do this?

1012
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That was mostly Digi who yelled the sways.

1013
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He was drunk as fuck.

1014
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Why?

1015
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Because he was drunk.

1016
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Dude, imagine.

1017
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Dude, imagine.

1018
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's Bronycon.

1019
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
There's tons of kids there.

1020
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And all these fucking assholes in there, like early 20s, jumping on stage yelling fuck

1021
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
at the kids.

1022
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Kids there.

1023
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's Digibro's fucking birthday, Bronycon's birthday.

1024
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yep.

1025
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It was pretty fabulous.

1026
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
We need to have a fucking Bronycon.

1027
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I love that place.

1028
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
We need to have our own Bronycon.

1029
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We need to have our own Bronycon.

1030
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I was curious about one thing, Munchy.

1031
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And specifically, I'm curious about your relationship with your mom.

1032
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So your mom paid for your trip the first time.

1033
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm curious.

1034
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Because I feel like a lot of kids-

1035
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Brony curious.

1036
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
When they're-

1037
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I don't know how to say that.

1038
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You weren't there.

1039
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh, no.

1040
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That's our word.

1041
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's our word.

1042
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
He's been saying, but forget it.

1043
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No.

1044
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So, like, your mom was kind of like expecting you to pay more of your way as you got older.

1045
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Did you have any resistance to that?

1046
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Were you an entitled little shit?

1047
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And we were like, no, mom, you paid for everything for the rest of my life.

1048
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I literally want to shit in my pants and have you change it my entire life, mom.

1049
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Well, did Jess just walk in the room?

1050
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Of course I wanted to shit my pants and piss on my walls.

1051
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But that's unrelated to the money.

1052
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I just wanted to do that with my own accord.

1053
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And she agreed.

1054
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Okay.

1055
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I offered to pay more money.

1056
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That's, you know, I expected something like that.

1057
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You are an unusually mature guy when it comes to a personal responsibility, Munchie.

1058
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And that is to be commended, I think.

1059
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Thank you, bitch.

1060
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Piss on my walls.

1061
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So other than pissing on your walls, are there any other parents-related stories you want to tell?

1062
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Well, the thing that there's not like a lot of stories, because while me and my mother are like close in the sense that we like like each other,

1063
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:02,000
like she has out from the set, like out from the fucking do is to try to do, make me be like my own guy.

1064
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And so she's always trying to make me like self-suspicion.

1065
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So we don't really like, we used to do like stuff together, but we don't like do anything together anymore.

1066
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I know what you mean.

1067
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Which is fine.

1068
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah, so there's not really a lot of stories.

1069
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, besides the one time where we almost were stuck over the border in Mexico.

1070
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh, right.

1071
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, why don't you tell that real quick?

1072
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That's a fascinating story.

1073
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I am of mud-blood descent as stated earlier.

1074
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm very low on the fucking hemospectrum.

1075
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And my mother was like, you know, Tijuana's fucking sick, bro.

1076
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And I was like, fuck yeah, bro.

1077
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And you know, like you want to go to Tijuana?

1078
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I was like, fuck yeah, bro.

1079
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And then she was like, sick, bro.

1080
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I like your mom's vocabulary.

1081
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Where do you think Munchie got it off?

1082
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So we went to Tijuana and then we're like, all right, it's pretty fucking bad actually.

1083
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Let's go home.

1084
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And then-

1085
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The end.

1086
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Because you went there for the whores in the gambling.

1087
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That's the problem.

1088
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Exactly.

1089
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The whores and I did pet-hit.

1090
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But other than that, it was a total failure.

1091
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
No, no, no.

1092
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Not a horse.

1093
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
A whore's the whore.

1094
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Nate, he knows what you fucking said.

1095
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah.

1096
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Okay, good.

1097
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Wow, Nate.

1098
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Thanks.

1099
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's almost like you're bin-sane, LOL.

1100
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Please take that back.

1101
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's a terrible traffic burn.

1102
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Anyway, when we were about to leave, my mom was like, oh yeah, I didn't bring your passport,

1103
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
by the way.

1104
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I was like.

1105
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, no.

1106
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Thanks, mom.

1107
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I always want to live here forever and never go home.

1108
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, right, okay.

1109
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's a secret way to try and get rid of you.

1110
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
By the way, I don't know if this is this for all of the border, but that particular day,

1111
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
there was this weird dystopian line to get to the US.

1112
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It was a fucking photo of a Russian bread line.

1113
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I see.

1114
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It was just a singular gate to get into the US.

1115
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We had to wait in this line for two hours, and then my mom had to just reason with the

1116
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
guard.

1117
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
He looks like I just picked him up from over here, but he's on the other side.

1118
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Please don't kill me, Mr. Donald Trump.

1119
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm clairvoyant.

1120
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I can see in the future.

1121
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Well, Trump was working borders.

1122
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah, man.

1123
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He knew his future would involve it heavily.

1124
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, he knows his stuff.

1125
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
He knows exactly how it works.

1126
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So what, did you get arrested or what?

1127
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No, he was just like, hmm, what age are you?

1128
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And I was like, oh, I don't know.

1129
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And then it was like, where do you go to school?

1130
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't know.

1131
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And then it was like, yeah, sounds legit.

1132
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah.

1133
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

1134
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That sounds good.

1135
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And then he was like, all right, fucking leave my side, bitch.

1136
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
He walked over to this side and all was happily ever the after.

1137
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Now, real quick munch.

1138
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's not that well known, but there is a fan wiki about the PCP.

1139
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And there's an entry about your mother, Munchie.

1140
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
If you don't mind me reading it.

1141
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh, wait.

1142
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
OK.

1143
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah, I'm going to read it right now.

1144
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It says, Munchie's mom was the founder and former leader of the Crystal Gems,

1145
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
enthralled by the beauty of Earth.

1146
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Munchie's mom led her friends and allies in a rebellion against the gem homeworld

1147
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
around 5,500 years before the events of the series,

1148
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
successfully driving the invading homeworld gems off the planet

1149
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and saving the life forms inhabiting it.

1150
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Beautiful stuff.

1151
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah.

1152
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I mean, she did do that.

1153
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
She is a fat whale.

1154
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So, you know, it matches up.

1155
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They forgot to add that she is a gigantic slut

1156
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
who will fuck any fucking shit with a car wash, you know, anyone.

1157
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Like, yeah, big slut, big slut.

1158
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah, that's all true.

1159
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And she's dead now.

1160
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
LOL, get fucked.

1161
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, got him, got him.

1162
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Except for, like, in these weird inside your lion memories shit.

1163
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I only saw that episode once.

1164
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I don't know what's going on.

1165
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I didn't know you even fucking watched that show.

1166
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I've seen, like, the first 30 episodes, and then maybe I'll watch the rest someday.

1167
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's pretty good.

1168
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's pretty good.

1169
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yeah, I like it.

1170
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Munchie's life, the show that is.

1171
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I like Munchie's life, the show.

1172
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, that fucking reminds me.

1173
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I almost forgot I hate Nate.

1174
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Here's why.

1175
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah, OK.

1176
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
On the Steven Universe episode, you were going to have me.

1177
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
You were going to wake up later than when you messaged me.

1178
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Wasn't that, like, episode two?

1179
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah.

1180
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It was way early, yeah.

1181
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And I didn't get to be on, and I forever haunted your nightmares.

1182
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Oh, I remember that.

1183
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I remember that, because you were fucking late.

1184
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I can't wait all day for your latest videos.

1185
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You told me that day, Nate!

1186
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I didn't know you were supposed to be early.

1187
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Maybe we'll do a follow-up one day.

1188
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Maybe, I don't know.

1189
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You want to be a Steven Universe?

1190
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, like, episode two is Steven Universe, the PCP.

1191
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, my God.

1192
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's when we all drew Crystal Gems for ourselves and put in the intro that I animated so beautifully.

1193
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
No.

1194
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It just, yeah, that's Steven Universe.

1195
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
See, Jesse and Digi did it like a gem cast.

1196
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Oh, you guys did one, too.

1197
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You guys did one, too.

1198
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
That was a separate one.

1199
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
On the horse thing.

1200
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, there you go.

1201
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Anyway, yeah, a fucking sick story.

1202
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, I think that's all I have to say.

1203
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
She's a nice person.

1204
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Get the fuck out of my old sight, woman.

1205
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
How's that pizza, Munchie?

1206
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Let me get my pizza.

1207
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Hold on.

1208
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I didn't want to eat, because I didn't want to ruin the world.

1209
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Ah, it's going to go cold.

1210
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Fuck this podcast.

1211
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Here, here.

1212
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Hey, guys, welcome to Stealing Your Dad.

1213
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's definitely as easy.

1214
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm going to take this, Mr. Bit, and upload it on my channel.

1215
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Is that Pizza Hut?

1216
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Is that Pizza Hut?

1217
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You got there?

1218
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'm going to do a...

1219
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Here.

1220
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Wait, wait, Munchie.

1221
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You can't do that.

1222
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
You can't do that.

1223
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What kind of toppings do you get on your pizza, Munchie?

1224
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
What...

1225
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Is that...

1226
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Just tell me if that's Pizza Hut.

1227
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That is Pizza Hut, right?

1228
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I need to know.

1229
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Okay, okay.

1230
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Munchie, what kind of pizza did you get?

1231
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Meatlovers.

1232
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1233
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You would.

1234
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You literal gay lemal.

1235
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Now, Nate, before we go to your parents, I have a confusing question.

1236
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It doesn't really make sense to me.

1237
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's like a paradox because somehow your parents raised you and you're arguably one of the

1238
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
best guys ever.

1239
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Some might even say the best guy ever.

1240
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That's true.

1241
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But at the same time, your parents raised Ben St. Arguably the worst guy ever.

1242
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Most would argue the actual worst guy ever.

1243
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So how did this happen?

1244
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Where did your parents fuck up in the timeline?

1245
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,840
Well, you know, it's a freak thing.

1246
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,840
It's kind of like, you know, leukemia can kind of crop up just genetically.

1247
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,840
You put two different people together.

1248
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
One of their kids, you know, is perfectly healthy.

1249
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,840
The other's got a crippling illness like Ben does just personality-wise.

1250
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
Retardation?

1251
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,840
Yeah, yeah.

1252
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:58,840
I thought it was that like Nate like siphoned off all of the goodness, all of the good vibes

1253
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,840
from Ben's corpse is living corpse.

1254
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
That is true.

1255
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
And now you're the better guy than him.

1256
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:11,840
Ben's like a Dark Souls player that I ganked in the womb and absorb his humanity.

1257
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,840
And now he's a hollow shell of a man.

1258
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
That's why you won the race.

1259
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:21,840
It's no coincidence that Nate is a Holocaust survivor and Nate is Hitler.

1260
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
That's right.

1261
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
It's no coincidence.

1262
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Also, Hitler, the most famous Holocaust survivor.

1263
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,840
That's been a great job.

1264
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:36,840
There are too many things wrong with that statement.

1265
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
I know.

1266
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,840
I don't even want to unpack it because it's so brilliantly stupid.

1267
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Yeah, let the viewers do it at home.

1268
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Well, I don't know, man.

1269
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,840
Nate, by the way, real quick, what did you just like say that again?

1270
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Because something popped up in my memory and I was going to say it really quickly,

1271
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,840
but I also can't remember what you just said.

1272
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,840
You said it all really fast.

1273
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Like a Holocaust survivor, Hitler?

1274
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,840
No, no, no, back about your parents.

1275
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1276
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,840
All of my family has cancer.

1277
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
I'm probably going to have cancer by the time I die.

1278
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
Is that true?

1279
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Yeah, that's true.

1280
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,840
This is like in a movie, like a detective movie where the character says,

1281
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,840
no, say that again and then it refreshes his memory and he solves the mystery

1282
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,840
from some innocuous bullshit that the other guy said.

1283
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,840
That's true.

1284
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,840
I didn't think it would ever happen in real life.

1285
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
The killer is Jane.

1286
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,840
It's like, I'm going to die.

1287
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
Which arguably a better ending.

1288
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
There you go.

1289
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,840
Oh, you've been saying, oh, you.

1290
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Oh, no, best of luck with that much.

1291
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Anyway, so I don't have that much to say about my parents.

1292
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
I don't know.

1293
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Enough.

1294
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Pretty normal.

1295
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Yeah.

1296
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,840
My dad is a psychologist.

1297
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
He's a smart boy.

1298
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,840
He's a psycho.

1299
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,840
Yeah, he's a psycho.

1300
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,840
My mom's a special ed teacher and they met like working at a place.

1301
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
She has special ed.

1302
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
Well, no.

1303
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,840
I imagine she spent a lot of time with Ben.

1304
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,840
You might say they were the perfect parents to try to raise a perfect son,

1305
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,840
which succeeded one time, did not work out so well the other time.

1306
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Ben's the older brother.

1307
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,840
So it's like he was the test run and then all the stuff they learned from him,

1308
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,840
they used on you to make you a good son.

1309
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,840
Ben's like the proto man and I'm like the mega man who's better in every way.

1310
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:23,840
The proto man won at the end of the Sons of Death or the Sons of Fate.

1311
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,840
He won the battle, but not the war of autism, which he has.

1312
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
We'll see it back three if it comes out.

1313
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
That's true.

1314
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Isn't like a mega man a fucking faggot?

1315
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,840
Isn't that good?

1316
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
Yeah, I can confirm.

1317
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,840
That's true.

1318
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
That's true.

1319
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
All right, continue.

1320
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,840
If anyone interrupts again, I'll kill them.

1321
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,840
Oh, shit.

1322
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
Good.

1323
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,840
I was just going to say.

1324
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Enough.

1325
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Did not see that coming.

1326
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
God damn it.

1327
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
Yeah, I don't know.

1328
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,840
They met like doing like working with special ed kids, but in any case.

1329
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,840
How did they, how did they work with Ben before they met?

1330
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Before that's one of the great questions of our time.

1331
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,840
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

1332
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,840
Ben's a retarded time traveler.

1333
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
I'm sorry, I'll stop.

1334
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,840
I just fucking hate Ben so much.

1335
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,840
I understand.

1336
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,840
That is totally relatable to my parents.

1337
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,840
They would sympathize very much so with that.

1338
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Yeah, I don't know.

1339
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,840
I don't have a lot to say.

1340
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
They're pretty great.

1341
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,840
They're pretty great to me.

1342
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,840
They've given me pretty much anything I wanted in life.

1343
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,840
They never did anything particularly bad to me.

1344
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
I don't know.

1345
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,840
I have an older brother and younger sister.

1346
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,840
We were all raised middle class.

1347
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
It was good, man.

1348
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,840
It was good.

1349
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,840
I don't have any kind of crazy stories really because everything was totally normal and

1350
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
not interesting.

1351
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Ben's in another PCP with Digi and Ben.

1352
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,840
I remember that a little bit.

1353
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Only about his dad, about how he's kind of cool but also gay.

1354
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
Kind of stern.

1355
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
Yeah.

1356
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
My mom kind of takes-

1357
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,840
And he's ashamed of Ben's career choice.

1358
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,840
He's just ashamed of Ben, period.

1359
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
You know what?

1360
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,840
Okay, that's a good jumping off point.

1361
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,840
My dad is not ashamed of Ben's career choice at all.

1362
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,840
I think he would really support anything that any of us do.

1363
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,840
He's simply an incredibly practical guy and only cares.

1364
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,840
You can do whatever you want but first you've got to meet your responsibilities of paying

1365
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
the fucking bills.

1366
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,840
So he's mad at us.

1367
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
That's just life.

1368
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
That's just how to live.

1369
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,840
Don't tie everything like that.

1370
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
I think it's a fool.

1371
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,840
I'm on Team Dad.

1372
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Team Nate Dad.

1373
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
That's sexist.

1374
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Right now, Ben's doing better.

1375
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,840
My dad just worries that Ben won't be able to pay his bills or whatever.

1376
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
That's all he cares about.

1377
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,840
My sister is a tattoo artist.

1378
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,840
She hates tattoos.

1379
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
My mom too.

1380
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
They hate the idea of tattooing.

1381
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,840
My sister is a fucking tattoo artist.

1382
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
Kind of like not what they're into.

1383
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,840
But they've pretty much gotten over it and are just happy that she can support herself

1384
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,840
doing something she's happy with.

1385
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,840
In that respect, they're pretty chill.

1386
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,840
One thing I've noticed is that my dad was really controlling when we were young.

1387
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,840
He's the kind of guy who always believes he's right and usually is.

1388
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,840
That kind of reinforces his desire to always be in charge of shit.

1389
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,840
But as I've gotten older and gotten out of his thumb, gotten out from under his thumb,

1390
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,840
and I think this is probably true of most people becoming an independent adult,

1391
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,840
I feel a lot less of that shit.

1392
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,840
His overbearing presence has lessened greatly and I can just kind of appreciate him.

1393
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,840
He's kind of become a real person as opposed to an authority figure in my life.

1394
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,840
I like him a lot more that way.

1395
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,840
It's much easier to interact with him.

1396
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,840
Because when you're a kid and you're growing up and you have a controlling dad,

1397
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:43,840
it's easy to forget that he's also capable of being fun and doing cool shit.

1398
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,840
I just see more and more of that as time goes on and he's not my boss anymore.

1399
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,840
And it's nice.

1400
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,840
It's a nice thing I'm trying to communicate.

1401
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
I didn't really mention this about my dad.

1402
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:03,840
Not really the controlling, but he believes he's right a lot of the time.

1403
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,840
Just today, he misheard something I said and he would not believe that he misheard it.

1404
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,840
He said that I didn't say the thing and it really made me mad.

1405
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,840
What was the thing? I need to know now.

1406
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,840
It was about the draw cast.

1407
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,840
It was about the draw cast we were recording earlier.

1408
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,840
I said, oh, I'm going to be on a draw cast.

1409
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
I'm going to be on a podcast in 45 minutes.

1410
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:33,840
And then that's going to take a couple hours and dinner wait until after that.

1411
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Or should I change it?

1412
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
And he said, no, that's fine.

1413
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,840
He thought I meant, like, could it wait an hour or 45 minutes?

1414
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,840
And then that's why that is not really that interesting.

1415
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:50,840
It just annoyed me that he would not consider the fact that he misheard me.

1416
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,840
I know what you mean.

1417
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,840
It's just stuff like that.

1418
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:05,840
But it's interesting when I hear like, look at people interacting with their parents as if they're just interacting with a friend or like me or like someone.

1419
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:11,840
It's weird. I don't act like I do around my parents the way I do around my friends.

1420
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,840
I'm more so recently because they see my YouTube videos.

1421
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,840
They see what I'm like when I'm not, you know, like being reserved.

1422
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,840
You know what I mean?

1423
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,840
I do.

1424
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
That's that's a fascinating thing I observed.

1425
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Even when I was a kid, like, yeah, like this is what I was trying to say this before.

1426
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,840
But like, when you see the way you're like my dad, especially my dad is very, he can be very high strung.

1427
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,840
And like, when I was a kid, he was, you know, he was high strung.

1428
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:43,840
But then when I would see him like, whatever I would go with him like to work on like the extremely rare chance I would see him like out just like doing his business.

1429
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,840
He was like such a nice guy to everybody he met.

1430
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:54,840
And it was like unbelievable to me that he was like this kind of guy out in the world was like such a sweetheart because like he works with a lot of old folks.

1431
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,840
He's like a, you know, he does like elder counseling and shit now.

1432
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,840
And he's done for like 20 years at this point, but that's his thing.

1433
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,840
And like, he's just such a fucking softy to them.

1434
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,840
I mean, you know, he still does his job.

1435
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,840
But even not to them, but like to the nurses he interacts with to everybody else.

1436
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
He seemed like such a nice guy.

1437
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,840
And then when he would come home and just be like, why are these, you know, he wouldn't swear.

1438
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
But like, this is just me in my voice explaining what he would say.

1439
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,840
Why are there fucking dishes not done?

1440
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,840
What the fuck is this shit?

1441
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Like I come home and nobody's done anything.

1442
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,840
I have to do everything when I get home.

1443
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,840
This is bullshit.

1444
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,840
You know, he'd say it in much nicer language.

1445
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,840
This world.

1446
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,840
Yeah.

1447
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,840
Yeah.

1448
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,840
And he would pull out that gun and just end it all.

1449
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,840
Every single day.

1450
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,840
Every day.

1451
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840
Every day.

1452
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,840
He's unfortunately the invincible man, which is a big downside for him and his suicidal tendencies.

1453
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,840
But yeah, you know, that's, that's, that's the funny thing about parents.

1454
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:53,840
The way that as kids you perceive them versus the way they, they are sort of agents out in the world separate from that.

1455
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,840
Total can be like hugely different, which I find very interesting.

1456
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:06,840
And now that I'm an adult and get into a place where I'm becoming more of their equal as opposed to their, you know, not subservient, but you know, their child exclusively,

1457
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:15,840
I'm able to understand that they kind of are put in a role where they, at least my dad, kind of felt he had to be the authoritarian.

1458
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,840
And I could tell he never liked doing that.

1459
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,840
He was, he never liked having to like punish us or be strict with us.

1460
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,840
He would even, he would like tell us like, I hate, you know, having to fucking enforce these rules and shit.

1461
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:32,840
But you guys got to learn, be responsible and take initiative and do all that kind of shit.

1462
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,840
And I think it kind of eventually sunk in a little bit, I guess.

1463
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,840
I've got a little bit more of a work ethic than I did when I was young.

1464
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,840
But, you know, yeah.

1465
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,840
I feel like your dad and my dad would get along. We should have a dad cussed.

1466
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,840
Just like a sibling cuss, yeah.

1467
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,840
And I would sneak in and fucking nab a bitch.

1468
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,840
It's a danger to gather too many dads in one place with Munchie around.

1469
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,840
That's a big risk that we'd be taking.

1470
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,840
But I agree. I think our dads would get along great.

1471
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,840
My dad is very much a dad, if you know what I mean.

1472
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
Like 100% dad.

1473
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
Well, actually, that's what I'm saying.

1474
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,840
Like he's gotten a little bit less daddy and more chill dude-y in recent years.

1475
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,840
And I think the fact that all his kids don't live with him anymore, he's finally free.

1476
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,840
Which I don't think he's like super thrilled about.

1477
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
I think he kind of misses having people around.

1478
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,840
But nonetheless, like we're all out doing our own shit now.

1479
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:31,840
And I can tell he's able to loosen up a little bit, you know?

1480
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,840
You imagine what it feels like to just like-

1481
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
Is his voice he loosened up any at all? Do you know?

1482
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,840
I'll let you know next time I go visit.

1483
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,840
Alright, thanks.

1484
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,840
You ever think how like weird it is?

1485
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Like you're like a young man and then you get a wife and you have kids

1486
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,840
and then your life is all about raising these kids to a certain age.

1487
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Like for 20 years probably.

1488
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,840
And then they all leave and then suddenly you find yourself in a space-

1489
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:04,840
With the sort of free time you would have had when you're like a young man at 25 or whatever.

1490
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,840
I know exactly what you mean.

1491
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,840
And then suddenly it's like, oh, what happened? Where am I?

1492
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,840
What could that be like? It's probably very strange.

1493
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,840
I bet it is extremely strange.

1494
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,840
And like we've got this big house in Massachusetts that's now mostly empty most of the time.

1495
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,840
Because it's just two people living there instead of like five.

1496
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,840
Yeah, it's a big change, man.

1497
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,840
I mean my dad is the kind of guy who plans like decades ahead.

1498
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,840
And he's got schemes, he's got things to occupy him.

1499
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I mean my mom's retiring at the end of this school year, I think.

1500
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,840
And my dad's retired in, I don't know, like a handful of years more.

1501
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,840
And they have plenty of savings.

1502
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:51,840
They are going to be just fine with their savings because my dad is on that shit.

1503
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,840
And he's got me to start a 401K already.

1504
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,840
And it's going, it's my fucking company, it's feeding into it every paycheck.

1505
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,840
And yeah, I don't know, he's just like the most responsible guy in the world.

1506
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,840
And that's been a big strength to him, like career-wise and like economically.

1507
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,840
But also probably cost him a little bit of fun he could have had in his life.

1508
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,840
I mean it still can.

1509
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,840
And hopefully he will now, now that he's got more opportunities to do so.

1510
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:23,840
You know, I really am happy that I can get older and understand where the way he's,

1511
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,840
the way he like was a dude.

1512
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,840
And like hearing about stories when he was a kid, like the shit he used to get into.

1513
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,840
Like he was like a huge Monty Python fan when he was a kid.

1514
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,840
And I didn't even really know until like a couple years ago when I heard Ben mention it,

1515
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,840
like talking about my dad.

1516
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,840
And like him and his buddy Asa, who you know, is like his friend from like elementary school

1517
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
that he's still friends with.

1518
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,840
They used to fucking quote that shit all the time to each other.

1519
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,840
And they went across like England, having adventures together a couple times.

1520
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,840
And they did all kinds of crazy shit.

1521
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:03,840
And it's just really cool to learn about your parents as people, as opposed to authoritarians.

1522
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,840
I really like it.

1523
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,840
But parents feel like fathers because women are not people.

1524
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
Well, you know, that's the thing.

1525
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,840
I was, I feel a little bit guilty even saying this because I'm not focusing on my mom so much.

1526
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:20,840
It's just that my mom's been a very passive person, you know, in like the relationship.

1527
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,840
My mom was always kind of the one who did not take initiative to like do stuff.

1528
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,840
She would, she's not a bitch.

1529
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,840
She would, she'd be very supportive when there was things we wanted to do.

1530
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,840
But she was very, she was dimmier, I suppose I'd say she was.

1531
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,840
Are you sure that your family isn't Muslim?

1532
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,840
Because it sounds very Muslim.

1533
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,840
Muslim? No, she's, unfortunately, she's a disgraceful white woman.

1534
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Oh, no.

1535
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
White people can't be Muslim, Nate.

1536
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
What the fuck?

1537
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,840
Well, not with their hair all, you know, sledding out in the sun.

1538
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Jesus Christ.

1539
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Somebody fucking mute this guy.

1540
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Whoever edits this, just edit Nate's fucking audio out of this podcast.

1541
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
Nate, please.

1542
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
Please.

1543
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,840
And this.

1544
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,840
Yeah, I don't know.

1545
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,840
You should call your dad up and tell him you've been fucking my dog.

1546
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
You bitch.

1547
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Pretty sure that's allowed in Islam.

1548
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,840
Pretty sure.

1549
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,840
All right.

1550
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,840
That's it.

1551
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,840
You're thinking about goats.

1552
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,840
That same thing.

1553
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,840
Same thing.

1554
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,840
Dogs and goats.

1555
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
Little known fact, same thing.

1556
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
Hippo, what were you saying?

1557
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:28,840
Yeah, I was saying like what you were saying about like your stories of your dad as a young man.

1558
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:34,840
Like my dad has like a, I really like dad stories because he, my dad is good at telling stories.

1559
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,840
You know, at the dinner table, like after, you know, we're done.

1560
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,840
We're just sitting there just like, ah, nice.

1561
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:46,840
And then he starts just, you know, I remember a thing and he tells us and he's always really good at telling it.

1562
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:54,840
And he has so many like stories of him being like a really like a rough house, ruffian kid with his friends that would beat people up and scare people.

1563
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Wow.

1564
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,840
That's awesome.

1565
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:05,840
There was this really cool one where he was like, you know, he blew up his science class in his Christian class and he went outside.

1566
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,840
Oh, probably.

1567
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:16,840
And then there was like this one where he, him and his friends, there was like this one stairwell to this certain part of the school.

1568
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,840
And he and his friends locked arms at the top of the stairs and they would not let anybody pass for like two hours.

1569
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,840
Wow.

1570
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,840
That's commitment to a fucking joke.

1571
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,840
They really got in trouble, but it was great.

1572
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,840
Yeah.

1573
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:36,840
It's just sort of like, you know, old London, like, I don't know, 50s, 60s sort of cool, cool rough boys.

1574
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,840
Upside down land.

1575
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,840
Yeah, that's right.

1576
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,840
It's cool.

1577
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,840
Was that?

1578
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,840
Old dad stories are really cool.

1579
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,840
I'm imagining that's the Tower of London and the Queen is trying to pass.

1580
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,840
She's like, oh, get out of my way, you ruffians.

1581
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,840
And they're like, no, Goughna can't do it.

1582
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,840
And the police can't do shit about it because those cucks don't carry weapons.

1583
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,840
That's right.

1584
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
They'll fucking get, they'll fucking get claws on the god.

1585
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,840
I'll get you kids whips out small water gun.

1586
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,840
No guns aren't allowed.

1587
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
Oh yeah, whips out butter knife.

1588
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,840
Oh wait, knives aren't allowed either.

1589
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,840
That's knives are not allowed.

1590
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
Whips out finger.

1591
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,840
That's, that's a very, uh,

1592
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
And they wag their finger.

1593
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,840
Yeah.

1594
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,840
It sounds like a very British attack is like wagging somebody.

1595
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,840
Even that's dangerously phallic, a.k.a. patriarchy.

1596
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,840
So we need to stay away from the whole finger wagging thing.

1597
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,840
But you know,

1598
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,840
Whips out white woman to be raped promptly by our,

1599
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,840
by our immigrant friends.

1600
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
No, no, Brexit passed.

1601
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,840
There's no more immigrants in the UK.

1602
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,840
That's right.

1603
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,840
That's right.

1604
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
I mean, now that, yeah.

1605
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,840
Hey, but I understand the,

1606
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,840
the government and the,

1607
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,840
and the political structure of your country way better than you.

1608
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,840
I know what Brexit does.

1609
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,840
I know what Brexit has done is made like immigrants want to come in really quick

1610
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,840
before it happens, before it becomes like legal.

1611
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,840
So now there's just so many more immigrants.

1612
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,840
It's terrible.

1613
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
Well, actually, I don't know.

1614
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,840
I mean, like when, when, when the Brexit's done,

1615
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
over 20 minutes a day,

1616
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,840
do you just see a bunch of the jobs in the street or what?

1617
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
Well, the thing is,

1618
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,840
we've already had like a very multicultural,

1619
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,840
at least London.

1620
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,840
Like London is very multicultural anyway.

1621
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,840
So it's like, I've seen,

1622
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,840
I've seen different types of people all the time.

1623
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,840
So seeing a bunch more would be like, hey, what am I?

1624
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,840
Wait, I forget.

1625
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,840
Where do you live?

1626
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,840
Do you live near London?

1627
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,840
What's your address?

1628
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Near London.

1629
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Okay.

1630
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Yeah, what's your address?

1631
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,840
My address is,

1632
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,840
One, two, three, Fake Street.

1633
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:30,840
Brett Bong.

1634
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,840
Yeah.

1635
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,840
One, two, three, Fake Street.

1636
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
That's what I always say.

1637
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,840
Crumpet and T Street.

1638
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,840
Do you know the address of the Queen's Palace?

1639
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,840
What?

1640
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Buckingham Palace.

1641
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Yeah.

1642
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
What's the address?

1643
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,840
Google it.

1644
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,840
You'll find it.

1645
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,840
I was hoping you knew it,

1646
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,840
so you could just say you live there.

1647
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,840
That would have been it.

1648
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,840
What if you were the Prince of England give all along?

1649
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,840
Please make that true.

1650
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,840
That would be cool for me.

1651
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,840
Oh, and then I could,

1652
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,840
then I could patron Ben Sain.

1653
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,840
No!

1654
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,840
Like, zero dollars.

1655
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
No, there you go.

1656
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,840
A little waste of money.

1657
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,840
There you go.

1658
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,840
Well, that was pretty much it.

1659
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,840
Who do you think?

1660
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
It was probably Munchie.

1661
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,840
I don't know why I asked.

1662
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,840
With that level of audio clipping,

1663
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,840
there's only one man who can fit that,

1664
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,840
who can fit that.

1665
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,840
He is clipping the band.

1666
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,840
So, anybody else want to say anything about their parents,

1667
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,840
or should we?

1668
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,840
Okay.

1669
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,840
Okay.

1670
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,840
Well, we got questions too, so.

1671
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,840
Yeah.

1672
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,840
As a broad thing,

1673
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,840
I just need to pass down to you, dear viewers,

1674
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,840
the wisdom that I have been passed down by my hero,

1675
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,840
the man, the myth, the legend,

1676
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,840
Jean Rankowski,

1677
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
aka, Jace Connors,

1678
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,840
aka, part one, dude 91.

1679
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,840
The advice is as follows.

1680
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,840
Dads.

1681
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,840
Get on the ground.

1682
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,840
I can't.

1683
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:44,840
I can't.

1684
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,840
The movie maker is obviously first.

1685
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,840
First one for us.

1686
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,840
However, second man.

1687
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,840
No!

1688
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,840
No!

1689
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,840
Munchie enough.

1690
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,840
Also, by the way, listen, buddy,

1691
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,840
so we have all three of those in quick succession

1692
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
from one another.

1693
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,840
Anyway, as I was fucking saying,

1694
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,840
I forgot what, oh, no, okay, okay.

1695
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,840
The concept and name and term specifically of dads

1696
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,840
are inherently funny in every way.

1697
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,840
And therefore, adding dad to the end

1698
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,840
of any adjective, noun, or verb

1699
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,840
inherently makes that verb or other word

1700
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,840
like 10 times as funny.

1701
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,840
You can do this with anything.

1702
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,840
For instance, friendly dad for 20,

1703
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,840
or super daddy,

1704
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,840
or wood dad, anything.

1705
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,840
It can be anything.

1706
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,840
Adding dad to the end makes it better

1707
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,840
because dads are just inherently funny.

1708
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,840
I've got a good question for everybody to answer

1709
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,840
to end this with,

1710
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,840
would you become a parent?

1711
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,840
Fuck no.

1712
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,840
That is a good question.

1713
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,840
Okay, we're gonna say no.

1714
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,840
I'm definitely never going to have kids,

1715
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,840
ever, no way.

1716
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,840
Really?

1717
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
You can quote me on that.

1718
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,840
If I ever have kids,

1719
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,840
listeners at home,

1720
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,840
if I ever have kids,

1721
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,840
you have permission to fly out to my house

1722
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,840
and literally kill me.

1723
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,840
I'll give you my address.

1724
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,840
Now, this is a two-part question.

1725
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
How come?

1726
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,840
How do you say that?

1727
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,840
Because I'm way too selfish

1728
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,840
and I don't want to waste my life

1729
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,840
raising some little fuckhead

1730
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,840
who looks like me

1731
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,840
because I know how bad my genetics are

1732
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
and I'm not gonna put that curse

1733
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,840
on some other innocent human beings.

1734
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,840
That's a good point.

1735
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,840
You're a terrible human being.

1736
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,840
You've all seen me.

1737
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,840
You don't want to perpetuate the monkey disease.

1738
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:27,840
Nope, never.

1739
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,840
That's true.

1740
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,840
Yeah, fuck kids.

1741
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,840
What do you say hippo?

1742
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah, go ahead and give me.

1743
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,840
No, you can fuck kids.

1744
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,840
It's okay.

1745
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,840
Sex with the young and all.

1746
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Well, now that you've told me that, I will.

1747
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,840
I mean, technically,

1748
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,840
every single person who has sex is a kid

1749
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
because they're all somebody's child.

1750
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,840
Oh, right.

1751
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,840
Yeah, that is true.

1752
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,840
So fuck you, I was right.

1753
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,840
Oh, guys, I forgot to tell you,

1754
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
this is really fucking important.

1755
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
This is crazy.

1756
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,840
From the South the other day,

1757
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,840
if your mom never had children,

1758
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
you won't either.

1759
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
How crazy is that?

1760
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,840
That's fucking fucked up, bro.

1761
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Yeah, probably true.

1762
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,840
That's fucked up.

1763
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,840
So much of the toilet left, am I right?

1764
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,840
God damn it.

1765
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,840
That reminds me of that famous screencap

1766
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,840
of a little girl, I think,

1767
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,840
a food of fucking her mom that says,

1768
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,840
I'll take your virginity, mom.

1769
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,840
Well, that's a good one.

1770
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,840
Tom, what about you?

1771
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,840
Are you ever going to have kids after you kill yourself?

1772
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,840
What about you, Tom?

1773
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,840
Are you going to take your mom's virginity?

1774
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,840
Yeah, weigh in on that, please.

1775
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,840
I mean, about having kids,

1776
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,840
basically, I'm in the same position as Momgie.

1777
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,840
I'm too selfish.

1778
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
I have too much.

1779
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,840
I think me and Tom are the same person in a lot of ways.

1780
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,840
We have a lot of similarities, I feel.

1781
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,840
But no, it was exactly the same.

1782
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,840
I wouldn't want to fucking have kids,

1783
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,840
because I think I have an interesting perspective,

1784
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,840
because my parents...

1785
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,840
Didn't want to have you.

1786
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,840
No, they didn't.

1787
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,840
I was literally in an accident.

1788
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,840
I almost died when I was born,

1789
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,840
and they should have just let it happen.

1790
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,840
Wow, OK.

1791
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,840
Would have saved me some trouble.

1792
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,840
Oh, shit.

1793
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
You know, that should not impact.

1794
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,840
That doesn't matter.

1795
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
Totally irrelevant.

1796
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,840
No, I think it's important.

1797
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,840
Don't worry about it.

1798
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,840
I feel like a lot of people, like,

1799
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,840
sincerely will get upset,

1800
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
even if they don't say it,

1801
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,840
that they were in an accident or that it wasn't tended.

1802
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,840
I hope that's not the case with you, Tom,

1803
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,840
because it doesn't matter.

1804
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,840
You're worthy, and I like you,

1805
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,840
and your existence has value.

1806
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,840
I think it's safe to assume that the majority of

1807
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,840
first-born kids are probably in an accident,

1808
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
but then the parents are like,

1809
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
oh, fuck it, we were going to do this anyway.

1810
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Let's just do it.

1811
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,840
I think most kids are accidents in general.

1812
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
Am I wrong about that?

1813
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,840
I mean, probably, I don't know.

1814
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
Whole human species was a genetic accident.

1815
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,840
Wait a minute.

1816
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,840
It's just a surprise.

1817
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,840
I think, yeah, all right.

1818
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,840
Well, the thing, the point I was going to make

1819
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,840
is that my parents had me,

1820
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,840
then two years later, they had my sister,

1821
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
and then, like, 12 years later,

1822
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,840
they had another kid.

1823
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,840
Oh, fuck.

1824
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,840
So I...

1825
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,840
That kid was the accident.

1826
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,840
We were all accidents.

1827
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,840
So...

1828
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,840
My whole life has been an accident,

1829
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,840
but, like, just growing up

1830
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
and, like, being, like,

1831
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
old enough to, like, see the whole process,

1832
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,840
and, like, this is what it is to have a child.

1833
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,840
I was like, never.

1834
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,840
Never in a million years.

1835
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,840
Like, all the people who were romanticized having a kid,

1836
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,840
no, I lived through it.

1837
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,840
I didn't get to sleep either,

1838
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,840
because I had to sleep right next door

1839
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,840
where the baby was sleeping.

1840
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,840
Right, right.

1841
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,840
This is fucking horrible.

1842
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,840
So, like, I saw all this shit happen.

1843
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,840
Like, I've already had to change diapers and shit.

1844
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,840
Fuck that!

1845
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,840
I paid my dues.

1846
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Not doing it again.

1847
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,840
So, no.

1848
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
I paid my dues.

1849
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,840
Never.

1850
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,840
I have a unique perspective.

1851
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,840
I know exactly what it means.

1852
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,840
Time after time.

1853
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,840
No.

1854
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
Okay, alright.

1855
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,840
Alright.

1856
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,840
Perfectly acceptable answer.

1857
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,840
Can we skip over Gip, by the way,

1858
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
or did I just, like, pass out?

1859
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,840
No, we didn't...

1860
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,840
Well, he hasn't gone yet,

1861
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,840
but we didn't skip him.

1862
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,840
Yeah.

1863
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,840
Okay, why don't you just go now?

1864
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,840
He said he already has kids.

1865
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,840
I...

1866
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Right.

1867
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
I am kids.

1868
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,840
No.

1869
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:00,840
So, I think I'm unusual in my generation, generally,

1870
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,840
that I just...

1871
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,840
I like the idea of having kids.

1872
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,840
Were you born in lay wrong generation, Gip?

1873
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,840
No, no.

1874
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,840
What I mean is, like, it's...

1875
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,840
Lay wrong generation.

1876
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,840
It's very, like...

1877
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,840
Oh, that's...

1878
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,840
Yeah, it's a very good joke.

1879
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,840
Thank you, thank you.

1880
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,840
Very, very good name.

1881
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,840
Very good name.

1882
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
I spent a lot of time with that.

1883
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,840
I thank you, everyone.

1884
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,840
I'm not being sarcastic.

1885
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,840
I thought it was really funny.

1886
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,840
It is funny.

1887
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,840
It's hilarious.

1888
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,840
Yeah.

1889
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,840
He said it a million times before.

1890
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,840
That makes it funnier.

1891
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,840
And it's funnier every damn time.

1892
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,840
It's like subscribe to Munky Jones.

1893
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Everybody in the comments, say subscribe to Munky Jones.

1894
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
It only gets funnier as it goes on.

1895
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,840
Yeah.

1896
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,840
Sorry, Gip.

1897
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,840
Okay, please.

1898
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,840
That was an unconvinced grunt.

1899
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,840
Yeah.

1900
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,840
Yeah.

1901
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,840
I like the idea of having a child.

1902
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,840
I don't know whether I like the idea of raising it,

1903
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,840
but I like the idea of raising it.

1904
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
I don't know whether I like the idea of raising it,

1905
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,840
but I like the idea of having had raised a child up

1906
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,840
and him or her to be like cool.

1907
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,840
What age do you think you...

1908
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,840
And to have a name that I gave them.

1909
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,840
What age would you say is like, like, okay,

1910
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,840
it'll be cool to have a kid once they're X,

1911
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,840
like 25, like, I don't know, 40.

1912
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Just curious.

1913
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Oh, well, I think I'd enjoy it.

1914
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,840
I think I'd enjoy it once they're not a baby

1915
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
and they can talk and they can walk around

1916
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,840
and be cute and stuff.

1917
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,840
Now, Hippo, what if your kid becomes the next

1918
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840
Elliot Roger or like somebody who

1919
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,840
kills a bunch of people?

1920
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,840
Well, it wasn't because I'm not a terrible father.

1921
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
The next greatest hero of all time?

1922
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,840
Peter Roger was a terrible father.

1923
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,840
He was one of the best fathers.

1924
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
He just gave his son money and said, go.

1925
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
That's really all you need to do to raise a good son.

1926
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Go shoot the people.

1927
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,840
Go to the shoot people.

1928
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,840
Go on, go to the shoot people.

1929
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,840
That's what you need to do.

1930
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,840
When you raise your kids, you can't say a lot about the fall.

1931
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
You know, if Hillary Clinton was president,

1932
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,840
Roger would not have killed all those people.

1933
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,840
That's right.

1934
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,840
Because she would have had sex with him.

1935
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,840
Because Obama would not have brainwashed him

1936
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,840
with Cory in the house.

1937
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,840
It was her time.

1938
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,840
That's a world famous YouTube video

1939
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,840
of Cory in the house, what's in an OP, right?

1940
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,840
No!

1941
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,840
The faggot Jeff stole my joke.

1942
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,840
He's not a faggot. He's cool.

1943
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,840
Now, mine came out in like mid-March

1944
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
and then his came out April 1st.

1945
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,840
So who ripped off who? You tell me.

1946
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,840
Oh, fascinating.

1947
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
And also mine came out way after his, I think.

1948
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,840
Yeah.

1949
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,840
But mine was actually funny.

1950
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,840
I don't know what I'm doing.

1951
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,840
So you want to have kids, you're looking forward to it.

1952
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
It'll be cool. You like all that shit.

1953
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,840
Yeah, I like the idea

1954
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,840
of being a...

1955
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,840
Because I thought about

1956
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,840
how you would do it wrong

1957
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,840
and how you would do it right.

1958
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,840
You've got to prepare for them to rebel.

1959
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,840
You've got to accept that

1960
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,840
they're going to live in a world

1961
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,840
where everything is completely different and weird.

1962
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,840
We're living with let's plays

1963
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
and YouTube and shit

1964
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,840
and our parents don't know what the fuck that is.

1965
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,840
So when I'm a parent,

1966
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,840
if I'm a parent,

1967
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,840
my kids are going to be growing up on some weird shit

1968
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,840
that I'm going to think is disgusting

1969
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,840
and I don't get it.

1970
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,840
But I'm going to have to let them do it

1971
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,840
because that's the future.

1972
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,840
So I've thought about the way

1973
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,840
to be a good parent

1974
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,840
despite the way that times change.

1975
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,840
I don't know. I've thought about it a lot.

1976
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,840
I want to be like a cool dad.

1977
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,840
Like my dad.

1978
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,840
Because he's cool.

1979
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,840
I know what you mean.

1980
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,840
I kind of empathize with parents

1981
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,840
who are like, oh, I can't keep up with what kids are doing.

1982
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,840
Because for thousands of years,

1983
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,840
human society did not evolve very fast.

1984
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,840
Now all of a sudden,

1985
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,840
the internet has changed everything about the way we live our lives.

1986
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,840
So I get it that people from the 20s

1987
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,840
have no fucking idea what's going on

1988
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
in the world right now.

1989
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,840
The people from the 20s are dead.

1990
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,840
Not all of them. That's only like 90s.

1991
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
They're getting close to 100 now.

1992
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,840
They don't even know what the internet is from.

1993
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,840
Okay, fine. The fucking 40s.

1994
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
Whatever. It's still big difference.

1995
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,840
Big difference.

1996
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,840
Yeah. Okay. Anyway.

1997
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,840
Mumkey? I mean, Munchy? Same guy?

1998
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,840
Munchy? Every time.

1999
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,840
Every time. Munchy.

2000
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,840
Tell me about your son.

2001
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
Well, my son

2002
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,840
will be named

2003
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
Mumkey Jones

2004
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
and I'll kill him.

2005
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,840
It's funny that

2006
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,840
Hippo wants to be a dad

2007
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,840
because he thought his dad was cool.

2008
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
I want to be a dad because I thought my dad

2009
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,840
was a fucking faggot.

2010
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,840
Dude, that's the Will Smith approach.

2011
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,840
That's the Will Smith approach.

2012
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
I'm just going to be like, ah, you fucking bitch.

2013
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
I'll speedrun this shit, LOL.

2014
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,840
I'll post this on Twitch.

2015
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,840
He's going to be

2016
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,840
720 no scoping those dad Olympics.

2017
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
It's going to be fucking sick.

2018
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,840
Alright.

2019
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
I want to have a child

2020
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,840
sometime in the future

2021
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
once things are

2022
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,840
not, you know,

2023
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,840
when I'm not a baby myself.

2024
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,840
No particular age

2025
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,840
and also

2026
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,840
if I could

2027
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,840
I would just want to

2028
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,840
as Hippo said just like fast forward the baby parts

2029
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,840
but the baby's parts, I don't think they'll be that bad.

2030
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
The babies are cute.

2031
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,840
Yeah.

2032
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,840
They're a bit of a gay

2033
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,840
mess, but it's like one or two years.

2034
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,840
It's bad.

2035
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,840
I know it's bad, but like, you know.

2036
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,840
Imagine doing anything for one or two years.

2037
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
That's,

2038
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
I'm with you, but I'm just saying that's this a long time.

2039
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
No, yeah.

2040
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,840
I want to be able to like

2041
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
fucking like make someone

2042
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,840
me but cooler.

2043
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,840
That's what I'm going to try and accomplish.

2044
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,840
How could that happen?

2045
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,840
I would just force him to make grills.

2046
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,840
Did you become Bill Blossom

2047
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,840
for two seconds?

2048
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,840
I think the most likely thing to happen

2049
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,840
if Munchie, if you stay the way you are

2050
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
as a parent that your child will be

2051
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,840
the most like boring person

2052
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,840
in the universe.

2053
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,840
Yeah, just to rebel.

2054
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,840
But you know, Munchie, I mean Munchie

2055
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
would die.

2056
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,840
Munchie would be the one guy who would be so proud

2057
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
of his son to get a job at McDonald's

2058
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,840
to make those McGriddles.

2059
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,840
He wants it so bad.

2060
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,840
Instead he'll become like

2061
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,840
I want the McGriddles son!

2062
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,840
I'm not here for you!

2063
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,840
Where are my fucking McGriddles?

2064
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,840
Bring them to me!

2065
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,840
This is what I trained you for.

2066
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
This is all you're good for to me.

2067
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,840
The fry cook from birth.

2068
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,840
The chosen one, yeah.

2069
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
But instead of doing all that

2070
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,840
gay shit

2071
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,840
he learns how to become an astronaut

2072
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
and he fucks away to space.

2073
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,840
He'll be very disappointed.

2074
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,840
I just wanted my McGriddles.

2075
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,840
I just wanted McGriddles.

2076
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,840
Fascinating.

2077
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,840
No one's commented on this yet,

2078
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,840
I don't think.

2079
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,840
Because the episode's not out yet.

2080
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,840
Bitch,

2081
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,840
you are that.

2082
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,840
I want to have a kid

2083
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,840
but I couldn't even

2084
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,840
imagine having a wife.

2085
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,840
I know what you mean.

2086
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,840
I was going to say something about that.

2087
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,840
I would just want to adopt, I guess.

2088
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,840
I know the feeling.

2089
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,840
That is a thing.

2090
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,840
You think this is how I'm going to do it

2091
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
and then if you meet a significant other

2092
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,840
then they have their

2093
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,840
plans and you're going to kill each other.

2094
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,840
And they're always going to be worse.

2095
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,840
It's because

2096
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,840
none of us are

2097
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,840
actually a stature of monkey,

2098
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,840
but none of us as far as I know

2099
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,840
are in a serious committed relationship of any kind

2100
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,840
where we're really considering anything like that.

2101
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,840
It's just way outside my wheelhouse

2102
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
the idea of committing to someone

2103
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,840
for 18 years or whatever the fuck.

2104
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,840
Well anyway,

2105
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,840
I guess I'll just say

2106
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,840
my piece on as well.

2107
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,840
For many years

2108
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,840
I have known that I will have

2109
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,840
for starters, I have seven sexy daughters

2110
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,840
to begin with.

2111
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,840
And please feed them

2112
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,840
by going to patreon.com

2113
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,840
It's one of my reward tiers, I think.

2114
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,840
Feed my seven daughters. Need to do that shit.

2115
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,840
Aside from that,

2116
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,840
I plan on having two more children

2117
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,840
maybe like 10 years or so.

2118
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,840
Charlotte and Vincent,

2119
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,840
they're going to be two perfect children

2120
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
and I'm going to raise them

2121
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,840
to better humanity for all.

2122
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,840
Because the thing is, nobody's talked about this

2123
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,840
I think about things like

2124
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,840
the movie Idiocracy a lot

2125
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,840
about how the stupidest people breed the most

2126
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,840
and make the most worthless swine humans

2127
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,840
that don't deserve to live.

2128
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
I have a duty to breed

2129
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
and spread my perfect genes

2130
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
my god-like genes around the rest of humanity

2131
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,840
so you guys haven't even been talking about this

2132
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
but I am serious about this

2133
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,840
I need to continue my genetic legacy

2134
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,840
because I know I'm the best

2135
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,840
because I know that's what humanity needs

2136
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,840
to get better, it needs what I've got

2137
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,840
to be humanity, anti-humanist

2138
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,840
to not reproduce

2139
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,840
and continue this perfect thing

2140
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,840
I've got going on over here.

2141
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,840
I'm selfish so I'm okay with that.

2142
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,840
That's true.

2143
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,840
I'm fine with the intellect part

2144
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,840
but I don't give a shit about genes or anything.

2145
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,840
Well, you forget how much

2146
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,840
I can fucking bench, dude.

2147
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
You forget that shit.

2148
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,840
But look, the fact that there are so many dumb

2149
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,840
stupid swine humans is how

2150
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,840
we're going to succeed

2151
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,840
and take their money and they won't realize

2152
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,840
we just need to have slaves again

2153
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,840
what the fuck Abraham Lincoln

2154
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,840
That'll work for a while

2155
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,840
but I want to get to Starfleet as soon as possible

2156
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
and in Starfleet you need people to have their shit together

2157
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,840
more or less

2158
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
I'm hoping for that sooner rather than later

2159
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,840
You need to build Starfleet out of the pyramids

2160
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,840
Out of Minecraft

2161
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
Yeah, we just need to make

2162
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,840
Minecraft real and then we'll have

2163
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,840
fucking Starfleet like two seconds

2164
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,840
We'll have plenty of Minecraft slave builders

2165
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,840
That's all the children of the world

2166
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,840
All the kids will do it, man

2167
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,840
Yeah, that'd be nice

2168
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,840
It would be like Indiana Jones or the Temple of Doom

2169
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,840
except, you know, they'll be doing something

2170
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,840
I also

2171
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,840
like what you were saying, I also wanted to say

2172
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
I really want to be a dad

2173
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,840
There was something that's apropos about this

2174
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,840
So today, the day we're recording this

2175
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,840
April 1st, 2017 is the

2176
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,840
10 year anniversary of Tangentapa Gurun Lagann's release

2177
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
and that's a special day

2178
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,840
for people like me who really care about that series

2179
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,840
and I know I always say that Kamina

2180
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,840
is like my favorite character

2181
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,840
I've had a long time to think about why that is

2182
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,840
and I know I've talked about this before

2183
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,840
but the point is he is like

2184
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,840
the ideal father figure to me

2185
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
He's like

2186
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,840
When I see him, I always talk about how

2187
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,840
Kamina is like my favorite anime character ever

2188
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,840
which is true, but the point of the show

2189
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,840
which is what I said in my Gurun Lagann video

2190
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,840
is that Kamina is not perfect

2191
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,840
He is a flawed individual

2192
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
He has these various flaws

2193
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,840
that are complimented by someone like Rossiu

2194
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,840
and those things kind of combine in Simone

2195
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,840
making Simone more or less the perfect guy

2196
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,840
not quite, even Simone isn't perfect

2197
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,840
but it's about combining different factors

2198
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
but when I see Kamina

2199
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,840
when I see in him this masculine

2200
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,840
bravado can do anything

2201
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,840
project strength to

2202
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,840
make the people around him stronger

2203
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
this is going to get personal and possibly too deep

2204
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,840
but those are the things that I see

2205
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,840
myself lacking

2206
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,840
when I see a dad like that

2207
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,840
or a dad figure, he's not actually Simone's dad

2208
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
but he serves that function

2209
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
those are the things I want

2210
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,840
and I love that

2211
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,840
I want to be that for people

2212
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,840
because it's something that I really value

2213
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,840
and want to

2214
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,840
I don't know, I want to spread that

2215
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,840
I want to be the good dad

2216
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,840
because I love good dads

2217
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,840
good dads are my favorite thing in the world

2218
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
I have the ability to do that

2219
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,840
so I feel it's my obligation to do so

2220
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,840
and I hope in 30 years from now

2221
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,840
there's a kid making a shitty podcast

2222
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,840
who's talking about how cool his dad was

2223
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
and how he inspired him to be a cool guy

2224
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,840
and do cool things even if that only

2225
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,840
entailed just you know, birthing him

2226
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,840
and then leading him to his own devices

2227
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
to uh, why, what

2228
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,840
what mean were you going to say?

2229
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,840
I was just going to say and can like

2230
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,840
rapy, that was part of your training right

2231
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,840
well, of course

2232
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,840
you're right, teaching him the proper rape techniques

2233
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
as I say

2234
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,840
every day, the only true love is between

2235
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,840
a boy and a man, that's the goal

2236
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,840
and you know

2237
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,840
and yeah, I'm really fixated on the dad thing

2238
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,840
I want to be a good dad and I

2239
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,840
like what you were saying, I don't think about

2240
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,840
like the woman I would have to have involved

2241
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,840
in this at all, I am not interested

2242
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,840
I would be repulsed

2243
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,840
I could see myself

2244
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,840
I mean, I hate the idea of marriage

2245
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,840
it disgusts me, it's really a contract

2246
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,840
that keep men locked down

2247
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,840
to keep them from leaving, which actually does serve a practical purpose

2248
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
cause like families

2249
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,840
kid, raising children is better off

2250
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,840
when the man is not able to leave and is forced

2251
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
to stay, cause it's in men's best interest

2252
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,840
like personally, to just go around and fuck

2253
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
a million sluts and just you know, be free

2254
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,840
but like, a family is better off

2255
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
when they're kind of forced in place

2256
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,840
so like, I get the societal logic

2257
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,840
behind marriage that forces men to stay

2258
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,840
but I'm pretty uncomfortable with the idea

2259
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
myself, but I mean, I don't know

2260
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
maybe I would do something like that

2261
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
a committed relationship of some kind, to raise kids

2262
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,840
but God, do not care

2263
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,840
about the woman

2264
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,840
well the thing is, I'm trying to raise

2265
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,840
the best kids possible

2266
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,840
given the current environment

2267
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,840
and we don't have starfleet, we don't have any kind of that shit

2268
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,840
the best, the best environment

2269
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,840
you see statistically, this is a fact

2270
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,840
the best kids in America

2271
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,840
regardless of like, any kind of background

2272
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,840
having a mother and a father

2273
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,840
in like, a marriage relationship

2274
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,840
brings you the best children, they do the best

2275
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,840
like that is the biggest deciding factor

2276
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,840
is it like your anti-gay marriage

2277
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,840
discussion or what?

2278
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,840
no, not at all, I mean, it is actually a fact

2279
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
that like, mothers and fathers marry do better

2280
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
statistically

2281
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,840
the children of gay couples can be successful and good

2282
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,840
well, no, that's not what I'm saying at all

2283
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
it's more likely

2284
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,840
I'm only talking about statistics

2285
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,840
like, my dad is

2286
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,840
he does a lot of

2287
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,840
okay, I admit, I'm basing this on

2288
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,840
what my dad has researched

2289
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,840
because he's worked with a lot of kids

2290
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,840
like people getting divorced and all kinds of like

2291
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,840
well, yeah, divorce is going to lead to a fucked up kid probably

2292
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,840
well, not just that

2293
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,840
it sounds like you should be saying

2294
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,840
children who have two

2295
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,840
parents rather than mother and father

2296
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,840
I don't know

2297
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,840
well, but that's just not what the stats show

2298
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,840
the children, I mean, it is a fact

2299
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,840
that the most ideal situation

2300
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,840
the kids who do the best

2301
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
come from families that are

2302
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,840
you know, a traditional marriage

2303
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,840
and I don't even support traditional marriage

2304
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,840
so don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that I'm into it

2305
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,840
I'm just saying that that's what the facts

2306
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,840
are paying out

2307
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,840
I think I need to see these stats

2308
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,840
because it doesn't make any sense

2309
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,840
it's entirely possible that that's because we live in an evil

2310
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
patriarchy where that kind of relationship

2311
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
is like, rewarded

2312
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,840
whereas gay married couples

2313
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
do worse, maybe that's totally true

2314
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,840
and it is not true, but statistically

2315
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,840
that is the fact of the matter

2316
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,840
that they do the best

2317
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,840
that was true, I would have seen those stats posted

2318
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,840
on a lot of the

2319
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,840
red-pilled pages that I follow on Twitter

2320
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,840
and Facebook because I feel like that

2321
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,840
is a stat that they'd want to brag about all the time

2322
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,840
well

2323
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,840
maybe I'm wrong, I admit

2324
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,840
based on what my dad told me, maybe he was wrong

2325
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,840
the thing about people posting stuff

2326
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,840
is that they don't know anything

2327
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,840
so they only post

2328
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,840
stuff that gets posted by somebody

2329
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,840
who does know about it and I guess nobody

2330
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,840
has

2331
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
I feel like this is undocked about territory

2332
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,840
a little bit

2333
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,840
it's the sort of thing

2334
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,840
people are done

2335
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,840
and if they see something that supports their argument

2336
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,840
they'll repost it

2337
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,840
none of them actually know it offhand

2338
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
I didn't even mean to bring this up

2339
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,840
you can just say divorce

2340
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,840
not divorcing

2341
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,840
your kids do better when you don't divorce

2342
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,840
that's just how it is

2343
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
that sounds very logical

2344
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,840
I understand what you're saying

2345
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
I say that to myself

2346
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,840
in my brain a lot

2347
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,840
the way you're coming from

2348
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,840
I think it just comes down to a fact

2349
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,840
that just like

2350
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,840
minorities and shit are just

2351
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,840
they aren't a lot of them

2352
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
so it's harder to

2353
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,840
get big old samples

2354
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,840
I don't even know how the fuck

2355
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,840
we got to this point

2356
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,840
we have to wait until Hillary Clinton has her turn

2357
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,840
and makes it so that legally

2358
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,840
half of families

2359
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,840
have to have gay parents

2360
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,840
and then we can get the stats that we need

2361
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,840
we need that state enforced homosexuality

2362
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,840
as soon as possible

2363
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,840
that's equal

2364
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,840
we gotta have equality

2365
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,840
we gotta have equality on this

2366
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,840
I got my eye on you munchie

2367
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,840
watch the fuck out

2368
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,840
alright

2369
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,840
real quick Nate

2370
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,840
since you mentioned that today is April 1st

2371
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,840
I thought it would be important if I said real quick

2372
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,840
why is it so short

2373
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,840
my favorite meme

2374
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
we don't want to get content I do

2375
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,840
I don't think people plan

2376
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
guys this is the Kid Icarus show

2377
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,840
we have to say if we salvage it or slaughter it

2378
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
parents

2379
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,840
parents

2380
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,840
love them or hate them

2381
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,840
they're definitely the plebe

2382
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,840
they're getting slaughtered

2383
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,840
I give them zero rotten tomatoes out of a thousand

2384
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,840
oh god

2385
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
so as per usual

2386
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,840
on the tpcrastinator's twitter

2387
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,840
we said we needed some questions

2388
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,840
no no no

2389
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,840
I have something to say

2390
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
I have something to say

2391
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,840
I was going to award them a lot of dads

2392
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,840
but I stole them all

2393
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,840
they're all gone there's zero dads for dads

2394
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,840
they're all gone

2395
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
when there's no dads available everybody gets a zero dad score

2396
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,840
so at Jarisbat wants to know

2397
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,840
what are your most controversial

2398
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,840
and unpopular anime opinions

2399
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,840
and I brought this one up because

2400
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,840
this is the worst possible question

2401
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,840
oh my god

2402
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
no I do want to talk about it

2403
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,840
you're just fucking with us

2404
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,840
I have a good answer

2405
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,840
my controversial anime opinion

2406
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,840
is that anime is generally boring

2407
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,840
oh my god who gives a shit

2408
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,840
fine let's just hear your answer monkey

2409
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,840
what do you want to say about that

2410
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,840
I just wanted to say that I know you anime elitist

2411
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,840
would frown upon this opinion

2412
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,840
and that's why I want to bring it up

2413
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,840
it's probably because I watched it as a kid

2414
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,840
but I have a deep

2415
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,840
love for Naruto

2416
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
and I really wish that it was easier to watch

2417
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
I wish that the entire thing

2418
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,840
was dubbed in English and that somebody would

2419
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,840
cut out all of the filler episodes

2420
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,840
like if there was an abridged version

2421
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,840
that just had the important shit

2422
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,840
I would watch the fuck out of it

2423
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,840
I just love that show

2424
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,840
when I graduated college

2425
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,840
one of my friends friends that we'd hung out with

2426
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,840
he was super big into Naruto

2427
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,840
I used to read the manga back

2428
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,840
in high school

2429
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,840
and I just fell off the bandwagon because it was just so big

2430
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
and he's like alright dude

2431
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,840
I'm going to text message you over the next two weeks

2432
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,840
an entire list of all the

2433
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,840
episodes you have to watch to skip all the filler

2434
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,840
so you can get caught up

2435
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
I love that he talks like that

2436
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
he was a fan

2437
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
the game reviewer

2438
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,840
top number one

2439
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
and he did he gave me this huge fuck

2440
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,840
I don't have it anymore I wish I did

2441
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,840
was it like a hundred

2442
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,840
he's just like you can skip like

2443
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,840
20 episodes here, 40 episodes here

2444
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,840
I'm just like Jesus Christ

2445
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,840
it was funny because I didn't miss a beat

2446
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,840
it totally just flowed and I was like this is ridiculous

2447
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,840
I think there's some subreddit where they're compiling

2448
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,840
all the main episodes

2449
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
and they're cutting out the filler

2450
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,840
so if somebody can like remind me what that is

2451
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,840
I think I might waste some time watching Naruto

2452
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,840
you know there's this thing called one pace

2453
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,840
I remember I mentioned it a long time ago

2454
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,840
but there's this one pace

2455
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,840
it's exactly what it sounds like

2456
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,840
it's one piece only they cut out

2457
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,840
all the bullshit from every episode and speed it up

2458
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,840
and only leave parts that are decent

2459
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
it's like each episode is now two minutes long

2460
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,840
they're like maybe 15, 15 to 20

2461
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,840
a lot of stuff generally happens

2462
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,840
but one piece anime is garbage

2463
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
and it's such long pans all the time

2464
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,840
it's terrible they fix all that shit

2465
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,840
and leave only the important stuff

2466
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,840
that's like back in the day they had this thing

2467
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,840
all fight no filler, did you ever see those

2468
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,840
way back in early YouTube

2469
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,840
spliced together all the big fight scenes

2470
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,840
from like Dragon Ball and stuff

2471
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,840
that's funny because I don't even care about fight scenes

2472
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,840
I would rather see like okay they start fighting

2473
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,840
and immediately jump to the conclusion

2474
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,840
because I do not care about the actual fighting that happens

2475
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,840
the reason I bring it up because they had the Goku vs Frieza fight

2476
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
it was like 16 hours long

2477
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,840
and when he said the planet would blow up

2478
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,840
in 5 minutes there was like another 7 hours

2479
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,840
oh yeah

2480
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,840
that's pretty fun

2481
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,840
that's my favorite

2482
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,840
people exaggerate that

2483
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,840
after he says that

2484
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,840
it was hours of content

2485
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,840
after he says the planet will blow up in 5 minutes

2486
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,840
7 hours though

2487
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
it was something like 7 hours

2488
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,840
it was a good like

2489
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,840
third to half of the fight

2490
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,840
was after he destroyed

2491
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,840
just tries to destroy the planet

2492
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,840
there's nobody else really

2493
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,840
have a controversial anime

2494
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,840
opinion I thought it was actually a good question

2495
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:51,840
but you don't have to fucking

2496
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,840
kill yourself I like you

2497
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,840
don't kill yourself

2498
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
I have a controversial anime opinion

2499
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,840
that's kind of relevant to the last anime review

2500
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,840
yeah fuck you Nate trying to shit on that question

2501
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,840
we all like it

2502
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,840
go on

2503
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,840
Dom what do you got

2504
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,840
I think that the original full battle is way better than brotherhood

2505
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,840
I thought brotherhood was gay

2506
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,840
and I hated it

2507
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,840
what the fuck

2508
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,840
have you completed both

2509
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,840
can you tell me why

2510
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,840
without using buzzwords

2511
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,840
like it was gay

2512
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,840
yes well the main problem

2513
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,840
that I had with brotherhood

2514
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,840
was that

2515
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,840
it felt very kind of like

2516
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,840
by the books one of the things I was really interested in

2517
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,840
yeah it was by the book that's why it's better

2518
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,840
because it was based off the book

2519
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,840
well no because like the thing

2520
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
I guess the thing that I was really interested in

2521
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,840
with the original full battle

2522
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,840
is what they did with the homunculi

2523
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
and how they wanted to be human as well

2524
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,840
because it was an interesting way to like

2525
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,840
foil what Ed and Howard were chasing

2526
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,840
the entire time because they wanted to be human

2527
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,840
and they couldn't understand

2528
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,840
why the homunculi wanted to be human

2529
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,840
because they'd be like so much weaker

2530
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,840
when the fact of the matter is like

2531
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,840
their quest for being human would inherently weaken them as well

2532
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,840
so it's the protagonist and antagonist

2533
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,840
basically chasing the same thing

2534
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,840
and the way that they kind of clashed ideologically

2535
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,840
and couldn't kind of see past each other's differences

2536
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,840
even though inherently they wanted the same thing

2537
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
I thought that was a really interesting dynamic

2538
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,840
that's a pretty cool point

2539
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
I'm just like we just want to kill people

2540
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,840
these are just flat boring typical show

2541
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,840
no no no no no no

2542
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,840
greed in full metal alchemist brotherhood

2543
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,840
is the best fucking character of any show I've ever seen

2544
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
he's like the same in both though

2545
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,840
he's still a great character

2546
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,840
no he's not the same in brotherhood

2547
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,840
but greed's the best out of both of them in both interpretations

2548
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,840
and greed I would give greed more credit

2549
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
than really anybody else

2550
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
but the majority of them

2551
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,840
I really like to fact how like

2552
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,840
my controversial opinion

2553
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,840
full metal alchemist brotherhood

2554
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,840
or full metal alchemist and I don't plan to

2555
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,840
because there's I don't care

2556
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,840
that's okay that's fine don't worry about it

2557
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,840
they're not that good

2558
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,840
my controversial version of this

2559
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,840
also the Aryan race

2560
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,840
this I'm going to keep talking over you

2561
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,840
oh you told me

2562
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
how to talk over people

2563
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,840
you're going to have a puff in if you don't

2564
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,840
and I won't respect your

2565
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,840
ability to talk

2566
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,840
okay so what's your anime

2567
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,840
my anime

2568
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,840
is that I would like to watch more

2569
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,840
but they're too long

2570
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,840
and I think

2571
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,840
some of them are good

2572
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,840
but I've only watched like 7 and I don't really intend

2573
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,840
to watch anymore dude why would you say that

2574
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,840
that's too controversial for the show that's too controversial

2575
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,840
the people can't handle that kind of opinion

2576
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,840
too controversial this question

2577
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,840
sucks oh god damn it

2578
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,840
I uh

2579
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,840
do I have a fucking controversial no I don't have any

2580
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,840
and the Kirby anime is legitimately

2581
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,840
better than like

2582
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,840
3 of the 7 anime I've seen

2583
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,840
that's probably true

2584
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,840
okay Nate let's see you pick a good question

2585
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,840
you piece of shit

2586
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,840
okay here's a real

2587
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,840
question that's important to everyone

2588
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,840
okay at Eddie the Rack

2589
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,840
why is Nate so amazing

2590
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,840
yeah that's right

2591
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,840
okay so he's asking for advice

2592
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,840
why is Nate so good at picking questions

2593
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,840
it's how to deal

2594
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,840
with a family member who is a shitty

2595
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,840
commenter what do you do

2596
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,840
when you're faced with that ultimate dilemma

2597
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,840
when you have to put them down like a dog

2598
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,840
just block them and ban them from your life

2599
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,840
you gotta put them down

2600
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,840
ban them from your life

2601
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,840
ban them from their life with a fucking 9mm

2602
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,840
no no just channel ban them from your life

2603
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,840
what does that mean

2604
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
it means to act

2605
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,840
it means to act aloof and just to not

2606
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,840
acknowledge them even when they say hello

2607
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
exactly right to you

2608
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,840
well

2609
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,840
I have the fortunate

2610
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,840
ability or thing

2611
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,840
of not having any shitty commenters

2612
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,840
in my direct family

2613
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,840
in my extended family they're abundant

2614
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,840
however my direct uncle

2615
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,840
is literally not a joke

2616
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,840
like a memester on poll

2617
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,840
and talks to me about Pepe

2618
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,840
and how cool he is whenever we meet

2619
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,840
that's not a fucking joke

2620
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,840
that's awesome

2621
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,840
how old is this guy

2622
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,840
I'm just curious how old is this guy

2623
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,840
40 is like 6

2624
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,840
what the fuck

2625
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,840
actually no he's 52 actually

2626
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,840
I didn't know anybody over 40 knew what Pepe was

2627
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,840
other than like an alt right

2628
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
thing

2629
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,840
Hillary's already put down the alt right

2630
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,840
weren't you gonna come out against Pepe

2631
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,840
that's what we need

2632
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
she fucking did

2633
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
the anti defamation league came out against Pepe

2634
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,840
I want Hillary to say

2635
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,840
Pepe has got to go

2636
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,840
as an alt right

2637
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,840
fucking avatar

2638
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,840
well I don't think that was her specific

2639
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
I read articles on

2640
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,840
brightbart.com

2641
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,840

2642
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,840
are connected to the anti defamation

2643
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,840
and you know what they say about brightbart

2644
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,840

01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,840
like fools gold tism

2665
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,840
circulating they don't actually have power

2666
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,840
but they trick under tailors

2667
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,840
all across the world into thinking that

2668
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,840
they're pretty good

2669
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,840
it's the feminism stone

2670
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,840
it's probably extended canon and awful

2671
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,840
not canon guys that's not canon

2672
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,840
not fucking canon

2673
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
the only tism stones are

2674
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
fucking autism sexism racism

2675
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,840
and the other ones that I forgot

2676
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,840
well the autism

2677
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,840
appears when you summon the other six

2678
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,840
are together right there's seven total

2679
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,840

2683
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
yeah go ahead okay at tales

2684
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,840
of nerdy I want to know

2685
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,840
do you ever worry that your controversial

2686
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,840
language I think you know what I mean

2687
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,840
wink wink could hinder your

2688
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,840
YouTube or IRL

2689
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
careers I don't know what the fuck this nigger's talking

2690
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,840
about

2691
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
hinder an IRL career

2692
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,840
well you know both are possible

2693
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
especially for me I've got a real job

2694
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,840
and I do not know

2695
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
how it would be taken

2696
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,840
if these things were to be

2697
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,840
shown to the people around the office

2698
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,840
I don't know like I feel like I'm

2699
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,840
pretty much not guilty of doing

2700
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,840
anything wrong I feel like it's just a bunch of

2701
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,840
fucking jokes that we're telling online and that would be

2702
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,840
my defense it's comedy so relax

2703
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
hopefully it wouldn't be that big a deal

2704
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
you know what I've thought

2705
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,840
about this like what would happen if

2706
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,840
like someone like me you got like

2707
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,840
two million subscribers and I'm one of

2708
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,840
those big YouTubers but I still go

2709
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,840
on this show and I say nigger

2710
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,840
sometimes and it's like oh people can

2711
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,840
look up the fact that I've said this thing

2712
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,840
and then somebody might say you know

2713
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,840
try to try to cause a big stink and say

2714
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,840
this guy hypocrite said

2715
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,840
this what a hypocrite

2716
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,840
every single like

2717
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,840
news thing would say that and that's

2718
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,840
like funny but

2719
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,840
epic joke epic joke I just I don't

2720
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,840
worry about that at all because like those people

2721
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,840
aren't my audience if you give a shit

2722
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
about the thing is like fuck you the thing is

2723
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,840
I think about that like yeah it doesn't

2724
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,840
matter how big I'll get it won't

2725
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,840
you know really affect me but it

2726
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,840
I don't know well I mean

2727
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
look at PewDiePie at such a huge

2728
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,840
PewDiePie and JonTron are doing just fine so

2729
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,840
I know he's doing fine but

2730
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,840
there has been a massive like outcry

2731
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,840
against the guy that was completely unjustified

2732
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,840
and even if he's totally financially

2733
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
secure the fact that there were so many

2734
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
people online literally attacking them

2735
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,840
and well you know cyberbullying the man

2736
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,840
or whatever like that's that's not good

2737
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,840
nobody wants that and they're like that's not cool

2738
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,840
but yeah like

2739
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,840
they're they're they're

2740
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,840
retarded I mean in indirectly

2741
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,840
like so much for the

2742
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,840
PewDiePie

2743
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,840
so much for the taller and left

2744
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,840
there it is there it is

2745
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,840
indirectly PewDiePie being like

2746
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,840
labeled as a fascist Nazi

2747
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,840
and being like the top youtube guy

2748
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,840
has made a lot of like companies

2749
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,840
pull their adsense revenue

2750
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,840
from youtube they don't want to be associated with youtube anymore

2751
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
and now youtube is losing money

2752
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
and now monetization

2753
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
across the board is just going down

2754
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,840
so it's generally

2755
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,840
like it's pretty gay

2756
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,840
that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard

2757
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,840
that companies

2758
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,840
don't want to put their ads on youtube videos

2759
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
because of offensive content

2760
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,840
are they gonna fucking pull their ads off

2761
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,840
of family guy and adult swim now

2762
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,840
fucking idiots

2763
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,840
well actually I mean companies do decide

2764
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,840
what they want their commercials to air on

2765
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,840
the conspiracy right now

2766
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,840
is they're just trying to like turn youtube into tv

2767
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,840
so they're trying to get rid of like

2768
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,840
not offensive content but just like

2769
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,840
anybody because like the whole thing

2770
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
I don't know how much you buy into this but like I watch too much youtube

2771
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
about dumb things where people are just saying

2772
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,840
well the whole thing is it's a conspiracy

2773
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,840
because they're mad at PewDiePie

2774
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,840
and shit because they have more reach than like

2775
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,840
all the mainstream like entertainment channels

2776
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,840
like PewDiePie

2777
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,840
legit gets more views

2778
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,840
and like viewership and then like

2779
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,840
HBO and like CNN

2780
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,840
just regular tv so they're just like

2781
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,840
because youtube just came out with youtube tv

2782
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:27,840
I don't know if you heard about that but like they're gonna do a $35 a month

2783
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,840
cable subscription

2784
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,840
thing through youtube

2785
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,840
so they're just like oh like the same

2786
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,840
day they did that they started like trying to

2787
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,840
shut down like all these platforms like this

2788
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,840
and then like within a week like every single

2789
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,840
like news

2790
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,840
like article has come out saying like oh like

2791
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,840
youtube is awful and authoritarian

2792
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,840
and gross and we need to change it so it's just like

2793
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,840
all this just kind of lining up

2794
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
they're trying to like subtly influence it and change all this crap

2795
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,840
yeah I think it's definitely happening

2796
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,840
so the thing is

2797
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
it's gonna happen regardless

2798
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,840
the solace is like oh well

2799
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,840
even if youtube doesn't pay us

2800
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,840
we'll still have patreon but then

2801
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,840
at what point will patreon be associated

2802
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,840
they've taken out some fucking

2803
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,840
yeah like patreon is like

2804
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,840
oh we're now associated with people

2805
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,840
who make like

2806
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
like fascist content we gotta

2807
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,840
we gotta stop letting them get money

2808
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,840
and even if patreon allowed that shit

2809
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,840
like the things like the giant outcry against

2810
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,840
pewdiepie like if pewdiepie had a patreon

2811
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,840
imagine the cut he would have suffered just from

2812
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,840
people getting upset it would have been

2813
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,840
something and you know he's running a business

2814
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,840
so I he's probably got you know some

2815
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,840
level he needs to keep me I mean maybe

2816
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,840
pewdiepie is maybe not the best example but like someone who's more

2817
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,840
riding the line like

2818
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,840
like fucking dark side fill is like

2819
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,840
I don't like the guy but like he's

2820
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,840
he's on that line where he's barely

2821
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,840
getting by financially if some

2822
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,840
scandal were to emerge about like he said the word nigger

2823
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,840
and you know like people got

2824
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,840
really upset even though these things feel

2825
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,840
extremely artificially inflated like if you made

2826
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,840
a fucking joke you know whatever

2827
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
people got mad at him for it like he'd be done

2828
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,840
if his patreon shit got cut like his

2829
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,840
career would be over he'd have to go work

2830
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,840
at McDonald's if McDonald's would even hire him

2831
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,840
knowing that this is a man who once said

2832
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,840
nigger in his life can we even hire such a guy

2833
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,840
let's just let him die in the streets like

2834
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,840
here's what you're not considering Nate

2835
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,840
is that people who donate to

2836
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,840
patreons are typically people with

2837
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,840
jobs and the type of

2838
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,840
people who get offended by

2839
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,840
mean jokes on the internet are

2840
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,840
typically very liberal and those people

2841
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,840
don't have jobs so I don't think

2842
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,840
patreon is gonna be that big of an issue

2843
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,840
nobody has a job

2844
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,840
gets easily offended by things

2845
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,840
let me ask you this

2846
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,840
liberal jobless fuck

2847
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,840
all I'm hearing is that very soon there's going to

2848
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,840
be real competition for youtube

2849
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,840
and real competition for patreon

2850
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:43,840
some companies

2851
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,840
are cutting out advertising

2852
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,840
I guess I'll make a real

2853
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,840
better website that supports free speech

2854
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,840
that sounds pretty good

2855
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,840
it's like a stupid piece of shit

2856
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,840
it's funny we're talking about this because I was playing

2857
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,840
I'm doing a whole podcast and did you about this next week

2858
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,840
but the whole thing I think right now is

2859
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,840
like we're kind of having a shift back

2860
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,840
I think this whole model

2861
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,840
that we've kind of been riding this high is kind of starting

2862
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,840
to collapse where it's just like

2863
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,840
everything has become so simple

2864
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,840
it's just like oh I can just make a

2865
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,840
free channel on youtube and reach

2866
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,840
like millions and millions of people

2867
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,840
and I'll get money and it's so easy for me

2868
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,840
as a creator to just make a platform

2869
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,840
and as a viewer I go to

2870
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,840
like three websites and everything on the fucking

2871
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,840
internet basically is right there

2872
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,840
and I just think because it's becoming

2873
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,840
so centralized and like big business

2874
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,840
getting into it it's going to start becoming more

2875
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,840
homogenized and clean like traditional media

2876
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,840
and so everything that's kind of made

2877
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
these platforms interesting is going to start to

2878
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
kind of collapse under that like corporate

2879
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
weight and then and

2880
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,840
people are calling like oh we need an alternative

2881
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,840
we're going to go to vid.me and like gab.ai

2882
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,840
instead of twitter and and all that

2883
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,840
shit but the problem is

2884
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,840
like for

2885
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,840
something like youtube to work

2886
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,840
you have to be a corporation like youtube

2887
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
just the amount of

2888
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,840
money it would take to host all this videos on youtube

2889
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,840
is fucking stupidly

2890
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,840
like unimaginably large

2891
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,840
so like it's not like you can say

2892
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,840
they have server farms across the world

2893
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,840
to support all this shit you know

2894
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,840
and that's but that costs money and like

2895
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,840
so you're like of course oh I want to go to

2896
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,840
vid.me they can be the new youtube but

2897
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,840
you're going to put them in exactly the same situation

2898
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,840
youtube's in right now so they're going to need

2899
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,840
money from advertisers so the advertisers are going to

2900
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,840
come in and put down the same fucking

2901
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,840
regulations so what the solution

2902
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,840
I think is is that everyone

2903
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,840
just need to stop being a little bitch and be like

2904
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,840
fuck I'm going to have to make my own website

2905
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
I'm going to have to try hard like fucking like

2906
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,840
get an audience like the old fashioned

2907
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,840
way because I have to have control over everything

2908
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,840
if I want this freedom or have to

2909
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
toe the line and just not be who

2910
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,840
I actually want to be and make safe stuff

2911
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,840
and people are going to have to make that choice

2912
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,840
and hopefully our general internet

2913
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,840
rights will remain where they are who knows

2914
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,840
if that's going to last you know things are

2915
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,840
ebbing away little by little

2916
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,840
yeah I mean to me that

2917
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,840
that is bad

2918
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,840
I mean to me when people say people are coming

2919
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,840
out and be like the internet's under attack

2920
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,840
and like okay like yes you've lost

2921
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,840
you know you've lost

2922
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,840
privacy yes this is not actually an attack

2923
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,840
specifically on your what you can do

2924
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,840
online just you know got to be aware of

2925
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,840
that shit I but I definitely feel like it

2926
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,840
steps towards that kind of thing that I do

2927
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,840
not want and here's another little

2928
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,840
conspiratorial thing for the future so

2929
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
like just like I was like we were saying before

2930
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,840
like patreon you know would shut down

2931
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,840
accounts of people who aren't acceptable youtube could kick people

2932
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,840
and what happened but you were saying

2933
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,840
that like but individual people

2934
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,840
can still give money to patreons

2935
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,840
and like because those people

2936
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
are you know hard-working people who aren't offended

2937
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,840
easily by shit they're not you know

2938
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,840
libcucks it's not a problem but what

2939
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,840
happens when the businesses that employ

2940
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,840
those people are able to find out

2941
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,840
what pay like which patreons

2942
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,840
they their employees give money to

2943
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,840
and then fire them because they're giving

2944
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,840
money to the wrong people with wrong ideas

2945
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,840
and wrong think I wonder when we're

2946
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,840
going to get to that point hopefully never

2947
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,840
just something I think about and

2948
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,840
if we're going down the road we're going

2949
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,840
it's only a matter of time like yep

2950
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,840
that's the whole point like this authoritarian

2951
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,840
kind of imagine getting fired

2952
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,840
because you were like a patron of

2953
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,840
John Tron who is now a quote unquote

2954
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,840
racist and you know I

2955
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,840
that's I don't even think that's a stretch

2956
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,840
I think I think that's possible to happen

2957
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,840
today it's possible

2958
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
man it's possible

2959
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
my controversial opinion is that everything

2960
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,840
will be fine

2961
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,840
I'm a worrier

2962
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,840
so I like I think about these things

2963
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,840
and I do not find it easy to sit back

2964
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,840
and not worry about these things

2965
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,840
now at the risk of sounding like

2966
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,840
some weird retarded person

2967
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,840
I do have a quick devil's

2968
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,840
advocate question

2969
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,840
you always sound like that monkey

2970
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,840
everybody's concerned that

2971
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,840
your ISPN is going to

2972
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,840
sell your browser history

2973
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,840
to companies

2974
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,840
so that they can more directly advertise

2975
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,840
to you and I get the privacy

2976
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,840
angle of it but when it comes to

2977
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,840
targeted advertisements

2978
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,840
I don't see how that's a bad thing

2979
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:01,840
because personally if all the advertisements

2980
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,840
I saw were things that I actually

2981
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,840
care about I think that would be

2982
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,840
a better internet experience for me

2983
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,840
than seeing fucking advertisements

2984
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,840
for shit that I would never buy ever

2985
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,840
well you know I'm with you on that

2986
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,840
the thing with like

2987
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,840
the way it works at the moment is that

2988
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,840
it bases it off

2989
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,840
of what you've looked at

2990
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,840
and what you bought already

2991
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
and then they try to sell you more of that

2992
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,840
and it doesn't

2993
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,840
sometimes just doesn't make any sense

2994
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,840
like if you buy a DVD

2995
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,840
of something

2996
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,840
and then now Amazon is recommending you

2997
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840
the same DVD but

2998
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,840
of a different type

2999
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,840
I bought it already

3000
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,840
there's no point

3001
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,840
my biggest problem

3002
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,840
I'm not a huge

3003
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,840
I don't think people should be having

3004
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,840
all this access to my personal

3005
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,840
data I'm not a huge fan of that

3006
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,840
but I'm not freaking out like a ton

3007
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,840
of other people are because they're already doing it

3008
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,840
and there's really no way to get around it

3009
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,840
like if you're using your phone

3010
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,840
your network provider has been mining

3011
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,840
your phone for data for years

3012
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,840
you're using Windows 10 it's mining all your data

3013
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,840
you're using Chrome it's mining all your data

3014
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,840
there's no way to get around that

3015
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,840
I don't mind that so much as long as it's

3016
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,840
anonymized and that it's used

3017
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,840
for purposes that's useful

3018
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,840
I know a lot of people are getting up

3019
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,840
and arms over

3020
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,840
if you use an Android phone Google now

3021
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,840
Google monitors

3022
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,840
everything you're doing on your phone but it serves you

3023
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,840
stuff from the internet that's interesting

3024
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,840
and it'll look through your email

3025
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,840
I love Google now for when I go on flights

3026
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,840
because it'll go into

3027
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,840
my email it'll find the flights that I've done

3028
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,840
and I'll have to pull up the itinerary

3029
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,840
of me having to do shit

3030
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:43,840
so when I go to the fucking

3031
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,840
to pull my data

3032
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,840
to have a tangible impact

3033
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,840
on my life in a good way

3034
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,840
as long as it's anonymized

3035
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,840
and you're not trying to keep tabs on me

3036
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,840
that's fine

3037
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:57,840
what I kind of get pissed off about

3038
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,840
is that these companies

3039
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,840
like Verizon and AT&T and them

3040
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,840
are investing

3041
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,840
tons of money in lobbying

3042
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,840
so they can get access to all this data

3043
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,840
so all that tells me is that this data

3044
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,840
is worth fucking

3045
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,840
millions if not

3046
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,840
billions of dollars

3047
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,840
and what pisses me off is that

3048
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,840
that means that everything I do

3049
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,840
on the internet inherently has value

3050
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,840
and I'm not seeing any of that

3051
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,840
if you're going to make all of this money

3052
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,840
that's taking all this time

3053
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,840
and you're fighting tooth and nail for almost a decade now

3054
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,840
to get this data it's insanely valuable

3055
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,840
if you're going to get your way eventually

3056
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,840
and make billions of dollars

3057
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,840
I want a trickle down of that

3058
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,840
I want my internet's cost

3059
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,840
to fucking plummet

3060
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,840
I don't want to pay as much as I'm doing

3061
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,840
because if you're like literally tripling your income

3062
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,840
off of just being an ISP

3063
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,840
like fuck you you don't need to keep charging me

3064
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,840
like $100 a month drop it down to like $50

3065
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:53,840
companies tweaking legislation

3066
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,840
purely for profit

3067
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,840
circumvents the entire like

3068
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,840
economic basis of capitalism

3069
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,840
where you're supposed to give and then receive

3070
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,840
like there's supposed to be a mutual gain

3071
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,840
when through an exchange of goods

3072
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,840
but just tweaking laws to better

3073
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,840
advantage what you're trying to do

3074
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,840
doesn't engage in that

3075
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,840
and also rewards like

3076
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,840
purely corporate profit driving

3077
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,840
efforts and does not reward

3078
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,840
like actual trying to improve

3079
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,840
to give people something more of what they want

3080
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,840
which is what it's all about

3081
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,840
if it's not doing that it's not helping the system

3082
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,840
you're just forming an oligarchy

3083
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,840
essentially you're giving these corporations

3084
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,840
like governmental authority

3085
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,840
to bring this

3086
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,840
sort of back to the whole parents thing

3087
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,840
I think like I was saying

3088
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,840
kids are gonna grow up

3089
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,840
and they're gonna be like

3090
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,840
in a world that I don't understand

3091
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,840
but I'm gonna have to deal with it

3092
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,840
it's probably gonna be like the death of privacy

3093
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,840
like the next few generations

3094
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,840
they're just gonna not know what it means

3095
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,840
to have privacy

3096
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,840
and I'm just gonna have to deal with the fact

3097
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,840
that they're living in that world now

3098
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,840
and even though I don't like it

3099
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,840
that's just how it's gonna be

3100
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,840
have you guys seen that black mirror episode

3101
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,840
about the people on bicycles

3102
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:07,840
who are forced to

3103
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,840
they're forced to watch ads

3104
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,840
and if you look away

3105
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,840
you're like shocked

3106
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:15,840
but they live in a society

3107
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,840
where everyone rides bikes to generate energy

3108
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,840
to fuel everything

3109
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,840
and you earn a little currency

3110
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,840
as you ride and you can buy

3111
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,840
shit that's advertised to you all the time

3112
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,840
I'm not gonna go into it

3113
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,840
but it's a whole terrifying dystopia

3114
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,840
of nightmare where no one is

3115
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,840
you're never free

3116
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,840
you're putting these little cubicles your whole life

3117
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,840
you just treat it like a little automaton

3118
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,840
which is kind of how I view people

3119
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,840
but still

3120
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,840
doesn't look very comfortable in the future

3121
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,840
everyone's an automaton

3122
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,840
Starfleet would never say that

3123
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,840
that's being more treating people worse

3124
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,840
than Starfleet does

3125
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,840
which I fully admit to doing

3126
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,840
we solved the future

3127
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,840
we solved internet privacy

3128
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,840
and capitalism

3129
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,840
we fixed it all

3130
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,840
we also talked about dads

3131
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,840
if you care about any of this

3132
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,840
it's your duty to become a politician

3133
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,840
and change things

3134
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,840
if you don't do that then you don't care enough

3135
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,840
I agree

3136
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,840
well, not everybody can be a politician

3137
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,840
but whatever

3138
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:19,840
people who want to be politicians

3139
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,840
the people who want to be politicians

3140
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,840
shouldn't be

3141
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,840
except for Hillary

3142
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,840
because it's her time

3143
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,840
obviously

3144
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,840
and with that

3145
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,840
fucking goodbye

3146
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,840
that was episode 51 of the

3147
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,840
Procrastinator's podcast

3148
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,840
and make sure you're following us

3149
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,840
and who was the weeb

3150
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,840
subscribe to Mumkey Jones

3151
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,840
Mumkey Jones was definitely the weeb

3152
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,840
because he brought up a shitty anime question

3153
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,840
