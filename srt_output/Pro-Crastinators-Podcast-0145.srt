1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
1, 2, 3, Sink!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And one more time. 1, 2, 3, Sink!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, dope. I'll do the intro. Here we go.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm the best guy ever, and we've got a full house, ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're joined by such kooky characters as Ben Saint.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When you walk away, you don't hear me say, please, oh baby, don't go.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We've got Digibro. I'm still alive. Why?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That can be remedied. We've got Endless Jess here.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey, it's me, Bored James, and when I'm bored, I like to play some board games.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We've got Munchy wearing his tiny hats.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Guys, I don't want to alarm you, but I just found this book called The Bible,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and I think that it's got some crazy shit in it that we haven't considered up until this point.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I think we deserved, you know, old classics given the Faraday.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's not the best graphics, but I think it's got some real wicked truths in it.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How's the game feel? How's the game feel on that Bible?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Not very good. It's a hippocrit.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Damn it, hippocrit.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Uh, hi. It's me.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Uh, good. Oh, there's Tom Oliver. He's popping in and out.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You there, buddy? Tom?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Tom? Yes, it's me.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, he's having issues.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tom!

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We'll see how it goes with him.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And we're today, guys, for the first time in a million years.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're joined by an actual guest, Mr. Zen Huxtable.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I actually came here because I wanted to spite the three fans of the PCP who don't like me.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Give us their names.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know their names because I...

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Give us the names.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Stop hiding, though.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're a chunt.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Y'all get down on that old-fashioned witch hunt over here.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I just have their names plastered all over my walls.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It motivates me to get out of the house.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I mean, that's what I do with my enemy's names.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I made those dolls out of them so I can stab them.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's good.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you put a commenter's name in, like, a voodoo doll,

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is that as effective as, like, you know, DNA material or, you know...

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Imagine, like, a commenter voodoo doll with just, like, a body pillow

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
with, like, a square screenshot of a YouTube comment on it?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It only works if the comment says first.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tom, are you there, buddy?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think... No.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, we don't leave you.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Before he dropped out the first time, I heard his voice for, like...

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, me, too.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I heard him mumbling about trying to figure it out.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, shit.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is this his scheme?

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
To get on those PC pennies without doing any work,

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
technically being on the episode?

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Possibly.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I bet he'll pop up in, like, an hour as a ghostly whale,

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and we'll, you know, just deal with that as it comes.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, but anyway, people, let's get on to things

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that are happening with us and fun times going on with us.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I got you, Nate.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's got stuff. Yeah, okay.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is what I've been doing all month, is I've been...

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All three days of it?

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, fair point. Yes.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But also, for the previous month,

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is sitting around on the YouTube suggested page

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and obsessively hitting Not Interested on everything

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and, like, on, you know, blocking different channels,

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
because, like, I don't usually use the suggested page.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I usually am, like, solely in my subscriptions.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Um, but, like, it's just... there's just not enough.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's just not enough shit to watch.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I've been camping suggested, and, like, I will literally go in

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and have, like, four rounds of reloading the page,

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
hitting Not Interested on absolutely everything,

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
reloading until I find the one video that I kind of want to watch.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And I got to say, it's a nightmare.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, I was gonna ask that.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Did you think that it would work out in your favor?

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, it did. It did work.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Does it even work?

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's also a nightmare.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't understand what the goal is.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So if the thing is, if you go into the suggested tab

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and you hit Not Interested on a video,

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
it will never show up again.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And if you say Tell Us Why,

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and then you say I don't want to watch videos from this channel,

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
that channel won't show up anymore.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So it used to be that my suggested was almost exclusively channels

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was already subbed to and videos I had already watched.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have a couple of channels I'd like to hit that for.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Right, so I was just sitting there and I just...

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like all of them.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It doesn't fucking work for me.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Really?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I pressed Not Interested and it pops up like two days later.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, I was gonna ask.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Maybe it comes back.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I literally don't know what this feature is.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've never gone into a suggested page.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's like pressing the button on the crosswalk.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It doesn't do a damn thing.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It just makes you feel...

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It gives you the illusion of power.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, I believe that.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The home page?

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because I'm just talking about the home page on you.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, all right.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, I understand now.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm on the same page.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, just the suggested videos section on the home page.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And there's just like a little three dots.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can click on next to a video and click Not Interested.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But like...

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, no shit, huh?

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, if you do that enough,

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
eventually, I mean, I killed anything I was subscribed to,

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
anything I'd already seen, you know, any stuff like that.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So eventually it started recommending me, you know,

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
exclusively stuff I've never heard of before.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
However, here's the problem.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that YouTube also only recommends you shit related

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to things that you have seen.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And therefore, let's say you watch a video like,

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Endless Jess's New Video is a perfect example of this,

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
where he was talking about the Kingdom Hearts.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like how there's like 90 videos explaining Kingdom Hearts.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So as soon as you click on one of them,

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
all of your recommendations are other videos

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
explaining Kingdom Hearts.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And it's like, I already watched a video.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That was my plan all along.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
In that case, all of those had already been in my suggested

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
before I watched yours because of Nate's video.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So like, and that's the best part about this feature

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is that when you click Not Interested and it asks you why,

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and there are four options that can appear.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The first one is I've already seen it.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The second one is I don't like it.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The third one is I'm not interested in this channel.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And the fourth one is I'm not interested in recommendations

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
based on this video.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And it'll tell you what video it recommended you shit based on.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What the fuck button are you pressing where you got these options?

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I see not interested.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Save to watch later.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Save to playlist and report.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You have to click on not interested and then it gives you a prompt.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah. When you click not interested,

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh shit.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
things come up.

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So tell us why.

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tell us why.

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, this is perfect.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, cool.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I would never have even known that this was possible.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
People have been telling me this for a while

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
because I always complained about YouTube recommendations being shit

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and people were like, oh, well, you can filter them.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I was like, that sounds really time consuming.

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And it is really time consuming.

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
However, I've been doing it.

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So eventually it will kill off all the shit you've already seen.

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But like, again, the biggest problem is that it just recommends you other shit

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that's like what you've seen before.

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So if I watch like world's biggest hamburger,

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
it's like now I've got nothing but videos about possibly the same hamburger.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Like not even like another food item, but like just more on that.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I hope you're going to tell me a success story here

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
because it just seems like you're saying like,

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
guys, did you know that YouTube isn't good in a certain way?

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like, yeah, it's terrible.

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I expected more of you guys to have done this

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
because like so like literally every time I've complained about this people

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
like about the suggestions.

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Everyone's like, oh, you can just like it works super well

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
if you just delete all the stuff.

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll tell you, I subbed like I made my subscriptions my homepage

183
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and I have never looked at that's what I've always done.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It does jack shit for me.

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I get those suggestions days later.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll tell you, I did sub like six channels through this method.

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's I saw you.

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You linked that inner standing video or channel before.

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, no.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That was something that just came up in the recommendations

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and it's like another like spirit science type of thing.

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But it's like a guy who he's part of a group.

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What was it called?

196
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They were called like the energy group or something like that.

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It was just like all the elemental masters.

198
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I believe was their name.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey, I want to come back to that later.

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, I know.

201
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There's a whole bunch of channels like that.

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's a whole bunch of those weird spirit.

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Like it's like a spirituality general channel.

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like they have like the binaural beats,

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
but then they'll have vlogs by this guy and then other stuff.

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And like the video I linked you guys was just him like explaining all the big things

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in the future for their company and stuff.

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And it's like I like how it's it's inner standing as opposed to its opposite.

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Under standing or outer standing out.

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, yeah, maybe Ben, let's just jump under the shit that you were.

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Did you literally just in the middle of saying something or are you done?

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was done.

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know that.

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I got the point.

216
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think that topic hinge on the function that we have a lot more to talk about.

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, I guess what I was hoping to get you guys to talk about is like,

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I figure you all see a lot of suggest.

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I know hippo watches a lot of suggested videos.

220
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I know.

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, obviously the fact that Jesse put in his kingdom hearts video would suggest

222
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that he also sees that shit.

223
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm just wondering what you guys think about like suggested videos in general because

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
like that's the biggest way that you grow your channel is by appearing in the suggested tab.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For sure.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Kind of like I use them.

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I kind of hate them.

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know if I feel like going and like curating them super.

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm with you, Ben, but I have a slightly less like adverse reaction.

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I use them.

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not like particularly like I want to seek them out like I would never do what you're

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
doing, did you?

233
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Like I don't really want to like seek out new videos.

234
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have no reason to.

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sort of the middle between Ben and hippo where it's like,

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't like the fact that I spend as much time as I do on YouTube,

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but I don't dislike it either.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, well, let me ask you this.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm not out here to hunt for more.

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How the hell are you occupying your time?

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm doing other things.

242
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like what?

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You have an amazing.

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's always seemed to me, did you that you seem to have an amazingly large amount of free time

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that I don't understand?

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Cause I seem to have, I don't know.

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I mean, for me, it's social interaction.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I talk to people a lot.

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The difference between you and I is that your videos take a week in total time to make and

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
my videos take 10 minutes in total time to make.

251
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So that's why I have so much free time.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This even seemed to add like the height of the content machine era.

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It still seemed like you miraculously had tons of time despite producing.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I guess we're pretty easy to make.

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It was mostly vlogs.

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah.

258
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If I make a vlog or a podcast, I just like, you know, all I gotta do is hit record and

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
rant for that amount of time, throw it into Vegas, cut a little bit off the beginning

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and a little bit off the end, render it, takes less time than it takes to record the video,

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
upload it, and it's done.

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's like 15 minutes, you know?

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I mean, I guess you're right.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know, you could cut out a step by just uploading as is and then editing it in YouTube.

265
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That takes, it sucks so much.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The YouTube editor is terrible.

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The YouTube editor is terrible and it takes a while to update.

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, it takes longer than rendering a video, what I think.

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Seems that way.

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Especially with all my fucking cores and my processor, dude.

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
All right.

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Like the whole thing with like recommended videos, I had watched, like I, you know, the

274
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
part of the reason I am now currently not watching YouTube is because I was one of those

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
people who would just watch all sorts of recommended things all the time because I would usually

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
just watch YouTube on my phone in bed.

277
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So like I would, there would be like Wendover Productions who does like videos explaining

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
how flying works, like flights and the whole system of airplanes.

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I know about him.

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm all over there.

281
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, those sort of things are cool and like anything about like, you know, a lot of YouTube

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
is just Wikipedia, but as a video.

283
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's the biggest thing I've been fucking running into and it's driving me insane because so

284
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
many of them are regurgitated.

285
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
First of all, if any video says 1001 as the time code, don't fucking watch that video.

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's fair.

287
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Any video that's 10 minutes on the dot or just over, don't watch it because it's always

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
going to be insanely stretched out.

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Like every video I click on has to like, you watch a video about like some specific food

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and first they explain the concept of food, then they explain the whole history of the

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
city where the food comes from.

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But like, you know, the cursory version and then like maybe at one point there'll be like

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
a sentence of unique information in the video and then like, so I've gotten to the point

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
where sometimes I see, sometimes I just see the thumbnail and it tells me enough of the

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
story.

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There was one that was like opening a condom in a wind tunnel and like the picture is this

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
condom all inflated in a wind tunnel and I went, well, all right.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't need just a few minutes of that, you know.

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I want to see it in motion.

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm so sick of that shit.

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sick of videos that just do not have any kind of unique perspective at all that are

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
just regurgitating.

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Like there's like, there's a channel called What Culture Wrestling where like, like five

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
times a day they'll post a video about some like wrestling goss or some shit and it's

305
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
just stuff from the wrestling subreddit that everyone's on.

306
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like you can, you can set your watch to it.

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like there'll be a popular post and within like an hour there'll be a video that is just

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
regitating the post on the subreddit.

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I hate them.

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I want them to burn and die.

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I kind of feel that way.

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I kind of feel that way.

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm conflicted about it when it comes to Hippo.

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You watch or you used to watch Trainer Tips, right?

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The Pokemon Girl guy.

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He, I mean, I like him more or less.

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You know, I watch his videos.

318
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That guy actually puts effort into his videos, right?

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He does.

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He does.

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
He does.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Trainer Tips is like the Casey Neistat of Pokemon Go.

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He is exactly that.

324
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He is like, he's that on purpose.

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But like most of the information that he gives about the game, which is like half the reason

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
why I watch his stuff, probably three quarters.

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean, he just gets it from subreddits.

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Like he's not the one like doing the data mining or anything.

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And sometimes I feel like, is this guy, is this, is it fair?

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is it fair that he's like, you know, he's, I mean, I know he's curating the information.

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, it's not like he's not doing anything.

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's like the TLDR corner of YouTube.

333
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
All the reason why I watch his videos is because I like him.

334
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You know?

335
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I mean, I like him fine.

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Uh, if it were just, if it didn't have anything to do with Pokemon Go, I wouldn't watch it.

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wait, was that Ghostly Voice Tom?

338
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is he alive?

339
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I live.

340
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I live in Brazil.

341
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, okay, okay.

342
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There you go.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
All right.

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We were having issues.

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay.

346
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't try and get down recommended holes too often.

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But what I do do, which is extremely adverse to my health.

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I actually, many times in front of the show, is I go on the trending feed every single

349
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
day.

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Every single fucking day of my life.

351
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Listen!

352
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I want to talk about Good Mythical Morning and then fucking, uh, uh, Philip DeFranco.

353
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's so zoomercore.

354
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's the zoomercore thing you've ever said in your entire life.

355
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Anyway, I see, I see these videos.

356
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Zoomercore.

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
And they're like what you're describing.

358
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,500
They're just like, huh, what if we fucking deep fried a thing that was already deep fried?

359
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
What's up guys?

360
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
It's Good Mythical Morning.

361
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Like, like, I don't, I can imagine it would be gross.

362
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,860
Like most of what I'm getting, I guess this is because of the type of stuff that I have

363
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
clicked on.

364
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,620
But almost all I get is like informational videos with like very standard editing.

365
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,820
Like stuff that's like, if you took one of my videos and took a sentence from it and extrapolated

366
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,100
it to 10 minutes, that's what I get recommended.

367
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,140
Like, and it's a lot of it is like NBC and shit like that, you know, or like, uh, god

368
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,820
one of the worst is like this, what's called munchies or something.

369
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,220
Yeah, I fucking hate that guy.

370
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,860
It was just some, uh, no it was, it was mashed, that's what it's called.

371
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Mashed is like a food channel.

372
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
I think I've seen that.

373
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,700
Yeah, it's mega big, but like the videos will literally be like literally one sentence

374
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,100
of information surrounded by eight and a half minutes of video.

375
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
And then you're sitting there watching it.

376
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,140
It's not the channel that does like, really talk about like such and such a restaurant

377
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,820
is really bad for you or something.

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Just anything.

379
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
They put out videos constantly.

380
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,220
You know, speaking of channels that are really massively big and also completely worthless,

381
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
I saw a video the other day.

382
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:26,500
I didn't try to, it wasn't on purpose, but I, I ended up seeing a video by I hate everything.

383
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,660
No, I'm sorry for your loss.

384
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,020
Has there ever been a more worthless form of content than I hate everything's entire

385
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,180
channel?

386
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,020
There is like, you could like just watch an entire video of this, any video, it doesn't

387
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:49,300
matter which one there, you will not find a single unique thought anywhere.

388
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,700
Jesse, please describe to me what the content was in general because I don't know anymore.

389
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
It's been years.

390
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,660
Well, it's just like, I mean, it's like the one I watched was I hate our gaming the subreddit.

391
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,020
And first of all, right away, I see exactly what you're fucking doing.

392
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
I see through you.

393
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,540
You're just, you're making a video about hating the subreddit so that it will get big on that

394
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,540
subreddit.

395
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,140
You fucking phony, but sure, sure, but that's just moral outrage has nothing to do with

396
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,180
why I actually hate the channel.

397
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,100
It's just like, he says it's not even like a human being with an actual perspective.

398
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,020
It's just like a chronicling of how people feel about this certain topic because everything

399
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,740
he says is everything that everyone says.

400
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,740
He never says anything unique and he's not even like a good writer.

401
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,300
Like nothing he says is even funny.

402
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,340
There's never a sentence that's put together in an interesting way.

403
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,460
It's just the most fucking, it's like, it's like, I would call it vanilla, but even vanilla

404
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
is a flavor.

405
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,020
It's like, it's like the flavor of gray, like gray paste through a, through a, through a

406
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,140
tube in my mouth.

407
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,940
Like when you click on his videos, I feel like you're expecting it to be like an angry

408
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,100
vitriolic rant, but it's just like a regular ass analysis video with very bland editing

409
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
everything just slides into place.

410
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,340
There's not even any like passion in the delivery.

411
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,980
Like I don't get why it's called, I hate everything.

412
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,460
I mean, I know why it's called that.

413
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
It's a great gimmick.

414
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
It's a perfect name.

415
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,220
That name has probably elevated him more than his actual content because he has the gimmick

416
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,180
to be able to say, I hate blank on every video.

417
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,020
But like, and you know, there's tons of videos about guys who rant about things angrily and

418
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,300
you know, they're all fine.

419
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,220
They're fine because they're actually, you know, ranting angrily, but like the, oh, I

420
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,220
hate them.

421
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,620
There's just no, he's not a person.

422
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,060
He's like just, he takes things that everyone is saying and then he just repeats them in

423
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
this monotone.

424
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,860
He just is the algorithm.

425
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
He is the algorithm.

426
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
That's exactly it.

427
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,500
He's in like, his videos exist purely, I believe, so that trillions of years from now on a satellite

428
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
in a hard drive.

429
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,100
There can just be like a chronicling of like how people felt about a certain thing at a

430
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
certain time.

431
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,900
Because beyond that, beyond, beyond a purely historical perspective, there is no work for

432
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
that.

433
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,700
You've described exactly how to succeed is say, say things everyone agrees with.

434
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,500
No, that's the funny thing about it is like, that's something that I've been criticized

435
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,820
for not doing before that like, like Glass Reflection, who was the first big anime reviewer

436
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,860
on YouTube, like he literally like went out of his way to do that, to like try to have

437
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,420
the perspective that was like the most agreed upon, like to, because he thought of himself

438
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,540
as writing an objective review.

439
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,660
So like, you know, which obviously that's the correct way to do it because that's what

440
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
works.

441
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,660
None of us are fucking successful.

442
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,180
Like I know that like, I'm not trying to come off like bitter, but like I know that

443
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,580
that that's what works.

444
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,980
But personally, I find it repugnant and I like, I can't, I don't understand who would

445
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
watch it.

446
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,220
Like who is that channel for nobody?

447
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,220
It's for everybody.

448
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
It's for everybody.

449
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,300
So when you say like objective review, are you talking about like he, he, he basically

450
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,020
surveys what everyone thought and they like finds the middle ground into that or what?

451
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,860
It's not so much the middle ground is that like, let's say it's just like all the most

452
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
stated things.

453
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,540
So like generally people say that this show has really good animation, but a really weak

454
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
story.

455
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,500
Like he's just going to say like, oh yeah, the show, you know, like you're in Logan,

456
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
for example.

457
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Right.

458
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,980
And like, if, if enough, as he famously said, not to say that I don't think he agrees with

459
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,140
the things that he's saying necessarily and like, but he got into huge trouble one time

460
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,540
when he just wrote a review where his perspective was different from the majority.

461
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,380
Like, because he wrote about, uh, no, yeah, he wrote about no sake and he didn't really

462
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
like it.

463
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,420
And like just the way that he complained about it, like he got a ton of dislikes and

464
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,380
all these people were on his ass and then like, he kind of switched gears and started

465
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,980
doing like more, you know, like less of that style.

466
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,900
Just because of that, you know, like realizing, because it was also not working.

467
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
His channel was dying.

468
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Right.

469
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,100
Um, like, I'm not even mad at the person behind the channels because like, I get why

470
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
they do it.

471
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Cause it works.

472
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,380
I'm more, I'm more frustrated with the people, the audience that keeps like swallowing this

473
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,260
like, why, why does anyone like it?

474
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,340
I don't understand what's entertaining about it.

475
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,060
The reason they like it is that they want to have that timeless chronicle of what everyone

476
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
thought.

477
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Like that's how they're thinking of it.

478
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,340
Or they just want like noise to fill the void in their, in their cars.

479
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,660
I don't think that, I don't think that they're that prudent.

480
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
They don't want that.

481
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,460
And I mentioned like, there's a lot of, there's a big market for just, you know, like who's

482
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,140
going to fucking remember like what some seasonal anime or whatever it's, people want to hear,

483
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,100
Oh, there's a good anime that I can like watch this video of and feel good about being an

484
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,560
anime fan and identifying as one because even if, even if they're not even specifically

485
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,260
validating this person's experience of the show, they want to hear that like good things

486
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,780
are happening in anime so I can feel like a helpful, good, you know, member of the human

487
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
race.

488
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
You know what's fucked?

489
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,420
I want that feeling, but I can't get it cause they're all liars and or wrong or dumb.

490
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,980
You're too, you digi.

491
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,500
I mean, this is your whole thing.

492
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,620
The fact that this, this is something I definitely admire about you.

493
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,180
You will not just accept that you, you do your whole finish or fail thing.

494
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,740
You will, you have to go see it for yourself or it'll just let someone tell you it was

495
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
like good or bad.

496
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,340
I mean, that's the thing.

497
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,380
Like I think the reason people can appreciate these videos is that they just have basic

498
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,060
taste and like what it comes down to is like, if you haven't seen enough shit, everything

499
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,420
is more impressive.

500
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,940
You know, like the first time you ever see like a kind of cool, like death scene in

501
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,100
an anime, you're like, Oh my God, anime is so fucking cool.

502
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,660
I want to watch more violent shit.

503
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,660
But like, you know, it could be just some basic ass, you know, regular show that anyone

504
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,980
who really cares about the medium wouldn't care about because they're like, Oh, you

505
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,180
can get so much better violence from this show and this show and this one's got great

506
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,180
action scenes.

507
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,900
And then it's like, when you've been through all that, then you can't take the other stuff

508
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,180
seriously anymore.

509
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,780
These people just haven't.

510
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,340
And like, I've seen too much to be placated and that's why I have to be someone on the

511
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,700
speaking end.

512
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,980
But then it's, it's like, you don't have to have seen that much to be on the speaking

513
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,220
end and nobody's going to check you for it, you know, and you don't try to talk about

514
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,660
shit like this though.

515
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,980
You just like watch a show and then you say how that show like what was interesting about

516
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
it to you.

517
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,420
There's no, you're never like, Oh, 2018, great year for anime, you know, right?

518
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
That's not my wheelhouse.

519
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,580
No, like in, I hate, hate when people do shit like that, when they haven't seen everything.

520
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,580
You know, it's like, how can you make a statement like 2018 is one of the best years of anime

521
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,740
if you haven't watched every show from every year?

522
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,580
Like, I like that.

523
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,780
I don't like his reviews, but I like that YMS will release his list like that like years

524
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,260
later so he can see everything.

525
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,420
That's the biggest thing that I love.

526
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,380
I love YMS is like old like year roundups years later.

527
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,220
I have like, I never watched movies like the rare times that I like of my own volition

528
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
watch a movie.

529
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,500
It's because he recommended one in like a best of like 2014.

530
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,020
Those are what inspired Finisher failed in the first place by the way.

531
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Because his taste is so different from mine that anything he's negative about, I usually

532
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,100
want to strangle him because he's a fucking idiot, but like, but I like hearing him talk

533
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,380
about the things that he likes.

534
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
So those are the videos.

535
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,780
I just like that his taste is very consistent.

536
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,860
So you know, like if he gives a movie a super high recommendation, like, I don't assume

537
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,220
that it's going to be good for me, but I know exactly what it's going to be like.

538
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
You know?

539
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,540
Yeah, it's weird because like, I'm not even necessarily that interested in the videos.

540
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,380
I'm just interested in like the idea that someone is that interested in the medium that

541
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,460
they will watch everything from like a certain year and then like catalog what their favorites

542
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
were.

543
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
Yeah, that's crazy to me.

544
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,980
And then we get to reap the benefits of their, you know, like sorting out the cream from

545
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,940
like they spent the time and we got mixed.

546
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
You mixed your mind.

547
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
Thank you.

548
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I maybe I did bad.

549
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I did.

550
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,420
You're you're being real chaffed to me right now.

551
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,340
Everyone knows the chaff rises to the top of the cream.

552
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,980
So I'm what we know when you when you're when you're when you're threshing your milk in

553
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,740
the old milk mill.

554
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,700
What all this looking at YouTube has made me think about is the fact that like the reason

555
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,340
this is happening is that YouTube is replacing TV and people don't have enough to watch.

556
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
And that's why they're going to.

557
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,180
I don't think that people necessarily would prefer to watch these types of videos over

558
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:09,100
something legitimately good, but that they just are trying to fill as much time as possible.

559
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,300
And usually it's just going to keep recommending them the same type of shit, you know, that's

560
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
definitely true.

561
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,260
So you just get kind of trapped in a loophole of it.

562
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,780
And I do think there's a growing amount of like, like the audiences don't seem satisfied

563
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
by this.

564
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,300
Like it doesn't seem like people are happy with it.

565
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,780
But I know how to solve this problem.

566
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,300
It's not easy, but it's going to require a big push from people like me who have already

567
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,460
been pushing for this, but we need more people pushing for just broadening people's tastes.

568
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:41,140
Because if you like, let's say that you sub like 10 daily vloggers and like that's, that's

569
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,940
enough content to keep you occupied throughout each day, but it's all low effort, like basic

570
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
ass content.

571
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,020
Well, what if you follow like 500 channels that all post once a month and everything

572
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
they do is great?

573
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,540
Well, you'd be in, you know, everything you'd be watching is great and you'd have enough

574
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,940
to fill your day.

575
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,300
But like because I feel like there was a time when you could have done that.

576
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:06,500
And because of the fact that everyone's incentivized to try to be by themselves enough content

577
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,460
to fill someone's whole fucking day, that's no longer viable as an individual, you know,

578
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,700
like, so I think that if we could get the audiences to just care about a broader range

579
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:24,260
of things and to be more, you know, to just know more and maybe this, maybe this period

580
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,380
will help that happen when everyone becomes desensitized to this information when like

581
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,780
everyone fucking knows everything.

582
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,620
That's how I felt about our day I learned.

583
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,220
Everybody's got to go watch the stupid character rumble.

584
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,020
The only video that's good.

585
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,540
That's a perfect example of a great video that most people are never going to find.

586
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,940
But like, we need more people talking about what's the best stuff out there, you know,

587
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,380
you know, it's just speaking of the best stuff out there.

588
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,620
Let me talk about, you mentioned it before, a little book called Legend of the Ten Elemental

589
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Masters.

590
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,780
Do you guys know about this book?

591
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,060
You've talked about it before.

592
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Have I?

593
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Yes.

594
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Okay.

595
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Okay, well.

596
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,060
I've read it at because you own a copy.

597
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,060
In fact.

598
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Oh, right.

599
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Did I lend you my copy?

600
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Right.

601
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Oh, I didn't mean to.

602
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Well, I was...

603
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Well, for the...

604
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
All right.

605
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,500
So for the last maybe six months or so, I've been using it as like a...

606
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,220
It's been under one of the legs of my table propping my table up.

607
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,300
I've seen the way that your desk works.

608
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,780
But I recently actually purchased some table risers.

609
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,420
So I got all my great literature out from under my table legs.

610
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,820
So I had my copy free again and I was thumbing through it on the toilet, you know, like I

611
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
do.

612
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,740
And I was like, man, what a great unique piece of literature.

613
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,620
It's like nothing else that's ever been written or so I thought, but more on that later.

614
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,900
And I had reached out to Oolulilia, the guy who wrote it like months ago about like, what

615
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,060
if I recorded an audiobook of this and he never responded.

616
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,020
And then on a whim, I was like, I'm going to do it again.

617
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,220
So I contact him again and this time he responds.

618
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,100
And over the next like day, I negotiate an exclusive rights deal for the audiobook rights

619
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,780
to produce the audiobook.

620
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
And I'm doing it.

621
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,780
Whoa.

622
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Yes.

623
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,780
And it's going to be...

624
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
You are incredible.

625
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,300
You got to let the people know because people who don't know about this guy will just think,

626
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,580
okay, just some, I don't know, indie author or something.

627
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
Please let them know.

628
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,380
This is not just someone.

629
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,700
I think we've talked about Oolulilia on the show before about his website with his list

630
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
of ones.

631
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
There's a lot.

632
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I could go...

633
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
You know, there's a lot to say.

634
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
You have the Clip Notes version.

635
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Clip Notes version at least.

636
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,340
I mean, he's like a super OCD guy.

637
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,100
He's spent like, he used to be known for...

638
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:47,220
He did these extremely like hyper detailed sort of let's play like walkthroughs of like

639
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:54,060
Ultima and like Bubsy 3D and stuff and he's very strange and he was working for a long

640
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,820
time on this game called Platform Masters in which like seemingly the most important feature

641
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,100
was the extremely accurate parallax scrolling of the backgrounds as your character moved

642
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
at high velocities.

643
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,820
I would describe him as like a likable low cow.

644
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Like he's somebody...

645
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,780
He would have a Down the Rabbit hole video made about him but he is not...

647
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,380
He's never done anything shitty as far as I know.

648
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Yeah, nobody hates him.

649
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
He's not an asshole.

650
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Yeah.

651
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
He's not an...

652
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
He's in no way an asshole.

653
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,380
He's just created really bizarre things.

654
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,600
Like for instance, in this book that Ben is talking about, every time an object is described,

655
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,460
the hexadecimal color, like the hex code for whatever color that object is is placed

656
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,380
in the text and is that color?

657
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,780
Like it is colored that way.

658
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,300
So like you got hex codes constantly.

659
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,380
The power systems are like extremely detailed.

660
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,980
There's like a whole infographic about how flight works.

661
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,220
Yeah, like it's like how characters move their arms, it's like how does a character

662
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,220
move their arms and like what does a different arm motion mean?

663
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,620
Like in terms of like pitch and yaw of like the angle of their flight and stuff.

664
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,860
And like he'll describe time stopping Final Fantasy style for an extended like spell animation

665
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,780
to play out and then he'll describe like a green, like a red like damage number with

666
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:16,380
like in scientific notation like popping out and he'll say like the number bounces three

667
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,700
times like a ball.

668
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,500
The number is in the Tahoma font, but narrower.

669
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:27,380
It is size 168 and half an inch thick or whatever.

670
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:33,340
And fuck, I forgot what I was going to say because that was too funny.

671
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
It's really fucking weird.

672
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
It's unique all right.

673
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,100
So I did, I recorded one take, okay.

674
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,700
He gave me, he authorized me to release.

675
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,420
If you get into bed with this man, considering the level of OCD he has, what kind of demands

676
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:52,620
are going to be made on you to meet his very particular, you know, style or requests?

677
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,140
You know, funny and he actually told me that he doesn't really care that much about Legend

678
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,940
of the Ten Elemental Masters anymore because he's actually got a new book that I don't

679
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
think anyone's heard of.

680
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,620
He's got a new book called Secret in the Basement.

681
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,300
And one of the ways that I cajoled him into letting me like Jesse.

682
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,180
And it's written by R.L.

683
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Stein.

684
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,300
It is also, I don't know much about it.

685
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,700
It's also an RPG based book, so I'm sure it's very interesting in that way.

686
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,860
I ordered a copy, but I haven't read it yet.

687
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,060
It's still being shipped to me.

688
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,300
Oh, so it's actually out?

689
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Well shit.

690
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,300
It is.

691
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Yeah, yeah, and nobody knows about it.

692
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,780
And I told him like, Hey, you know, if I do this, like this audio book, like I will

693
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,460
plug your new book in it and like, I don't think a lot of people know about it.

694
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,300
So like, you know, people who like the first one, they'll find out about this new one.

695
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,620
Maybe this is patronizing and I don't mean to insult the man by saying this, but like

696
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,540
ever since maybe this is like underestimating him.

697
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,500
But like ever since I heard you, you tell me about him initially and like, he sounded

698
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,380
like a weird freak, like an OCD guy who would just be a burden on his parents and everyone

699
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,380
around him.

700
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,380
But then like you told me that like there was a time in his life where he decided he

701
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,180
needed to like pull his own weight and like not burden his parents.

702
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:07,420
So he wrote Legend of the Ten Ella Masters like to sell to help like support his family.

703
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,700
And I was like, now I like this guy officially.

704
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,380
Yeah, the reason the reason he published the book at all was like to, you know, pay his

705
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,500
parents back like some rent.

706
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Good man.

707
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,020
So he could like, yeah, because like he couldn't live on his own because he's pretty messed

708
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
up or he wasn't.

709
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I think he's better now.

710
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,460
I think he's gotten over a lot of his hyper OCD tendencies.

711
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
That's good.

712
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,540
He published it to make money to like to help support his parents or whatever.

713
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Anyway, God's being a superhero.

714
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,580
It doesn't sound like like a long cow.

715
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,380
He sounds like the next step in human evolution.

716
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
His fucking website.

717
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,260
I love his phobias, by the way.

718
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,780
My favorite thing about you on there is fears.

719
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,140
Yeah, you find his website fears.

720
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,060
A lot of those are outdated, but at the time he was like the list of like his fears of

721
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,940
all his the best pages, all his dreams page, because the life page, it literally ranks

722
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,500
them by like how capable he is, how much he wants to do it, why he like wants to do

723
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,900
it, and what like how likely he thinks it is that he could do it.

724
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,660
And like, there's some stuff in there that he doesn't even want to do.

725
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,060
Like there's stuff that his yeah, wanting to do it ranking is like not at all, but he

726
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,100
has it on his bucket list because I guess he just thinks he should.

727
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Yeah.

728
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,140
And it'll be stuff that he learned about on travel shows and stuff or like become like

729
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,020
like do a boxing match.

730
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,940
And it's like, I have no desire to do this.

731
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,300
And I don't think I'm capable.

732
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,660
It'll probably never happen.

733
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,180
But here it is on my bucket list.

734
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,940
He cataloged like thousands of his dreams.

735
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,180
He had a he had like a long D dream diary that I never read.

736
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,100
I think the website's down, but like I'm sure it's archived somewhere.

737
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,700
And he's he will like update how he like conquered some of those fears where like he had a fear

738
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,780
of open water, but he spent like years conquering it.

739
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,820
Yeah, that's great.

740
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,060
He's he's got a job now.

741
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,980
Yeah, he works at Walmart.

742
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,540
They're good.

743
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:54,940
Great.

744
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,380
Yeah, one.

745
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,100
OK, I guess the last thing about that is that so I recorded a take.

746
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,980
OK, he authorized me to put to do the first two acts and put them on YouTube.

747
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,620
So the first two acts of the audiobook are going to be on my channel.

748
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,220
And then he didn't want the rest of it released for free.

749
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,060
But he said we talked about like recording the full audiobook and like releasing it

750
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,900
through like Audible or something like that.

751
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,420
So that's the plan.

752
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,980
The first two acts are going to be on my channel and really, really stoked.

753
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,700
I recorded the I did a take yesterday, but I didn't like it.

754
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,340
I rerecorded it and I included the hex codes.

755
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,620
The first god didn't.

756
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,100
Yeah, the first take did not include the hex codes.

757
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,260
And I was like, no, fuck it.

758
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260
I need to preserve the author's vision.

759
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,540
So I included the hex codes, doing all the voices.

760
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,340
It's really fun.

761
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,740
And you are I have I have the whole audio for the first two acts done.

762
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,060
And I was editing it until this podcast start.

763
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,940
I'm going to go back to ten tangentially related.

764
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,620
But I actually made an audio book a few days ago of a sideways stories

765
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,700
from wayside school. Oh, dude.

766
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,100
A book that I love for my childhood.

767
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,420
I think was I telling you about that munchie?

768
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,460
Was I talking to you about sideways stories by Lewis Sacker?

769
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,220
If you did, it was in one ear at the other.

770
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,340
I was talking about that to someone.

771
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,860
Yeah, that's a shame, because it's a great book.

772
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,500
It's a great series. It's awesome.

773
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,100
It is. Did you ever read?

774
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,780
Did you ever read the, like, math puzzles, like side series?

775
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,180
No, I didn't know.

776
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,060
I wasn't even aware that was a thing there.

777
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,540
Yeah, I had a couple as a kid.

778
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,940
They're like, um, it's it's it's, you know, it's like the teacher.

779
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,380
God, I forget the teacher's name.

780
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,500
Miss Jules, I know that kind of just read it.

781
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,420
Yeah, like it's like Miss Jules, like, OK, she'll write like a math thing

782
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,020
on the blackboard and be like, who can solve this math puzzle?

783
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,180
But it's not actually a math puzzle.

784
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,180
It's actually like a like a hidden letter.

785
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,660
Like you have to, like, decode the letters in the math and like or something.

786
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,260
I don't know. I'm apprehensive.

787
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,220
But is this like a game or is it a book?

788
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
It's like a puzzle book. Yeah.

789
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh, yeah.

790
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,420
Zen, yeah.

791
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,100
Yeah, why did you post that on your side channel instead of your main channel?

792
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,180
Do you want me to post on my main channel?

793
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,300
I'll do it. I'm just curious.

794
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,180
I'm curious about the logic.

795
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,100
I'm curious. Why did you record an audio book of sideways stories?

796
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,220
Well, obviously, I want to clutter up his illustrious channel

797
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,980
with such masterpieces like why victorious is a hidden gem and whatnot.

798
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,220
Yeah, exactly.

799
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,380
Why Dan Schneider is my idol and my guide, you know, such other pop.

800
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
I love. Yeah.

801
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,700
No, Zen, what what made you what made you record this?

802
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,780
What what what could possibly possess you?

803
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,380
I think it literally just popped up in my mind.

804
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,140
So I was like, OK, let me just look it up on Google and see if there's a PDF.

805
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,620
And there was. So I was like, people need to know about this.

806
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,540
But apparently not enough people to put it on my main channel for some reason.

807
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,460
So well, maybe I will know.

808
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm curious about the logic because, like, for me, the logic has begun.

809
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,500
Do you have the rights to do that?

810
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,780
Well, well, I'm not monetizing it.

811
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,140
Is that OK? That's probably fine.

812
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,100
I would imagine. Maybe.

813
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,860
Question mark. I think I suppose theoretically they might object on the grounds

814
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,460
that like you've made that information of that book available without purchase.

815
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,420
But they can't. I don't know.

816
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,580
You know, I'm not worried about.

817
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,420
I knew like I knew that I could, you know, do Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.

818
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,220
Like I could record it and put it on my channel and get away with it.

819
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,460
Like I knew the guy wasn't going to sue me or anything.

820
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,180
Well, but I just I just wanted I just I just wanted his like I wanted to be able

821
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,660
to say like, yeah, this is official.

822
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,540
This is like endorsed by the creator.

823
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,660
This is this is the real shit.

824
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,780
Well, plus now it's not it's not as though you're just doing it of your own accord.

825
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,060
Now it sounds like there's a deal be brokered here.

826
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,980
Now now you are in bed with them and now you are best friends.

827
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,700
Ben is really you.

828
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,900
I would you're best friends.

829
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,940
Yes, you're carving yourself out, Ben.

830
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,580
A fascinating niche as like internet cryptid connoisseur.

831
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,300
This was this was always kind of my thing.

832
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,140
Like I always love. Yes, you always love.

833
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,620
I loved I had that book by like, oh God, caffeine killed my family.

834
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,580
Yes, by what's her face?

835
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
I don't remember her name.

836
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,820
It was like it was like caffeine killed my family.

837
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,780
The best free cure since Jesus Christ himself.

838
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,460
It's like and it's like it's a little paperback book.

839
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,700
And half of it is like weird anecdotes about how people die if they drink coffee.

840
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,860
And then the rest, the other half of the book is just a list of food items

841
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,700
and how much caffeine is in them.

842
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,180
And it's full, it's full of stories like, so my grandfather drank a coffee a day

843
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,220
and he died at 60.

844
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,780
My father drank two coffees a day and he drew and he died at 30.

845
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,060
So, you know, because he drank twice as much coffee, he died twice as early.

846
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,580
That's why you know that coffee is going to kill you.

847
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,340
You know, I feel I feel for this guy's troubled life.

848
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,180
Funny, because it was a woman.

849
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,300
The guy who died at 30 was run over by a car.

850
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,740
That's how he died.

851
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,940
Yeah, nothing to do with the coffee, but wasn't it though?

852
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,140
Are we sure about that?

853
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,420
No, maybe it's like a sin leader or something.

854
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,180
The most interesting parts of this group's daily life are the parts

855
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,460
that aren't talked about in the podcast a lot, where, Ben, you are in league

856
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:16,700
with many, many people that I would just find that we could discuss like an entire episode about.

857
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,500
Like, I really like that, because when I see a channel that's done something

858
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,940
that I would have done, I'm just like, oh, man, well, I guess back to the drawing board.

859
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,340
And Ben's like, I got to contact that guy and collaborate.

860
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:38,820
Like, sometimes, like I like I made I made friends with low art, and I'm on a I'm on a podcast with him now.

861
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,100
That'll probably be out by the time this video is out.

862
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,340
You know, a long run podcast, like a series?

863
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,260
Well, I know I was I was the first guest on his new movie podcast, The Low Cast.

864
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,100
Low Art is a guy, I think he's at like 40 K subs.

865
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,220
He did his break, he did one with Full Metal Alchemist.

866
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,900
But his breakout hit was like a full series overview of Teen Titans,

867
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,700
where he went through like episode by episode being it was called is Teen Titans

868
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,620
2006 as good as we remember.

869
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,340
I remember that. Yeah. Yeah.

870
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,180
It was pretty much the inspiration for my my Poo series.

871
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,740
I was going to ask. Yeah. Yeah.

872
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,700
Yes. More overall.

873
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,220
Thank God. I was worried. I hope I watched the I watched the whole Teen

874
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,780
Titan series because I love Teen Titans as a as a youth.

875
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,980
And it seems like, yeah, it holds up.

876
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,660
Yeah, I remember it being really well.

877
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,700
Yeah, show. Oh, it has a cliffhanger ending.

878
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,340
Yeah. Yeah.

879
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,860
Ending that never gets solved because that stupid terror episode right at the end.

880
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,380
And yeah. Yeah. Right.

881
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,060
Where she remembers. It'll get resolved, though.

882
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,860
I mean, it'll they'll make they'll bring back Teen Titans.

883
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,860
You think they'll bring it back?

884
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,820
I know the question is because even if they bring it back, it will be about that.

885
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,060
Yeah. But will we be happy with what they think the story

886
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,220
about that because they tease it at the end of the Teen Titans go movie.

887
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,580
Yeah. I saw it in theaters.

888
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:59,780
I didn't try. I mean, that was that was always my thing

889
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,980
because people were always, you know, people have been whining for years and years

890
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,060
about Teen Titans go and I've been saying for years, you idiots.

891
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,460
Teen Titans go is going to bring back the original series.

892
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,900
Just be patient, you fucking morons.

893
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,740
It's a hugely popular show.

894
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,860
It's making the characters popular again.

895
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,260
Yeah. But but if it's more popular than the old one,

896
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,220
doesn't that mean that, like, don't go back to the old one?

897
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,580
Well, you got to remember, you can get into two different wallets this way

898
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,780
because like the kids who want the original, the people complaining about it

899
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,460
only prove that there's a huge audience for the old shit.

900
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,380
Like, I always knew they'd bring it back and I was right.

901
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,180
I'm always right. It's just a curse.

902
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,100
I never thought I'd like Teen Titans go fine.

903
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,180
I don't hate it or anything.

904
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,620
But I would never have thought that they would bring the old one back.

905
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,060
But if they do, I'll be I would really like it.

906
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,100
I want to know what the fuck's up with Tara.

907
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,140
Was she Tara? Was she a look alike?

908
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,420
Was she brainwashed? Was she just pretending?

909
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,140
Was she in the witness protection program?

910
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,140
We just don't know.

911
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,940
I think she was pretending.

912
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,700
I'm going to that's my that's what I does it.

913
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,700
Does it even matter?

914
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,140
Like, frankly, who cares what happened to Tara?

915
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,500
She's, you know, clearly she's alive.

916
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,940
And does it like all that matters is the emotional stakes of Beast Boy,

917
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,460
which I did kind of care about, admittedly.

918
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,020
I'm just in it for the shipping.

919
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,780
I want Beast Boy to get over Tara.

920
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,100
I want Raven to get that sweet green dick.

921
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,580
I want to see it.

922
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,180
It's I've been waiting for it for 20 years.

923
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,300
Nate, I don't I don't understand how you can say that.

924
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,860
It's so weird and mysterious the way that she's just there

925
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,220
and acts like she doesn't know him.

926
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,540
And like, don't you want to know why?

927
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,900
OK, because like because like going on, I think she's so traumatized

928
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,620
that she's just she wants to be done with it.

929
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,940
So she's just telling him, hey, man, I mean, I'd like to know.

930
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,260
I'd like to know the answer.

931
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,780
I guess I guess I don't know.

932
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,460
I'd take more. I'd take more.

933
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,140
Yeah, sure.

934
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,900
I don't think anyone's opposed to having more Teen Titans, right?

935
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,180
I will be very critical, though,

936
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,460
if like they're bringing like new people to make it.

937
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,020
Because, you know, lower.

938
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,900
Lowered is doing a new series about young justice,

939
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,660
but I never watched young justice.

940
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,300
So it's not as good.

941
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,100
I'm sure that like every comment on every video

942
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,060
he made about Teen Titans was, do no young justice next.

943
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

944
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,140
Relatively the spiritual successor, I suppose.

945
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,020
I'm always blown aback by how many cartoon shows

946
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,620
people have seen before in their lives.

947
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,700
I don't know if I talked about this before,

948
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,300
but there was a period where I banned cartoons for my life

949
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,060
and an attempt to become an adult, which were too great.

950
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,540
Yeah, yeah, that's when you that's when you look at him now.

951
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,900
Yeah, that's why he that's why he became huge.

952
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,780
That's why he was like six foot eight at 13 years old

953
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,660
because he stopped watching cartoons.

954
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,180
Ironically worked.

955
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,220
But anyway, I always feel like there's been like a real depth

956
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:55,140
or dearth, I think is the right word of like traditional TV shows

957
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,340
that I've consumed and like traditional

958
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,980
dearth means a lack of, by the way.

959
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,180
Yes, I know.

960
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Yes, it is the right word.

961
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,940
I thought it was the opposite of that, but OK.

962
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,580
No.

963
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,460
So there's not a lot of things that I've seen.

964
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,380
So I haven't like seen, you know, 20 fucking television shows.

965
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,540
Watch the Sopranos.

966
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,700
I can remember like Flapjack.

967
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,700
I can remember Chowder and, you know,

968
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,940
you asked me to name five more and I can't do it.

969
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,500
Like I don't remember.

970
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,540
I feel the opposite.

971
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,300
Holy shit.

972
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,740
How early on did you put this ban on cartoons as soon as I knew

973
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,540
when an adult was fucking hilarious because I have the exact

974
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,260
opposite experience of I have never had any interest in anything

975
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,860
that wasn't a cartoon.

976
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,140
So like, but I also like, I am more inclined to.

977
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,940
It's not that I had anything against cartoons.

978
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,180
It just was that they were kids shit and I had.

979
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,500
Doesn't Homestuck count?

980
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,540
Well, that's why I mean, that's a huge part.

981
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,260
Well, no, I saw I saw live action shows as like four adults.

982
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,900
So I didn't watch them.

983
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,820
And then when I grew up, I realized that they were just shitty

984
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,340
and that I was right all along.

985
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,020
I never drew like a hard line between cartoons

986
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,500
and live action stuff.

987
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,900
But Digi, I was I was way more in your said, like, I as a kid,

988
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,420
I was not like, oh, I want to be an adult.

989
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,500
Like I wanted to stay a kid.

990
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,260
I fucking resented the idea that I would ever be an adult.

991
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,980
I was like, yeah, people used to tell me like, oh, one day

992
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,300
you're not going to like toys anymore.

993
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,980
And I'd be like, fuck you.

994
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,420
I'm fucking hoarding all my toys.

995
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,100
I don't give a shit about toys anymore.

996
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,940
So I also ended up liking girls, which I said I wouldn't.

997
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,620
But that's too bad.

998
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,060
Oh, fuck.

999
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,940
I had the same reaction to you, but only because I

1000
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,860
was already an adult.

1001
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,140
I said, what do you mean I'm going to grow up and not like it?

1002
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,500
Because I'm already grown up.

1003
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
What do you mean?

1004
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
I already know.

1005
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,540
I feel like the opposite of the same stuff.

1006
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,220
They're not saying that I've not cartooned specifically.

1007
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,220
It's all media for my childhood.

1008
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,740
I'm not connected to it in the same way

1009
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
that people can point it.

1010
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,740
Like, oh, remember Fillmore?

1011
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,460
Remember Disney Channel's Fillmore?

1012
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,060
And like, what the fuck is the Disney Channel?

1013
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,260
Yeah, it's weird because I somehow miss Fillmore.

1014
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,620
Didn't we talk about Fillmore last episode?

1015
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,620
Yes, you did.

1016
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,420
It's like a thing that I saw one episode.

1017
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,940
It's about a black guy.

1018
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,300
I don't know, but I caught like one episode of it ever.

1019
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,820
And I thought it was the coolest shit.

1020
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,740
And then I never saw it on TV again.

1021
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,420
And I was like, what the fuck was that show?

1022
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,140
It's been making the rounds on YouTube

1023
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,700
because there's just one quote where this girl is like.

1024
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,460
The chicken, right?

1025
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,220
Or the turkey?

1026
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,820
Yeah, the girl's trying to swindle him.

1027
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,820
And then he sees past it.

1028
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,220
And then he's like, and by the way, Penny,

1029
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,660
that chicken was dry, real dry.

1030
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,540
That's right, I know about this show

1031
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,900
because I started watching Black YouTube.

1032
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,700
And I have two actually, we can bond over that.

1033
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,580
Yeah, well, did you see it?

1034
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,300
Because there was a video that was a how to black.

1035
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,900
Yep, I watched an exact same video maybe three hours ago.

1036
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,380
Maybe that's why Fillmore is making the rounds.

1037
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,300
It's pretty entertaining.

1038
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,780
Is that a video?

1039
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,260
I need to get to watching that video

1040
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,860
because I don't know how to black.

1041
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,060
The funny thing about it, then, is that it's stylistically

1042
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,260
very similar to your videos.

1043
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,940
Unironically, it feels like a Zenhux-table video almost.

1044
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,340
It reminded me of Fillmore and reminded me

1045
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,300
that I had always wanted to see more Fillmore.

1046
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,060
But I just, because this was like, I didn't have like,

1047
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,780
I wasn't internet savvy when I was a little kid

1048
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,740
and I saw it on TV.

1049
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,260
To clarify, by the way, for Zen,

1050
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,860
it's not about how to be black.

1051
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,660
It's about how to write black characters in the video.

1052
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,300
Yeah, I know.

1053
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,700
That was a joke.

1054
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,100
Yeah, Zen, you need a fucking lesson.

1055
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,860
I don't even know what it's like.

1056
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,860
I got a white splay here.

1057
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,420
You don't know what it's like to be a black man.

1058
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,220
I'm like, it's name only.

1059
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,420
I mean, one more, this is one more account

1060
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,940
of how YouTube just gives me the same shit.

1061
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,900
Because as soon as I watched that, it was like all,

1062
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,300
like, I got tons of black YouTube and like, tons of,

1063
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,020
just like, because of your videos,

1064
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,100
I keep getting these fucking Steven Universe analysis

1065
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,940
and I'm like, stop.

1066
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,940
Oh, I only made one.

1067
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,780
That's terrible.

1068
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,700
I made one.

1069
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,020
That's terrible.

1070
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,580
Don't go down that.

1071
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,900
I thought that I had been right.

1072
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,340
I have the reputation of being like,

1073
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,500
ooh, Steven, you character design suck.

1074
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,860
I made one fucking video on it.

1075
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,780
Jesus Christ.

1076
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,940
Well, my recommendations are because of your video.

1077
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,260
No, it's not.

1078
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,940
So I thought that I had been recommended How to Black

1079
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,780
because I watched that guy, Jack St.

1080
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,780
And he had a couple of videos that were like,

1081
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,180
it was like looking, okay.

1082
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,020
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1083
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,340
FYI, I searched ZenHuxdable in YouTube.

1084
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,740
The second result is ZenHuxdable Steven Universe,

1085
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,780
I swear to God, just saying.

1086
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,060
Susan Wojcicki, she fucking hates me.

1087
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,140
Is that, no, I'm thinking of Sarah Z.

1088
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,300
And by the way, the name of the video

1089
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,420
is Stop Making Excuses for the Visual Inconsistencies

1090
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,460
of Steven Universe.

1091
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,540
So I think I get.

1092
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,420
That's not the one I was getting recommendations though.

1093
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,340
It's because of his Lily Pete response thing.

1094
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,580
Ah, okay, that's the one.

1095
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,820
My boy Lily Pete, yeah.

1096
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,660
Still kicking it.

1097
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,380
You can't say that, you can't, be careful.

1098
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,980
I didn't mean to do that, guys.

1099
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,380
Okay, look, this is fair, there's a lot of Pete.

1100
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,380
You're just cool, there's gonna be a two hour video

1101
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,580
on us now.

1102
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,420
I just wanna fuck this.

1103
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,020
I mean, let's be frank, it would be easier to preserve

1104
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,380
the idea of Lily Pete as a woman in your mind

1105
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,220
if you don't watch the videos

1106
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,020
and hear a male-sounding voice coming at you

1107
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,940
for hours and hours and hours, you know?

1108
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,540
Oh, let's not, let's not.

1109
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,180
Yeah, no, I just stood in front of the mirror.

1110
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,900
There's people like, what the what, for example,

1111
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,460
who have a girl avatar, who definitely,

1112
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,180
I'm pretty sure they're not trans or whatever,

1113
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,820
but they just have a girl avatar.

1114
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,780
That's the same thing Lily Pete does,

1115
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,540
only I guess Lily Pete is legitimately trans or something.

1116
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,820
How am I supposed to know the difference?

1117
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,980
I just had this picture of Lily Pete on my wall

1118
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,420
and I just kept on repeating girl, girl, girl, girl, girl,

1119
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,860
girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl.

1120
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,620
Your enemy's on your wall, just like me, I knew it.

1121
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,380
You're more like fucking silly Pete.

1122
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,340
Stephen, your personality isn't fear-aided,

1123
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,620
it makes me so mad because every single video

1124
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,060
is either like, there's no normal porridge,

1125
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,860
there's no just right video, it's all just like,

1126
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,820
I see, I hear what you're saying,

1127
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,420
and I think I agree with you,

1128
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,620
but you're just so fucking rude and stupid and gay.

1129
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,140
I made one, I made multiple.

1130
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,540
Yeah, I was gonna say, I like Jesse's,

1131
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,380
I remember liking Jesse's.

1132
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,700
I don't remember, but.

1133
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,540
Here's the, here's the.

1134
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,700
I made the one, I made the one Steven Universe video

1135
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,140
that was a parody of all the shit.

1136
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:25,500
Yes, yes, and it was so spot on, it was so spot on.

1137
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,580
Even before that, I made a video about one of the seasons,

1138
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,180
a serialized video, in fact, if anyone remembers that old

1139
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,820
series, it did like a real review on the season of Steven Universe.

1140
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,300
I wanna know what Hippo was gonna say

1141
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,660
because he had the chance to speak at all.

1142
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,100
Oh yeah.

1143
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,900
Oh no, I had nothing to say, I was just trying to fit

1144
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,980
a zinger in there.

1145
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,300
Oh no.

1146
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,980
Well no, Gib was right, the only review

1147
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,860
that you need to make is that Steven Universe is good,

1148
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,060
and I basically agree.

1149
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,380
Yes, I've wished.

1150
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,980
Season one recently, and the beginning of season two,

1151
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,820
season one is perfect.

1152
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,340
For anyone not privy to my content,

1153
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,420
I just wanna establish that I don't hate Steven Universe.

1154
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,260
Okay.

1155
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,620
You just hate women, lesbians, gay people.

1156
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,940
Absolutely, thank you.

1157
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,300
Thank you for the elaboration.

1158
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,780
I bet if you did that, I bet if you just,

1159
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,580
I bet if you just made a video called Steven Universe is good,

1160
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,140
and you just said like, the reasons the show is good,

1161
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,340
and didn't even mention the reasons anyone hates it,

1162
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,980
you would get massive thumbs down,

1163
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,820
you would be like downvoted to oblivion,

1164
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,940
people would come, we're gating the video,

1165
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,620
calling you a piece of shit in a cock

1166
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,420
and a libtard propagandist.

1167
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,740
That's an experiment that I wanna run.

1168
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,580
There's something that's going on around the viewer.

1169
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,420
I'm gonna make that video.

1170
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,380
Steven Universe is good, the video.

1171
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,540
I have a video from way back in the day

1172
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,860
about Steven Universe, where it was universally popular.

1173
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,700
I mean we just did episode.

1174
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,860
I don't remember any huge blowback from it,

1175
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,140
but maybe it's because it was before the storm.

1176
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,220
I think the worm has turned.

1177
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,140
I think the worm has turned on Steven Universe

1178
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,940
and it's become popular to shit on it.

1179
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,500
It's really funny that he said that, Jesse,

1180
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,340
because the people who are shitting on the show

1181
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,980
the most right now are SJWs.

1182
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,420
Like, they are shitting on the show

1183
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,940
because they're insisting that it's like,

1184
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,380
I've said, I've said for a long time

1185
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,420
that Steven Universe is not gay enough.

1186
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,860
Well, no, it's not that, they're saying that it's like,

1187
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,820
oh fuck, does that mean you can explain this better

1188
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,740
than I can? They're not biologically female,

1189
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,700
they are fucking light holograms, they don't even fuck.

1190
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,100
Okay. Well, everyone's an SJW.

1191
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,340
I mean, most of the videos I see are by alt-right SJWs.

1192
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,180
Well, that's true.

1193
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,020
Saying the show's too gay.

1194
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,620
Basically, the gripe that people were having

1195
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,140
with the show is that the messaging was like,

1196
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,940
this is a fascist like the diamonds.

1197
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,900
And basically, the gripe that people had

1198
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,700
was that the text in the show was

1199
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,020
that they were being forgiving to fascists.

1200
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,620
Ah, okay. I think so, fucking man.

1201
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,220
God, I hate people who care about shit.

1202
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,620
I just fucking, I'm so sick of people thinking

1203
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,700
that their opinion matters on anything.

1204
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,540
Hey, guys, Kingdom Hearts 3 has a lot of cool stuff.

1205
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,380
I really like it.

1206
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,620
Oh, wait, before we go on that, I wanted to say something.

1207
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,420
I wanted to say that the reason I thought

1208
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,140
I got recommended How To Black

1209
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,540
was because I had been watching this guy, Jack St,

1210
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,460
who did a, he did two videos.

1211
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,140
Well, that's for the bonus episode,

1212
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,660
we'll talk about that maybe.

1213
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,140
But Jack St, he did these two videos looking at like,

1214
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,260
black.com is unique quality content.

1215
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,860
90s, like gender, like trans representation,

1216
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,860
or like, or no, gay in stuff representation

1217
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,500
in 90s media, because the feeling,

1218
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,700
like the sentiment is that the 90s was full of cartoons

1219
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,580
and stuff that had lots of like gay representation.

1220
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,580
So he went back and he looked through it.

1221
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,940
And basically the conclusion was like,

1222
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,700
with only a couple of exceptions,

1223
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,060
like yeah, there are characters who are like coded gay,

1224
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,580
but they're all, like almost all of them

1225
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,700
are like the butt of a joke.

1226
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,940
And it's not really, yeah, like it's not really,

1227
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,620
it's not really as progressive as people tend to remember.

1228
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,580
They're in the show, but like,

1229
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,700
how are they being portrayed?

1230
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,100
People think they were gay characters in 90s cartoons.

1231
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,220
I don't remember that ever, in my case.

1232
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,900
To be fair though, when they say that,

1233
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,060
they mean like him from Powerpuff Girls.

1234
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,300
Okay, sure, when you're on the mark.

1235
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,100
Who is literally Satan also.

1236
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,380
I'm pretty sure that him is just supposed to,

1237
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,100
him is just like supposed to be the Rocky Horror character.

1238
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,780
Yeah, he's Tim Curry, he's just Tim Curry or whatever.

1239
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,860
Well, yeah, he's like a combination of.

1240
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,900
How much more fucking coded gay can you get?

1241
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,060
That's not coded gay though.

1242
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:23,700
That's just a sweet transvestite from trans fucking Fabania.

1243
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,260
He's like a bisexual or something.

1244
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,700
It's not coded at all, it's right there.

1245
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,940
I mean, it's all in the same melange.

1246
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,620
Well, I'm just trying to say that like.

1247
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,780
Fuck that boy pussy.

1248
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,260
The point of it is not that he's like gay

1249
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,660
and that's why he's evil.

1250
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,820
I think he's just a combination of Tim Curry's Labyrinth

1251
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,420
and Rocky Horror characters, you know?

1252
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,700
You mean, it wasn't Tim Curry in Labyrinth, it was,

1253
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,540
was it Bowie?

1254
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,380
David Bowie was Bowie, yeah.

1255
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,540
Tim Curry plays the devil in that, doesn't he?

1256
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,380
It's not Labyrinth,

1257
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,940
but I know you're talking about it, something.

1258
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,780
Is it Labyrinth?

1259
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,620
Okay, whatever.

1260
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,340
I know there is another movie where Tim Curry plays.

1261
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,180
Wait, wait, wait.

1262
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,220
He's got like crazy makeup.

1263
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,820
Is this like, look, I mean, is it, wow,

1264
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,340
newsflash before a thing was like socially acceptable

1265
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,620
on a widespread degree, people like were critical of it.

1266
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,340
Oh my God, what a shocker.

1267
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,740
No, no, but like a lot of people have this idea

1268
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,380
that cartoons in the 90s were like,

1269
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,180
we're like pushing a gay agenda.

1270
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,020
Okay.

1271
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,860
Oh, okay.

1272
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,700
Yeah, yeah.

1273
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,540
Oh, so it's, okay.

1274
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,220
I thought the, I thought you were saying.

1275
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,220
Yeah, by including things like him.

1276
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,220
I thought you were saying that people had the impression

1277
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:27,020
that cartoons from the 90s were like positively pushing.

1278
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:27,860
Yeah, yeah.

1279
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,220
Yeah, yeah, they do.

1280
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,700
Yeah, yeah, I've never heard that.

1281
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,500
Okay, I guess what I'm saying is that I thought

1282
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,740
that the people who thought that were the other people.

1283
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,780
You know what I mean?

1284
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,100
Oh God, I'm fucking lost.

1285
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,340
I thought you were trying to say

1286
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,700
that people were praising 90s cartoons

1287
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,420
for having more gay representation.

1288
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,300
No, that's why I was confused.

1289
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,900
If you tell me that it's conservative people saying like,

1290
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,180
oh yeah, cartoons back then really pushed the gay agenda.

1291
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,940
That's the case, there was no need for a video about that

1292
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,540
because those people are obviously fucking wrong.

1293
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,780
And like, no one remembers it that way.

1294
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,540
There were a couple, there were a couple of examples

1295
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,860
like Robot Jones had an episode

1296
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,780
that was like actually about the issue

1297
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,620
and not treating it as a joke.

1298
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,780
Nobody watched fucking whatever happened to Robot Jones.

1299
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,380
I certainly did not watch whatever

1300
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,220
I had ever watched.

1301
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,060
Oh, okay, yeah.

1302
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,900
I fucking watched it.

1303
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,740
Did ever happen.

1304
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,820
That's why I was interested.

1305
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,060
That's why it was interesting

1306
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,980
because I'd never fucking heard of this shit.

1307
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,700
Whatever happened to Robot Jones,

1308
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,340
I've not heard that name in many years.

1309
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,940
The name was a hell of a bill of prostitutes.

1310
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,780
That was like one of the first cartoon cartoon shows, I think.

1311
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,060
Yeah.

1312
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,340
The show famous because it had gay.

1313
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,140
I don't know about pushing the gay agenda,

1314
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,980
but I'm certainly pulling the gay agenda.

1315
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,100
Like hand jobs, if you know what I'm saying.

1316
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,940
We'll talk about that on the bonus episode.

1317
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,420
My mic is phallic.

1318
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,260
Can you guess what I'm doing?

1319
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,100
Listen, we can be gay coded all you want,

1320
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,780
but unless I'm sucking your dick, you're not gay enough.

1321
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,820
That's all I'm trying to say.

1322
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,660
Yeah, for sure.

1323
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,500
Speaking of gay.

1324
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,220
Well, about that Kingdom Hearts 3.

1325
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,340
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1326
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,540
Kingdom Hearts 3 pushed the gay agenda.

1327
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,620
I sure hope so.

1328
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,460
You know what?

1329
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,780
I haven't beaten it and I don't think Gibb has either.

1330
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,620
Is that accurate?

1331
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,820
Final Fantasy has way too many like fucking anime people

1332
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,180
I just want to see Donald and Mickey.

1333
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,620
You know, the funny thing about that is.

1334
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,420
You see Donald and Mickey and Goofy.

1335
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,420
Do you?

1336
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,340
Oh, yes.

1337
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,260
It's funny you say that.

1338
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,260
You could have loved Mickey actually.

1339
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,660
I played Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 3.

1340
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,180
I don't know anything about it.

1341
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,740
I played those games in spite of Donald and Goofy.

1342
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,460
I just wanted to say that I like Mickey Mouse.

1343
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,620
I have no opinion on Kingdom Hearts.

1344
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,500
It's a great series.

1345
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,660
I love it.

1346
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,980
As a person who did not grow up with Kingdom Hearts,

1347
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,460
I have not been waiting for it for like a decade.

1348
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,460
I played the Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 kind of recently

1349
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,220
and I always thought it was stupid

1350
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,100
because it was combining Disney and Final Fantasy

1351
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,180
and also has edgy stuff.

1352
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,020
It's a fair assessment.

1353
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,860
That was correct.

1354
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,180
Upon playing them, I have discovered that it is stupid

1355
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,460
but it is also really funny and I love it.

1356
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,620
If every time Mickey Mouse talks about the world of darkness,

1357
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,660
it means it's really like Mickey Mouse voice

1358
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,580
with his like dark hood over him.

1359
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,020
It's the funniest, coolest stuff of all time.

1360
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,220
I think that Kingdom Hearts,

1361
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,660
I wouldn't even have had ever had any problem with it

1362
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,660
or assumed anything bad about it or negative

1363
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,020
or thought it was dumb if not for the fucking trench coats

1364
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,740
of the Organization 13,

1365
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,580
which are the worst design I've ever seen.

1366
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,420
I agree.

1367
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,500
They look cool on the Organization guys.

1368
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,380
No, they don't.

1369
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,100
They look so bad.

1370
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,300
Those trench coats are the ugliest trench coats

1371
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,140
I've ever seen.

1372
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,540
They're not the ugliest trench coats.

1373
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,380
They're real edgy.

1374
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,460
They're very hot topic but they don't look good.

1375
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,740
They're beyond hot topic guys.

1376
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,580
They're really badness.

1377
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,420
They don't.

1378
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,740
Yeah, I mean they're like,

1379
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,820
they're like goth wave clothes.

1380
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,180
No, I want to hear it.

1381
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,020
Did you, what do you think was bad?

1382
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:41,860
I'm with didgy on this.

1383
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,220
I hate those fucking guys.

1384
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,060
They look ridiculous.

1385
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:44,900
As a guy who-

1386
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,140
I don't, I listen.

1387
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:46,980
I love them.

1388
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,540
I know, I know.

1389
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,620
But the thing is,

1390
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,340
I don't believe that you actually think that.

1391
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,180
What?

1392
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,700
What do you mean?

1393
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,260
Because it doesn't make any fucking sense.

1394
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,100
Let me clarify.

1395
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,980
I am a guy who wore a trench coat through all of high school.

1396
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,380
I am a trench coat enthusiast.

1397
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,740
Oh, so this makes you cringe.

1398
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,660
I don't like that.

1399
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,140
Just thinking back to it, that's why.

1400
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,420
Hold on, I'm trying to look at-

1401
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,100
You're not getting proper representation

1402
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,940
in your media and you're upset about it.

1403
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,780
I'm gonna give you a full breakdown.

1404
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,340
I gotta look at a picture of it.

1405
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,180
Okay, oh my god.

1406
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,300
I know there's lots of weird zippers and layers and stuff.

1407
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,460
First of all, I hate the weird, overly closed hood.

1408
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,740
I hate the whole look of the chest is ugly.

1409
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,500
I hate that they go all the way down

1410
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,180
and then they have a zipper coming up from the bottom.

1411
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,020
That's stupid.

1412
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:33,660
There's a bunch of different versions of this Google search.

1413
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,140
Just Google Xemnas, you'll see him

1414
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,380
in the full thing like floating

1415
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,020
and you get a good look at the whole thing.

1416
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,300
Google Organization 13, there's one of a generic.

1417
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,140
I don't know.

1418
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,220
You can't see his face.

1419
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,020
I've just always found them really ugly.

1420
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,140
In fact, when I used to go to anime conventions,

1421
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,100
it would be fucking everywhere.

1422
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,220
It's like giant groups of people wearing the trench coats

1423
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,740
and the hair looks bad enough in the games,

1424
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,300
does not translate to reality at all.

1425
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,260
First of all, it looks absolutely fantastic in the games.

1426
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,980
It's anime hair.

1427
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,540
Anime hair doesn't look good in reality.

1428
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,020
Like the one you just posted in the chat of Xenohort,

1429
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,700
I really dislike.

1430
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,540
Why?

1431
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:19,300
This is one of the best designs of all time.

1432
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,620
Did you consistently say Xenohort and it's Xehanort?

1433
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,460
Xehanort?

1434
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,300
Even Xehanort.

1435
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,620
This is Xemnas, god damn it.

1436
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,700
His name is Xemnas.

1437
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,820
He's the nobody in Xehanort.

1438
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,980
Have you possessed Terra's body, god damn it?

1439
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,580
The problem here is that Digi is realizing something

1440
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,860
that he doesn't have the courage to fully articulate,

1441
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,100
which is that anime sucks and is gay.

1442
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,820
The entire anime aesthetic is just wrong and bad.

1443
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,820
I think there's something to what you're saying, Jesse.

1444
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,660
Anime is bad.

1445
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,900
I don't know any anime that looks like this, though.

1446
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,460
Like, I don't know any fucking line.

1447
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,460
I don't know Bleach.

1448
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,300
They don't wear-

1449
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,380
This is clearly anime stuff.

1450
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,900
This is why the trench coat looks bad.

1451
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,940
Like, I understand looking at this.

1452
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,580
It's the fact that the sleeves are, like, flared

1453
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:08,860
and also that the material is not, like, leather.

1454
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,980
It's sort of like a plasticky, shiny, weird thing.

1455
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,460
No, it's heavy leather, god damn it.

1456
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,300
It looks sick.

1457
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,140
It does not look like leather.

1458
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,180
It looks like, like-

1459
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,940
I'm really into this image that Xen just linked.

1460
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,260
This is my favorite.

1461
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,100
I hate it.

1462
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:21,940
I think the main thing about it-

1463
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,740
Leave Jiren to me, Goku.

1464
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,300
Who the fuck is Jiren?

1465
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,460
He's fucking the alimau from Dragon Ball 2.

1466
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,300
Is he the cat?

1467
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,220
No, he's the super jacked gray alien.

1468
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,180
Okay, I figured out who's the best character.

1469
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,940
I figured out everything I hate about this trench coat.

1470
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,500
First of all, the biggest problem really is that it's so tight

1471
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,460
in the midsection.

1472
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,700
Oh, he wants to do-

1473
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,300
To emphasize his manly figure, god damn it.

1474
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,980
He looks awesome.

1475
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,660
He's a fucking stupid fucking Jiren.

1476
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,820
He's a big buff baby boy.

1477
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:51,660
He's a vital boss.

1478
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,500
He's really terrible.

1479
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,500
Jiren is awesome.

1480
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,100
He's a tough-toothed baby who can dance like a man.

1481
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,420
Ew.

1482
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,260
This isn't-

1483
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,420
Wait, is this a new Dragon Ball?

1484
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,260
The cat thing was weird-looking, but in a good way.

1485
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,620
You fucking dance on your corpse.

1486
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,620
The cat thing was weird-looking, but in a good way.

1487
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,780
This isn't a bad way.

1488
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,940
No, Jiren is good-

1489
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,940
Okay, first of all, please be aware.

1490
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:09,780
This is literally-

1491
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,340
He's fucking Star Trek, look.

1492
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,180
Yeah, he is.

1493
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,220
He is literally Captain Picard.

1494
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,380
This is the most powerful entity in all of Dragon Ball.

1495
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,620
This alimau, gray muscle alien piece of shit.

1496
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,220
Wait, I thought the strongest entity

1497
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,180
was like the little old man or whatever, or like-

1498
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,020
Well, yeah, that's God.

1499
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,860
Did they-

1500
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,700
Oh, that was a red herring.

1501
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,540
Okay, that's Lord of the Rings.

1502
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,780
How many times are they gonna introduce

1503
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,900
the new strongest beings?

1504
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,740
No, no.

1505
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,700
God damn it, I actually watched the series.

1506
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,540
I know the answer.

1507
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,380
As long as the series goes on,

1508
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,340
they're gonna keep doing that.

1509
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,180
Jesse knows.

1510
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,020
That's the show.

1511
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,860
Jesse knows.

1512
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,060
The guy that Digi's talking about, Lord Zeno, is God.

1513
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,620
There is none higher than him.

1514
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,220
But like, there are multiple universes.

1515
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,060
Although they did make the second Lord of the Universe.

1516
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:44,900
There's like 12 universes.

1517
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,740
There were two of them?

1518
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,980
And Jiren is the most powerful dude

1519
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,500
in one of the universes.

1520
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,140
I don't think he's as powerful as the little boy.

1521
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:53,980
Oh my God.

1522
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,860
Lord Zeno is so cool.

1523
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,700
Yeah, I just-

1524
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,540
What are you talking about?

1525
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,060
No, I love Lord Zeno.

1526
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,300
Lord Zeno is the shit.

1527
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,140
He's the coolest.

1528
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,100
I fucking love him.

1529
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,300
He's so cute.

1530
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,660
Yeah, he's rad.

1531
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,380
These are all the show notes, people.

1532
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,380
Lord Zeno looks like shit.

1533
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,420
No, shut the hell up and get out of here.

1534
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,500
There's fucking Final Fantasy,

1535
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,220
there's fucking Kingdom Hearts,

1536
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,780
heaven let your light shine down.

1537
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,180
A hoodie looks really funny.

1538
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,420
This color scheme is so close

1539
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,420
of the supporting trans rights.

1540
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,740
I don't understand it.

1541
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,980
Lord Zeno is a character that I invented.

1542
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,300
I respect him.

1543
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,940
I like Lord Zeno.

1544
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,500
I'm not a fan of the other guy.

1545
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,380
I'm not a fan of the G.

1546
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,100
Okay, Digi, I still don't understand

1547
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,980
why you don't like the Kingdom Hearts 13 or trans guys.

1548
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,820
Well, I changed it to mine.

1549
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,660
Step by step.

1550
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,660
Okay, I want to hear.

1551
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,740
I do want to hear.

1552
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,820
All right, first of all,

1553
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,380
the fact that it hugs so tight

1554
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,780
in the midsection looks really uncomfortable.

1555
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,260
That's why it looks cool.

1556
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,940
That's, I'm not a fan of that.

1557
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,780
Second of all.

1558
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,660
No, that's just effeminate.

1559
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,500
It's fashion.

1560
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,340
It's fashion.

1561
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:03,340
I really hate that they unzip from the bottom up.

1562
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,820
Like, what?

1563
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,660
That's stupid.

1564
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:06,500
Oh yeah, that's a little weird.

1565
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,820
That is weird.

1566
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,380
Have you never seen a double zipper?

1567
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,660
It can unzip from both sides.

1568
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:12,980
But it goes all the way to the top.

1569
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,380
So we'd have to lean all the way down.

1570
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,820
You're assuming they would unzip off.

1571
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,260
It's not all the way zipped down.

1572
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,740
It's fashion number one.

1573
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,180
I'm just wondering, like, when I look at it,

1574
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,540
I can't help but think, like, which way does he go

1575
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,380
to take it off?

1576
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,420
Does he just go up and like...

1577
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,260
He pulls up, goddammit.

1578
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,100
I think he's designed to be over from the top.

1579
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,060
It's a double-sided zipper.

1580
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,340
He only has it pulled down as far as his hand

1581
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,420
can comfortably reach.

1582
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,540
It's style and functionality.

1583
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,820
If you think of the power of the Organization 13,

1584
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,980
they could probably use telepathy to move a zip

1585
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,380
without having to bend over.

1586
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,180
They'd just do their little hand motions, like...

1587
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,460
Axl can just, like, shoot fire at it

1588
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,140
and make it, like, you know, move with that or something.

1589
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,460
You just blast it with, like, flour.

1590
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:59,060
I'm also just not a fan of this, like, all flat black aesthetic,

1591
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,900
like, nothing.

1592
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,060
It's matte black, and it looks dope.

1593
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,580
Matte black is for technology.

1594
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,220
It's not for clothes.

1595
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,060
I disagree.

1596
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,380
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1597
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,020
OK, I just Googled Organization 13.

1598
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,580
Are all these characters, like, real?

1599
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,020
Like, are they actually in the game?

1600
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,140
They're in the game.

1601
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,180
No matter what the question is, yes.

1602
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,500
OK.

1603
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,740
Whatever you want.

1604
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,060
It's such a bad series.

1605
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,100
It's so terrible in every way.

1606
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,300
Look, look, we all know it's dead,

1607
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,980
but they've just released the last one.

1608
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,140
None of us have beaten it yet.

1609
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,500
Like, it's getting put to bed, like, today.

1610
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,020
You know, I bought it, like, this weekend.

1611
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:36,260
I bought Kingdom Hearts, like, thinking that I wanted it,

1612
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,420
because, you know, I grew up playing the original games

1613
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:40,700
back in the day.

1614
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
Did you play the sequels to two, all those other ones?

1615
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,100
I played one and two when it came out.

1616
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,820
And so, you know, I bought my Kingdom Hearts 3

1617
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,140
and I took it home.

1618
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,620
And then I looked at it and, like, I don't want this.

1619
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,700
I don't even want to fucking put it in.

1620
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,500
You'd like it.

1621
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
This is Kingdom Hearts is fucking stupid.

1622
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,660
Like, I just realized all at once.

1623
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,500
You would love running around with it.

1624
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,300
I just suddenly realized.

1625
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,300
I suddenly realized.

1626
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,900
And having great Toy Story adventures looking for Andy.

1627
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,780
I suddenly realized that I've always hated the series

1628
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,660
and just I never, I never knew.

1629
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,300
I wouldn't admit it until I had the game in my possession.

1630
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,540
This is why I mentioned earlier

1631
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:16,380
that I had not grown up with Kingdom Hearts,

1632
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,740
because, like, I bought it as soon as it was available.

1633
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,380
And I have been having a lot of fun with it,

1634
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,900
because it is a new PS2 game in 2019.

1635
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,140
I've been waiting for a long time

1636
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,660
to be able to play another PS2 game.

1637
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,700
It plays exactly like Kingdom Hearts 2,

1638
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,340
little different, you know, with, like, more stuff in it.

1639
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,300
But, like, it's colorful.

1640
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,580
It's got, like, crazy cartoony characters

1641
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,620
that are stupid and funny and cool.

1642
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,740
And the story is, like, it's for babies,

1643
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,860
and I really like it.

1644
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,900
I mean, it's not, like, a shit game.

1645
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,060
I have heard something.

1646
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,460
The guttons are unwatchable in the first three years.

1647
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:53,380
Most of them are.

1648
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,460
Some of them, like, are surprisingly, like, oh,

1649
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,660
that feels like it was, like, directed or, like,

1650
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:02,740
was taken from, like, like that, they, like, I don't know.

1651
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:03,780
I'll just say that, uh...

1652
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,020
Looked at a human being, like, I have a conversation

1653
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,460
and, like, animated it like it was a person.

1654
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,380
It's like, that was okay, but a lot of it is, like, awful.

1655
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,340
You know what I was wondering?

1656
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,900
I just, I don't know what...

1657
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,380
Is there some mandate?

1658
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,140
Is there some reason why they had to make every,

1659
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,740
like, every conversation and every, like, cutscene,

1660
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:27,740
like, paste so awkwardly with weird pauses between speech?

1661
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,780
That's why there's stuff on the board.

1662
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,860
Like, is this a thing where, like,

1663
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,900
because they translate from Japanese to English,

1664
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,820
there's, like, tons of dead space left?

1665
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,340
I, like, why did they do that?

1666
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,380
I would imagine so.

1667
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,220
Yeah, but, like...

1668
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,260
Yeah, but there's so many, there's so many dubs out there

1669
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,300
that are good and localized really well.

1670
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,820
Exactly, that's what I'm saying, right.

1671
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,500
You can edit any cutscene down, you can just cut bits.

1672
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,780
You're playing, like, background music.

1673
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,900
There's no audio, like, to worry about.

1674
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,740
Yeah, I know you mean.

1675
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,420
I have no patience for that weird,

1676
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,140
stilted Asian anime bullshit.

1677
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,660
So is it, like, is it...

1678
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,620
So is it just, like, directed like that

1679
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,380
from the get-go or something or what?

1680
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,860
It has always been like that, yes, absolutely.

1681
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,260
And I don't know why.

1682
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,300
Like, I guess it does feel more video game-y,

1683
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,860
AKA shit.

1684
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,900
Like, I should be pushing X-men right now.

1685
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,780
It's not a good thing to have those parts, yeah.

1686
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,820
But yeah, it's just bad though.

1687
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,340
And, like, they could fix this.

1688
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,460
You could just cut out these little chunks of waiting.

1689
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,300
I don't know, it's baffling to me.

1690
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,620
Why the fuck did it?

1691
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,460
I don't know, I like it.

1692
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,700
I mean, I don't like it, I don't think it's good,

1693
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,060
but, like, it just feels fun.

1694
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,180
Like, it feels just, like, it feels like it should

1695
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,460
as a Kingdom Hearts game.

1696
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,140
And I already know what I was getting myself

1697
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:32,980
to do when I bought it.

1698
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:33,820
I don't know, like, I know what I did.

1699
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,300
I'm sure people can play the game.

1700
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,700
I've been informed of something in my comments

1701
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,340
that has greatly disturbed me

1702
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,060
and made me even less excited to play the game

1703
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,300
than I already was, which is that

1704
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,620
there are no Final Fantasy characters in this one at all.

1705
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,460
Is that true?

1706
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,180
That's what I have heard, that's what I have heard.

1707
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,100
What is the point of the series then?

1708
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,500
It's all, it's, what the fuck, why?

1709
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,660
Look, the presence of Final Fantasy,

1710
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,460
look, obviously, it leads with Disney.

1711
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,780
The presence of Final Fantasy-

1712
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,740
Nothing would be in it.

1713
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,660
I, me too.

1714
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,420
The presence of Final Fantasy has always been

1715
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,620
kind of a more thematic press.

1716
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:09,780
I mean, it's always been bad.

1717
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,820
They've always done the Final Fantasy stuff badly,

1718
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,100
but it's like the whole genesis of the series.

1719
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:14,940
It's part of it.

1720
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,660
You guys gotta understand, this is the new Square Enix.

1721
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,380
You're gonna have to download the Final Fantasy 7 DLC pack

1722
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,020
to get the ex-

1723
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,740
I, unironically, think that's, look,

1724
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:25,940
I haven't beaten the game yet.

1725
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,100
I've heard this from people that, like, DLC and, like,

1726
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,220
like, end game content is, like, zilch,

1727
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,780
and that it will be, like, patched or it'll be DLC

1728
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,100
or maybe, like, they'll make a Final Mix version of the game.

1729
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,940
I hear something like that is coming.

1730
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,980
I can't confirm it yet.

1731
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,700
But, like, yo, the, like, at the very least,

1732
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,940
Leon, Yuffie, Eris, and even Cloud and Sephiroth

1733
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,580
have been in every game as actual characters

1734
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:51,340
that we care about in Kingdom Hearts Lore.

1735
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:54,260
Why in God's name would we not, like,

1736
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,180
address those characters in Kingdom Hearts 3

1737
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,780
unless they just, like, ran out of dev time?

1738
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,620
And besides that-

1739
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,700
The best part of every game is the Sephiroth fight.

1740
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,140
You go find him, he's hanging out on a cliff somewhere

1741
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,660
and you go, I'm gonna fight ya and he's gonna go,

1742
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,820
well, I'm gonna suck Cloud's dick once you kick my ass

1743
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,700
and so then you fight him and it's hard and it's fun.

1744
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,140
I'm mad. It's fun, though.

1745
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,060
It's just good.

1746
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,580
I mean, sure, the story is terrible.

1747
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,660
It's just, like, where's Cloud?

1748
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,500
I don't know.

1749
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,580
Fight me. Okay.

1750
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,700
Beat him. Get Cloud.

1751
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,900
Okay.

1752
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,740
That's how it goes every single time.

1753
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,140
But it, like, it's just, it's,

1754
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:30,380
the thing about Kingdom Hearts 3,

1755
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,340
this is my observation.

1756
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,300
It's that it is bizarrely, like, in depth

1757
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,660
and bizarrely large amounts of effort

1758
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,460
were put into some aspects.

1759
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,100
If you get to, like, the Toy Story world,

1760
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,460
there's, like, a whole fucking-

1761
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,620
They, like, made a second game within Kingdom Hearts 3

1762
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,020
that's, like, clearly a parody of Final Fantasy-style games

1763
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,860
like Final Fantasy XV that, like, exists within,

1764
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,300
within the Kingdom Hearts universe,

1765
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,940
within the Toy Story universe, exists this universe.

1766
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,620
It's bizarre, but it's dope.

1767
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,180
But, like, so that had insane amounts of effort

1768
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,380
and energy put into it.

1769
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:05,140
Like, but where the fuck are my Final Fantasy characters?

1770
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,020
Why is that just, like, not here at all?

1771
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,020
At all?

1772
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,060
I don't understand the weird lopsidedness

1773
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,020
of the, like, emphasis of the development.

1774
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,580
Is it because they're gonna fill it out later?

1775
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,860
Is this more Final Fantasy XV syndrome

1776
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:20,580
of they just didn't finish the game that they wanted to?

1777
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,620
Because the fact that we don't see Leon

1778
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,740
and those other boys that have been in every game

1779
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:28,340
as, like, vital buddies of ours is bizarre.

1780
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,780
What if it's because they want you to think,

1781
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,260
well, shit, if I want to see all the Final Fantasy characters

1782
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,620
interact, I'm gonna have to buy Dissidia?

1783
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,820
I mean, that's true, except there's no story

1784
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,220
in the new Dissidia, none.

1785
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:47,340
You'd have to play the PSP games from 10 years ago.

1786
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,420
So you got nothing.

1787
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,740
They're not giving us what we need.

1788
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:51,780
We're in expense.

1789
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,780
Sounds like hate and all.

1790
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,260
Okay, most fucking games.

1791
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,100
Most important questions.

1792
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,820
What another fucking thing?

1793
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,620
Why the hell hasn't Donald Duck

1794
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,300
who's turned my voicemails?

1795
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,660
Why the fuck does Donald Duck

1796
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,980
give these up both?

1797
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,500
And he's gonna have to respond

1798
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,660
to all the various emails I sent him.

1799
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,780
I want to collab with you, Donald Duck.

1800
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,580
I want to know what's in your mind.

1801
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,740
I want to be on my interview show.

1802
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,500
Donald Duck, why do you not think it's okay

1803
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,740
for you to just ignore me?

1804
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,340
Like all the other people that you just fucking then kill

1805
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,420
and stuff in a dead ditch in Africa.

1806
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,660
Why do you think you can treat me like the way

1807
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,940
you treat all your horrors and your hookers?

1808
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,540
I've known that Donald Duck is not

1809
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,660
in Tales Get Strolled, Munchie, for the last time.

1810
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,580
And another thing, why the fuck is there not

1811
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,540
a goof troupe level and a DuckTales level

1812
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,380
in Kingdom Hearts?

1813
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,140
There really should be.

1814
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,100
Goofy and Donald kind of got the shaft

1815
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,540
in terms of their development.

1816
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,940
I mean, I'm glad Scrooge is in it.

1817
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,780
I love Scrooge.

1818
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,620
Scrooge is there, yeah.

1819
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,460
He's good.

1820
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,300
He's a good guy.

1821
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,140
I don't know the thing.

1822
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,460
What's the deal with that Kingdom Hearts story?

1823
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,740
It's so weird.

1824
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,940
Why is it so convoluted?

1825
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,540
And how come the games are all on one?

1826
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,940
They have such weird names.

1827
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,180
There's decimals in there and numbers and fractions

1828
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,220
and the names of the games.

1829
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,380
I don't know how to read it.

1830
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,100
I don't understand.

1831
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:04,860
OK.

1832
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,500
How do you even pronounce Xenor?

1833
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,660
That's my new character.

1834
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,900
Guy who doesn't understand Kingdom Hearts lore.

1835
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,100
But the best, every most important question,

1836
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,460
who's the best organization 13?

1837
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,820
Answer, Seix, Dunn.

1838
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,700
Xemnas, it's Xemnas.

1839
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,620
Mark Xen, you freaks, you fools, you gays.

1840
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,460
But there are keyblades, and then there

1841
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:28,220
are, get ready for it, keyblades.

1842
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,500
Keyblades.

1843
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,380
No, I won't let you mock that.

1844
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:33,940
That's an actual hilarious joke from our lecture

1845
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,460
that we all made together.

1846
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,700
And I won't let you soil it.

1847
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,420
That's culture.

1848
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,020
People now do that.

1849
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,900
They go, keyblade.

1850
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,140
Keyblade, yep.

1851
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:43,780
I don't do it.

1852
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,500
I mean, has your, I gotta imagine.

1853
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,620
You were there, Jesse.

1854
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,180
What?

1855
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,900
Has your video, how the views of your video,

1856
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,180
have they spiked?

1857
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:54,780
Have they spiked with the release of three?

1858
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,940
Yes, they have spiked.

1859
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,940
It's still sitting at around something like

1860
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,820
three, two, four hundred, like thousand views.

1861
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,460
Which like for a video that,

1862
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,740
I mean, I'm not trying to toot my own horn,

1863
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,540
but for a video that's like fairly well known,

1864
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,940
such as that, those are relatively low numbers.

1865
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,060
It's not like it's surging about like

1866
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,700
hundreds of thousands, like every month or whatever.

1867
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,300
But like, people are coming back to it,

1868
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,460
they're watching again, and it's certainly,

1869
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,340
like, again, not to suck my own dick too hard,

1870
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,940
but like, it was the primordial,

1871
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,300
let's explain the crazy Kingdom Hearts lore video

1872
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,700
that many people are copying right now.

1873
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,700
And by the way, I was gonna say this before,

1874
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,900
but let me say it now.

1875
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:34,540
So Barry Kramer, former editor of Game Grumps,

1876
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,380
made a video.

1877
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,780
I saw this on your stream.

1878
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,820
I was watching your stream.

1879
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,380
Really, really quick tangent.

1880
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,100
Ross follows me on Instagram, that's it.

1881
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:45,940
Oh, dope.

1882
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,260
That's cool, that's cool.

1883
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,660
I fucking hate Ross.

1884
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,300
Oh, well, there you go.

1885
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,540
It's fine, because he's fucking,

1886
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:55,820
I don't know, he's just, he's annoying.

1887
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:58,780
But he's outside of the context of him

1888
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,580
trying to be funny on Game Grumps.

1889
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,580
When he's talking about animation and stuff, he's,

1890
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,420
he's really good.

1891
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,260
He's still annoying.

1892
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,600
He's still annoying.

1893
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,340
I don't like the stuff he makes.

1894
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,180
He's annoying.

1895
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,660
Everyone ever involved with the Game Grumps,

1896
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,420
they're all cool, please give me a job.

1897
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,020
Deliver me from the procrastinators

1898
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,260
and give me a real job.

1899
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:20,540
But, Hating Ross made it really satisfying

1900
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,940
when he was straight up the villain

1901
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,740
of that World of Warcraft series they did.

1902
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,580
That was a really great series.

1903
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,420
Wasn't he the one trying to like,

1904
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,380
help everybody have fun and, you know.

1905
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,980
Well, sort of, but he does a terrible job

1906
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,660
and is an idiot and ruins it for everyone.

1907
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,580
Okay, well let me, let me finish my point about Barry.

1908
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:36,900
It's, it's just that,

1909
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,540
so Barry is one of these pretenders to the throne.

1910
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:42,700
These, these princes, biting it by kingly heels.

1911
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,060
You know, who made like a, it was like,

1912
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,180
it was like a good enough summary of Kingdom Hearts.

1913
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:48,780
And I appreciate, it's like animated.

1914
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,620
I'm sure he did a good job.

1915
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,660
I have not actually watched it.

1916
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,060
Great, but I heard from one,

1917
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,220
he says like the beginning of the video,

1918
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,740
someone in my stream yesterday told me,

1919
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:01,060
Nate, did you know Barry has only played Kingdom Hearts I

1920
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,540
and half of Kingdom Hearts II

1921
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,700
and yet this man, Danes,

1922
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,780
to make a fucking story summary of every,

1923
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,940
talk about reading Wikipedia and making videos out of it.

1924
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,460
Wouldn't you fucking finish the,

1925
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,500
if you're making a video about the story.

1926
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,060
He didn't even finish two a good game.

1927
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,260
Okay, well for what is it a good game?

1928
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,020
You know what's even worse than that though?

1929
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:20,860
What?

1930
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,940
I love this man to death,

1931
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:25,500
but AVGN made a whole 10 minute video about Kingdom Hearts

1932
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,980
without having played any of them.

1933
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,380
That's, that's.

1934
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,300
Or I think he was playing his way through them,

1935
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,740
but like he didn't know anything about that.

1936
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,340
He literally just made a video that's like,

1937
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,140
what's up with all the titles?

1938
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:36,980
Whoa.

1939
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,820
And I was like, what are you doing?

1940
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:40,060
You know, that was, that was a video.

1941
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,020
I liked that video.

1942
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,940
I gave it a pass because it's AVGN.

1943
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,340
But I would have preferred like an AVGN video

1944
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:49,180
about any of the Kingdom Hearts games.

1945
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,020
Like if he did.

1946
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,380
Imagine if AVGN did a real video

1947
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,860
reviewing Kingdom Hearts one or something.

1948
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,820
Or like all the Crafty Spinoff games.

1949
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,660
Yeah.

1950
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,500
That would be.

1951
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,320
Yeah, yeah.

1952
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,160
Making them faces.

1953
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,000
Saying, oh this is not.

1954
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,500
This is the shit load of fuck right here.

1955
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,780
That's what I come to see.

1956
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,420
That's what I like.

1957
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,500
That's why it feels like a cheap like paycheck cash grab.

1958
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,860
Like need a video for this month.

1959
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,700
You know.

1960
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,540
Kingdom Hearts is hot.

1961
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,380
Not going to play the game.

1962
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,220
I don't even know.

1963
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,380
Just going to read Wikipedia.

1964
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,340
I'm not saying this is,

1965
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,900
I'm not saying this is any better,

1966
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,200
but like I wouldn't be surprised

1967
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,160
from the way that he framed it at the start of the video

1968
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,160
that like people were just requesting him

1969
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,560
to talk about it a lot.

1970
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,680
That like everyone wanted him to do Kingdom Hearts

1971
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,200
that he didn't know anything about it.

1972
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,600
So he just made a video being like,

1973
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,000
hey, I don't know anything about it

1974
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,120
and it seems confusing.

1975
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:34,000
So, you know, but like the way he presented it though,

1976
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,880
it's like, it's simultaneously as that.

1977
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,600
But it's like, yeah, but the title and thumbnail implies

1978
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,040
that you're actually going to say something

1979
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,840
about Kingdom Hearts and you're not.

1980
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,440
So it ended up feeling like clickbait.

1981
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,520
It felt like some.

1982
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,560
I think this meme.

1983
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,160
I think that honestly, I swear to God,

1984
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,960
I mean, I've been V for like a fucking decade

1985
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,000
and longer talking about Kingdom Hearts and shit

1986
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,880
and like discussing Lauren whatnot.

1987
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,400
And I really think the meme that this story

1988
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,280
is too complicated to figure out has deeply set in,

1989
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,520
despite the, like there's many infographics

1990
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,000
and like meme posts about like,

1991
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,960
it's really not that hard guys.

1992
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,560
You just have to think a little bit.

1993
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,960
It's like, I had like, like going through it

1994
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,280
for like, you know, one and two.

1995
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,680
Just after the lecture, I was like, yeah, I'll play it.

1996
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,400
I think I was already playing at the time.

1997
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,800
But like, I wanted to know how complex it was

1998
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,120
because I like complex things.

1999
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,120
Like the parts of the Caribbean three,

2000
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,240
the people say, oh, that's such a convoluted plot.

2001
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,240
I love how convoluted it is.

2002
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,760
I love trying to follow along.

2003
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,920
And so I was like, Kingdom Hearts

2004
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,880
is probably going to be something I love.

2005
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,000
And it's not even that complex.

2006
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,920
It's just like a combination of a few things.

2007
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,520
It's edgy and stupid a lot of the time.

2008
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,480
It has a few, like a lot of the games in the series

2009
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,880
have silly names, like titles that you would,

2010
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,200
like very unconventional titles.

2011
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:00,120
And like side games have lore that comes up

2012
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,880
in the main series.

2013
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,320
That's really the only three things

2014
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,120
that make it sort of confusing a little bit.

2015
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,160
But beyond that, it's not that much.

2016
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,080
You just need to know.

2017
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,760
There are convenience in it more than it's complicated.

2018
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,600
It's the real thing.

2019
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,080
The problem is that there's actual nonsensical lore

2020
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,440
that does not make sense and like is hard to recognize

2021
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,280
as you play through.

2022
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,200
Like what bothers me about this with Kingdom Hearts,

2023
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,720
like Jesse just said, it's more that it's inconvenient.

2024
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,680
It's more that it's broken up into too many places.

2025
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,160
It's too hard to follow all that.

2026
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,360
But like, I think that also a lot of this

2027
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,920
is just people are fucking stupid.

2028
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,920
And like, there's so many people who are just like,

2029
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,680
like going by what I heard people say

2030
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,280
about Final Fantasy VII online,

2031
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,320
I thought it would be literally incomprehensible.

2032
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,000
Like the way people talk about that game is like,

2033
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,880
it's so confusing and so weird.

2034
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,080
It makes you think so hard.

2035
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:52,920
It's got so many crazy mysteries.

2036
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,720
These people haven't played the game in 20 years.

2037
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,840
Or like Evangelion or something where they're like,

2038
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,720
oh, it's like, it's such a head fuck.

2039
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,640
And it's just like, it's like,

2040
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,440
if you've never had exposure to any complicated story,

2041
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,760
then yes, you know.

2042
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,760
I hear that shit and it's like,

2043
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,240
well, I followed it perfectly fine at nine years old.

2044
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,320
You fucking retard.

2045
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,960
So, whoa, did you, whoa, this story's got like themes.

2046
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,920
And like, it's trying to like say something.

2047
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,560
It's like, it's more about like just that sometimes

2048
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,240
you have to fill in the gaps of what was going on.

2049
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,840
And like, the show gives you the tools to do it

2050
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,280
or the game gives you the tools to do it.

2051
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,480
And those people just don't know how to use those tools.

2052
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,320
You know?

2053
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,160
That's exactly right.

2054
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,680
And I think that then when you go read a Wikipedia entry,

2055
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,360
and it's true, these holes are there

2056
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,080
and you haven't actually put in the effort

2057
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,320
to play the fucking game that gives you the resources

2058
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,440
to make obvious inferences like that, then-

2059
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,440
Final Fantasy VII tells you-

2060
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,280
Yeah, you're high and dry,

2061
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,840
because you didn't play the game or whatever.

2062
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,760
Everything in the lore is in the game.

2063
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,960
You can find like houses and like documents.

2064
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,320
You could read about Genova and like Professor Gast

2065
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,480
and where like the Shinra Corporation came from.

2066
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,920
They don't want to do that.

2067
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,760
They want to read what you read.

2068
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,680
But it's all there.

2069
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:01,720
There's like the fucking glossary and stuff

2070
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,600
and like character bios that are in Kingdom Hearts III.

2071
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,680
After you meet a character,

2072
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,000
you can go read about them.

2073
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,720
If you have a little trouble, like who was that again?

2074
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,600
You can find all the information

2075
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,320
in all three of the Kingdom Hearts main games.

2076
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,640
I mean, this was-

2077
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,000
I go and read that because like most other games

2078
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,080
that have things like that, I don't need to read it.

2079
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,240
But like in Kingdom Hearts I do.

2080
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,600
And that's really the only difference.

2081
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,360
Once I have read it, I get it.

2082
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,000
You gotta remember we're dealing with a gaming pop culture

2083
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,720
where like the last of us is the greatest depth

2084
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,680
and cinematic achievement imaginable in media.

2085
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,440
Like fucking, you know.

2086
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,000
Or God of War with like people are saying like God of War

2087
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,480
has the best story in a video game.

2088
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:46,480
Every fucking day of my life for the last year,

2089
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,920
every fucking day I wake up and I see,

2090
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,520
this video was good until you called Joel boring.

2091
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,560
How dare you be smirks the name of Joel.

2092
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,840
Why are people so defensive about the last of us?

2093
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,240
I don't understand.

2094
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,520
It's like just a-

2095
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,280
It's a mediocre fucking story.

2096
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,400
It's not, it's fine.

2097
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,080
I didn't even say it was bad.

2098
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,360
It's just fine.

2099
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,480
Why do people care so much about that fucking game?

2100
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,680
They need their golden idol to show people as like,

2101
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,720
this is why you need to take my dumb ass opinion seriously

2102
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,200
on video games matter.

2103
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,200
I didn't waste my time playing these hundreds and hundreds

2104
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,960
of hours of meaningless games that do nothing but fill a void

2105
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,400
that is the lack of accomplishment in my life

2106
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,360
that I make up for by playing these vicarious hero characters.

2107
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,200
No, no, no.

2108
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,560
This is important in like making me a good person.

2109
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,120
I like am Joel and shit.

2110
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,560
And I like did save the princess or whatever.

2111
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,720
That's not you guys.

2112
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,040
Oh God, stop Nate.

2113
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,000
You're gonna make me fucking,

2114
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,880
you're gonna make me fucking cry, all right?

2115
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,720
You should.

2116
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,000
Someone needs to call a witch doctor

2117
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
because I'm seeing several new colors right now.

2118
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,200
I wanna make a statement that seems obvious

2119
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,720
because it is and everyone's already said it before.

2120
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,440
But I have not spiritually resonated with this

2121
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,920
until just now.

2122
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,360
I Google search Kingdom Hearts 3 full game movie

2123
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,400
and I'm watching it.

2124
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,680
And the first thing is this bizarre wizard man

2125
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,000
telling Anna Mayman that he needs to go on an adventure

2126
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:17,840
for whatever reason.

2127
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,840
Is it Merlin?

2128
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,560
Maybe, I have no idea.

2129
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,520
Anyway, I'm like, okay, yeah, Kingdom Hearts,

2130
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,880
gotcha, understand, goofy Donald there, okay, I understand.

2131
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,480
Then they go to Hercules or land

2132
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,360
and I can like easily in my mind think,

2133
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,920
okay, Final Fantasy, Disney, Donald, Goofy

2134
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:33,760
and stuff like that.

2135
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,760
But for some reason, now they're in a Disney renaissance movie

2136
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,480
and then they approach Hades.

2137
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,200
And I hear James Woods.

2138
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,400
I think Munchie might be a little behind

2139
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,600
on his Kingdom Hearts.

2140
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,120
I hear James Woods giving the same fucking voice

2141
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,120
he's been giving for 20 years now.

2142
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,360
Old and disheveled, like fucking choking up

2143
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,320
in the middle of recording,

2144
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,360
doesn't he wanna do another take

2145
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,880
and then he's gonna die too soon

2146
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,920
and then actually be able to get the same amount of shots.

2147
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,760
He loves Joe Ladies.

2148
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,320
And I just hear him say, huh, fucking Hercules,

2149
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,680
more like Jercules, huh, get it?

2150
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,040
And I'm like, are you fucking joking me?

2151
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,880
Like Kingdom Hearts and Disney are the same game?

2152
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,200
What?

2153
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,280
They're fucking, that's so weird, dude.

2154
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,440
I can't believe that fucking Final Fantasy Disney

2155
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,360
are in the same game.

2156
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,680
Like I didn't believe it.

2157
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,040
Like I knew, okay, Donald Goofy got it.

2158
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,760
Like I didn't actually believe that Disney movies

2159
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,720
and Q's of Final Fantasy were actually together.

2160
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,880
I didn't believe that it couldn't be true.

2161
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,280
Okay, the weird thing about that observation, Munchie,

2162
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:43,400
is that I also had that same revelation

2163
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,600
as I was playing Kingdom Hearts 3

2164
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,400
because I've just been studying lore.

2165
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,040
I've been hitting the books about Heartless

2166
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,400
and No Ways in the Dark and Keyblades and I'm like,

2167
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,320
man, that's where I've been for 13 years.

2168
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,760
I finally play Kingdom Hearts 3 and I'm like,

2169
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:01,040
whoa, it's fucking Mike Wazowski, Motherfucker!

2170
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,880
Jesus Christ!

2171
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,200
You think about all this lore stuff,

2172
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,720
but the actual like moment to moment experience

2173
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,480
of playing Kingdom Hearts is like 90% only.

2174
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,080
Yeah, it is 90% Disney shit.

2175
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,200
I fucking like Kingdom Hearts, I was sick.

2176
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,960
Oh my God, it's Hercules!

2177
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,880
It looks like Hercules!

2178
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,880
Oh my God!

2179
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,960
Hercules!

2180
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,760
The funny thing about talking about the plot

2181
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,920
of Kingdom Hearts at all is that it's not the forefront

2182
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,120
of why people care about Kingdom Hearts.

2183
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,480
Like, I don't think that many people play it for the show.

2184
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,800
It's not what the games are about.

2185
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,760
The first game is just about a kid

2186
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,520
trying to get back to his little girlfriend

2187
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,600
and that's really relatable.

2188
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,360
Like, it's not really, that's why everyone loves the series

2189
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,120
in spite of the fact that everyone hates the lore

2190
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,600
because it's not about the lore at all.

2191
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,760
The games are about Rapunzel's fucking sexy feet

2192
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,440
and you want to come on those feats,

2193
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,280
you want her to jack you off those feet

2194
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,200
and so you go to the Rapunzel world

2195
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,440
and you get what you came for.

2196
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:01,440
Like, they're also about sweet boss battles.

2197
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,880
I have a disease, an exotic disease,

2198
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,720
there's no way to cure it.

2199
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,680
I'm on my deathbed.

2200
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,360
Make a wish foundation comes to me

2201
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,560
and they say, what do you want?

2202
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,840
We'll give you anything.

2203
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,200
And I just say to him, make all the Final Fantasy III cutscenes

2204
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,400
real and they're happening to me.

2205
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,320
I want Hercules to talk to me.

2206
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,640
I want Hades to talk to me.

2207
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,240
I'm sorry, I'm getting reactivated pissed off

2208
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,960
about all the Kingdom Hearts lectures

2209
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:25,800
that are out there now

2210
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,200
because I'm really thinking about how the joke

2211
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,560
with Nate's video was that nobody cares.

2212
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,560
Like, that's the point of-

2213
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,000
I did repeat that many times.

2214
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,840
Like, the main point of all of the lectures

2215
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,880
for the most part is usually that it's-

2216
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,160
The climactic moment at the end was like,

2217
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,960
they're like, Nate, are these games worth playing?

2218
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,120
And I say triumphantly, okay, well, first of all,

2219
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,360
if you're playing for the story, stop.

2220
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,120
That was the thesis statement of the whole lecture.

2221
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:53,960
That's the thing.

2222
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,240
So if that's the case,

2223
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,520
like when all these people are making these videos

2224
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,480
that are like, whoa, explaining the crazy story of Kingdom,

2225
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,680
nobody cared in the first place.

2226
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,960
Like, why do we-

2227
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,040
We don't need an explanation leading into the new game

2228
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,040
because we're not playing it for the story.

2229
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,480
We don't need to know what happened.

2230
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,080
Just put it on, look at the flashy lights

2231
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,400
and fight, you know, Disney villains.

2232
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,480
Like, that's the point.

2233
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,400
My favorite thing to do in Kingdom Hearts 3

2234
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,880
is to run up walls.

2235
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,720
There's so many walls you can just run up.

2236
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,400
You just walk up to the wall and you press forward

2237
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,720
and you just start running.

2238
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,160
And then you can do, you can press square

2239
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,200
and you can kick off the wall

2240
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,760
and then you can jump and you can double jump

2241
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,880
and then you can do an air dash.

2242
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,120
You can just be really high up

2243
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,960
and then you fall down and you smash things.

2244
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,800
I think because I haven't like seen-

2245
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,640
You can explain the story of Kingdom Hearts.

2246
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,760
You can explain the story of Kingdom Hearts in one sentence.

2247
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,080
It's a fun anime game with Disney shit.

2248
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,400
Woo!

2249
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,240
That should be all the videos.

2250
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,000
I think because Mickey Mouse and Donald Look

2251
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
are just like icons, right?

2252
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,080
Like, I haven't like seen any shorts of them.

2253
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,320
I don't know anything about them as characters, really.

2254
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,600
But when I see Hercules,

2255
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,400
a film that I've seen many times before

2256
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,960
and like I have like an emotional connection

2257
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,160
to Hercules, the Disney movie.

2258
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,600
And I see him looking at bad evil hoodie.

2259
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,400
Heaven, let your lights shine down.

2260
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,040
Whoa!

2261
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,640
I see him looking at him menacingly.

2262
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:16,720
I just am fucking, like I'm seeing too many colors right now.

2263
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,240
I understand what it's like to be fucking colorblind

2264
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,760
and I'm saying I'm seeing way too many colors.

2265
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,880
The best part of the game by far.

2266
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,160
To clarify what I was trying to say before

2267
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,640
is that like why I was upset thinking back on it

2268
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,200
is the fact that these people making these videos

2269
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,080
don't get that.

2270
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,160
Like they don't get that that's the, like your lecture-

2271
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,000
That's the appeal.

2272
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,760
Your lecture was making fun of the story.

2273
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,320
You're like, hey, I am explaining this whole story

2274
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,400
because I happen to be such a huge fan of Kingdom Hearts 2.

2275
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,400
Incidentally, I'm telling you-

2276
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,520
Okay, I gotta be that guy.

2277
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,480
I gotta be that guy.

2278
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,880
So it's like, is that like an in-joke then?

2279
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,880
Like why does the story have to be so convoluted?

2280
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,320
Okay, even in the games,

2281
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,320
Nomura clearly takes this very seriously.

2282
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,680
I was gonna say like, yeah, you can say that

2283
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,840
you don't play for the story, but like someone cares.

2284
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,680
Look, I just wanna say-

2285
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,080
I just wanna say, look, the butt of the joke I feel

2286
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,560
in the Kingdom Hearts lecture is that look,

2287
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:10,840
I am the joke because I care when I should not.

2288
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,000
That's what I'm trying to say.

2289
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,560
Is that like the whole point is that like

2290
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,600
these games are looked down on for having

2291
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,000
like a dumb premise and a dumb story.

2292
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,080
And you're like, yeah, they do, but I played them anyways

2293
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,640
and I obsessed over them and I learned it all

2294
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,880
because that's the way I am.

2295
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,120
Anything I consume, I learn everything about it

2296
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,120
because that's you, that's your personality.

2297
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,440
And so like for you to make this lecture,

2298
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,800
yeah, you are the butt of the joke.

2299
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
Like, hey, I'm a 27-year-old man

2300
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,440
talking about Kingdom Hearts,

2301
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,000
but like the whole time you're presenting it as,

2302
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,400
this is, I'm explaining this because it's funny

2303
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,560
and stupid and doesn't matter and you don't need to know it.

2304
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,960
I'm like, that's kind of the point of the lectures

2305
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,480
is that for the most part again,

2306
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,720
we talk about things that like we have

2307
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,760
this insane knowledge of that no one else cares about.

2308
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,600
Like that's kind of the joke.

2309
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,480
That's the premise of the lectures to begin with, right?

2310
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,320
That's what I'm saying.

2311
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,160
That they are a joke.

2312
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,400
So like, so then you get to these other people

2313
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,320
who are making videos about this

2314
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,920
and it's like they haven't even played the games

2315
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,680
and they're like trying to sincerely explain the story

2316
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,680
as if like that really matters.

2317
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,120
And it's like, no, the whole point was

2318
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,760
that it doesn't really matter, you know?

2319
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,400
I haven't seen any of these like other explanation videos,

2320
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,720
but I can pretty much imagine what they are.

2321
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,680
And like they probably come at it from the angle

2322
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,280
that they're doing some kind of weird

2323
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,840
like consumer advocacy thing.

2324
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,440
Like they are providing you a service.

2325
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,440
Like now you don't, like now you know.

2326
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,720
Like now you're up to, I'm getting you up to speed.

2327
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,800
Like you need to know this information.

2328
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,360
This is why you should watch my video.

2329
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,640
So you will know the things that you must know

2330
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,440
before you get into Kingdom Hearts 3.

2331
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,280
Yeah, yeah.

2332
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,920
Here's my advice for if you want to play Kingdom Hearts 3.

2333
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:55,520
It's if you do, if you care about the story,

2334
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,920
then if you plan to watch all the cut scenes,

2335
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,040
just go play the other games first.

2336
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,360
If you don't, then just skip the cut scenes.

2337
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,360
Like there's no reason to watch a YouTube video

2338
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,160
explaining it all and then play the new game

2339
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,920
and expect to like the story.

2340
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,320
It's like, if you were going to like the story,

2341
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,920
you would go play the other ones.

2342
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,400
Why jump in now?

2343
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,240
Why come in late like this?

2344
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,760
But they want to be on the new thing, did you?

2345
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:19,600
They want to be talking about it.

2346
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,440
I don't even think it's working

2347
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,440
because it doesn't seem like many people actually care

2348
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,680
about Kingdom Hearts 3 now that it's happening.

2349
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,520
They want to be able to say, oh, Kingdom Hearts,

2350
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,720
Kingdom Hearts was my childhood.

2351
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,400
Yeah, that's cool.

2352
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,800
Because they don't even say that half of them are like,

2353
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,920
I haven't even played the goddamn games.

2354
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,600
I haven't played one and a half.

2355
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,480
They want to be able to talk like that anyway.

2356
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:41,120
I happily wear the hat of Elitist on this subject.

2357
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,960
If nothing else, I happily adopted.

2358
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,600
And yes, on just that level,

2359
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,920
I feel comfortable shit talking people

2360
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,760
who are going to try to talk about these games

2361
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,120
without doing as much effort as I put into play them.

2362
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,000
Whether or not, you know, I just did it for fun,

2363
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
but it became my full-time job later in life.

2364
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,040
And so, you know, I'm the expert.

2365
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,600
Who the fuck is Barry Kramer?

2366
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,320
Who hasn't even, honestly,

2367
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,400
that makes me more angry than AVGN.

2368
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,600
Like that he gave up on Kingdom Hearts 2.

2369
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,400
Like, God, like if you're making this video,

2370
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,960
go back and finish the game.

2371
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,800
Yes.

2372
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
Or you should feel bad.

2373
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,240
It's got to be relevant to the SEO optimization, bro.

2374
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,080
And you know what?

2375
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,080
This ties back to that thing

2376
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,200
at the very beginning of our talk today.

2377
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,720
It's like, when you are a YouTuber,

2378
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,680
the pressure is now on you.

2379
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,280
Produce content.

2380
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,760
Don't worry about research.

2381
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,600
Okay, well, let's not blame.

2382
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,440
I know that's the nature of the game.

2383
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,280
But still.

2384
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,120
I don't think you can blame that on Barry.

2385
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:33,960
Because Barry puts out a video once.

2386
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,800
No, no.

2387
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,640
Yes, you fucking can.

2388
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,400
If Barry wanted to make a Kingdom Hearts video

2389
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,000
and SEO optimized,

2390
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,240
then he should have gone back before the game.

2391
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,000
But he knew the game was coming out.

2392
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,160
He had fucking time.

2393
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,320
It's not like it snuck up on him.

2394
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,280
No, no, that's all fair.

2395
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,480
I know he tried to get it out in time for the game,

2396
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,760
but that was not for SEO purposes.

2397
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,480
He did that because it's sexy

2398
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,920
to get something out about a game

2399
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,880
right before it comes out.

2400
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,560
Like, everybody wants to have that experience.

2401
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,640
But like, don't do it

2402
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,640
if it's not something you actually care about.

2403
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,640
Like, I have every season,

2404
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,400
like season three of Attack on Titan or something

2405
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,240
will come out.

2406
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,280
And I'm like, I'm not going to write a video about that

2407
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,440
because I'm not going to watch Attack on Titan

2408
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,560
seasons one and two

2409
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,800
so that I can have an opinion on this, you know?

2410
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,640
But Barry's like, I'm not going to play those games.

2411
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,440
He wasn't even successful financially.

2412
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,320
It was a failed movie.

2413
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,960
It wasn't even like the most popular thing.

2414
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,640
So why is anime man talking to him?

2415
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,640
Why was he talking about the main game?

2416
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,640
Hercules world is in every single Kingdom Hearts.

2417
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,320
It's relevant to the Kingdom Hearts main game.

2418
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,160
What?

2419
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:33,000
He's a recurring character.

2420
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,640
You go to it each time.

2421
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,680
I mean, the first two games,

2422
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,520
the first two games you go to like-

2423
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,680
Monty, didn't you watch Barry Cramer's seminal video

2424
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,680
explaining the story?

2425
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,520
Oh, and by the way-

2426
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,360
They're talking like they're friends.

2427
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,080
Hercules and anime man are talking as if they are friends.

2428
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,840
Like, they know each other like they're like,

2429
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,920
oh hey dude, what the fuck, welcome to ancient Greece.

2430
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,760
The-

2431
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,600
No.

2432
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,440
The Hercules world.

2433
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,280
This is impossible.

2434
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,640
In Kingdom Hearts one and Kingdom Hearts two

2435
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,360
was host to the dope Colosseum thing

2436
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,960
where you fight like series of battles

2437
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,240
and unlock epic dope shit at the towards the end of the game

2438
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,240
and you can go through and it gets, it's awesome stuff.

2439
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,320
You can refight battles with bosses over and over there.

2440
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,640
Not in Kingdom Hearts three.

2441
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,280
Just not there, just not there.

2442
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,160
That's just a small point.

2443
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,000
Well, whatever.

2444
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,960
I just wanna say, I don't besmirch Barry Cramer

2445
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,480
for making a video relevant to a thing.

2446
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,400
I, you know, whatever, I respect the hustle.

2447
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,160
People, you know, you wanna grow your channel,

2448
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,600
you gotta do stuff like that.

2449
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,720
I just don't think that that video will ever be looked on

2450
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,040
as anything like particularly good by anyone.

2451
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:35,880
And it was-

2452
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,720
There was nothing-

2453
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,200
That he has spent his time on it.

2454
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,680
There was nothing stopping him

2455
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,720
from just finishing the fucking game.

2456
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,760
He just didn't want to.

2457
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,040
Even if he did finish the game,

2458
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,440
the video would have been like from a perspective

2459
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,880
of a person who just sort of kind of-

2460
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,840
Well, in fairness, let's be fair.

2461
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,560
I haven't played any Kingdom Hearts games

2462
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,600
since the second one like 15 years ago

2463
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,640
and I made my video about it in less than a day.

2464
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,640
Yeah.

2465
01:34:59,120 --> 01:34:59,960
That sounds about right.

2466
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,240
Your video has like, like the point of it

2467
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,480
is obviously different from the point of those videos.

2468
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,000
Like, again, like what I was praising Nate's video for

2469
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,880
is the fact that he's taking the piss out of it

2470
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,240
and admitting this doesn't matter.

2471
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,760
Well, I just mean, let's not,

2472
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,480
let's not pull out the torches and pitchforks

2473
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,080
for Barry Cramer for not finishing the second game

2474
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:21,920
when-

2475
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,760
No, yeah, but your video isn't,

2476
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,400
I'm explaining the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

2477
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,120
That's what makes it annoying is that it's like

2478
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,720
you didn't experience the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

2479
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,000
How can you talk about it with any kind of like,

2480
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,760
how can you capture the essence of it in any way?

2481
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,600
You know-

2482
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,560
So we're just inter-thieves.

2483
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,240
You want to buy a sundial?

2484
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,080
That is true.

2485
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:45,920
Remember that guy?

2486
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,760
Remember?

2487
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,320
Hey, you want to buy a sundial?

2488
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,440
Remember that guy?

2489
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,520
Well, I am an elitist.

2490
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,320
I don't want to actually act like no one's allowed

2491
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,920
to make a video unless they have like more information

2492
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,960
or like experience than me.

2493
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:58,960
Okay, that's fair.

2494
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,720
I suppose what it really is is a more of like,

2495
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,280
it's more of like, why will I care about your video?

2496
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,680
Like, you know, will it last the test of time?

2497
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,880
It's all like quality concerns

2498
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,880
as opposed to like permission to make a video.

2499
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,160
It's where none of us have watched this video either.

2500
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,320
So we're all just like,

2501
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,160
just getting angry at the mere thought and idea.

2502
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,320
But just the fact that I know

2503
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,120
he didn't beat Kingdom Hearts fucking too.

2504
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,040
Right.

2505
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:21,880
Why would you-

2506
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:22,720
Insulting.

2507
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,080
It hurts my soul, but that's okay.

2508
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,000
I'm going to beat his heart into the ground.

2509
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,800
Even the lowly hypocrite beat Kingdom Hearts too.

2510
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,480
Yeah, the furtive hypocrite.

2511
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,320
You know what's funny is,

2512
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,160
it's so easily overlooked.

2513
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,600
I'm realizing I did a video just like Nate's Kingdom,

2514
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,000
not Nate's, Jesse's Kingdom Hearts video

2515
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,280
about Fate's Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works

2516
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,560
back when that came out.

2517
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:44,920
Where it was basically just like,

2518
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,640
hey, fate's coming out.

2519
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,960
Here's all the things I do know about fate,

2520
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,200
which is not very much, but I'm excited, you know?

2521
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,480
Like, why not?

2522
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,520
And how did that go?

2523
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,800
Went really well.

2524
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,360
Well, all right, there you go, I guess.

2525
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,200
Very did nothing wrong.

2526
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,240
Well, there's a price for unjudgment.

2527
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:07,240
I mean, it's worth noting that my completely terrible

2528
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,840
and utterly worthless rambling Kingdom Hearts video

2529
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:15,840
already has surpassed in views the epic and amazing

2530
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,600
stupid characterable video

2531
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,000
that I've wanted to make forever.

2532
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:19,840
No!

2533
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,160
And put a lot of my heart and soul into it.

2534
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,160
Yeah, that says a lot.

2535
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,760
We all know, we know how this works.

2536
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,520
I put out the world over album

2537
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,840
at the last day of last year.

2538
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,200
I think it has less than 10,000 views still.

2539
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,560
I spent all year working on it, you know?

2540
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,160
In the background, all year.

2541
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,640
The next day, I put out a vlog

2542
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,000
called Like It's Okay to Hate Anime

2543
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,040
that I just had the idea for on the spur of the moment,

2544
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,360
recorded in like five minutes,

2545
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,440
didn't even really agree with it, watching it back,

2546
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,720
and posted it anyway, and it's got like 50,000 views.

2547
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,560
Like, we know how it works.

2548
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,360
We'll never surprise me, but it will always make me sad.

2549
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,200
It will always disappoint.

2550
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,600
As content boys on YouTube and otherwise,

2551
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,080
I mean, the purpose of what I'm doing

2552
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:01,640
with like my Weagawa approach is like,

2553
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,960
I'm making my ones for them,

2554
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,280
so I just have the freedom to make the ones for me.

2555
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,120
And, you know, that's gonna be my way forward.

2556
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,240
Which is the name of a Keyblade, but anyway.

2557
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,960
I remember Oath Taker.

2558
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,120
That's actually the Oath Keeper.

2559
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:18,960
Isn't it Oath Keeper?

2560
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,800
Oath Keeper, there you go.

2561
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,760
That's a base fest.

2562
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,200
Which George R.R. Martin would famously rip off.

2563
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,040
Oh yeah.

2564
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,080
Am I thinking of the Weight of the Dawn?

2565
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,000
Okay, whatever.

2566
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,480
No, there's definitely an Oath Keeper.

2567
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,640
No, no, I meant Weight Forward.

2568
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,560
Oh, Weight Forward is the game that made Shantae.

2569
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,600
Okay, yeah, never mind.

2570
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,440
I was thinking of the Weight of the Dawn.

2571
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,800
But Oath Keeper is also,

2572
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,360
when the Stark sword is melted down,

2573
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,720
it's forged into two swords,

2574
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,240
and Bran gets one of them.

2575
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,000
Right, Tyrion Lannister naming it

2576
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,280
after his favorite video game, Kingdom Hearts One,

2577
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,840
where Sora gets that Keyblade from Kyrie.

2578
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,120
Tyrion has really patrician taste in anime.

2579
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,640
When are they gonna make a cross between DreamWorks

2580
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,320
and what's the other one?

2581
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,480
Get out, Miss Swamp!

2582
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:56,800
There it is.

2583
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:01,800
Yeah, I wanna play PS4 Shrek meets anime.

2584
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:05,120
Oh, so you mean you want like Dragon Quest

2585
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,480
meets DreamWorks, right?

2586
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,080
Dragon Quest meets DreamWorks.

2587
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:09,920
Now we're talking.

2588
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,760
I wanna go to Eldorado.

2589
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,120
I wanna do all the cool shit.

2590
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,240
I wanna be the Prince of Egypt.

2591
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,880
We can go to Eldorado and see that

2592
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,680
unusually fit Mayan girl.

2593
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,920
The studio that made like Coraline and Kubo,

2594
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,040
you could do them with, yeah,

2595
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,080
Leica with Atlas then, for the persona.

2596
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,320
What about that one, Rango, Dango,

2597
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,080
with Johnny Depp as that lizard?

2598
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:30,920
Jango.

2599
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,740
Rango.

2600
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:32,560
Rango.

2601
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,400
That was a Jango.

2602
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,240
Not Jango.

2603
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,240
Oh, I wanna go to the Jango world in Kingdom Hearts,

2604
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,720
and you know.

2605
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,920
Yeah, you know, Quentin Tarantino plus Steven Universe.

2606
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:41,760
You know that?

2607
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:47,160
I wanna be Sora in there, in that saloon

2608
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,760
in the snowstorm with the hateful ape,

2609
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,000
with Samuel L. Jackson telling me about

2610
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,200
how he whipped out his big black cock

2611
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:56,200
and fuckin' mouth break to dude

2612
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,840
cause he was a slaver's son or something.

2613
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,680
You know.

2614
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,520
Call him.

2615
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:01,360
We got him.

2616
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,200
We got him.

2617
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,040
We got him.

2618
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:03,880
We need the series.

2619
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,720
Yes, it does happen.

2620
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,560
Yes, it does happen.

2621
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,960
There's a long monologue about making this white dude

2622
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,560
suck his big black cock and it was pretty sick.

2623
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:12,960
We need the Kingdom Hearts to grow with its audience.

2624
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,800
Hmm.

2625
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,640
He said pretend it's not.

2626
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,160
Disney absorbs the Tarantino library,

2627
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,000
and then now they can do that.

2628
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,160
I mean, they got Star Wars?

2629
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:22,520
They got, there was something else.

2630
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,400
When's Iron Man gonna show up in Kingdom Hearts 3?

2631
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,520
I assume any one of these days.

2632
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,520
I assume fuckin' that they didn't make a Star Wars world

2633
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,360
in Kingdom Hearts,

2634
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,040
but I really would've liked to see that.

2635
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,080
I don't know why they did that.

2636
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:35,920
I mean, okay.

2637
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,240
Because the game's been in development

2638
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,520
before they got the rights to

2639
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,000
it.

2640
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,840
Probably.

2641
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,680
So it can't have it in there.

2642
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,120
Well, the end of this saga,

2643
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,720
maybe with the next saga they'll be like,

2644
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,400
okay it's kind of a fresh start time,

2645
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,040
let's get fuckin' Marvel and Star Wars involved.

2646
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:49,880
Oh, shit.

2647
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,740
So it's not the end?

2648
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,560
No, it's not the end.

2649
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,400
No, it is not.

2650
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,240
Oh, cool.

2651
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:54,120
Why?

2652
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,960
I can't wait.

2653
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,780
I'm looking forward to it.

2654
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:58,440
You're the only one I have ever experienced 3 so far

2655
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,980
because me and Digi only played it

2656
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:04,460
for a couple hours on the Ryan game stream so far,

2657
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,560
is I sat down,

2658
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,360
I booted up the game for the first time.

2659
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,520
It was like, oh man.

2660
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:14,080
Kingdom Hearts 3. This game is real. This is pretty crazy. I can't believe after all

2661
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:19,200
this time it actually physically exists and is in my possession. And I'm just, you know,

2662
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:24,000
going along, going through the opening, listening to the babble that passes for cutscenes in

2663
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,600
Kingdom Hearts. I'm like, yeah, yeah, I've played a few of these. I've been here before.

2664
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:34,040
And then it fades out and all of a sudden a title comes in. Kingdom Hearts 2.9. I'm

2665
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:43,720
like, oh, my fucking god. No, the box, the box lied to me. What is happening? How is

2666
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:49,280
this possible? I made a joke about this on Twitter a year ago and now it happened. It

2667
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:56,480
was a joke. The meaning, yeah, I get it. Okay. The only meaning of that is that that cutscene

2668
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,800
and that the beginning of the game is like of what Sora and Kairi and Riku and whatever

2669
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:06,080
we're doing. That was actually part of the Kingdom Hearts 2.8 package. It was the secret

2670
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:11,360
ending that you unlock where it shows, it literally shows up everything right up to,

2671
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:16,480
like it overlaps with the beginning of Kingdom Hearts 3 as Sora heads off to Olympus Colosseum.

2672
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,440
All of that was Kingdom Hearts 2.9 in Kingdom Hearts 3.

2673
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,080
Do you guys have stupid that sentence?

2674
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,080
If you do.

2675
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:26,680
So Kingdom Hearts 2. So Kingdom Hearts 3. Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually Kingdom Hearts

2676
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,680
3 though, right?

2677
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:28,680
Yeah.

2678
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:31,800
Later, the Kingdom Hearts 3 logo comes in today.

2679
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:38,680
I'll add to Tom's impressions after the first four hours. Game seems not fun at all from

2680
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,280
watching Tom has had no fun so far, pretty much.

2681
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:43,280
No.

2682
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,280
Are you still Olympus?

2683
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,280
He's still Olympus.

2684
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,280
We just finished Twilight Town.

2685
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,480
Well, it's Square, so you know the fun starts at around 38 hours in.

2686
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,480
Yeah, yeah.

2687
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,480
Yeah, that's correct.

2688
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:57,040
The thing I hate the most is that in regards to the running up walls like Hippo was saying,

2689
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:02,040
I hate how everything that you can action with has like that white line going up it.

2690
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,040
It looks so bad.

2691
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:08,320
They turned the entire world shiny because you can run on everything and it looks like

2692
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,320
shit.

2693
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:10,320
I hate it.

2694
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,320
I hate it.

2695
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,320
I know they did it.

2696
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,320
It also makes it...

2697
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,320
You fucking negative man.

2698
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,800
It makes you feel even worse about the stuff you can't climb up because like in Traverse

2699
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,640
Town you can climb up like the buildings but then there's a wall around the town that

2700
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,720
you can't climb and so you're just like, oh, okay.

2701
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,720
So I understand why they did it so you could distinguish what you can and can't climb.

2702
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:32,360
But you can climb most things and it's just like there's other aesthetics they could have

2703
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:35,720
used that would have done the same thing, not so annoying.

2704
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:41,040
But I do think the reason for that and the game is known for being very easy and also

2705
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:46,920
for the stupid long pauses in the cutscenes is probably just because it's a baby game.

2706
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,160
Like the long pauses are kids can watch it and take it all in, I think.

2707
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,160
I'm sure that...

2708
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:56,120
I mean, I absolutely feel this is a game made for the masses, absolutely.

2709
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,840
It is not made for like hardcore, Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, speedrun level one players,

2710
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,520
although there is a level one option that you can choose, at least on pride mode that

2711
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,520
I'm playing on.

2712
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,040
So maybe I should have fucking done that and then the game would actually be hard.

2713
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,960
I think that's in every mode or at least I can see it in mine.

2714
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,320
I was just playing normal mode.

2715
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:15,680
By the way, Gib, the other reason that I have such strong negative emotions about the flow

2716
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:21,080
motion stuff is because the flow motion stuff is very much like it was in Dream Drop Distance.

2717
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,080
The whole structure...

2718
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,640
I'm going to talk about this in my wee Agua, but the whole structure of the game is such

2719
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:31,240
a way to give you cool flow motion stuff that has completely removed any like platforming

2720
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,320
challenges.

2721
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,840
They are gone from the game.

2722
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,320
Nate, platforming was always the worst thing about the game.

2723
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:38,320
Correct.

2724
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,320
Correct.

2725
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,320
I always liked it.

2726
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:41,320
Absolutely.

2727
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,320
I missed it.

2728
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,560
You guys are wrong and I won't admit it.

2729
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,280
Specifically Kingdom Hearts One was like dreadful.

2730
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,200
Kingdom Hearts Two was okay.

2731
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,200
It just wasn't very interesting.

2732
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,240
It was just like, I can see a thing up there.

2733
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:54,240
How do I jump?

2734
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:56,000
I guess I need to come back when I have another thing.

2735
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Well, fine.

2736
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Okay.

2737
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,400
Platforming was kind of frustrating in Kingdom Hearts One, just the way to do it.

2738
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,960
Even if you guys talk about it, can't you fly in those games?

2739
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:04,960
But that's the thing, Jesse.

2740
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:10,320
You eventually in Kingdom Hearts One, you eventually unlock movement abilities one by

2741
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:15,040
one and it's satisfying and gives you access to new areas and it feels great.

2742
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,040
That was completely removed.

2743
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:21,960
Yeah, but like certain things that you have to do before you get those powers are like

2744
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:24,000
platforming segments, which are terrible.

2745
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,960
People always bring up Wonderland, it was really frustrating the first time you do it, which

2746
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:28,960
is true.

2747
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,520
Yeah, and Tarzan and like all of them.

2748
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,400
All of them are bad until you get flying and then it's sort of okay.

2749
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,560
But I like when a game starts shit and then turns good.

2750
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,560
I like it.

2751
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,560
Yeah, I think I'm with you.

2752
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,760
I like when games are good and get better.

2753
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,560
We got to stop talking about Kingdom Hearts.

2754
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,680
When you get gliding, it feels great.

2755
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,680
Yeah, you go God mode.

2756
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,560
Gliding in Kingdom Hearts feels so good.

2757
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:53,600
Dare we give up that euphoria of finally getting good movement mechanics, even though we have

2758
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,320
to suffer through 40 hours of shit movement mechanics.

2759
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,320
I say no.

2760
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,640
I mean, at this point we've waited 15 years for them, so they might as well put them

2761
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,640
at the beginning of the game.

2762
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:07,000
I'm very happy they put Dodger back in the same thing and not something you have to unlock.

2763
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,120
Tease me just a little more, please.

2764
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,120
No, please.

2765
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,120
Daddy, no more.

2766
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,120
No more Kingdom Hearts.

2767
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,120
We've been talking about this for 15.

2768
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,120
Yeah.

2769
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,160
Yeah, I guess.

2770
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,160
Zen, huckstable.

2771
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,160
Hey, what's up?

2772
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,160
Oh, yeah.

2773
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,320
Just to close it out, I'm definitely hooked on Kingdom Hearts and I'm going to play every

2774
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,320
single game now.

2775
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:26,320
Good.

2776
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,320
Amazing.

2777
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,320
Kingdom Hearts 1.

2778
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,320
Great game.

2779
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,320
They're not super long as far as RPGs go.

2780
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,840
Zen, have you thought of anything to talk about in this long 45 minutes that we've been

2781
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,680
talking about Kingdom Hearts?

2782
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,600
I haven't thought of a thing.

2783
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:41,080
Nate came to me yesterday and he was like, oh, you think of a topic or two or three and

2784
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:44,000
I was like, I can think of zero and here we are.

2785
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Fair enough.

2786
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,880
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.

2787
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,680
No, we're all the same.

2788
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:52,200
We're all fucking calm, empty handed.

2789
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,200
Hey, I brought something.

2790
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,200
I brought something.

2791
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,200
How the hell do you do it?

2792
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,200
Well.

2793
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,200
It's for your fucking self, bitch.

2794
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,200
Yeah.

2795
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,200
Well, okay.

2796
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,200
We're actually clearly divided along lines of those who put an effort and those who

2797
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,200
don't.

2798
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,200
And you know, it's pretty clear who's who.

2799
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,200
No, I didn't put an effort, but it's-

2800
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,200
The problem is-

2801
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,200
No, I fucking brought a topic.

2802
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,200
Oh, did you?

2803
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,200
I brought a thing to talk about.

2804
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,200
Don't you remember?

2805
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,200
It was less than an hour ago.

2806
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Oh, I forgot, that was good.

2807
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:17,400
The thing that I always make the exact same mistake every single time I write that note

2808
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:22,800
for the PCP, where I make notes that are like, I want to like pace myself and like explain

2809
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:27,000
like a thought that I'm having, which is not at all like the way to make notes for the

2810
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
PCP.

2811
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,200
No, this is not a conductive environment to explaining things.

2812
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,200
Exactly.

2813
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,200
Exactly, Jesse.

2814
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:37,800
Like, it's not about like making thoughts happen and explaining yourself.

2815
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,600
It's just about screaming and about fucking playing video games with Hercules from Disney's

2816
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Hercules on them.

2817
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
That's all this is about.

2818
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:53,800
Here's my pre-show process for the PCP is that it's usually like 1258 and I see an

2819
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,000
at everyone notification and I go, oh my God, it's Sunday already?

2820
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
And then-

2821
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,600
I need to praise the Lord right now.

2822
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,600
Yeah.

2823
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,100
I go, fuck, I'll be on.

2824
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:08,800
And then while I'm setting up my mic, I think, is there anything I could possibly talk about?

2825
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,200
And usually I just based on whatever I've been doing and like what I could, like, you

2826
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:15,400
know, the whole YouTube thing, like that's all I've been fucking doing is-

2827
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,400
Well, I'm reading Hentai right now.

2828
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,000
So like, you want to talk about that?

2829
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I'm down.

2830
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Right now?

2831
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Hell yeah.

2832
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Yeah, right now.

2833
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Yeah, what do you got?

2834
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Back it up and push it.

2835
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,400
Well, if you follow Zenhuxtable on Twitter and you use mobile where it shows you people's

2836
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,800
liked tweets, expect to be flooded with porn.

2837
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,900
I mean, you hear that, huh?

2838
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:35,900
He's not the king.

2839
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:36,900
There's more.

2840
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:40,200
There's more prolific porn likers out there.

2841
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,200
Yeah.

2842
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,200
But he is guilty.

2843
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,200
But he is guilty.

2844
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,200
It's a tough one to find.

2845
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,200
Hippo's a huge porn liker.

2846
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,200
Tough to find someone who likes it more.

2847
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,200
Yeah.

2848
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,200
Biggest porn liker I know, maybe.

2849
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,200
Hippo's fucking horny.

2850
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,200
Horny on man.

2851
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,200
He's just very clandestine about it.

2852
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,200
I've never seen him.

2853
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,200
When did it become okay to like porn?

2854
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,200
That's what I want to fucking know.

2855
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:01,200
When did it become okay to just openly say, like, yeah, I have sex.

2856
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,200
Yeah, especially on Sunday.

2857
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,200
Let's go back.

2858
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,200
I know no one will agree with me.

2859
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:09,200
I know that everyone thinks that sex is cool now for whatever fucking reason you've got

2860
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,200
in your head.

2861
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:14,200
But I just want everyone to go back to the time where everyone was fucking ashamed of themselves.

2862
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:17,200
I miss it so fucking much every day of my life.

2863
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,200
I sort of agree.

2864
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,200
Look, I don't know.

2865
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:23,200
I'm one of these guys who's open about liking hentai and porn and stuff, and I think that's

2866
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:24,200
generally good.

2867
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:28,200
But I don't want to hear a damn word about your actual sex life.

2868
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,200
I don't want to hear anything about that.

2869
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,200
I find that mega weird, Nate.

2870
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:33,200
Honestly.

2871
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,200
I find that mega weird.

2872
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,200
I don't know why.

2873
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,200
It's so different for me.

2874
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:39,200
I've compartmentalized them completely, and they feel like totally different.

2875
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,200
No.

2876
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:44,200
I understand what you're saying, because, like, you know, like, that side of me is a filthy

2877
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,200
fucking animal.

2878
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:49,200
I don't want anyone else to see that, and fucking, I don't want to see anyone else's filthy animal.

2879
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,200
I know you've got one inside you.

2880
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,200
I don't want to see it.

2881
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:59,200
It all depends on how you think about sex and the sex that you have.

2882
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:03,200
Because, like, I mean, to me, that's like saying, like, oh, I don't want to think about it.

2883
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,200
I don't want to talk about it.

2884
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:05,200
It's too powerful.

2885
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,200
No, go.

2886
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,200
Go on.

2887
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,200
Go on.

2888
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:13,200
To me, it's like, if you were to say, like, oh, I can't stand when people talk about this

2889
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:14,200
video game.

2890
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,200
Like, I never want to hear anybody talk about that game.

2891
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:21,200
Like, it's just a thing you do that you have things to say about, just like anything else.

2892
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,200
That's no...

2893
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,200
Okay.

2894
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,200
Well, this is...

2895
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,200
Yeah, you just got it.

2896
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:31,200
What could you have to say about the sex that you have that, like, needs to be brought

2897
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,200
to, like, public attention?

2898
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:36,200
Well, I mean, okay, there's a difference between it's not talking in the room and going, like,

2899
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,200
hey, everybody, I just fucking...

2900
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,200
Fuck the bitch doggy style.

2901
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,200
Like, that's annoying.

2902
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:47,200
But, like, having a conversation about sex that you have, like, it's just like having

2903
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,200
a conversation about cooking.

2904
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,200
Okay, hang on, hang on.

2905
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,200
Okay.

2906
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,200
I'll train techniques and ideas.

2907
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:54,200
Tell them I'm sorry.

2908
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,200
No.

2909
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:58,200
I am not training techniques with any of you fucks.

2910
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,200
Get out of here.

2911
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,200
You can't wait for me.

2912
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:01,200
Here's one thing that comes to mind.

2913
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:06,200
Okay, one thing that comes to mind immediately about this subject is, like, okay, sex, presumably

2914
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:10,200
with another human being, is an intrinsically private act between those two individuals.

2915
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,200
No, it's not intrinsically private.

2916
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,200
Of course it is.

2917
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,200
No, it's socially private.

2918
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,200
What are you talking about?

2919
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,200
What are you talking about?

2920
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,200
What makes it intrinsically private?

2921
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,200
Well, okay, I mean...

2922
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,200
Yeah.

2923
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,200
Okay, let's just...

2924
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:25,200
Like, is it fair for me to, like, expose deep...

2925
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,200
Because I wouldn't want someone to do this to me.

2926
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,200
Expose deep nuts.

2927
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,200
My sexual performance at, you know, whatever.

2928
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,200
Ask permission.

2929
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,200
Well, yeah, no, like, yeah, you shouldn't divulge.

2930
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,200
What am I going to do with that?

2931
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,200
The only thing that makes it quote-unquote intrinsically private is that there's another person that

2932
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,200
you have to ask in order to, like...

2933
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,200
Well, okay.

2934
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:48,200
Very early into my relationship, I was like, hey, is it okay if I talk about sex that we've

2935
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:49,200
had on our...

2936
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,200
On my show?

2937
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,200
You know, like...

2938
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,200
I guess it's just that the...

2939
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,200
My answer to that question is no.

2940
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,200
I don't want anyone to know.

2941
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,200
Okay, yeah.

2942
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:58,200
So it's different from person to person.

2943
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,200
The weirdest part about what you said was the word intrinsic.

2944
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,200
Like, there's...

2945
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:05,960
It's not even slightly intrinsic, because if you have a sexually open culture, nobody

2946
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,200
would question it if you talked about sex.

2947
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
Like, there's nothing intrinsic.

2948
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,200
It's entirely...

2949
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:12,200
Okay, well, I...

2950
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,200
I'm talking about something slightly different.

2951
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:18,200
There's a feeling of vulnerability here, I guess, that I just don't care for personally.

2952
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:19,200
Right.

2953
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,200
That's just you, though.

2954
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,200
Like, I don't feel vulnerable talking about sex.

2955
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,200
It's not just him.

2956
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,200
I get that.

2957
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,200
Okay.

2958
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,200
I think it would be great about talking about my sex life, because I have good sex, and

2959
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,200
I want to brag about it.

2960
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,200
Enough!

2961
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,200
Enough!

2962
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,200
No!

2963
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,200
It's not about having good sex.

2964
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:34,200
Case important.

2965
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,200
There we go.

2966
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,200
That's not what this is about.

2967
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,200
Why not?

2968
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,200
If you...

2969
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,200
Okay.

2970
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,200
Nobody wants to talk about the food they make if they eat shitty food.

2971
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,200
Like, if you make...

2972
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,200
If you do something well and you enjoy doing it, you want to talk about it.

2973
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,200
Look, I do agree...

2974
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,200
That's true for everything.

2975
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:49,200
I agree that society should be more naturalist and everybody should be fucking like animals

2976
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,200
in the streets.

2977
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,200
I agree with that.

2978
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,200
I just don't want to hear about it or talk about it.

2979
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,200
That's it.

2980
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,200
That's fine.

2981
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,200
I don't want to say that.

2982
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,200
I'm just imagining...

2983
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:01,200
I'm just imagining a world where people are fucking in the streets and you just pass them

2984
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:04,200
by and make sure they don't talk about it.

2985
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:07,200
It's called the Polinic Girls Attack, and that is the plot.

2986
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:08,200
That's the world that I want.

2987
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,200
Wait, wait...

2988
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,200
I prefer that one where they just legalized rape.

2989
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,200
That's my favorite one.

2990
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:16,200
Have any of you seen the Polinic Girls Attack, which is one of the best Hentai OVA?

2991
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,200
No.

2992
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,200
No, no, I don't.

2993
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,200
No.

2994
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:23,200
It's a show where pollen is personified as naked girls who fuck people randomly.

2995
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:28,200
So if you are allergic to pollen, it just means you're constantly getting fucked by these

2996
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,200
hot girls.

2997
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:33,200
And so all over the city, just everyone is just like fucking in the streets or on buses.

2998
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:38,200
You're constantly seeing sex, but everyone's trying to pretend it's not happening and go

2999
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:39,200
about their normal day.

3000
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,200
That's hilarious.

3001
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,200
That's really cool.

3002
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,200
It's really embarrassing for them and stuff.

3003
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,200
There'll be people like...

3004
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:47,200
There's a girl in episode either one or two.

3005
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,200
But they can't help it.

3006
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:52,520
There's a girl who's on the bus and this boy who she likes sits next to her and she's

3007
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:55,320
like really nervous, but then she has allergies.

3008
01:53:55,320 --> 01:54:00,000
So she starts getting fucked in front of him, but it's like by other girl pollen.

3009
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,040
So then she's all embarrassed about it, but he's like, no, I understand.

3010
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,040
You've got allergies.

3011
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,020
He's clearly embarrassed, but he's trying to be strong about it.

3012
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:09,020
It's adorable.

3013
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:10,020
It's a great fucking OVA.

3014
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:11,020
Wait, wait, what's going on?

3015
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:12,020
Is this the thing you wrote?

3016
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,020
Sounds like a thing you wrote.

3017
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,520
No, it's a really good anime OVA.

3018
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,520
Go watch it.

3019
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,520
The Polinic Girls Attack.

3020
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,520
I don't believe it.

3021
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:18,520
I don't believe this is a good anime OVA.

3022
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,520
It's like my favorite porn anime.

3023
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,520
I've never heard you talk about it.

3024
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,520
What started this in my mind is not like people talking about their sex lives.

3025
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:33,520
What I'm talking about is like a discord channel for posting porn and like being like,

3026
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,520
wow, I love that fucking big kiss on that girl.

3027
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:40,520
Like a bunch of guys just all getting around and be like, oh man, look at the vagina on

3028
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,520
that one.

3029
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,520
Ah, yeah, dude.

3030
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,520
Wait, wait, quick question.

3031
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,520
How many of you have an NSFW board on your server?

3032
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:47,520
I have two.

3033
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,520
I figured you have to have one or else people complain about the lack of it.

3034
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,520
People demanded of me and I refuse outright.

3035
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,520
Yeah, that's fine.

3036
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,520
Oh my God.

3037
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,520
No, it's completely normal.

3038
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,520
People come in and they see and they're like, okay, cool.

3039
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:03,520
I'm not against it, but yeah, I wouldn't participate in a discussion like that.

3040
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,520
For sure.

3041
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,520
Yeah, exactly.

3042
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,520
I'm not trying to say that it's like morally wrong.

3043
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,520
It just grosses me out and I hate you if you do.

3044
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,520
Honestly, it's funny.

3045
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,520
Don't look at the channel.

3046
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,520
You know what's funny?

3047
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,520
I don't need to be in part in a community of people posting the porn that they just

3048
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:22,520
nutted to and it's like, oh, maybe there's some good shit in there.

3049
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,520
I can find the good shit on my own.

3050
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:25,520
Thank you very much.

3051
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,520
It's more about the fact that I just hate people and don't like talking about them.

3052
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,520
The purpose of talking about sex is to get sex.

3053
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:35,520
And if I'm not trying to get sex, I don't want to fucking talk to your ass.

3054
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:36,520
Get the fuck away from me.

3055
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:37,520
I basically agree.

3056
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,520
More or less.

3057
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:42,520
I don't go out of my way to talk to anybody about sex.

3058
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,520
But if sex comes up in conversation.

3059
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,520
Right.

3060
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,520
Just comes up naturally.

3061
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,520
Exactly.

3062
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,520
And among certain people, it does if everyone's comfortable.

3063
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
It's not unusual.

3064
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:58,520
It really comes down to the individual how you feel about it because tons of people are...

3065
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,520
I mean, that's true of anything, really.

3066
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,520
Any discussion topic.

3067
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,520
Some people don't want you to talk about politics in front of them at all.

3068
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,520
And some people are eager and not even going to get mad and are just going to have a good

3069
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,520
time talking about it.

3070
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,520
Same goes for this.

3071
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:17,520
But it's a lot easier to talk about porn than sex because, you know, you can't share your

3072
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,520
sexual experiences with someone else directly unless you fuck them too, I guess.

3073
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:22,520
And it won't be the same.

3074
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:28,520
But like, you know, you can always share porn and it's really interesting to...

3075
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
I like getting porn recommendations.

3076
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,520
Like me and my...

3077
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:32,520
Yeah, exactly.

3078
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
Me and my previous group of friends used to talk about porn at the same time.

3079
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,520
It just established the fact that, yeah, we jack off.

3080
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,520
And it's like, here's a person that I think people would enjoy.

3081
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
So you just link that shit into your servers.

3082
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,520
Yeah, I'm over that.

3083
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:44,520
That's all it is to me.

3084
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,520
In general, I feel.

3085
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,520
I mean, I could easily, like, if I saw...

3086
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:53,520
I think I just watched a porn, like, last night that I literally thought Ben would like this.

3087
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,520
A porn.

3088
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:58,520
Because it was, you know, some gothy, like, you know, Avril Lavigne looking chic.

3089
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:01,520
And I was just like, yeah, that's a Ben slide if I've ever seen one.

3090
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,520
Ben slide allergies.

3091
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:05,520
I don't...

3092
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:06,520
I don't know if I...

3093
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,520
I don't like that in porn.

3094
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,520
I don't have any particular feeling about that aesthetic in porn.

3095
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,520
To me, it's just weird when there's a channel.

3096
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,520
And it's like in a friend group of, like, people who I know and I've spoken to,

3097
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,520
and I know them on, like, a personal basis.

3098
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,520
And I don't know.

3099
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:24,520
I just think it's weird when they're talking about all the people they want to have sex with

3100
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,520
and all the things they've had sex with.

3101
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:27,520
I just don't want to hear it.

3102
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,520
I just don't think it's cool when I hear it.

3103
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,520
You know, like, for me...

3104
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,520
Yeah, okay, go ahead.

3105
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,520
In my channel, there is no talking.

3106
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
It's just a slew of pictures.

3107
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:37,520
That's all it is.

3108
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,520
That's how it is.

3109
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,520
It's way different for me.

3110
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,520
For me, it's like when I post a link and then they're like,

3111
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,520
oh, fucking love vaginas, dude.

3112
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,520
Haha, yeah, dude, me too.

3113
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:48,520
It's like the comments under an ex-hentai, like, individual page of like,

3114
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
yeah, boy, I also nutted.

3115
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:51,520
I love reading those comments.

3116
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,520
I always go to the comments.

3117
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,520
It's those comments, but the people who I know,

3118
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,520
the people who I know made them.

3119
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,520
I don't know.

3120
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,520
What has to happen in your life

3121
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:05,520
for you to end up leaving comments on porn videos?

3122
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:06,520
That's a good question.

3123
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
Some of them have a ton of comments.

3124
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,520
It's great, you know, because like,

3125
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:13,520
the assumption is that, you know, they jacked off

3126
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:17,520
and then they somehow weren't ashamed of what they did after they jacked off.

3127
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,520
I guess the better question is what has to not happen in your life

3128
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,520
for you to end up like that?

3129
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,520
Okay, that's exactly what I was going to say, Jesse,

3130
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,520
because I, like, the kind of the way I think about it is,

3131
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,520
I think about sex this way in general,

3132
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:32,520
when I want sex, like, it consumes my thoughts

3133
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,520
and that's what needs to be done.

3134
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:36,520
Once it's done, I become a true philosopher

3135
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:40,520
and it's time to do everything else that matters in life.

3136
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
And like, when I see people spending time

3137
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,520
in like an NSF work chat or whatever,

3138
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,520
I'm like, okay, guys, just nut, then you can get on with your day

3139
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,520
and you can go like do stuff.

3140
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:53,520
Yeah, it's kind of like, honestly, I think I'm doing a public service.

3141
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,520
When at long last I get off, I feel liberated.

3142
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,520
I'm like, thank God, I'm free.

3143
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:01,520
Yeah, when you see someone in their everyday life

3144
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,520
talking about sex that they're not currently having,

3145
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:07,520
it's like if you saw Superman typing an article

3146
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,520
for the Daily Planet in his Superman clothes,

3147
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,520
like, what are you doing?

3148
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:13,520
Go out there and save some people and do Superman stuff.

3149
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,520
I couldn't deal more.

3150
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:15,520
Get it out of here.

3151
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,520
Honestly, like, not only will I,

3152
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:22,520
I will literally stop doing things to go jack off

3153
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:26,520
and go make myself hard to do that, to have fun.

3154
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:29,520
I do that, but I don't feel good about it.

3155
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,520
Why not? You're doing it.

3156
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:34,520
Like, why would you do something and then guilt yourself over it?

3157
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,520
You already fucking did it.

3158
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:39,520
Well, I only feel guilty because it's like

3159
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,520
I could have been doing something better.

3160
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,520
I could have not wasted that time, but I did.

3161
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:48,520
You can feel that way about literally every second you spend on this.

3162
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:49,520
Okay, sure.

3163
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,520
Every second that you are not genuinely wasting your time.

3164
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,520
That's a particularly useless way to spend time.

3165
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,520
The whole idea of, like, pornography or, like,

3166
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,520
jacking it as it is, being, like, a time-wasting,

3167
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:06,520
it is a time-waster in the sense that you're not making anything,

3168
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
you're not being productive,

3169
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
unless you're literally producing life.

3170
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,520
Indeed, indeed.

3171
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,520
Yes, yes.

3172
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:15,520
But, like, anything, any other thing,

3173
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,520
like entertainment in general, is also that.

3174
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,520
True.

3175
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,520
You're not getting anything out of it necessarily.

3176
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,520
No, it's different.

3177
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
But you need it. You need to entertain yourself.

3178
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:27,520
No, you're clearing your mind. It's better.

3179
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,520
Watching a show or something.

3180
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:29,520
At least you can learn something.

3181
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:31,520
At least you're having a new experience.

3182
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,520
No, this is fucking, this is a really fucked weird conversation.

3183
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,520
And I don't know how to insert myself into it

3184
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:39,520
because I have to talk about sex and nobody wants that.

3185
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,520
Insert myself?

3186
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,520
No!

3187
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,520
I get as much out of having sex as I do out of, like, eating.

3188
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,520
Like, you, it's-

3189
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:49,520
Yeah, very little, almost not.

3190
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,520
I don't get anything out of eating.

3191
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,520
Except that you gotta do it.

3192
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:55,520
Never mind, I forgot, none of you wants to be human at all.

3193
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:56,520
You just want to-

3194
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:57,520
No, whoa, whoa, whoa, Digi!

3195
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,520
Do not let me with these fucking vile creatures.

3196
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,520
I'm the most human-core person on earth.

3197
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,520
Do not say that about me.

3198
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:05,520
Listen, Digi, you're a freak.

3199
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:07,520
You don't like the Organization 13 hoodie,

3200
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:11,520
and you think you get something edifying out of eating a meal.

3201
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,520
What do you get out of eating a meal?

3202
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,520
Eating a meal is fucking great.

3203
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,520
It fulfills you on the same thing.

3204
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:17,520
I'm like a body level.

3205
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,520
I'm like a literal physical level.

3206
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:23,520
Eating a meal is only slightly less of a waste of time than jacking off.

3207
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,520
If I did have to eat food, I wouldn't do it.

3208
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,520
Jacking off is a hurdle in life.

3209
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,520
Oh, yeah, for sure.

3210
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,520
I mean, sex is an experience.

3211
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:29,520
Sex is a valuable experience.

3212
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:30,520
Jacking off is a hurdle.

3213
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:33,520
Like, I wake up every day of my life and I go,

3214
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:34,520
oh my god, I gotta-

3215
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:35,520
Eating food is a hurdle too.

3216
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:37,520
I gotta eat twice today.

3217
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,520
I gotta cum five times.

3218
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,520
I gotta shit who knows how many fucking times.

3219
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:41,520
I probably gotta pay some bills.

3220
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,520
I spend my whole day waiting for when I get to eat or fuck.

3221
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:45,520
That's all I think about.

3222
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:49,520
Like, all day I'm like, oh, I already ate like three hours ago.

3223
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,520
If I eat right now, I'll get fat.

3224
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:51,520
I gotta wait three more hours.

3225
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,520
I spend my whole day waiting for the windows between those hurdles

3226
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,520
when I can actually do something.

3227
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,520
Yeah, I mean, I think that's there for the mindset right there

3228
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,520
because I feel like I'm in Jesse's camp there.

3229
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,520
Eating, eating is a chore.

3230
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
I feel exactly the same about eating

3231
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:07,520
as I feel about doing the laundry or buying groceries.

3232
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,520
Oh my god.

3233
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:11,520
It makes me sick that like 70% of my day at least

3234
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,520
is like coming and eating and shitting.

3235
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,520
It's not-

3236
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,520
I wish I could just cut it down somehow.

3237
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,520
It's not that I don't-

3238
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,520
It's not that I don't enjoy the things I eat.

3239
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,520
Like, I cook.

3240
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,520
Like, I don't just like eat-

3241
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,520
I'm not Nate.

3242
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:24,520
I don't just eat beans out of a can.

3243
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:26,520
Like, I do cook something that tastes pretty good

3244
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:27,520
and I like it.

3245
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,520
And like, I do enjoy it to a certain extent.

3246
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:33,520
But like I said, if I could not do it, I wouldn't.

3247
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,520
Let me introduce a totally different perspective.

3248
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,520
And I was talking to Nate about this a little bit yesterday

3249
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,520
about how I heavily compartmentalize my life

3250
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,520
and I schedule it very heavily.

3251
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,520
So what happens for me is that I'm working on stuff

3252
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,520
that I feel are conducive to my future, right?

3253
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:48,520
A positive future for me all the time.

3254
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:50,520
And then when I'm not doing that, I'm eating

3255
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,520
and I'm watching shit.

3256
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:56,520
So that part of my day is like, that's the unwinding.

3257
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,520
That's like a necessary part of my day.

3258
02:02:58,520 --> 02:02:59,520
I need it.

3259
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,520
So it's like, I don't view eating or like-

3260
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,520
Well, what happens when you want to jack off

3261
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:07,520
while you're in your time zone of work time?

3262
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,520
What happens then?

3263
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,520
What is that?

3264
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,520
Like, if you feel like jacking off, as happens to me

3265
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,520
while working all the time,

3266
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:15,520
but you're in work time,

3267
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,520
do you continue to work and suppress that urge?

3268
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:22,520
Or do you deviate from your schedule to alleviate that issue?

3269
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,520
I do it like in the morning, twice a week.

3270
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,520
Okay, okay.

3271
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:27,520
Twice a week?

3272
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,520
Yeah.

3273
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,520
Oh my god, you're a genius.

3274
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:31,520
Yeah.

3275
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,520
Nate, I think you make your secret gene.

3276
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:34,520
I have a schedule.

3277
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,520
It's like a circadian rhythm.

3278
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:39,520
Wait, in the morning, twice a week.

3279
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,520
Oh my god.

3280
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,520
I'm so jealous.

3281
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,520
I'm so fucking jealous.

3282
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:43,520
I need to give you a piece of advice.

3283
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,520
It's going to sound like I'm being insincere,

3284
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,520
but I'm completely serious.

3285
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,520
If you have an erection and you want to get rid of it,

3286
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:52,520
backhand slap your dick.

3287
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,520
I do this all the time.

3288
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:00,520
If I have an unwanted bone or I just slap the shit out of my cock

3289
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:02,520
and it withers up.

3290
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,520
All of my bones are unwanted, so maybe I'll try that.

3291
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:09,520
You got to hit it with the knuckles on the back of your hand.

3292
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,520
You know what my curse is?

3293
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:15,520
My curse is that I have no heat, so I'm always freezing.

3294
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,520
So I always have my hands under my dick where it's warm.

3295
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:21,520
And so from always touching my dick,

3296
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:23,520
it gets hard like 10,000 times a day and I'm like,

3297
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,520
oh Jesus, I got to take care of this fucking shit now.

3298
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:29,520
Jesse, do you not have an electric heater?

3299
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,520
They're like $60.

3300
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,520
What's that?

3301
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:36,520
You go to Walmart and you get a little tower.

3302
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:39,520
No, I have had space heaters and electric heaters.

3303
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,520
I can't because the floor is always wet

3304
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,520
and flooding up from the tiles.

3305
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,520
So if I had a heater, it would be an electrical hazard

3306
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,520
and my house would burn down with me in it,

3307
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:51,520
which might be a good thing.

3308
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,520
How much flooding is there?

3309
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:55,520
Guys, you don't understand.

3310
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:57,520
I live in a cave.

3311
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,520
I live in a bad place.

3312
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,520
This is the moral of all of my stories and all of my anecdotes.

3313
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,520
Are you wet?

3314
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:10,520
Jesse's basement pretty much floods every single day.

3315
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:11,520
Right, no.

3316
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,520
I watched a video where you're playing with the toys

3317
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,520
and that is like, is it larger than...?

3318
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:17,520
No, that's a whole different kind.

3319
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,520
There are multiple...

3320
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:20,520
No, that's a different kind of flood.

3321
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,520
There are multiple kinds of flooding where I live.

3322
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,520
There are multiple genres of it.

3323
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:27,520
There's like rainwater and snow water up from the tiles

3324
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,520
flooding, which is like all over the room constantly

3325
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,520
for like, you know, pretty much all the time.

3326
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,520
Pretty much 365.

3327
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:35,520
Then every once in a while there's like the drain.

3328
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:39,520
There's like the drain backs up and like this weird, filthy, smelly sewer water

3329
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,520
like comes out in this huge ocean that I don't even notice

3330
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,520
because I'm in bed until I smell it and I get up and I go,

3331
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:44,520
oh my god, what the fuck?

3332
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,520
And that happens at least around like eight or nine times a year.

3333
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
Have you considered...?

3334
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,520
But there's also the leaky pipes in the ceiling.

3335
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,520
There's also the fucking...

3336
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,520
What the fuck? If I considered leaving,

3337
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,520
what the fuck did you think my catchphrase was?

3338
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,520
Help, let me out for you dumbass!

3339
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,520
I say that at the end of every video.

3340
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,520
Help, I've been saying it for...

3341
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:05,520
I've been saying it for three years.

3342
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,520
Help, let me out!

3343
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,520
I just...

3344
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
I just don't know why you're still there.

3345
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:11,520
Because it costs money.

3346
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,520
Everything in life costs money.

3347
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,520
A lot of fucking money and it's impossible.

3348
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,520
Okay, fair enough.

3349
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,520
Um...

3350
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:21,520
No, no, no, but I'm just trying to understand from like a logistical standpoint

3351
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,520
because like, how many inches were like even...

3352
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,520
Well, not feet, but like how many inches is it?

3353
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,520
Because like, you could just get a stand and put the electric heater on top of that, right?

3354
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,520
What? I...

3355
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,520
What? I don't want to talk about this anymore.

3356
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,520
I feel exposed. I feel fucking...

3357
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,520
I don't like this.

3358
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,520
Fair enough.

3359
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:37,520
I don't like where this is going.

3360
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:38,520
Hey, I got a funny story.

3361
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,520
I just wanted to recommend an electric heater because I also have no heat,

3362
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:41,520
no central heat in my head.

3363
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:45,520
I was just trying to make a funny joke about my hand being in my pants all day.

3364
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:51,520
Okay, listen to my funny story everybody.

3365
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:53,520
Here it comes, okay.

3366
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:56,520
This is the joke, the funny story.

3367
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,520
So this is a story Michelle told me.

3368
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:03,520
Okay, Munchy, let's perk up those fat fucking ears and listen to this goddamn tale.

3369
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:04,520
I'm not going to like this.

3370
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,520
This is what I'm going to make you say.

3371
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,520
You're going to like it.

3372
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:11,520
Okay, so Michelle's been going on and on about how her hot coworker is so damn hot.

3373
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,520
Her new coworker, female coworker incidentally.

3374
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,520
Michelle is gay, definitely.

3375
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:22,520
And so basically, she was stalking her Instagram as she often does

3376
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,520
and she scrolls down and she's like, yeah, looking good.

3377
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:25,520
Looking good.

3378
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,520
I'm like, yeah, that's fine.

3379
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:29,520
And then all of a sudden, she spies something that looks a little strange.

3380
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,520
What is this?

3381
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:35,520
This hot, tall, model-shaped coworker of hers.

3382
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:38,520
Why is her skin gray in this one picture?

3383
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:41,520
What's happening in this particular, what's going on?

3384
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,520
Oh, fuck yes.

3385
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:43,520
And then she scrolls a little bit more.

3386
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:46,520
Are those horns on her head?

3387
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:47,520
What's happening here?

3388
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,520
That's so glorious.

3389
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,520
And she scrolls down even more.

3390
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:52,520
Okay, glasses, a big blue arrow on her chest.

3391
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:55,520
It's Equious Cosplay by dude.

3392
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:56,520
Homestuck.

3393
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,520
She's a homestuck freak.

3394
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,520
Her weird hot coworker.

3395
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,520
Is she single?

3396
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,520
Is she single?

3397
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,520
Wait, I have a very question.

3398
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,520
Could Michelle get her number maybe?

3399
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,520
Is she muscular?

3400
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,520
I mean, maybe for a girl kind of, but not really.

3401
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,520
No.

3402
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:18,520
It's not a one-to-one accurate cosplay, tragically.

3403
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:19,520
That's really cool.

3404
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:20,520
She also did karate.

3405
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,520
And it's really funny, and you know, good job, I guess.

3406
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,520
I mean...

3407
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,520
I laughed.

3408
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,520
It was, of all the trolls, Equious was the first one,

3409
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:36,520
the only good homestuck character,

3410
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:38,520
and that's all I have to say about that.

3411
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:39,520
I'm glad, you know, I'm glad.

3412
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:41,520
I feel like, you know, Equious needs love.

3413
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:42,520
He does.

3414
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:43,520
Equious needs love.

3415
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,520
He's underappreciated, but the only good character.

3416
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,520
Oh my God.

3417
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,520
Shout out to Econ for saying that homestuck,

3418
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,520
everything after Act 4 is bad.

3419
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
Shout out to him for ruining my life.

3420
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,520
Appreciate that, Econ.

3421
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,520
Way to go.

3422
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:57,520
Thanks for ruining Munch's life, Econ.

3423
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,520
Here's another fun fact.

3424
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:02,520
I did 100 pull-ups yesterday over a 12-hour span.

3425
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,520
That was hard, and my body was giving out...

3426
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:05,520
How many in a row?

3427
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,520
How many in a row?

3428
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,520
I've been doing in batches of 10.

3429
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:08,520
Batches of 10.

3430
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,520
So, you know, nothing crazy.

3431
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,520
I think this is the perfect time.

3432
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:15,520
Nate, I quite literally cannot do 10 push-ups.

3433
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,520
What should I do?

3434
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,520
10 push-ups, you say.

3435
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,520
I did 10 push-ups the other day.

3436
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:20,520
They were really wide, too.

3437
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,520
I did 10 push-ups really wide.

3438
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,520
You're supposed to do them tight to your shoulders.

3439
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:25,520
Wide is way harder.

3440
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,520
Well, I mean, it's just a different exercise to do them wide.

3441
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:28,520
Okay, so like...

3442
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,520
How do I get up to a level break?

3443
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:31,520
My arms are sore the next day.

3444
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:32,520
I feel really good.

3445
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,520
10 out of 10.

3446
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,520
My arms feel immediately sore.

3447
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,520
Okay, no problem.

3448
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:38,520
We just have to do it every single day,

3449
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,520
and it will be easier every day, and you can do more.

3450
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:41,520
Yeah, that's all I'm going to say.

3451
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:42,520
Yeah, I know.

3452
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:43,520
I watch BoJack Horseman.

3453
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,520
Let's just say your goal is do 10 push-ups in a row,

3454
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,520
okay, or 100, or whatever, whatever the goal is.

3455
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:51,520
Okay, like however many you can do in a row,

3456
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,520
do that, then rest, then do it again,

3457
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:55,520
and like wait another...

3458
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,520
And I'd say like do like three sets or whatever.

3459
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,520
I don't know, do like 10 sets, whatever you want to do.

3460
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,520
Although I guess I'd say don't even go to failure,

3461
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:05,520
because you want to be able to do it like every day

3462
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:07,520
so that you are recovering every day.

3463
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,520
So like, I don't know, maybe you can do five.

3464
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,520
Do five in a row.

3465
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:11,520
Maybe five is too much.

3466
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,520
Just as many as you can basically.

3467
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:14,520
Chain them together.

3468
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,520
So what's the wait time between like...

3469
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:20,520
Well, like at the gym, I wait about one minute

3470
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,520
or a minute and 30 seconds between sets.

3471
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:25,520
So that seems pretty reasonable, I'd say.

3472
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:27,520
Just to speak on push-ups in particular,

3473
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:30,520
because every time I've tried to get into working out,

3474
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:32,520
I always start with push-ups,

3475
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:35,520
and I start by doing like 10 the first day,

3476
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,520
trying to do another set,

3477
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:38,520
and then it's like, oh, I can't do more.

3478
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,520
But then the next day, I can...

3479
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:43,520
The growth is so fast in the ability to do push-ups

3480
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:45,520
that usually by like day three,

3481
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:47,520
I can easily do three sets of 10.

3482
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,520
After a week, I could probably do close to 100.

3483
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:54,520
It's almost as though it's just your muscles

3484
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:57,520
getting used to the motion more so than actually bulking out.

3485
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:58,520
It is.

3486
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:01,520
This is like when people start working out,

3487
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,520
I remember when I was reading starting strength and stuff,

3488
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:07,520
like a starting lifter, like squats.

3489
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,520
Their squat increases like a huge amount really early on,

3490
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,520
and it's not because they're getting super strong

3491
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:13,520
and getting huge muscle growth,

3492
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,520
it's just because their body is learning how to do it.

3493
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,520
I honestly feel like I've become an expert in starting strength

3494
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:22,520
because of the fact that I've only ever had starting strength,

3495
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,520
and then I just let it go, deteriorate.

3496
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:26,520
So I work out for like a couple months,

3497
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,520
and I get that nice,

3498
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,520
oh yeah, things are going great,

3499
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,520
and then you hit the slump of,

3500
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:34,520
oh well, now you're no longer in the starting,

3501
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,520
it's no longer fast, and then I go,

3502
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:39,520
oh well, I'm not noticing progress anymore.

3503
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,520
By the way, the reason I brought this story-

3504
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:43,520
The master of being adequate.

3505
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,520
The story was not to actually salute myself

3506
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:50,520
because actually I was attempting to hit 150 yesterday total,

3507
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:53,520
but I simply hit the wall, and it was weird.

3508
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:55,520
It was different than like when you're at the gym

3509
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:58,520
and you're doing like, you're going to failure over like three sets,

3510
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,520
and you're, I don't know, benching, I don't know,

3511
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:02,520
like a couple plates or whatever,

3512
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,520
whatever, I'm not that strong or anything.

3513
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,520
Like 180 pounds or something.

3514
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:08,520
And like you do that, and like you hit the wall

3515
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,520
after like 10 reps, and you just can't go more.

3516
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:12,520
This was very different.

3517
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,520
This was like, every time I came back to it,

3518
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:17,520
like my baseline strength was much diminished,

3519
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:20,520
which was different from like feeling strong at the beginning,

3520
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,520
and then getting weaker.

3521
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,520
I've like never worked out this way,

3522
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,520
and I'm honestly doing it as a meme, as a joke.

3523
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:29,520
It's not optimal, but I just felt like fucking doing it.

3524
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,520
Because yeah, I was thinking, my goal one day

3525
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,520
is to do a hundred pull-ups in a row

3526
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,520
like level one Zell from Final Fantasy VIII,

3527
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,520
as I've said.

3528
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,520
That is my goal.

3529
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,520
And if I do a hundred in a day,

3530
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,520
really all I have to do is slowly narrow the window

3531
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,520
between those sets until it's nothing at all, right?

3532
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:49,520
So, maybe that'll be my approach.

3533
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:51,520
And David Goggins.

3534
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:54,520
Is that a thing humans can do as a hundred pull-ups?

3535
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:57,520
People have absolutely done more than a hundred pull-ups.

3536
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:59,520
A friend of mine used to drive out

3537
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,520
to Mount Shashmore back in Virginia Beach

3538
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,520
just to use their pull-up bar to do a hundred pull-ups.

3539
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:06,520
So he would do it in a row?

3540
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,520
I don't think he did them in a row, but he would do...

3541
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,520
He would do it in like twenty minutes or so.

3542
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,520
Okay, well that's already pretty impressive to do it in that short of a time.

3543
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,520
He would just do sets of ten, rest a minute, do another set of ten.

3544
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:20,520
But he had huge fucking arms, you know?

3545
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,520
Sure, sure.

3546
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:25,520
Like I've said, when I was in middle school, my record was fifty.

3547
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:27,520
So I know this is attainable.

3548
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,520
You know, I was like a skinny guy, but I was like a little exercise boy.

3549
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:34,520
My record was seven, like last year when we had...

3550
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,520
When Ben and...

3551
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,520
That's already way better than most people.

3552
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:41,520
Yeah, well we had a pull-up bar set up in the middle of the house,

3553
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,520
in the passage from the kitchen to the living room.

3554
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:47,520
So every time you pass it, you're just tempted to do a pull-up anyway.

3555
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:50,520
The only problem with pull-ups is that unlike push-ups,

3556
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:53,520
it takes way longer to recover from doing a set...

3557
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,520
like a day of pull-ups.

3558
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,520
You can't just do it every single day.

3559
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,520
It involves more muscles probably.

3560
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:03,520
I'll do one pull-up one day, and then the next day I can't even lift myself.

3561
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,520
You know what's the weirdest thing though?

3562
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,520
After yesterday, it's not my arms that hurt, it's my abs.

3563
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:13,520
My abs are wrecked, because I never do ab exercises, because I'm an idiot, but you know.

3564
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:16,520
Oh, it hurts. Anyway, enough of that shit.

3565
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,520
I just thought that was cool and funny.

3566
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:21,520
I'll get back to you folks when I am a Final Fantasy character.

3567
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,520
How do you know that Zell did them contiguously, consecutively?

3568
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:29,520
You know, I suppose I should double-check that, because I remember thinking that.

3569
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:33,520
They said that, quote, something like, Zell jumped up and did 100 pull-ups,

3570
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:38,520
but I suppose they never said he didn't come down in between, or like shake a break.

3571
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:41,520
I don't really remember. Don't you just kind of like come into the scene,

3572
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:45,520
and he's going like 98, 99, 100. Yeah, 100 pull-ups.

3573
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,520
Maybe. I can't remember.

3574
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:49,520
What I remember is it being a scene where they shake.

3575
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:56,520
Yeah, like the implication in that kind of thing is always that they do it continuously.

3576
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:01,520
Yeah, I would. And I know humans have done it and can do it, so, you know.

3577
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,520
Alright, fair. Man.

3578
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:07,520
Yeah, the reason I just, yeah, it was just like one more thing.

3579
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:12,520
The reason that I started wanting to do push-ups is that my brother, he's fucking jacked.

3580
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:13,520
Oh, yeah?

3581
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:16,520
Yeah, and we're pretty much opposites.

3582
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:19,520
Like, he's jacked in short. I'm skinny and tall.

3583
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:24,520
So I'm just like, well, I want to be tall and muscular to some extent.

3584
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:25,520
Good idea.

3585
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,520
You know?

3586
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:27,520
It's a good combo.

3587
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,520
Yeah, just so I can hold it over my brother, because he can't get taller.

3588
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,520
He's older than me.

3589
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,520
That is cool.

3590
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,520
No, let him have this. Let him have this.

3591
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,520
Is he older or younger?

3592
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:37,520
He's older.

3593
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:38,520
He's older.

3594
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:41,520
Both of my younger brothers are taller and in better shape than me.

3595
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,520
What do?

3596
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,520
Exercise. That's all I mean. That's all you got.

3597
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,520
I want to do a marathon.

3598
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:51,520
We're heels like Tom Cruise.

3599
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:53,520
Yeah.

3600
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,520
Base Tom.

3601
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:57,520
He's my god, my icon.

3602
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,520
I mean, I'm out of shit to say people.

3603
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:02,520
I mean, we could do more or we could go to questions.

3604
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:04,520
Wait, wait, wait.

3605
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:06,520
I got one thing to say.

3606
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:10,520
For the benefit of the viewers.

3607
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,520
Zen Hoxtable, who are you?

3608
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:14,520
I am a guy.

3609
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:18,520
Well, a lot of people, for people who haven't heard this already,

3610
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:20,520
a lot of people said I'm an anti-Tuber.

3611
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:22,520
I wouldn't really identify as an anti-Tuber.

3612
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:24,520
I don't think you're an anti-Tuber.

3613
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,520
Yeah, I'm not really an anti-Tuber.

3614
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:31,520
I make videos on animation because just for sake of clarification,

3615
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:34,520
I'm in college for animation right now.

3616
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,520
I'm just very interested in that kind of thing.

3617
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,520
So it's not just animation videos.

3618
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:43,520
I also do music theory because I played the piano for about,

3619
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,520
I think, 12 years now.

3620
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:47,520
So I just know about a lot of that stuff.

3621
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:50,520
And I think that's a valuable thing to a lot of people.

3622
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:53,520
I mostly know you from your drawings on Twitter.

3623
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:56,520
Yes, I need to start posting more of those.

3624
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,520
I'm a really big fan of them.

3625
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:01,520
You have a really great, you have a lot of motion.

3626
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:03,520
They're very, very kinetic.

3627
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,520
They have a lot of motion to them.

3628
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:07,520
Thank you.

3629
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:09,520
I know basically nothing about you career-wise.

3630
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:11,520
Yeah, I've heard that you have a comic.

3631
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:13,520
I haven't checked it out yet.

3632
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:16,520
Yeah, I did this comic for Inktober.

3633
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:18,520
That was a lot of fun.

3634
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:22,520
Zen is a bit of a human content machine type of guy.

3635
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:26,520
Yeah, just not explicitly YouTubers, whatever I can.

3636
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:28,520
Oh my god, this is beautiful.

3637
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:30,520
Hey, I know nothing about you career-wise.

3638
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:36,520
I'm sure that you have great opinions about Doug.

3639
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:39,520
I'm sure everyone knows you and you're a great cartoon person.

3640
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:42,520
That's not the way Zen Huxable is not that guy.

3641
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:46,520
His videos are totally different from anyone else on YouTube.

3642
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,520
Okay, okay.

3643
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:52,520
All I'm saying is that I'm sure your videos are nice and great

3644
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:54,520
and you're a good person.

3645
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:57,520
But all I know is that I've hung out with you a couple of times

3646
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:00,520
before in Boston and you're funny and cool.

3647
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:02,520
And the thing that strikes me most is that you're happy

3648
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:04,520
and you enjoy doing things.

3649
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:07,520
Which is the best thing in a person.

3650
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:09,520
None of my friends are happy.

3651
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:11,520
No one in this call is happy.

3652
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:13,520
No one's happy.

3653
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:16,520
They're all fucking mean and mean.

3654
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:18,520
I'm a ray of sunshine.

3655
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:21,520
I feel like I'm happier than Zen overall in terms of,

3656
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,520
like maybe I don't portray the...

3657
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:24,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3658
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:27,520
No, probably in like quality of life and just like, you know,

3659
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:30,520
having your needs fulfilled, you're probably happier than I am.

3660
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:31,520
I think, sure.

3661
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:33,520
Zen is just extremely personal.

3662
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:35,520
Like, Zen is a...

3663
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:37,520
Zen's just like, he likes people a lot.

3664
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:40,520
That's probably what I'd use to be happy.

3665
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:43,520
Yeah, that's what I think you're connecting with there.

3666
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:45,520
Because I think I'm happier than anyone I know.

3667
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:46,520
But...

3668
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,520
Probably, yeah.

3669
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:50,520
And I still have to be happy and miserable all the time.

3670
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:54,520
I have to ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds

3671
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:56,520
and everyone's too scared to ask you.

3672
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:59,520
Who is the sexy lady in your YouTube...

3673
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:01,520
Oh my God, thank you for asking.

3674
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:02,520
Wow, there we go.

3675
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,520
Oh, it's Tycho Nuki.

3676
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:04,520
This is...

3677
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:05,520
Yeah, Tycho Nuki.

3678
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:07,520
She's my favorite artist.

3679
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:08,520
I don't know.

3680
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:09,520
She's a...

3681
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:10,520
Okay.

3682
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,520
Oh, fantastic.

3683
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:12,520
It's all over...

3684
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:13,520
It's not plastic love.

3685
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:14,520
That's Maria Takayuchi.

3686
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:17,520
Oh, I just thought it was the same person this whole time.

3687
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,520
No, it's not.

3688
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:19,520
It's not, no.

3689
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:21,520
Well, that explains why she looks like nothing like her.

3690
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:22,520
But...

3691
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:23,520
Yeah, she looks nothing like her.

3692
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,520
That was the one gap in the theory.

3693
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:27,520
Well, they sound fairly similar.

3694
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:28,520
I would say...

3695
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:29,520
Not really, actually.

3696
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:30,520
Tycho Nuki has a...

3697
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:33,520
She played me one of her albums at my house, right?

3698
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:34,520
Yeah, I did.

3699
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:36,520
I think I played Sunshine Hour.

3700
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:38,520
That's Tycho Nuki's first solo album because she's...

3701
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,520
Okay, now we're getting into this shit.

3702
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:41,520
Okay, so...

3703
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:44,520
I can't believe I just stuck in the same person this whole time.

3704
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:45,520
Yeah.

3705
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:49,520
Remember when I went to your house and we were talking about how Japanese artists released

3706
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:50,520
a lot of music?

3707
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:51,520
Yeah.

3708
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:52,520
Yeah, okay.

3709
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:56,520
So there was this music movement in the mid-70s to late-80s.

3710
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:57,520
It was called City Pop.

3711
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:59,520
And there were a bunch of artists that spanned from it.

3712
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:02,520
It was like a Kiko Yano type sort of in my life.

3713
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:06,520
This is just like for the people in the comments, just for gratification, like hearing the names

3714
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:08,520
on the podcast.

3715
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:14,520
It's like all these types of people that make like fantastic pop music that was really inventive

3716
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:15,520
at the same time.

3717
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,520
Like, they were experiencing...

3718
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:24,520
They were experimenting with just different musical cultures as well.

3719
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:30,520
And yeah, it's like if you like City Pop, you're pretty much set for music for the next

3720
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:34,520
10 years, at least, because there's just so much of it.

3721
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:40,520
They're like 30 artists that are fucking fantastic and they all have like 12 albums.

3722
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:42,520
So it's just great stuff.

3723
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:43,520
Beautiful.

3724
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:46,520
And Taiko Nuki's my favorite because her voice is fantastic.

3725
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:47,520
Okay, but that...

3726
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:49,520
She made 4AM if you're familiar with that.

3727
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,520
Plastic Love is a City Pop song.

3728
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:52,520
Yeah, it's a City Pop song.

3729
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:53,520
Okay.

3730
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:56,520
I'm really off base saying that they are similar.

3731
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:57,520
Yeah.

3732
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:06,520
Yeah, there's like instrumentally and sonically, there's not really a unifying signifier of

3733
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:07,520
City Pop.

3734
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:11,520
So it's like, it's sort of a stupid term other than it's like, oh, there are these artists.

3735
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:12,520
It's more of a movement.

3736
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,520
Well, John, that's what you say.

3737
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,520
That's John is for you, I guess.

3738
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:17,520
Right.

3739
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:20,520
That's like, it's even more nebulous for City Pop, that's the thing.

3740
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:22,520
I'm reading some of your comic right now.

3741
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,520
And your art style strikes a very specific chord in my brain.

3742
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:32,520
Your art style is artists from like 5 or 6 years ago that used to be good, but now is

3743
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:35,520
shit, but like you have the art style of the old good one.

3744
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,520
You know what I'm saying?

3745
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,520
Okay.

3746
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,520
I know what you're saying.

3747
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:39,520
Okay.

3748
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:47,520
So you go to fucking ask Leon, the best Homestuck ask blog, and the art so scribbly and ridiculous

3749
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:48,520
and funny and cool.

3750
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:50,520
And then you go to their new shit.

3751
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:55,520
Like clean and crisp and fucking ah, you went to art school and now your life's ruined.

3752
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,520
But now you got scribbly shit.

3753
02:21:57,520 --> 02:21:59,520
It's messy, but super aesthetic and great.

3754
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:00,520
I would tell you that.

3755
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:04,520
So you have like all, you have all like earlys to 2010s art style.

3756
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:06,520
Please never get better.

3757
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:10,520
Zen's art style is indicative of his content on the whole.

3758
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:17,520
It's all very unkempt, very like lightly edited, very like rambling and.

3759
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:18,520
I'm not a polished guy.

3760
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:19,520
Yeah.

3761
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:24,520
Like Zen will like stumble into a video, like literally stumble into the frame in a video,

3762
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:29,520
like rambling, popping his mic and just like going, going insane.

3763
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:33,520
And like you, a lot of the times you're not even, if it weren't for the title of the video,

3764
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:38,520
you'd have no idea what the fuck this video is about until you get real into it.

3765
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:39,520
I love it.

3766
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,520
It reminds me.

3767
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:43,520
It's in the same way of what you were just saying.

3768
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,520
It reminds me of like older YouTube.

3769
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:47,520
It reminds me of like before everybody was trying to be the most polished.

3770
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:52,520
And the thing is, I don't think you need to do all that extra shit that they do now.

3771
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:53,520
No, absolutely not.

3772
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:54,520
Exactly.

3773
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:55,520
Yeah.

3774
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:57,520
Like there's a core that people resonate with.

3775
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:01,520
And it's like, just leave all the window dressing and like leave the essential.

3776
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:02,520
Yeah.

3777
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:03,520
It's almost like.

3778
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,520
I think that's a good approach to just art in general.

3779
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:06,520
Absolutely.

3780
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:07,520
Yeah.

3781
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:13,520
It's almost like the level of polish in certain things like YouTube is like a mark of this

3782
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:14,520
person doesn't know what they're talking about.

3783
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:16,520
They're just doing everything that they're supposed to do.

3784
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:21,520
Because how can you have time to actually research a subject if you have to put out

3785
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:24,520
three videos a week that are fully like animated?

3786
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:27,520
You know, like these people are doing like full editing animations.

3787
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:31,520
It's like, dude, I know that you didn't research this thing.

3788
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,520
Unless like, because it used to be that you'd get one of those, like it used to be such

3789
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:40,520
an event to get a 30 minute video from a YouTuber because they were going to put as much effort

3790
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:44,520
into that 30 minutes as they would have put into like a two minute animation, you know?

3791
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:49,520
And so it would be like a six month process where they did all the research and they made

3792
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:51,520
it fucking entertaining from start to finish.

3793
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:57,520
And then like, I don't mind that there's now a culture of like 30 minute analysis videos

3794
02:23:57,520 --> 02:24:01,520
that don't have all that extra shit that are just like set to video game footage and it's

3795
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:02,520
just a guy talking.

3796
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:07,520
That's fine with me, but I feel like we've like that other thing is like disappearing

3797
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:15,520
like the extremely well made video in favor of like chopping that up into pieces, making

3798
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:20,520
it look as fancy as possible while having as little content as possible.

3799
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:22,520
Just like putting as many...

3800
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:25,520
When you're talking about those old videos, I'm assuming you're like referring to Sequelitis

3801
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,520
and shit, right?

3802
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,520
You cut out when you said a name.

3803
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:30,520
I said when you, yeah, Sequelitis.

3804
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:35,520
Yes, like the Sequelitis style, which was, which kind of like kicked off that, you know,

3805
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:39,520
on YouTube, like especially in the gaming sphere doing like longer form videos.

3806
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:44,520
And it used to be that because in early YouTube, the wisdom was you can't make long videos.

3807
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:49,520
It was always that you had to make short stuff because people are mostly watching it on like

3808
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:51,520
their phone during a lunch break or something.

3809
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:55,520
And like, nobody would click on your video if it was more than like 15 minutes.

3810
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:00,520
And so it was like, if you were doing more than that, then you really needed to make it

3811
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:02,520
worth their time by putting more effort.

3812
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:04,520
But now...

3813
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:07,520
Right.

3814
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:11,520
Yeah, like the original Plinket videos are releasing like seven parts.

3815
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:17,520
So, like, I like that it has, that we have normalized longer content and that there's more

3816
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,520
of it coming out.

3817
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:24,520
But I just, I feel as though the way that YouTube is structured right now, it's so disincentivized

3818
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:30,520
to ever make a like big epic video that no one's going to fucking do it anymore unless

3819
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:33,520
they're doing it in the background like Nate and it takes twice as long as it even would

3820
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,520
have before because he has to make Wiago and shit, you know.

3821
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:37,520
Right, for sure.

3822
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:41,520
Viewers, please open up the show notes so that this audio section makes sense.

3823
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:46,520
How do you go from this to this?

3824
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,520
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

3825
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:50,520
Okay.

3826
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:51,520
Gotcha.

3827
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:52,520
Yeah, it's, it's...

3828
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:54,520
I mean, the second one's not bad.

3829
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:58,520
It's not bad, but it's way different and not as cool.

3830
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:01,520
The background and the character art, it just doesn't match.

3831
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:02,520
Yeah, not at all.

3832
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:03,520
Yeah, the background looks great.

3833
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:07,520
It looks almost like weird filters on it, like a weird, bizarre bloom.

3834
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:08,520
Yeah.

3835
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:09,520
It's muddy.

3836
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,520
It's a muddy image.

3837
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:14,520
No, it's just like, I feel like they're in like this sort of metamorphosis where they're

3838
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:17,520
getting the handle on that sort of background thing.

3839
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,520
But look at this old shit.

3840
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:23,520
It's so colorful and beautiful and sketchy and energetic.

3841
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:24,520
Oh my God.

3842
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:25,520
Yeah.

3843
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,520
I think people just get like, they don't want to be complacent.

3844
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,520
It's like, yeah, they got bored with this style because they were just doing it so much.

3845
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:34,520
I would never say this art's bad because I don't even think it's bad.

3846
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:36,520
I'm just saying it's different.

3847
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:37,520
No, I get what you're saying.

3848
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,520
I get what you're saying.

3849
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:41,520
It's like, they're just leaving something that they were comfortable with for something

3850
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:42,520
that's, you know, different.

3851
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:43,520
Give, give, give.

3852
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:44,520
Trample on him.

3853
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:45,520
Trample on him, give.

3854
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:46,520
Just say your thing.

3855
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:47,520
Just crush him.

3856
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:48,520
Nah, go for it.

3857
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:49,520
No, crush.

3858
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:50,520
I pretty much finished my thought.

3859
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:51,520
Don't worry.

3860
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,520
Okay, good.

3861
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:53,520
I was waiting for it.

3862
02:26:53,520 --> 02:27:00,520
The other day, relating to this, I uploaded an image of a character I designed called

3863
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,520
Clarissa Gunsmoke.

3864
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:03,520
Yeah.

3865
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:04,520
On Twitter.

3866
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:05,520
That was cool.

3867
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:07,520
Yeah, and everyone loves it.

3868
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:09,520
And it was like, oh, wow, cool.

3869
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:13,600
And the reason it's interesting to me, because it's like a really sketchy drawing, but it's

3870
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:18,520
like, she's got a big hat that covers her face and she's got a little smile and she's

3871
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,520
got a gun.

3872
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:21,520
And she's got big red hair, big poofy red hair.

3873
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:22,520
She's cool.

3874
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:23,520
She's got long legs.

3875
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,520
She's got long legs, too.

3876
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:25,520
A big horse.

3877
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:26,520
Yes, yes.

3878
02:27:26,520 --> 02:27:27,520
For a while, I was...

3879
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:28,520
It's got big hair.

3880
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:29,520
Yes.

3881
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:32,960
And for a while, I was like, man, I want to be good.

3882
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:38,160
I want to be like, after my current comic is done, which is basically a comic that involves

3883
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:43,920
a stick figure with a pumpkin face, I want to draw real arms and legs and stuff.

3884
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:46,360
I want to have proper good art.

3885
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:49,600
I want to be getting better at art by making art.

3886
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:55,080
And a lot of the time, I get stuck thinking about the wrong sort of things.

3887
02:27:55,080 --> 02:28:01,680
I was trying to design this cowgirl character to have eyes and eyelashes and pupils with

3888
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:04,440
the shines in the pupils.

3889
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:07,200
And then I was like, I don't know how to make this look good.

3890
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,320
I'll just hide her face, because I can't fucking draw.

3891
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:11,880
And then everybody loves it.

3892
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:12,880
Yeah, maybe...

3893
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,200
Yeah, that's what you do.

3894
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,360
That's what great art is.

3895
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:19,360
Great art is like, the artist works within whatever limitations they have.

3896
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:20,880
Have you seen that video, Ben?

3897
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:22,560
That's been circulating around Twitter.

3898
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:23,560
It's about this guy.

3899
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:25,600
He's like a character designer for anime.

3900
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:26,600
He was like...

3901
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:27,600
The...

3902
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:28,600
I've seen that.

3903
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:31,280
Yeah, the anime designers these days are being so ornate.

3904
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:34,640
Just draw a hat over the eyes if you can't draw eyes in size.

3905
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,640
No, I haven't.

3906
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:36,640
I haven't seen this.

3907
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:41,440
I just want to say real quick that what makes Hippo's design so good is that you can tell

3908
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:44,520
that character's personality instantly.

3909
02:28:44,520 --> 02:28:48,280
Like the second you look at her, you're like, I could fucking write a story about this character.

3910
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:50,680
I know her so well.

3911
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:51,800
There's so much conveyed in the...

3912
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:55,240
It's like a very specific brand of cool.

3913
02:28:55,240 --> 02:29:00,080
And even for me, the context of knowing Hippo drew it adds a lot as well, because it's

3914
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:01,720
clearly his type of character.

3915
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:05,640
And I can imagine how he would write her in a story.

3916
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:10,520
So it's like, I think that all that contributes a lot.

3917
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:15,960
And looking at these ones that Munchie had posted earlier, it's like the first one has

3918
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:21,880
these very instantly readable, likable expressions that you immediately know what's going on.

3919
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:22,880
And then this other one...

3920
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,920
You can click on it and there are more images than you're still in the preview, but go ahead.

3921
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:29,960
But the other one, it has a great facial expression, but you wouldn't...

3922
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:35,480
You don't notice that because you're too busy looking at all this other shit going on.

3923
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:40,040
And I just think that putting the emotion to the forefront is always going to be the

3924
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:41,040
best.

3925
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:48,160
Any good drawing, it's always going to be like, can we capture the feeling of this?

3926
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:52,880
I feel like the images much more close to the art equivalent of what we've been talking

3927
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:55,520
about with YouTube.

3928
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:59,960
There's all that extra production put into the second image, where the core of the first

3929
02:29:59,960 --> 02:30:00,960
one is right there.

3930
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:05,120
Yeah, I think that's the context in which he brought it up.

3931
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:06,120
Yeah.

3932
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:09,880
Okay, what I'm about to say feels wrong.

3933
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:13,760
And I value technical skill.

3934
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:17,120
I don't want to be the guy who just says, oh, just fucking draw cartoons because it's

3935
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:18,120
all you need to know.

3936
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:19,120
No, I...

3937
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:21,840
Technical skill and anatomy and all that is extremely important.

3938
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:27,120
However, there's been a thought in my mind that's hard for me to argue with myself, despite

3939
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:28,840
how much I want to.

3940
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:35,560
And that's if someone can understand, literally get what you're drawing.

3941
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:38,840
Why would you spend more time doing it?

3942
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:49,000
The only purpose of technical skill is so that you can convey more difficult things.

3943
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,200
Like, there's some things that you just...

3944
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:56,480
If I'm trying to draw a fight scene, for instance, a lot of people have noted about

3945
02:30:56,480 --> 02:31:03,040
One Punch Man that the original webcomic, in spite of looking like shit, is great because

3946
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:05,400
the layouts are so good.

3947
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:08,640
And the guy has such a good knack for...

3948
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:12,480
It's basically a storyboard of a better comic, but the storyboards are good.

3949
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:15,960
There are panels of official Hunter Hunter printed in Shonen Jump that are worse than

3950
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:19,400
the web novel and drawings of One's Eye.

3951
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:20,400
Fair.

3952
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:27,400
But yeah, those drawings resonated with people, and it's obvious that the reason they had

3953
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:32,400
to turn it into something that was better drawn was just so that more people would show

3954
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:37,240
it respect and appreciate it, it would be more saleable because nobody's going to take

3955
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:39,160
a risk on something that looks like that.

3956
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:45,760
But it's just, I think, a general lack of understanding of what even is a good art.

3957
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,400
What does it mean for something to be good?

3958
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:54,640
I'm planning to actually make a video about this soon called Bad Looking Anime or something

3959
02:31:54,640 --> 02:32:00,320
like that and just explain how all these people get jizzed about Sakuga these days,

3960
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:07,240
but there's so many times where you guys never heard that one, but...

3961
02:32:07,240 --> 02:32:09,240
No, I've never heard that one.

3962
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:12,240
PCP Episode 145, get in jizz.

3963
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:14,640
Oh, yes, that's great.

3964
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:18,240
People get jizzed over Sakuga's face.

3965
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:20,240
There he goes again!

3966
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:24,240
I saw it regularly, I'm surprised you never heard me.

3967
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,240
I think the word you're looking for is jazzed, but whatever.

3968
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:27,240
No, jizz.

3969
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:29,600
You're jizzing over it.

3970
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:32,320
I've had friends say this all the time.

3971
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:33,320
Maybe it's a Virginia thing.

3972
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,320
I have no idea.

3973
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:36,320
I think it's a huge thing.

3974
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:38,000
It could be that I made it up.

3975
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:44,120
My friends said it back in high school, but anyway, yeah, I think they get so excited

3976
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:48,840
about seeing something moving a whole lot and they're like, oh, it has great animation.

3977
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:51,320
I'm like, no, it's just moving a lot.

3978
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:56,080
There's no emotion being conveyed or it's a confusing emotion or the weight is wrong

3979
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:58,320
or it's floaty.

3980
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:04,120
There's a fight scene in Episode 3 of Boogie Pop, which the whole show looks fucking terrible,

3981
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:11,800
but there's a scene where they put all this super animated segment, but it looks awful.

3982
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:14,360
Everything's moving, but none of it looks good.

3983
02:33:14,360 --> 02:33:20,960
I've seen shows where they're just parallaxing backgrounds and it looks amazing.

3984
02:33:20,960 --> 02:33:25,200
Just moving three different background layers to reveal something and I'm like, that's better

3985
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:27,800
animation to me than this is.

3986
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:32,600
Oh, I'm sort of related in the sense that it's a good looking anime.

3987
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:36,200
I was recently watching Penning Socking again.

3988
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:41,120
I was rewatching it and it is like the best anime ever made.

3989
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:42,120
It looks beautiful.

3990
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:43,440
Have you seen Dead Leaves yet?

3991
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:45,960
Are you watching the dub or the sub?

3992
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:48,880
Well, here's my experience with it.

3993
02:33:48,880 --> 02:33:54,000
I'm watching it with Kazzy and I had originally watched it sub, but she's a dub person, so

3994
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,120
I tried to watch the dub and I couldn't do it.

3995
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:58,200
I was gonna say, I thought you would hate the dub.

3996
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,200
Yeah.

3997
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:00,200
Yeah.

3998
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:01,200
Munchy.

3999
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:02,200
Munchy.

4000
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:03,200
Are you aware of Dead Leaves?

4001
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:04,200
Here's a quick take.

4002
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:05,200
No, no.

4003
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:06,200
I'm aware of it.

4004
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:07,200
I know what it is, but I had not.

4005
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:08,200
It's only 30 minutes.

4006
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:09,200
Go watch it.

4007
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:10,200
It's the most aesthetically pleasing thing I've ever seen.

4008
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:13,200
If it's only 30 minutes, I will do it after the show.

4009
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,200
Dead?

4010
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,200
All right.

4011
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:16,200
Oh, actually the puppy ball is after this.

4012
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:23,000
Imagine if Candy and Stocking had been like overclocked highest possible quality the

4013
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
whole way through.

4014
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Basically.

4015
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Hmm.

4016
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
I like that.

4017
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I like that a lot.

4018
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I thought it was a show.

4019
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
I was mistaken.

4020
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Here's a quick take.

4021
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:37,000
See if you agree with me.

4022
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:43,080
Ideally, Solider should have looked like Dead Leaves.

4023
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:44,080
Of course.

4024
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,080
Solider, huh?

4025
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:50,760
I mean, the Solider manga has the coolest aesthetic ever.

4026
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:55,280
Aside from the early chat, it takes a while for him to get his faces looking good.

4027
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,880
But yeah, I fucking love Solider.

4028
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:00,160
I've never read the manga for Solider.

4029
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:01,160
Oh, dude.

4030
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:04,280
It's way better than the anime.

4031
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:09,120
The unfortunate thing about the anime is they did the coloring really well in the show,

4032
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:16,120
but just in general, the way that they adapted, it really suffers from moving manga problems

4033
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:23,120
where there's a lot of stuff that in the manga is just really tiny side dialogue that

4034
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,120
...

4035
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:25,120
Oh, I know all about that.

4036
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,520
Actually, I made a video about this.

4037
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:27,520
My video ...

4038
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,520
You did.

4039
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:29,520
I watched it.

4040
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:30,520
What the fuck was it called?

4041
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:31,520
I don't remember.

4042
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:32,520
Was it the ...

4043
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:33,520
It was the difference between anime and manga pacing.

4044
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:34,520
I know the one.

4045
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:35,520
Yeah.

4046
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:37,760
Well, I used Solider as the example in that, where I was talking about how in the first

4047
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:43,000
chapter, there's these parts where Shinigami is chopping the dad or whatever and costing

4048
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,000
him.

4049
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,920
In the manga, it's this tiny-ass panel that's in between the action happening, so you just

4050
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:49,920
kind of gloss over it.

4051
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:50,920
You don't really pay attention.

4052
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:54,440
But in the anime, they have to make that a full-screen, fully-voiced, animated thing

4053
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:55,440
that takes 10 seconds.

4054
02:35:55,440 --> 02:35:56,440
Right.

4055
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:57,440
And it feels way more ...

4056
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:58,440
Yeah.

4057
02:35:58,440 --> 02:35:59,440
I don't know.

4058
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:00,440
Cheesy.

4059
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:01,440
It totally takes away from the tone of the episode.

4060
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:05,520
The anime gets better as it goes, but the manga ... The thing about the anime is that

4061
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:10,960
it stops right before the arachnophobia arc, which is by far the best arc of the manga.

4062
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:11,960
Shit, man.

4063
02:36:11,960 --> 02:36:12,960
I gotta read this thing.

4064
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:14,920
It's one of the things I've ever seen in a manga series.

4065
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:21,960
I wonder if there's a YouTube video that is about Solider and two people discuss it.

4066
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:25,120
Hippo, take it away.

4067
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:26,120
You didn't like it.

4068
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:27,120
That's cool.

4069
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:29,120
Go watch Chibibacca's on this channel.

4070
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:30,120
Solider, where is it?

4071
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:31,120
Where is it?

4072
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:32,120
The anime Chibibacca's on this channel.

4073
02:36:32,120 --> 02:36:34,120
Welcome to Bored, James.

4074
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:36,960
We're the Chibibaccas, and we're James Rolf.

4075
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:39,640
Get ready to play Chibibaccas.

4076
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,920
You like Karakano, and that's all that matters.

4077
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:48,120
I can't remember if I've ever said this before, but I watch all of Chibibaccas, and I love

4078
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:55,840
it, particularly because Hippo almost always feels exactly how I would, and describes it

4079
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:56,840
how I would.

4080
02:36:56,840 --> 02:37:00,960
Hippo, I think just through sheer force of having mostly known about anime through my

4081
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:07,840
content over the years, is the most satisfying person to listen to talk about anime.

4082
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:11,400
The only experience I have with anime are your videos.

4083
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:13,920
That's literally the only part of anime too.

4084
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:20,000
Yeah, but I feel like Hippo takes my videos, I feel like he agrees with them more, or takes

4085
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,120
it to heart.

4086
02:37:22,120 --> 02:37:26,480
When I hear him talk about a show, and he's talking about the visuals, and what makes

4087
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:30,800
the visuals good, I'm like, yeah, that's how I have talked about what makes visuals

4088
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:31,920
good in anime.

4089
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:36,120
No one else talks about it that way, because most people are fucking bad.

4090
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:41,680
I guess it's half that, and half the fact that I just like being, like, analysis having

4091
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:48,760
a point in general, so like any analysis video that, like, Mathematosis is really good, but

4092
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:52,560
Joseph Anderson is just sort of slob, and it's okay, because he doesn't really have

4093
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:59,640
a reason for making the videos other than make it for views, and Mathematosis is like

4094
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:03,760
the things coming out of his mouth are things that he needs to express.

4095
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:08,200
He wants to explain these things, and it just, like, I like that approach.

4096
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:12,080
I say it every day, Joseph Anderson is a poor man, is a poor man's Mathematosis.

4097
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:17,600
I mean, Mathematosis is probably one of the best YouTubers of all time.

4098
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,600
Period.

4099
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:19,600
I'd put him in my top 20.

4100
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:22,800
And yet I still watch Joseph Anderson, so you know what I'm saying.

4101
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:27,080
Well I hate ChibiBakas, because you guys didn't like Eskrayed, and you were wrong, you were

4102
02:38:27,080 --> 02:38:28,080
wrong about that robot.

4103
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:29,080
That was an interesting one.

4104
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:31,200
That was a legendary discussion.

4105
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:40,280
There is not enough, there is a severe lack of long, boring, dry analysis about video

4106
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:45,240
games and shit, like Joseph Anderson and Mathematosis, because those are the best channels, the best

4107
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:46,840
kind of content to watch ever.

4108
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:51,160
Wait, Jesse, do you actually mean that there's a severe lack, because there's a shitload

4109
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:52,160
of it now?

4110
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,160
There's not enough.

4111
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:56,440
There is a shitload, but it's not enough, because I've seen all of them, I've watched

4112
02:38:56,440 --> 02:38:57,440
all of them.

4113
02:38:57,920 --> 02:38:58,920
There's not enough.

4114
02:38:58,920 --> 02:38:59,920
You know what it is?

4115
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:01,400
It's still not enough.

4116
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:02,880
Look, I don't know what it is.

4117
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:07,280
There's some ineffable quality that Joseph Anderson and Mathematosis and Mr. B-Tongue

4118
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,280
have that like snowball gaming or whatever.

4119
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:15,280
It's just something about a guy who's not trying to be funny, and not trying to impress

4120
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:20,040
me, just kind of talking forever and ever and ever about every little detail in a game.

4121
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:27,400
But the problem is that, like, there's technically a lot.

4122
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:31,600
But they're all, everyone's talking about fallout and oblivion, and that's it.

4123
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:34,360
Those are the only two games everyone talks about.

4124
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:37,280
I want a video like that about every game ever.

4125
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:38,760
Yeah, another fallout game.

4126
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:40,280
Yeah, the new fallout.

4127
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:43,480
The thing is, I watched Angry Joseph, I know what he's going to say.

4128
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:48,120
I feel like a guy like Mathematosis is aware, and is like, everyone's going to say the things

4129
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,840
I'm going to talk about, like fucking up his roller and fly.

4130
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:52,880
If you're like me, and you're looking for this shit, and you type into the search bar

4131
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:59,520
on YouTube, like, long boring guy talks about video games, you will just get like an endless

4132
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:04,840
sea of fallout, and oblivion, and Skyrim and shit, and it's like, enough!

4133
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:08,080
There are more games.

4134
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:09,880
Long boring guy sounds like a hippo kid.

4135
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:12,600
Long boring guy is my favorite genre of YouTube.

4136
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:17,160
Jesse, I'm really glad that you clarified that, because I feel the same way you do.

4137
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:23,320
I love super long form, dry analysis, and like, Mathematosis is by far the best.

4138
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:31,680
Nova Caldwell, Gervais, Watchable sometimes, Joseph Anderson just below Watchable for me.

4139
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:36,880
But like, a big part of it is that, yeah, like, every time it's like, seven hour analysis

4140
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:41,800
of fallout, 76, or Mass Effect, Andromeda, or blah blah, and I'm just like, man, can

4141
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:46,160
we like, like, I know you guys are just talking about these games, because you know that like,

4142
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:50,440
a lot of people care, but that doesn't mean that it's a game worth talking for seven

4143
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:51,560
hours about.

4144
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:52,560
You know?

4145
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:57,440
Like, when Matthew Matosis put out his God of War video that was 30 minutes long, I felt

4146
02:40:57,440 --> 02:41:02,080
like that was so comprehensive, I was like, how could you possibly have anything to add?

4147
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:06,280
And then Joseph Anderson made the three hour one, and I was like, I'm not watching that,

4148
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:09,840
because I already know, I've already gotten the full experience, I feel like I played

4149
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:12,240
the game after watching Matthew Matosis' video.

4150
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,240
That's fair.

4151
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:16,720
You know that one Omega Ruby video or whatever that's like eight hours long?

4152
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:17,720
Yeah.

4153
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:18,720
Oh my god.

4154
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:19,720
Shane May.

4155
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:20,720
Shane May.

4156
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:21,720
I still want to watch that.

4157
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:23,220
It is a good video.

4158
02:41:23,220 --> 02:41:28,240
I've watched some of it, but like, I feel like it's just the length which is drawing

4159
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:29,240
people to it.

4160
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:33,440
It didn't need, it probably didn't need to be seven hours.

4161
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:37,900
It could have been trimmed, but I don't think it ever is like, pointless.

4162
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:41,880
I don't think that like, I don't think any of it is like a complete waste of time.

4163
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:49,400
It's so comfy and homey and he's so funny, it's just nice and like you can listen to it in chunks

4164
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:51,720
Like because we listen to it over the course of like almost a week

4165
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:55,720
Like just throwing it on when there was nothing else to do and like at first

4166
02:41:55,720 --> 02:42:00,020
I wasn't that interested like at first it kind of felt like a dry analysis video

4167
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:06,560
But like there's so many times that he just like breaks away to tell little stories or joke around or just like and yeah

4168
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:12,520
Somehow it feels unscripted at times like it almost feels like he's like kind of like Ben's poo videos

4169
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:17,720
I would say it's comparable to those. Yeah, in fact, that's exactly what it's like is Ben's poo videos

4170
02:42:17,720 --> 02:42:19,720
But but one that lasts seven hours

4171
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,680
I mean if you think about it

4172
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:28,600
It's really just that he made a series of videos but put them all into one video and rendered it as a seven hour

4173
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:34,240
Yeah, that's true. You could look at it. I mean the thing is that the guy had come back from like a four-year hiatus

4174
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:39,240
What he did that or something so it's like it wasn't like he just regularly does long-ass videos

4175
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:41,760
He did like a bunch of sonic videos way the fuck back

4176
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:49,080
He did a bunch that are like clearly trying to be sequel it is while also like responding to sequel is and like

4177
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:55,040
I think he used to comment on me back then because I found out about him from him somehow at the time

4178
02:42:55,320 --> 02:43:00,000
But then he like disappeared off the map for a long period and then he came back and he did like to

4179
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:04,160
Consecutive like he did like a 30-minute video defending Metroid 2

4180
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:11,480
And then like immediately afterwards a like seven-hour Pokemon Ruby video that he clearly had made them both in the

4181
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:13,480
Yo, I don't know if this is just me or or something

4182
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:20,280
But I type Omega Ruby into you into into Google auto-complete it completes seven hour immediately afterwards

4183
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:26,080
Like he made he's probably needs to relax for a year

4184
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:31,520
I liked I like to believe that he's working on another seven hour review of like a different fucking hard goal

4185
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:33,600
Tell me about my heart golds the greatest game ever

4186
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:36,680
Oh

4187
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:42,920
9.3,000 subs. Yeah, that's a thing. He's not he's not a youtuber

4188
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:49,560
He's just he's just a guy. I was really passionate about Pokemon Omega Ruby, you know like that's that's what I would have thought

4189
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:53,640
He would have had before this video. I know right he would have gotten at least into like the 10k

4190
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:59,840
Some of guys not sure I'm shocked. I'm shocked. I'm shocked to that he is he has on under 10k

4191
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:03,400
No, fuck how many views this is video. This has 280,000

4192
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:09,280
280 so less than I would have expected honestly, but yeah, I thought it would be well, you know

4193
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:13,280
The length of how many of those are that it's not at like yeah most probably

4194
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:17,720
You know this is a fascinating thing to me

4195
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:23,080
I feel like so I listen to a lot of ASMR and what did it like when I'm listening to ASMR it like

4196
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:27,840
It's like I'm embarking in a ship on a sea of like comfiness

4197
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:31,280
And I'm like surrounded by like a comforting presence

4198
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:36,680
I feel like being in the depths of a seven-hour analysis video is like a similar sort of thing

4199
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:41,480
You're just you're floating along in this comfortable world and like I don't know does anyone else

4200
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,680
You start to feel like

4201
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:55,640
If you have an insight into his like life in my life, it's like you're you're watching a let's play

4202
02:44:55,640 --> 02:45:00,120
Yeah, cuz he doesn't like every detail of the game. He goes like city by city

4203
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:05,880
I mean you could I mean you could beat Omega Ruby in less than seven. I well, maybe I well not easy if you're really

4204
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,240
Yeah, another thing I like about it. Sorry, Ben

4205
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:12,680
Another thing I like about it is that he doesn't take anything for granted in this video

4206
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:19,640
Like there's parts where he just explains like the basic conceit of how Pokémon even functions as a game

4207
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:24,440
Like it's not just about Omega Ruby. It's like it's like he's he's he's like hey

4208
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:26,840
I'm telling you about like what's unique about this game

4209
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:32,760
But like let's take a step back and actually just explain how Pokémon even works and functions and why it's even enjoyable

4210
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:39,520
And I love that stuff cuz it's like nobody does that nobody like takes that step back and like explains the mechanics and just like

4211
02:45:39,520 --> 02:45:43,080
Why they're fun cuz it's like we've all been playing Pokémon since we were children

4212
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:48,680
But to actually have it spelled out was like, yeah, I guess it is like that, you know

4213
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:51,680
It was cool. Sometimes it do be like that

4214
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:54,280
One thing I think a thing that makes it especially

4215
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:59,520
Comfy listening is like he goes on digressions and he talks about different aspects of the game

4216
02:45:59,960 --> 02:46:02,240
But most of them end up kind of being

4217
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:09,880
Tributaries off of this this river that he's on but they all kind of flow back into the same sort of theme like he kind of

4218
02:46:09,880 --> 02:46:16,200
He sort of returns to the same I general idea about like what he's saying about the game kind of like like all the things

4219
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:17,720
He talked about kind of lead back into it

4220
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:23,520
So you can kind of like zone out for a while and come back later and like he'll see he's talking about a different aspect

4221
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:26,440
But he's kind of making the same like general sort of

4222
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:29,240
thesis statements with them

4223
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:36,120
So, you know, it's relaxing. You don't have to pay too close attention. Yeah, that's cool. That's cool

4224
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:38,820
The guy's Scottish. Oh, that's right. He's

4225
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:40,820
Oh

4226
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:46,500
Watch cuz he's got such a yeah, that's why I like my well, it's not the only reason why I like it's a nice thing

4227
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:50,140
It's just not him atosis is I read. Yeah, but he's not Scottish

4228
02:46:50,220 --> 02:46:55,220
Yeah, when I heard he's like really Irish. Yeah, when I heard about the seven-hour analysis of Pokemon

4229
02:46:55,220 --> 02:46:58,820
I had no interest because I thought it would be some boring dry shit

4230
02:46:58,820 --> 02:47:02,260
And then as soon as I heard his voice and heard the accent I was like I can watch that

4231
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:06,700
It is a plus. She is really

4232
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:13,140
Colloquialism, so there's a few parts where he just becomes unintelligible on purpose

4233
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:16,220
Yeah

4234
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:20,100
I'll have my I'll have my mate Sheamus to boot you with a claw hammer

4235
02:47:22,900 --> 02:47:26,220
All right, all right, we've been talking for a million fucking years

4236
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:30,860
I feel like we should go to the best PCP episode because I didn't get mad at anyone

4237
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:37,620
No point did I think wow, I fucking sure hate you. I'm fucking mad that did you doesn't like the organization 13?

4238
02:47:40,060 --> 02:47:42,300
Happened to something they tap into something inevitable

4239
02:47:42,300 --> 02:47:46,260
I'll tell you right now iconic for a reason. I've always hated them

4240
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:51,260
However, I will say that there is a high likelihood. This has a lot to do with just like

4241
02:47:51,860 --> 02:47:53,180
trauma and

4242
02:47:53,180 --> 02:47:54,500
general

4243
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:57,740
this day for people cuz like all the goth kids

4244
02:47:57,740 --> 02:48:03,020
I knew in high school who I couldn't stand we're all like

4245
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:06,660
Someone who would wear one and then commit a school shooting

4246
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:14,700
Organization 13 coats and wear it brony con because did you won't be there to uh?

4247
02:48:15,580 --> 02:48:17,580
To give us shit for it

4248
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:26,700
No, we didn't all right

4249
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:34,180
But by the way about brony kind should mention that for the past four hours before recording this

4250
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:37,300
I've been sample and I created the the architect

4251
02:48:37,580 --> 02:48:42,620
Recurring the blueprints of a road trip a fucking 18-day road trip

4252
02:48:42,620 --> 02:48:45,740
I'm gonna go on and any of it will be brony con. All right

4253
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:49,220
Well, they're they're paying for our admission and stuff, right?

4254
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:57,140
No, no, we haven't gotten anything back been is that no we haven't come down yet. Oh, okay. Well, all right

4255
02:48:57,260 --> 02:48:59,260
It's

4256
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:05,860
Okay, I at least expected them to say like if they didn't want to do it

4257
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:08,180
They would be like hey, no, we aren't gonna

4258
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:15,140
Like they haven't said anything which almost makes me like it's such like an unbelievable

4259
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:21,620
You that they wouldn't have at least said something that I almost believe that they didn't get it somehow. Yeah, maybe yeah

4260
02:49:21,620 --> 02:49:23,940
I think maybe they just missed it or something

4261
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:27,260
I don't know try them again. There's no way because there's no way

4262
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:33,820
All right, but well anyway. All right, let's let's let's see the voice. Yeah. All right. Here we go people

4263
02:49:33,820 --> 02:49:37,580
Let's unless anyone's got any blast shit. No, no one's even allowed

4264
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:46,780
All right fucking speak pipe, you know the link just down below send us your own boy

4265
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:50,620
How many we got I have eight there is eight today. So less than less than you

4266
02:49:51,220 --> 02:49:56,340
Merciful, okay, first one is from to go a message from to go link

4267
02:49:57,620 --> 02:50:00,500
What's I don't like that guy it's got to be a scam

4268
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:05,900
Hey guys, sorry, I haven't made a voicemail in a while

4269
02:50:05,900 --> 02:50:09,980
I just wanted to talk about the whole college thing and why my god

4270
02:50:09,980 --> 02:50:14,100
No, interrupt this program to bring you a special message from our sponsors

4271
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:16,420
Dix are so cute. Oh

4272
02:50:16,420 --> 02:50:21,900
When you hold one in your hand, then it starts twitching like a

4273
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:49,180
Ah

4274
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:54,260
This voicemail is sponsored by

4275
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:02,140
Can we can we get to the ink as the next guess

4276
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:07,300
Let's get it. I really love I really really love

4277
02:51:09,460 --> 02:51:11,460
Distortion dope. Yeah

4278
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:15,260
The way to get your voicemail heard on the PCB is just to have a voice

4279
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:17,780
That's like the only requirement

4280
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:24,100
Every single person that downloads a voice modulator just gets in automatic. We actually vet these

4281
02:51:25,100 --> 02:51:29,340
Yeah, yeah, I cut a bunch of bullshit and you know what speaking of what do we do?

4282
02:51:30,340 --> 02:51:34,860
We we get probably like 20 every week to go through that's something like that a lot

4283
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:38,580
Yeah, it's a lot and I appreciate it and people just so you know

4284
02:51:38,580 --> 02:51:42,900
I hear what you're submitting if it's not on it wasn't good enough so work on it

4285
02:51:43,420 --> 02:51:46,940
That's a fact. Do you get a lot of repeats? Do you get repeats?

4286
02:51:46,940 --> 02:51:51,660
You know, I've actually I think today was the only time I ever got clearly someone like retrying like a bad

4287
02:51:52,100 --> 02:51:54,660
Something that they didn't want to do. It's pretty rare honestly

4288
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:58,100
Hmm cuz like they don't get a chance to like nothing back

4289
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:01,220
They have to like commit or I don't know what whatever. Oh, by the way

4290
02:52:01,220 --> 02:52:07,460
I was gonna do the next one from the sky Filipino who's doing like a Filipino lesson the audio quality is too shit

4291
02:52:07,460 --> 02:52:11,140
So I think I'm gonna skip it. So work on that buddy and try again next time

4292
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:18,540
Okay, but here we go fucking play next one. This is from Peter computer Peter

4293
02:52:19,060 --> 02:52:21,060
computer go

4294
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:23,740
Hello members of the PCP

4295
02:52:23,740 --> 02:52:28,940
My name is Peter the computer and I love your show more than I love interpreting binary data

4296
02:52:29,580 --> 02:52:33,700
But I'm beginning to wonder if you're all just a figment of my imagination

4297
02:52:34,380 --> 02:52:37,300
Endless just representing my deep anger and loathing

4298
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:40,580
Munchie my inner child as well as my sense of responsibility

4299
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:43,900
Digi my true nature of pure and honest degeneracy

4300
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:50,140
Along with me best man and Ben sainte representing my split political views and negative feelings

4301
02:52:54,260 --> 02:52:57,780
And whatever mage might indicate I don't want to think about it

4302
02:52:58,420 --> 02:53:00,260
so thoughts

4303
02:53:00,260 --> 02:53:05,420
Do you guys have any proof you actually exist? That's hot. No, literally none

4304
02:53:06,420 --> 02:53:08,420
Oh

4305
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:13,740
Robot voice and murder of the universe by King gives it in the lizard wizard. Oh, yeah

4306
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:23,940
Listen, I can I I exist I exist in your heart and you know, you know, that's you know

4307
02:53:23,940 --> 02:53:28,260
You can feel my heart teaches us that it literally doesn't matter if you're real or not

4308
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:34,420
You have a heart no matter what and we also have a heart as long as long as you literally believe

4309
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:36,420
That's what matters. So I'm going

4310
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:42,860
This is the son of the computer from the Rayman one review on

4311
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:51,180
If you believe well, hang on if you believe if you believe that you have a heart then you know as Descartes

4312
02:53:51,420 --> 02:53:58,100
Descartes cogito ergo some says, you know, I think there I think that something course you must therefore it is true

4313
02:53:58,100 --> 02:54:00,100
I thought no

4314
02:54:00,420 --> 02:54:03,460
Like a quote about like Descartes talking about Kingdom Hearts

4315
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:08,180
No, like, you know, if you if you if you think that you're real

4316
02:54:14,740 --> 02:54:19,480
Listen listen, I had to listen. I gotta do something with my fucking philosophy

4317
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:26,100
Asking if he's real he's asking if we are real which we can't prove to oh

4318
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:32,540
Yeah, but I was you said you got it. It's goddamn voicemail. Yeah, next one. Here we go

4319
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:35,460
Kingdom day card. Yeah, this is from

4320
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:41,420
Harlock as Nibble is calling in with a message. Let's go. Yes

4321
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:44,340
listen

4322
02:54:44,340 --> 02:54:46,300
This is Harlock as Nibble

4323
02:54:46,300 --> 02:54:51,140
I just want to let you all know that you were all wrong and I was wrong

4324
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:53,420
Not only is there a God

4325
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:57,940
But he's the greatest God. He might be the best God ever and

4326
02:54:58,820 --> 02:55:03,000
He hates and and podcasts that have people on it

4327
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:09,540
He also hates YouTube and he definitely hates the liberal politics

4328
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:20,300
His cult as one might call it that he operates in the RFC K

4329
02:55:21,380 --> 02:55:27,100
So as I am now a true blue Christian boy once again

4330
02:55:28,300 --> 02:55:30,300
Drinking that good red blood and

4331
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:36,820
Voting that good red party. I can no longer associate with the pure degeneracy

4332
02:55:37,900 --> 02:55:40,740
PCP podcast this certainly isn't no

4333
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:43,860
Something I have to do only for my parents

4334
02:55:44,460 --> 02:55:49,260
I'm not I'm not doing this. So they won't kick me out of the house. This is actually how I feel I

4335
02:55:49,820 --> 02:55:53,460
Would never lie at you because that is one of the many sins

4336
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:56,820
It might be one of the seven sinister ones

4337
02:55:57,420 --> 02:55:59,860
Or maybe it's not we got it, but it doesn't matter

4338
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:04,620
Please all accept the Lord into your heart

4339
02:56:05,940 --> 02:56:07,540
Goodbye

4340
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:09,540
Okay, I got good news for you

4341
02:56:09,660 --> 02:56:16,500
Yeah, all I ever wanted with RFC K was for it to become a leftist cult. So I think I I think I did my job

4342
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:20,940
You guys know, you know the cop killers over there in their dark dank

4343
02:56:21,420 --> 02:56:26,580
Cathedral just full of darkness and shadows practicing their their liberal politics

4344
02:56:26,580 --> 02:56:33,140
They're far left at bullshit the cop killers are just cut way too fucking hard and they need to stop skint

4345
02:56:33,780 --> 02:56:36,500
rewatching 90s cartoons scanning for pro for

4346
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:43,540
Progressive progressive gay gay presentation representation every day. That's just what we do over there

4347
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:49,020
There's good news though for this individual. It's that luckily while, you know

Letter of recommendation for my college application

I did in order for me for the college to accept that I had to register you as a

4358
02:57:33,740 --> 02:57:38,540
Recommender and when I do that they had they asked you, you know, like was this person's relation to you, right?

There's an employer which I wouldn't with ultimately, but there also was mentor which which I which I thought of

4361
02:57:49,980 --> 02:57:51,980
You went past mentor to a lawyer

4362
02:57:52,740 --> 02:57:54,740
saving that one for me, so

4363
02:57:54,860 --> 02:58:02,300
Yeah, they're enough. Okay next call. We got one. This is from a little well-known character to all of us named

4364
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:06,020
Sunstone is actually fucking good and great. So let's see

4365
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:08,020
Yeah

4366
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:12,940
No Steven Universe

4367
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:19,140
Okay, it had a glitch the new character. Yeah from fucking she's the cool

4368
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:27,600
Listen here, I am legitimately angry that you guys don't hashtag love and appreciate Sunstone

4369
02:58:28,300 --> 02:58:30,300
Sunstone is not only

4370
02:58:30,700 --> 02:58:33,620
Sick design Ben is right the first time ever

4371
02:58:34,460 --> 02:58:40,700
Just something is a sick design the hair is just incredible. That's point two point two is the hair is also really good and

4372
02:58:41,620 --> 02:58:47,900
Hashtag tears flowing from my face as I'm being addressed directly by this cartoon character

4373
02:58:48,100 --> 02:58:54,700
Telling me the woes and evils of bullying. I'm frankly appalled and I'm hashtag unsubscribing

4374
02:58:56,580 --> 02:59:03,580
From a podcast who hates literal joy and fantastic things such as Sunstone, you know what good bye

4375
02:59:03,620 --> 02:59:08,380
All right, crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. I I didn't watch the episode

4376
02:59:08,380 --> 02:59:10,980
I just looked it up and saw a picture and was like wow

4377
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:18,460
Because so it's on something is that it looks cool. Yeah, remember you should talk to a while on the Steven Universe

4378
02:59:18,460 --> 02:59:20,460
What the fuck is Steven Universe?

4379
02:59:22,420 --> 02:59:27,540
You know looking back on it. I just I've just been like annoyed

4380
02:59:28,540 --> 02:59:34,980
Mostly because like people are pointing out all over all over the place in the comments of all sorts of things

4381
02:59:34,980 --> 02:59:40,380
I've been seeing it everywhere like don't the PCP know that it's a throwback to 90s cartoons

4382
02:59:40,380 --> 02:59:45,860
Yes, we know but it was fucking gay in the episode. We know it was bad and it wasn't done

4383
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:50,980
Well, it was a badly told joke. It was rushed and I didn't get it. It's not that I didn't get it

4384
02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:55,820
I got it. It was stupid and you're all stupid for liking it. I'm sick of being nice

4385
02:59:55,820 --> 03:00:02,780
I'm sick of being mr. Nice guy and diplomatic about these things. I'm right and everyone's wrong. It was bad

4386
03:00:03,140 --> 03:00:08,980
Zen. Did you see that? Did you see that? Did you see the Sunstone episode? I I saw the special

4387
03:00:08,980 --> 03:00:11,300
What would you what do you what's your take on Sunstone?

4388
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:16,900
On Sunstone, um, I actually like rainbow quartz 2.0 the best. Oh, yeah

4389
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:20,980
I don't even know what that is deep into a series

4390
03:00:21,100 --> 03:00:26,380
You probably are of the opinion like you know like no matter how bad it gets I gotta finish it, right?

4391
03:00:26,380 --> 03:00:30,460
Like you know like go back to Kingdom Hearts like you played the first ones and they were good

4392
03:00:30,460 --> 03:00:33,580
And then you're like, well, I gotta just fucking finish it got again

4393
03:00:33,580 --> 03:00:39,100
It's just an obligation. Yep, but Steven Universe weirdly is like I love season one with all my heart

4394
03:00:39,100 --> 03:00:45,780
I think it's a perfect show that resonates with me specifically very much so but like it's just gotten bad to the point

4395
03:00:45,780 --> 03:00:48,060
Where like I just don't want to watch it

4396
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:54,820
Do you want to preserve do you want to preserve the memory of like that pristine memory of what it's just that I don't care because I

4397
03:00:54,820 --> 03:01:01,460
Know that it won't make me happy. I agree. I mean as the series has gone on as it's gotten into the later seasons

4398
03:01:01,460 --> 03:01:04,140
I mean, I agree. It was a perfect show with like no filler

4399
03:01:04,140 --> 03:01:10,060
But as it's gone on there's just been more and more episodes constantly that I just do do not give a fuck about anything and

4400
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:12,180
Just roll my eyes and it just

4401
03:01:12,620 --> 03:01:14,620
Fuck it. It's bad. The whole show is bad

4402
03:01:15,500 --> 03:01:20,100
That that one Steven bomb about Steven and Connie breaking up. That was so bad

4403
03:01:22,380 --> 03:01:22,860
differently

4404
03:01:22,860 --> 03:01:29,940
So I feel weirdly like I like the show even as it is now more than you guys and that really surprises me because I really like it

4405
03:01:29,940 --> 03:01:33,940
I I still like the show, but like I was looking through the list of episodes

4406
03:01:33,940 --> 03:01:39,540
It's just because it's been so like the upload schedule is so weird and like I

4407
03:01:40,260 --> 03:01:45,800
Remember like clumps because that's how they were released. Yeah, but like looking at the episode list

4408
03:01:45,800 --> 03:01:50,820
I'm like, okay season one good good good good good all of it's good season two pretty good

4409
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:58,500
You know it starts off great this that season two is like a peridot is around and we're trying to find out and Lapis is also here and

4410
03:01:58,900 --> 03:02:00,900
Stuff. Oh, no, she's not here. She's underwater

4411
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:03,300
season three

4412
03:02:03,300 --> 03:02:08,020
They start to get a few like who cares episodes sure season four

4413
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:17,300
Who cares episodes season five is like entirely who gives a flying fuck right up until the end where there's like a Steven bomb of like homework

4414
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:20,940
Yeah, I mean I suppose so like season five felt like awful

4415
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:26,340
Maybe I just don't remember because of how much how much of it was like. Oh another onion episode. I really

4416
03:02:27,740 --> 03:02:33,020
This is like a weird feeling that I am probably not articulating the best I possibly can

4417
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:36,780
But to me Steven Universe doesn't even like feel real

4418
03:02:37,380 --> 03:02:39,260
Like I look at clips of it

4419
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:45,540
I'm like, there's no way that's like actually happening like Steven Mears feels like Mars being like

4420
03:02:45,540 --> 03:02:49,580
Was a weird space captain guy or something and this is like fan-made content

4421
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:53,340
This is like there's no way like the story is actually progressed in this way

4422
03:02:53,340 --> 03:02:57,620
And then I'll watch like a new episode. I don't just think like this is just

4423
03:02:58,180 --> 03:03:03,100
So far removed from what I wanted the show to be like or what to happen

4424
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:09,020
Like it's so completely different from what I expected or what I wanted. It like isn't even faze me

4425
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:12,980
It does not even phase me like I can't like yeah, what did you want?

4426
03:03:12,980 --> 03:03:17,260
You just hit white male piece of shit. What did you want the show to be?

4427
03:03:18,820 --> 03:03:22,540
It's it's hard to explain. Yeah, I just I

4428
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:25,700
We can have a whole I mean I

4429
03:03:25,700 --> 03:03:31,020
I'm well known for hating the gaze and hating the trans and hating everyone

4430
03:03:31,020 --> 03:03:37,100
You know, I'm singing my theme song every day hide it lie did lie did Lee get me a rope and find me a tree

4431
03:03:37,780 --> 03:03:41,020
But nonetheless, I I'm still enjoying

4432
03:03:42,300 --> 03:03:46,620
This I was never a lore fag

4433
03:03:46,620 --> 03:03:52,100
I was never like I want them to explore home world and more depth, but even yeah, yeah

4434
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:58,100
I don't like you know, I did I did want all those things, but in hindsight. I think I was wrong

4435
03:03:58,700 --> 03:04:04,980
I cared about Steven as a character. I care about the gyms as characters. Yeah, like they have been besmirched

4436
03:04:05,060 --> 03:04:10,740
Yeah, I mean it really felt like in the beginning they they definitely fell to the wayside in the in the face of like

4437
03:04:10,740 --> 03:04:12,960
Oh, no, the world's gonna explode. Oh, no

4438
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:18,020
Straight up. I fucking everyone who will try to get the seniors will say Steven's annoying

4439
03:04:18,020 --> 03:04:24,540
I've loved Steven from episode one and I thought that his arcs were incredible and I love them so much

4440
03:04:25,140 --> 03:04:30,100
Steven like was literally me and I love him growing like a mature

4441
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:37,700
Responsible person who's level-headed and he loves people because he's like a boy and he's fatty like likes people and it makes me happy

4442
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:41,020
It makes me really happy, but it's now

4443
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:44,180
About weird bizarre fucking

4444
03:04:45,140 --> 03:04:50,300
In the beginning they really season first episode the Steven weight loss arc

4445
03:04:50,580 --> 03:04:52,580
Begins

4446
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:58,540
He has to love himself he has to be body positive forever. He has to get fatter fatter forever

4447
03:05:00,460 --> 03:05:06,740
Do you remember that episode where he turned into cats and he's yeah, that was a freakish and nightmarish, but also really good

4448
03:05:06,740 --> 03:05:08,020
That was a you know

4449
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:13,140
I've been tossing around my head for a while because the way I feel about Steven universe is the same way I used to feel about

4450
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:17,460
Homestuck we're like I know that I don't like it and like it's it's just in the tip of my tongue

4451
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:21,660
But I can't fully express it and I feel like it's been too long since I watched it

4452
03:05:21,660 --> 03:05:23,900
Like when it started everything was like

4453
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:30,140
Clarified homesick for me so much. I did the same thing with Steven universe to people to Steven universe soon good idea

4454
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:32,980
There was a lot of mystery at first or was like oh man

4455
03:05:32,980 --> 03:05:37,860
I can't wait to see what the other gems are like and what home world is like and what everything's like and now we have those answers

4456
03:05:37,860 --> 03:05:39,860
And it's like oh, it's all gay bullshit

4457
03:05:40,300 --> 03:05:42,300
Yes

4458
03:05:47,460 --> 03:05:49,460
Right now sure sure

4459
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:57,780
Wait a second. I said I'm feeling very vindicated about not having kept up with Steven universe. It's like season 2 episode 6. I

4460
03:05:58,660 --> 03:06:00,660
Mean yeah, you're not

4461
03:06:00,860 --> 03:06:02,860
The show dropped the ball

4462
03:06:03,580 --> 03:06:07,940
I mean that's true. I very much felt like like Steven universe the creators

4463
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:13,460
They weren't like in the right place to make like a globe like universe spanning

4464
03:06:13,460 --> 03:06:15,460
I still thought all of you guys

4465
03:06:15,820 --> 03:06:21,340
Just assumed all of you guys still loved this show since you were all still watching it. I mean I still

4466
03:06:21,860 --> 03:06:23,860
Well, I watch it. I

4467
03:06:24,500 --> 03:06:28,080
Like it is just watch it for the same reason. I still read okay

4468
03:06:28,340 --> 03:06:35,380
Like just despite season 5 generally being a lot of filler the bits that aren't filler. I'd still do like I did like

4469
03:06:36,300 --> 03:06:38,300
Liking and loving like back

4470
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:42,080
Podcasts years ago, we were like oh, this is like

4471
03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:51,160
And now you guys are all like I'm like wow like people were giving me so much shit over the years for not keeping up with the show

4472
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:55,540
Did I hear that cryptic tom trying to break the ghostly whale?

4473
03:06:55,540 --> 03:06:57,540
I

4474
03:07:03,540 --> 03:07:07,900
Steven universe as it stands right now is very similar to kind of how I felt about MLP a lot

4475
03:07:08,020 --> 03:07:12,300
Yeah, where that it's it's it's biggest strengths was was its abilities to

4476
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:18,380
Yeah, to have really cool characters and stuff because like this the scope of like the network

4477
03:07:18,380 --> 03:07:20,660
It was on and like this the length of the show and stuff

4478
03:07:20,660 --> 03:07:26,100
It really lent itself to like quick little character-centric episodes, but now they're increasing the scope

4479
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:32,060
They're going kind of outside their wheelhouse, and it doesn't it doesn't can't support that the the um, yeah

4480
03:07:32,060 --> 03:07:35,060
That's true. That's true. You know with them with MLP

4481
03:07:35,060 --> 03:07:40,580
Everyone said that like you know this the finales and stuff and like the adventure episodes are the worst ones and the ones

4482
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:44,260
everyone liked were like the character ones like art of the dress and whatever and

4483
03:07:44,860 --> 03:07:51,860
Now Steven Steven universe is now about like its overarching story is about the like adventure epic

4484
03:07:51,860 --> 03:07:56,260
Indeed, which has never been even though it has the same strength, which was its its character

4485
03:07:58,500 --> 03:08:02,380
It's about the right blend with Steven universe, but but yeah still I get the point

4486
03:08:02,380 --> 03:08:06,900
Yeah, it's not all bad like I was interested like the whole the whole lap is I like was dope as hell

4487
03:08:06,900 --> 03:08:08,740
And I think everybody loved that but the truth

4488
03:08:08,740 --> 03:08:13,220
I mean sad you know sad to say I liked the I liked the diamonds a lot more before yeah

4489
03:08:13,340 --> 03:08:14,380
Yeah

4490
03:08:14,380 --> 03:08:16,380
Meh, what can you do on the other hand?

4491
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:23,340
Adventure time was perfect all the way to the end and everyone who says otherwise is a coward and a phony and a fraud and a jerk

4492
03:08:23,340 --> 03:08:27,220
But it didn't push my precious gay agenda enough although it did a little bit

4493
03:08:31,220 --> 03:08:33,460
Every character to get double

4494
03:08:35,460 --> 03:08:41,420
People who are like oh I stopped watching when it became more about the plot and the lore like what is wrong with you cowards

4495
03:08:41,420 --> 03:08:43,420
The show was perfect all the way to the end

4496
03:08:44,180 --> 03:08:51,580
Adventure time is actually is actually gays Steven. You're I still it's like fake games gems are not fucking human

4497
03:08:51,580 --> 03:08:53,580
They don't fuck they don't it doesn't

4498
03:08:54,700 --> 03:08:58,860
Fuck a vampire girl. They don't there aren't even any men for them like okay

4499
03:08:58,860 --> 03:09:01,780
Well, so like it was big deal. Don't you dare say

4500
03:09:02,660 --> 03:09:09,500
Tell me that pearl doesn't fuck. I refuse to believe it. I have to have hope princess bubble gum and and Marceline

4501
03:09:09,580 --> 03:09:15,940
They they cut Finn and chose each other and that's dedication. They gave they gave they actually gave up the dick

4502
03:09:15,940 --> 03:09:19,740
They they made a choice. That's true. It mean it now they didn't give it up

4503
03:09:19,740 --> 03:09:25,900
They're both grooming him in tandem when he fucking grows that big beard in the future. They're gonna be all over

4504
03:09:27,900 --> 03:09:31,300
Okay, hang on maybe I hope I mean I hope so hey

4505
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:38,020
Yeah, we got we got three more people we got three more. Let's let's continue shall we?

4506
03:09:38,460 --> 03:09:40,460
Here we go, boom

4507
03:09:43,580 --> 03:09:49,220
Wait, is it not playing? I can't hey PCP this this is Steven universe fan

4508
03:09:51,020 --> 03:09:53,020
This is a question for Jesse

4509
03:09:53,660 --> 03:09:56,820
Since he seems to be the poop the poop man

4510
03:09:58,740 --> 03:10:00,740
How do you think pearl poops?

4511
03:10:01,100 --> 03:10:03,100
Thank you, it's like a shiny

4512
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:14,820
An answer quickly would be nice. I really need it for my

4513
03:10:18,900 --> 03:10:23,540
First of all, I hate you and second of all, I didn't hear the question because everyone is laughing too hard

4514
03:10:24,260 --> 03:10:27,580
Even say how does Pearl shit? How does she shit?

4515
03:10:27,900 --> 03:10:31,620
What's her shits like are they little pearly shits are they big stinking logs?

4516
03:10:32,020 --> 03:10:33,220
That's what he said. Oh, no

4517
03:10:33,220 --> 03:10:37,580
I mean, she's obvious she she makes reference to the fact that she hates digesting and hates eating

4518
03:10:37,580 --> 03:10:42,900
So obviously her shits in the past have been very slimy very hard to wipe. They never wipe all the way

4519
03:10:42,900 --> 03:10:48,460
They take forever. She's on the toilet for hours. Just like why is there so much shit? Why do they never wipe?

4520
03:10:48,460 --> 03:10:53,060
She's got that she's got that problem. She's got a never white problem here. She's too much poop. It's too slimy

4521
03:10:53,060 --> 03:10:56,380
It's too fucking filthy. She's always got filthy rancid, you know

4522
03:10:56,380 --> 03:11:02,380
The few times that she has put herself through the the the traumatic experience of eating and digesting food

4523
03:11:02,380 --> 03:11:06,940
It's been a bad experience every time so that's why so there you go. Her poops are bad

4524
03:11:09,460 --> 03:11:14,260
Poops are shit on average I as short as possible because it's bad

4525
03:11:19,340 --> 03:11:22,340
I spend a lot of time in the toilet just because it's the only place

4526
03:11:22,340 --> 03:11:25,100
Where I feel safe where no one is gonna fucking bother me

4527
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:31,100
Honestly, I'm at that age. Sure. That's understandable. I don't push too much, but I take my time

4528
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:36,860
I want me out in in under five minutes. That's a success. That is during a shit

4529
03:11:36,860 --> 03:11:42,680
I always do the sitting on the on the seat thing to to maximize a speed

4530
03:11:43,180 --> 03:11:45,180
Oh like putting your you know aerodynamic

4531
03:11:46,940 --> 03:11:48,940
Yeah

4532
03:11:49,420 --> 03:11:52,860
Squad over the fucking toilet it makes it come out squad over the sink

4533
03:11:53,860 --> 03:11:58,740
Until I do that, but uh when I was younger it used to always take me like 30 minutes to shit

4534
03:11:59,660 --> 03:12:04,660
Like once a day or so and like yeah, I've known a lot of people who take long shits

4535
03:12:04,660 --> 03:12:07,780
It's both something that you get better at as you age

4536
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:11,020
Like for some reason you can shit faster as you age

4537
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:18,340
Also, like apparently having like difficulty shitting and taking too long to shit is a sign of autism

4538
03:12:18,340 --> 03:12:20,340
So

4539
03:12:22,660 --> 03:12:24,660
It's a sign of

4540
03:12:26,340 --> 03:12:28,340
It's true, I don't know

4541
03:12:30,460 --> 03:12:35,460
Every speed up put your feet up put your feet up on every story that did you tell me you might be surprised

4542
03:12:35,460 --> 03:12:39,300
All has the same punch line and then later in life. I find out it's a sign of autism

4543
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:42,260
It's true. Every story

4544
03:12:43,220 --> 03:12:50,380
What happens when you so it happens when you grow up obviously autistic and nobody notices until you notice later

4545
03:12:50,780 --> 03:12:54,760
Because you read all the stuff about it and you go oh all of this was true about me

4546
03:12:55,580 --> 03:12:57,920
But yeah, no, I did read that

4547
03:12:58,580 --> 03:13:02,420
I don't I don't remember if it was actually autism or something something like that

4548
03:13:03,860 --> 03:13:10,380
But yeah, I've had friends who would spend like literally up to two hours like with a laptop like what my my

4549
03:13:10,380 --> 03:13:14,380
cousin boyd used to fucking watch full movies in my fucking toilet and just

4550
03:13:15,140 --> 03:13:18,740
Damning up the bathroom for a fucking hour. So I have to go downstairs

4551
03:13:18,740 --> 03:13:23,900
I have my own bathroom because I have dain to share it my room with my cousin

4552
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:29,220
He's taking two hours shit. It was really annoying, but then he started like actively trying to cut his shit time

4553
03:13:30,460 --> 03:13:35,660
Work because he would have the shit all the time and everywhere like he would take long ass shits like twice a day

4554
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:37,860
Like these fucking chapters

4555
03:13:37,860 --> 03:13:42,460
I mean, you know, there's something to be said like I'm sure you guys have like had your phone out

4556
03:13:42,460 --> 03:13:46,100
You go to the toilet and then you just like get busy doing stuff while you're shitting and you're like

4557
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:51,820
Like I used to I do I used to consistently read manga while I was shitting and yes

4558
03:13:51,820 --> 03:13:56,420
Like if it takes me like if I'm reading the first chapter of a new book and it's like 60 pages long

4559
03:13:56,420 --> 03:13:58,660
I might be in there for like 20 minutes, but

4560
03:13:59,380 --> 03:14:01,460
These days. I don't even read on the shit

4561
03:14:01,460 --> 03:14:04,860
I just try to get in and out as fast as possible because I just don't want to be there all day

4562
03:14:05,100 --> 03:14:10,060
Yeah, it's especially cuz fucking cold. I mean if you take it if it's if it's taking you two hours shit

4563
03:14:10,060 --> 03:14:18,580
I mean, I think the obvious solution is get in there shit what you can quick finish leave come back two hours later

4564
03:14:18,580 --> 03:14:22,380
And deal with the rest. There is nothing more unsatisfying than feeling I have not completely

4565
03:14:25,700 --> 03:14:30,660
Dude, I will hold it in until I until I feel that I cannot do it all in one go

4566
03:14:30,660 --> 03:14:35,860
Fair enough I guess but I do that in the morning character. I will literally wait

4567
03:14:38,940 --> 03:14:44,540
Because I started having stomach problems recently and like I could never shit when I first woke up

4568
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:49,340
But if I wait a few hours until you've like, you know walked around and like yeah, all right

4569
03:14:49,340 --> 03:14:52,660
Maybe had comes out way easier and also like something

4570
03:14:52,660 --> 03:14:59,300
I'll do is just while taking your shit like get up and like pace around the bathroom to hope like jostle some of it loose

4571
03:14:59,300 --> 03:15:01,300
You know sure

4572
03:15:07,380 --> 03:15:12,780
Gracie grimy bloody fucking muddy shit poopy shitty fucking bung holes

4573
03:15:13,260 --> 03:15:19,460
Spraying out fecal matter all over the fucking walls fucking shitty all over people's fucking face

4574
03:15:19,620 --> 03:15:25,620
Smelly poopy bloody shits and someone's mouth. I don't even fucking give a shit fucking kill me someone end my life

4575
03:15:25,820 --> 03:15:28,700
Poopy poopy poopy. All right, let's go on next call

4576
03:15:29,340 --> 03:15:34,540
Next call people is from our old friend paradox crocs. So let's see what he's

4577
03:15:36,500 --> 03:15:40,300
Good go top of the morning D gamers. It's me. No

4578
03:15:41,460 --> 03:15:48,380
So I got an email from official procrastinators at gmail.com saying that I was gonna be the newest addition to the PCP

4579
03:15:49,420 --> 03:15:51,700
Something about how much he's basically 30 now

4580
03:15:51,700 --> 03:15:54,220
So you need some fresh blood to secure the zoomer appeal

4581
03:15:54,700 --> 03:16:00,580
But I entered in my credit card information and I still haven't received an invite to the PCP discord I

4582
03:16:01,060 --> 03:16:04,140
Was wondering if you forgot to send it or if you changed your minds

4583
03:16:04,140 --> 03:16:06,860
I mean, I can show you my medical records if you want proof

4584
03:16:06,860 --> 03:16:10,260
I have enough mental disabilities to fit the joining criteria if that's the issue

4585
03:16:11,780 --> 03:16:18,580
Anyways, it'd be cool if you could get back to me on that as always don't forget to like comment subscribe at paradox crocs.com

4586
03:16:18,580 --> 03:16:23,340
Slash paradox crocs and enter in the promo code big iron. See you in the next voicemail

4587
03:16:24,220 --> 03:16:27,660
I regret adopting so fucking much every single day

4588
03:16:27,660 --> 03:16:32,180
I regret I regret making you my first adopted son and second son overall paradox

4589
03:16:34,380 --> 03:16:39,180
You keep crawling back somehow, I don't know how you do it, but what I'll figure out how to ban you for good

4590
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:43,500
This is a great question. We get it all the time. There's lots of people in this situation

4591
03:16:43,540 --> 03:16:49,460
The answer we always give is uh, uh, do keep watching your email for our response

4592
03:16:49,460 --> 03:16:52,300
Do not check your bank records. No, no, no

4593
03:16:53,020 --> 03:16:56,100
Continue because it won't be why wish your time

4594
03:16:56,780 --> 03:17:00,940
Yeah, it'll happen by the way. I forgot some people saying they've checked their bank records

4595
03:17:00,940 --> 03:17:05,940
Do not be like those people those people were banned. They were removed from the running and from life

4596
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:09,820
You ever wonder what happened? Kevin checked his bank records and look where he is now

4597
03:17:10,180 --> 03:17:15,020
Rant ranted about on did you bro and ruin the full name of this via email?

4598
03:17:15,020 --> 03:17:20,540
I was over this message from paradox crocs PCB member number 13 lucky number 13. So that was yeah

4599
03:17:21,100 --> 03:17:26,100
Good good keeping track. All right, 13 organization 13

4600
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:29,140
Oh boy, what is it?

4601
03:17:29,140 --> 03:17:32,380
I don't even is that might be true. I don't know something like that. I don't know

4602
03:17:33,380 --> 03:17:38,100
Okay, we got one more. We got one more voicemail. Okay, and this one is from a hen

4603
03:17:38,580 --> 03:17:44,900
Zuckstable, so we'll see what this is from. Let's let's get into it. Go more like hen sucks to bowl. Oh, got him

4604
03:17:45,020 --> 03:17:47,020
Wolf

4605
03:17:47,300 --> 03:17:50,780
Hello, yes, hello is is is this thing on?

4606
03:17:51,620 --> 03:17:57,180
Hi, I won't waste your time. Good. I just want to talk to Xenox will real quick. Oh, yeah, that's me. Hey, what's up?

4607
03:17:58,060 --> 03:18:02,900
Yeah, it's me your agent. I was just wondering how much longer this podcast is gonna take

4608
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:06,820
It's like another 30 minutes or something. Hi. Well, what's up? Yeah?

4609
03:18:06,820 --> 03:18:12,580
Well, I just wanted to remind you that you're gonna be on this the superior pizza party of podcast

4610
03:18:15,620 --> 03:18:17,620
Oh

4611
03:18:18,180 --> 03:18:20,180
Yeah, okay, and one more thing

4612
03:18:20,220 --> 03:18:25,780
What would you say that the chances are that this gag flop because of input like um, you know, I wouldn't be surprised

4613
03:18:26,060 --> 03:18:32,180
That's the issue with you know talking to people online. You sometimes like end up talking over each other and like becomes a whole Lord deal

4614
03:18:44,900 --> 03:18:46,900
I

4615
03:18:50,540 --> 03:18:57,160
Don't know the audience will appreciate the fact that Xen was actually responding to himself in that call

4616
03:18:57,500 --> 03:18:59,500
Yeah, I don't know

4617
03:19:02,500 --> 03:19:04,500
That is

4618
03:19:08,580 --> 03:19:11,580
It'll uh people will know because the audio quality will be

4619
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:15,020
Impossible it was hard to tell the difference

4620
03:19:16,020 --> 03:19:21,220
Over the call. Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't I mean I knew what you were doing because I could see your little right

4621
03:19:22,980 --> 03:19:27,580
That was submitted by the way like 10 minutes before the start of the podcast

4622
03:19:29,460 --> 03:19:34,100
I thought you know, I thought maybe you had like submitted that like while we were in the call

4623
03:19:34,700 --> 03:19:36,700
Because we've gone on for like three and a half

4624
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:41,600
I mean, he certainly would not have made the pizza party podcast if that was

4625
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:46,980
If that is a legitimate hey tell those hey tell those pizza party fucks we got a bone

4626
03:19:48,500 --> 03:19:50,500
Deliver

4627
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:57,140
Okay, no, I've literally never listened to it. Damn it. Yeah. Well, I

4628
03:19:59,540 --> 03:20:03,780
Like we actually should do that let's start shit with the pizza party. Oh my fucking god. No

4629
03:20:04,780 --> 03:20:07,220
No, guys really let's actually fire bomb their house

4630
03:20:07,220 --> 03:20:13,060
Let's actually kidnap their children in a no hold a ransom in an abs in an abstract sort of intellectual way

4631
03:20:13,060 --> 03:20:15,420
I think it would be really funny if we had beef

4632
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:19,980
That mean Ben please break down the abstract

4633
03:20:20,860 --> 03:20:25,820
Intellectual hate that you have to say that how the idea of us having it is great

4634
03:20:25,820 --> 03:20:30,260
But the actual practice of doing it sounds like work and a pain and it would be bad

4635
03:20:30,860 --> 03:20:36,500
Yeah, that's that's what I mean. Yeah, I just like allocate like ten minutes each. I'm so just I don't know anything about them

4636
03:20:36,500 --> 03:20:38,500
I've never watched

4637
03:20:43,580 --> 03:20:48,260
We said we were gonna add jingles jingles proceeding segments

4638
03:20:48,260 --> 03:20:50,420
We should have a shitting on the pizza party

4639
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:57,820
Someone write a song someone write a song and submit it and we'll play it on the thing and it'll be a jingle about

4640
03:20:57,820 --> 03:21:00,580
It's time to start talking about how shit the pizza party pie

Pushing their alt-right and then simultaneously SJW agenda

03:23:38,660 --> 03:23:40,500
indeed indeed

4675
03:23:40,500 --> 03:23:43,020
Well, but that's how it's gonna be people

4676
03:23:43,020 --> 03:23:45,340
It's like it's like if you're doing like you need to you know

4677
03:23:45,540 --> 03:23:52,940
Submit something that you think you could do for an entire podcast like every wreck like don't you know don't spend like two weeks

4678
03:23:53,540 --> 03:23:59,580
Editing this like ten minute mini episode or whatever and get it back to us like yeah, and then you can't you can't do

4679
03:24:02,660 --> 03:24:06,260
Yeah, if you want to provide I mean we will be scrutinizing to be like okay

4680
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:11,500
This guy did a full fucking animation that's way too much that probably means he's not the man for the job

4681
03:24:11,500 --> 03:24:17,260
So do not go overboard. We're looking for a podcast format. The emphasis is on audio editing

4682
03:24:17,260 --> 03:24:19,860
This is an audio show so like hey

4683
03:24:19,860 --> 03:24:24,980
I mean it's all in the document, but if you want to fucking scroll down to the part that's like checking your fucking levels

4684
03:24:25,700 --> 03:24:29,780
Checking your levels like we you know Tom me and Gib and Ben

4685
03:24:29,820 --> 03:24:34,300
Alden our own little like visual syncing with the audio things look if you want to do that great

4686
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:39,300
We're happy to have it, but do not overburden yourself and make it a big deal

4687
03:24:39,300 --> 03:24:43,660
It's supposed to be a small thing make it slightly more pleasing the emphasis is on the audio

4688
03:24:43,660 --> 03:24:45,940
So keep that in mind people yeah that in mind

4689
03:24:46,460 --> 03:24:51,420
But that said we're gonna pick the best one whoever makes the best stuff that's sustainable wants to get paid

4690
03:24:51,420 --> 03:24:53,420
It wants to be a part of the fucking team

4691
03:24:53,780 --> 03:24:58,740
And that's it. That's really everything you need to know I think so it's in the description click that document

4692
03:24:58,740 --> 03:25:01,580
It's got everything you need to know if you got questions

4693
03:25:01,580 --> 03:25:07,060
We probably should also like clarify using the same hashtag PCP editor contest

4694
03:25:07,060 --> 03:25:12,300
I think we might need to be like ages 16 and up or something for labor law purposes because we

4695
03:25:14,020 --> 03:25:20,260
That you have to be legal to work. I don't know what age I assume it's like 18 plus or something

4696
03:25:22,300 --> 03:25:26,100
Might might depend on what might depend on what country yeah, it could depend on that

4697
03:25:26,100 --> 03:25:31,060
So I guess that's up to you folks if you're 16, and you don't know do us a favor and Google it

4698
03:25:31,380 --> 03:25:33,860
If you're legal to fucking work and do this shit

4699
03:25:34,780 --> 03:25:37,620
Yeah, I mean, I don't know or over 18 then it should be fine

4700
03:25:37,620 --> 03:25:44,460
I think or I mean just fake your information really convincingly because then it's not our oh, that's fair. I would think

4701
03:25:48,380 --> 03:25:53,020
Get excited people this is your chance to be a member of the your favorite podcast

4702
03:25:53,380 --> 03:25:55,380
Remember

4703
03:25:56,980 --> 03:25:59,700
Well, that's what I mean I'm on the team

4704
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:02,420
I'm but I'm excited but I'm excited to see like I don't know

4705
03:26:02,420 --> 03:26:05,740
Maybe someone will come up with like a really neat visual look and I'll be really cool

4706
03:26:05,740 --> 03:26:12,180
And it'll be like hey, I really want this. I don't know. I'm excited to see what right make me and again just to clarify that remember

4707
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:15,780
This is a paid slave indentured servant position

4708
03:26:15,780 --> 03:26:21,540
You are not a member of the PCP by winning this you are a lowly if you employ you rag them up and fuck

4709
03:26:22,180 --> 03:26:27,740
If we start to get the impression you're trying to bury Kramer your way on to the show we're gonna cut you right out

4710
03:26:27,780 --> 03:26:29,940
So don't even try so have no

4711
03:26:31,180 --> 03:26:35,580
You will be a friend or respected by us in any capacity

4712
03:26:37,940 --> 03:26:40,020
That's that's what you need to know people

4713
03:26:40,420 --> 03:26:47,700
Don't waste our fucking time if your shit just skip it only do it and and also you will be laid off at a moment's notice

4714
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:50,900
If any of us need extra money for editing at any point

4715
03:26:51,900 --> 03:26:53,900
Indeed indeed, of course, of course

4716
03:26:54,420 --> 03:27:00,020
We'll try to have general job security here, but like you know, maybe one day someone's gonna want to be like

4717
03:27:00,020 --> 03:27:02,020
Hey, I want to do a Delta room thing. That's really cool

4718
03:27:02,180 --> 03:27:05,780
We're gonna try to do this rarely to take it away and do the editing

4719
03:27:05,780 --> 03:27:10,620
We want this to be you this you I'm talking to you future winner of this contest

4720
03:27:10,620 --> 03:27:13,260
What are we paying to be you week to week doing this shit?

4721
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:19,860
We are it's in the document everything you need to know and by the way part of the test here is reading the document

4722
03:27:20,140 --> 03:27:23,020
Understanding it because that shows professionalism that shows your ability

4723
03:27:24,660 --> 03:27:26,660
Don't give them all the hints

4724
03:27:28,420 --> 03:27:33,780
That's that's too much already you've got everything you need to do this like the hunt. I have just received word

4725
03:27:33,780 --> 03:27:38,860
I have missed the people that this episode when I don't fucking longer. I miss the puppy bull

4726
03:27:41,780 --> 03:27:48,380
It happens before the fucking Super Bowl every year what it's it's the only good thing about the Super Bowl wait

4727
03:27:49,380 --> 03:27:55,540
Today Patriots are in the go fucking game versus the ramp. That's really funny that we've gone this whole this whole day

4728
03:27:55,540 --> 03:27:58,900
This whole thing we didn't talk about the Super Bowl. I didn't know what's happening

4729
03:27:58,900 --> 03:28:03,380
But I did hear but I did hear the recording this before the Super Bowl, so it's like indeed

4730
03:28:10,540 --> 03:28:13,980
Because that's a pretty important thing we glossed over my favorite football team

4731
03:28:13,980 --> 03:28:19,020
Is the Miami Dolphins and also the Dallas Cowboys and other teams that I know

4732
03:28:43,980 --> 03:28:50,780
Don't want to do I just I just think John from needs, you know, he needs to be redeemed

4733
03:29:13,980 --> 03:29:15,980
I
