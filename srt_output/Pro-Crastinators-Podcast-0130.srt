The Pro Crastinators Podcast

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello everyone! Welcome to a PCP episode. That's the Pro Crastinators Podcast for the layman out there.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am the best guy ever. And uh...

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Boom! Gotcha!

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Layman? More like layman. Wow.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's Ben Saint, always before hurtful feelings.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've just brought a hot take to the table, and it is a sizzlin' on the griddle.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We've got, uh, hopefully to win Hippocrit.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let me tell you the story of me old bones.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It all started in... I forget. Now you've distracted me. Now I can't remember my story.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Shit. Well, sorry about that.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Little Aurora Mage is here.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Am I a demon, or am I a mediton ex?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are we human, or are we dancers?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Um, uh, and we've got Munchy.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Layman, more like low main, I say, preparing my dish to serve.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, happy Halloween season, everybody!

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's not keto!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I forget who said it, but we have a commenter who said last episode,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
can there be a single episode where Ben doesn't mention his diet?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why would you want that, idiot?

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, Ben's a man of and for, exclusively.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
His diet, commenters, fuck, fight me.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's censoring that you're trying to censor my very being.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's true. We should talk about our costumes that we're all wearing.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes, it's a Halloween close enough episode.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, we're all wearing them, as you can see, on screen in front of you right now.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh my god!

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have a cream sickle colored onesie.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It is a footed pajama onesie.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It is cream sickle covered, it's a very pleasant yellow.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And then I have moose antlers, and I am moose.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He is moose!

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, most moose aren't cream sickle colored.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's going on there?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think you better stop saying things like that before I encase you in the stone again,

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and you won't be able to get out, because it will be so thick,

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and you won't have any tools with you.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's true. I might be able to get out in my dreams,

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
because I'm Freddy Krueger, guys!

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Haha! Look at my fingers!

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll cut you in the dream world, where you are right now.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Freddy escapes to New York, too, the other day, for the first time,

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and he was like, I'm gonna fuck you, and it was exactly like Rick and Morty.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like me?

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I haven't seen a single 80's movie, let alone 80's.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Dude, I've been on a big horror movie bender,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
because I just got into, finally, some tiny bit,

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I was saying this the other day, of cinemastical shit,

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was watching all this monster movie shit,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and like I watched, just yesterday I watched The Exorcist,

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't finish, but I was watching fucking Freddy Krueger, Nightmare on Elm Street,

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was having a great time, I absolutely love it,

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and Freddy is Kino, is all I have to say about that.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ben, what are you wearing today?

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Shit, damn, I guess the world's my oyster,

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I guess I can just say anything I want,

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and just whoever's editing this episode is just gonna have to go with it, aren't they?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just put you in a cardboard box.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am...

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh no, I was about to say that I'm Kirito from Sorted Online,

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
because that would be really funny, but then I thought about it,

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and they realized that people of my age and stature actually go,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
actually do things like that, and unironically...

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ben, I met a Kirito cosplayer not too long ago,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
just living his life as a Kirito cosplayer.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, on Halloween, there was a Kirito cosplayer three years ago,

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and he was walking around the library, and I walked up to him and said,

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
hey, is that Sorted Online?

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And he said, yeah, and I was like, huh, okay, and then I walked away.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We were like, do you know Ditch Bro? I love him!

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I went to a comic expo yesterday, it was called MICE, Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo,

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and did not check who was going to be there.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I met Casey Green and Abby Howard, who it was like...

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You met Casey Green?

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, Casey Green was there, I shook his hand.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Shit, I forget what he made, I remember the name.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He made the anime club in the gun show.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The anime club!

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, dude, that's...

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And he makes fucking, what's it called?

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He had a portfolio there with originals from Anime Club.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He was selling the original pages of Anime Club.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Did you get any?

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You could see the blue pencil sketches and the ink layer over them.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, I didn't get any.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He makes Fat Boy comic, right?

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's the one he's doing now?

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not sure.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know he did, he's a good boy, and nut, and...

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What?

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I like it.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know about Fat Boy, I haven't heard of that one.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
God damn it, he's the guy who makes the comic about...

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Isn't it just about him as a character who's the most reprehensible, fat little...

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, that's Womp.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's Womp.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry, Casey Green.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ronnie Filmyaw from Womp, I think, isn't it?

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ronnie Filmyaw?

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, that's the one.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, I love gun show anyway, so no insult intended here.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What was I talking about?

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, I think the only reason I was bringing up Mice, which is the acronym, was that I actually

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
saw a guy in some kind of cosplay.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There was like...

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think as I was walking in, there was a guy and a girl, I think, sitting on a bench.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Human Centipede cosplay?

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And like, the girl was kind of cute, but they were both too fucking old for this shit.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And the girl was in Wonder Woman cosplay, and the guy was in...

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I couldn't identify what it was, but it looked like some kind of anime shit.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I was like, shut it as I walked by.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, no.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And I gotta say, the whole experience was not...

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I didn't like it.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I did not like going in there as a customer.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It felt bad.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It felt predatory.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It felt like I was a sheep walking into a den of lions.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How so?

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How so?

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I did not want to buy anything.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And even if I had wanted to buy anything, it wouldn't have been enough.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because it was like every one that I made eye contact with...

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Obviously, some of them were more aggressive than others.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But even the softest among them were still pitching in a sort of attempt to get me to buy something.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, that was like at the county fair.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It was just...

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's like I was just inherently at odds with them, and they were like...

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was immediately like...

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Even Casey Green, he didn't put the heat on or anything.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He didn't try and hard sell me his shit.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But even he was clearly wanted me to buy something.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because that's why they're there.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I was mad.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because I had wanted to sign up to be a tableer at this convention.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I think I could have probably done it if I had applied.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's just that I didn't move...

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I didn't live here in time.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And when I moved back to Massachusetts, it was too late.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The deadline was already over.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I was there, and I was like...

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Man, I would like this so much more being on the opposite side of this.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I would much rather be the lion.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think I might enjoy that in this scenario.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I do not like being the sheep.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's cool.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I understand what you mean.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I felt that way a lot about the county fair.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think I talked about it in the PCB before.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's just a whole cabal of weird, bizarre conspiracy theory wallets

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that prevent radio waves from accessing your credit cards.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And overpriced hot tubs to install on your mansions.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It was just a whole range of shit that people are trying to force on you

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
over and over and over again.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Really aggressively.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Just constantly.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I felt socially.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I felt like I was just...

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The people tabling were in charge.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They had all the social power.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They were the artists, and everyone else was the public.

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I felt inherently denigrated by the scenario.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was like, I should be...

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is such a humble event that I don't even know why I felt this way.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But I was like, I should be on the other side of the table.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I should be the one with the power.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
People should respect me.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I should not respect anyone.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think most people there kind of wouldn't have that problem

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
because you actually are a comic person.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you probably feel like that's just where you belong.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I did.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I felt like nature had twisted around.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why are you spooked?

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm spooked by the idea of being on the other side of the table.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, fair enough.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's spooky.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have to stand there and smile and get people to buy things.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I do not have the confidence to get people to buy things.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Here's the thing.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I would enjoy it because I would not care if anyone bought anything.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I would not care at all whether someone bought...

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I mean, obviously I would like it if they bought my shit.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But I would not be there to be like, ooh, I hope I make some money by selling my wares.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't care.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It would be good to just be fun.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I would be there so that people like Abby Howard and Casey Greene would be like,

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
ah, yes, this is my peer.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's my only goal.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And you know what?

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'd have accomplished it just by getting there.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I wouldn't care about feeding his family.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He cares about chasing that class.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I would just have a good time and meet people and it would be great.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a romantic rung on the indie comic Cursus Honorum to be able to not only publish your stuff in a real store like Ben has done as well,

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but also attend some sort of a small time convention.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I feel like that's just a ride of passage and a romantic ideal.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know what?

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I've never tabled a convention.

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's just what people do, but I've never done it.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And it's weird.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't think it's weird.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And being on what I consider to be the wrong side of the equation.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And history.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And history.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Made me really want to do it and also made me really want to get back to work and get my shit done so that I could go to events like this and have more stuff to show and be like, yes, this is my stuff, idiot.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Put down the dwarf fortress, Ben, and pick up the pen already.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Get back to it.

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, you know me.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ever since I've been like a comic guy now.

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You know me, Ben, a dwarf.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I've had thoughts of like, oh, wouldn't it be fucking sick if I made a little book of Bel-J for whatever.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I had little plushes of punk.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And I was standing there like, hey, you want it?

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's yours, my friend.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Like, you know, just like goading people over to it.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Which you'll have to find it first.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Dude, I think clump.

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think clump.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I think clump.

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think punk pushes fucking help.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Pump.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Plushes would sell pretty well.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They'd be cues.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The thing about that is that, I mean, you'd like, they'd have to be all handmade.

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like, like, like getting a, like getting like a fucking setup to like mass produce plushes is like super hard and impossible or make sense.

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Speaking of plushes, I have something.

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wait, mate.

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's for the love of God.

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want to hear all about that.

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But we have not finished our goddamn Halloween costume introductions.

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Can we please just do...

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Ben, what the fuck are you wearing right now?

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just tell me.

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just tell me.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Fine.

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm dressed as a...

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Casey Green.

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm dressed as a...

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm dressed as a...

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Casey Green.

246
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Look at you.

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, I'm Casey Green.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can see it.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's right.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's just Ben with the name tag.

251
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hey, kids.

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is Casey Green.

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I hope you all got your faces ready to sing a little tune here.

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's go!

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Good.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Having a baby and the baby is you.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay, anyway.

258
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Gib, what are you wearing?

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What's your costume?

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Oh, me.

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm a pirate skeleton.

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was from Pirates of the Caribbean, number movie one, and I was a dead guy.

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I still have my little piece of gold.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Good.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, that's great.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm dead.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Ah, shit.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Who else has left?

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Munchy?

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, no, we never did Munchy.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mage.

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mage, right?

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Mage is...

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Mage is Mage.

275
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, Mage is Mage.

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,320
I just put on an extra pair of wings, like little bat wings to complete my evil demon

277
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,000
look and also opened my second pair of eyes just for you guys.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We appreciate that.

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, okay.

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank God we've got those inter...

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait a minute.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh my God.

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She's open, not just...

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What's happening?

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The earth's rumbling, people.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you feel that?

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Nothing.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Nothing.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's happening?

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Not another calamity.

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's a zombie.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What the hell is that thing?

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, here he is.

294
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What the fuck is that thing right there?

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh God, help us all.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Could it be?

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Could it be?

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't...

299
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is it him risen from the grave?

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I see an empty Max Revive on the ground.

301
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What's that next to it?

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh God, he got into it.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He got into the Max Revives.

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh no.

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's all drains.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's the PCP guy.

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There it...

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, that's not the PCP guy.

309
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's the legally distinct PCP guy.

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Legally distinct PCP guy.

311
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And he's legal.

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, he really is after three years.

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's really scary.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Get him off the screen.

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
All right.

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's back, everybody.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He makes Halloween.

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He makes Halloween.

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's so legally...

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He's so legally distinct that he's...

321
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He's bulletproof.

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We are.

324
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We're all bulletproof now.

325
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It was drawn by Mage because she's like...

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
She's a necromancer, I guess.

327
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
She made him come out of the ground.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm a demon.

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Demon and necromancer, same thing.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You just have powers.

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Whatever.

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Get over it.

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, whatever, dude.

334
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Does that make a big deal of it or anything?

335
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, you wanted him.

337
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I wanted him.

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah.

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And he's back now.

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He's legally distinct.

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can stop bulletproof.

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh no, he's scared of us.

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He's running and he's hiding in the background there.

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, don't worry, guys.

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, he's more scared of us than we are of him.

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, we are horrible beasts right now.

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
If you encounter him in the wild, just spread your coat out.

348
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Try and make yourself look as big as possible.

349
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do not run.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do not run.

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Face him down.

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Just look at his face.

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Make loud noises like you're a crazy person.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes.

355
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's how we've kept him in check.

356
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Throw sticks and rocks.

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Do not run.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, that's out of the way.

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Moving on.

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mage, what the hell are you saying about plushes?

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I want to hear it.

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, today was a very exciting day.

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It was related to the Pokemon community today,

364
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but I'll skip all the details, I guess.

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh my god, it's Belldom Day.

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Shiny Metagrosses people, they're out there waiting for you.

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Dude, where's my phone?

368
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I gotta pull my phone out.

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's a weekly night, so...

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll be doing it.

371
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm going out to get them.

372
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm switching to headset.

373
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm switching to headset.

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm going out.

375
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll do the rest of the PCP remotely.

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Actually, Ben, it doesn't actually start for us.

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wait, no, it does start in 10 minutes.

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Five minutes, yeah.

379
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, plenty of time.

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
E.

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, it was a big journey, a big, big day for me.

382
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not sure how many details I want to go into,

383
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but however, one highlight of this whole thing

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
was that I discovered a Build-A-Bear thing,

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and they had Pokemon in it,

386
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and I had my very first Build-A-Bear,

387
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
which is a low on Vulpix, and I love it.

388
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And I named it Tyga, and it's on my desk right now,

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and it's life-size.

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I love it so much.

391
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Can we get a picture of that?

392
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hell yeah.

393
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Or show notes.

394
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A low on Vulpix is very hoggable.

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's a good one.

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That is true.

397
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Fucking Build-A-Bear is really sick.

398
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I love Build-A-Bear.

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I have very, very fond memories of the game.

400
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I prefer a low on Ninetales.

401
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Much more competitively viable.

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Look at them there.

403
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, question about this, though.

404
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Isn't kind of the point of Build-A-Bear

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
that you're supposed to customize it,

406
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
but this just looks like a generic low on Vulpix.

407
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I didn't want to dress it up.

408
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, so you had the option to dress it up,

409
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but you chose not to.

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, okay.

411
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You could have given it thigh highs.

412
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, God.

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Jesus Christ.

414
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And like a choker.

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And like a choker, lace collar.

416
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I didn't like any of the clothes options.

417
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You could have given him, you know,

418
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
crotchless panties, you know.

419
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Stop.

420
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Stop.

421
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Stop.

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Stop.

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Stop doing this to my pure baby.

424
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't start a bell.

425
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

426
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Stop that.

427
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You're all banned.

428
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, that's true.

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're not allowed to speak to me or my son ever again.

430
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I just have him like, he's got like,

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
what if you come out and you've built your bear

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and you just go, hey, I made this bear

433
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and then one, he's got a big old fat cigar

434
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
in the one hand and the other one,

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
he's got a big old stack of pornography.

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Tiny little like knitted pornography,

437
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but you can still read it kind of.

438
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh my God.

439
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh my God.

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There's a, there's a baniere.

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Where's that baniere?

442
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want it.

443
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you like baniere a lot?

444
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

445
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh yeah.

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I like low-punny because it's fuckable, you know.

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What if you went into a builder bear

448
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and you said, make all the homestuck characters.

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Would they do it?

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They don't have the template.

451
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You go in, you pick up a head.

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They don't have the courage for that.

453
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Useful.

454
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, like when you go in,

455
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
they have already pre-made heads and empty bodies

456
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and they fill up the bodies.

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've got an empty body.

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I've got an empty skeleton.

459
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No, no, no.

460
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I was meaning like I have no soul, like I'm depressed

461
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
because they couldn't make homestuck figurines.

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The interaction with the lady that was like filling it up

463
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
was quite awkward.

464
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Really?

465
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How so?

466
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, she had a Pikachu on her bag,

467
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
on her back in a bag.

468
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And so I thought maybe, maybe she likes Pokemon

469
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
so it won't be as awkward,

470
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
but she kind of seemed like a bit of a,

471
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
bit of a normie.

472
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Such a normie.

473
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, there it is.

474
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Such a normie.

475
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I wish I had that sound bite ready to go.

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I do have that.

477
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Gib actually prepared that sound clip though.

478
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So, one day.

479
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Prepare for what?

480
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
For what?

481
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
For what are you preparing?

482
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know.

483
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't worry about it.

484
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Once the bombs drop Mage,

485
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
we're not going to be able to hear you say things like that anymore.

486
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So we're just going to play it down.

487
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The only currency that's going to have any value

488
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
is going to be, you know, Mage audio clips.

489
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
MP35.

490
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's going to be the new currency.

491
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Listen, listen.

492
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The Petrodollar is cratching our over-extended oil needles

493
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and octopus tentacles

494
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
are retracting from the world.

495
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We're not going to be able to sustain our currency anymore.

496
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And what do we turn to?

497
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Some people say crypto.

498
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Some people say nuclear waste.

499
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I say Mage audio clips.

500
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, funny audio clips.

501
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm literally printing money right now

502
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
with every single word I'm speaking.

503
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, yeah.

504
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Belden Community Day.

505
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Halloween episode.

506
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Let's talk about Pokemon Go again.

507
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Fucking, I got so many Belden.

508
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I caught, I looked at the Pokedex.

509
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I caught 150 of those fuckers.

510
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Damn, that's like all the Pokemon there are.

511
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes.

512
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I caught 150 and I traded one of them with my brother

513
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
right at the end and I evolved it.

514
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And it's like a 98% lucky Metagross

515
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
with like almost maxed out CP.

516
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And then I finished him off

517
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and he's like the biggest, strongest lad.

518
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's crazy.

519
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There he goes.

520
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Right.

521
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Gen 4 came out guys.

522
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I sure did.

523
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
My absolute favorite generation.

524
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I caught two Banearies.

525
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I still can't get my Mamas one.

526
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I know, you have to wait for another wave for that.

527
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But yeah, I'm super excited.

528
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Gen 4 has been my favorite gen ever since I was a kid

529
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
because it was the first one that I did, obviously.

530
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I've always had a soft place in my heart

531
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for like Starling and all the stars and stuff like that.

532
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm walking my Chimchar right now.

533
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I am really excited because I don't know anything

534
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
about the past gen 3.

535
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So like this is all going to be new and fun and cool.

536
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Like when I saw Baneary, I was like,

537
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
what the fuck is that?

538
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's got like weird brains coming out of its head.

539
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But it's just fluff.

540
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's so cool.

541
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's like a zombie Pokemon.

542
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Woo, Halloween.

543
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't wait for Munchlax to come.

544
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm so excited.

545
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He's coming dude.

546
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He's coming.

547
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know if you're going to get him.

548
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't know how they're going to replicate.

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I just assume eggs maybe.

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He's really, really hard to get in the games.

551
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I was watching a video.

552
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Here's how you get Munchlax in the game.

553
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Can I explain?

554
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm the Munchlax guy.

555
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Please do.

556
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
All right.

557
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
When you start a copy,

558
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
when you start a new game of Pokemon,

559
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Diamond, Pearl or Platinum,

560
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
there is an item called the trainer card

561
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and it lists a number there.

562
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But what isn't listed there

563
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
is your secret trainer ID.

564
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And your secret trainer ID

565
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
is calculated whenever you press new game

566
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and you start a new character.

567
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And this secret ID calculates

568
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
the placement for Pokemon

569
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
within the Gen 4 gameplay mechanic

570
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
which is slathering honey on trees.

571
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
In Gen 4, you can slather honey on the trees.

572
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And if you come back in five hours real world time,

573
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
keep in mind you can't manipulate your DS time

574
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
like you can for literally every other game.

575
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't even know how they fucking calculate it.

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But once five hours actually pass in the real world

577
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and you've slathered honey on some bark,

578
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you can come back to that specially marked tree

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and pick up the Pokemon.

580
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And these Pokemon are mostly shit.

581
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like they're almost always terrible.

582
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You've got fucking combi

583
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and it's probably gonna be a male combi

584
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
so you can't even get a vetspequin

585
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
or you're gonna fucking get a fucking bee doofen.

586
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There's no reason for you to fucking do it.

587
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But based, calculated on your trainer ID,

588
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
there are four trees

589
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
that could possibly contain a munchlax.

590
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Keep in mind, possibly.

591
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This is not like these are the munchlax trees.

592
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Go here for munchlax.

593
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Munchlax has a 1% chance

594
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to be in a tree calculated by a number

595
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that you can't fucking see.

596
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So you're going to have to go to every tree in Sinnoh.

597
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Do it a hundred times.

598
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Like, and just slather honey on there a hundred times

599
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
to make sure that tree doesn't contain a munchlax

600
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and then move on to the next tree.

601
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And there's something like 27 trees or something.

602
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So just randomly, these four trees are calculated

603
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and you have no way of knowing which one is a munchlax or not.

604
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I mean, breed it how?

605
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Like, trade a Snorlax from another game or something?

606
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, you can, but you would have to have a Snorlax

607
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and you would also have to have a full incense.

608
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Those games don't have a Snorlax?

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No.

610
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No, they don't.

611
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You would also have to, if you don't have two Snorlaxes,

612
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
you would have to get the National Pokedex in Platinum

613
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
because then you can get a ditto in National Park.

614
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
In my current Nuzlocke I'm doing right now,

615
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I saw that munchlax is a Pokemon I could possibly get

616
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and I'm like, dude, I'ma get a fucking Snorlax

617
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
for my Elite Four team.

618
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
By the way, just beat the eighth gym on my Twitch.

619
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Twitch.tv slash definitely best guy ever.

620
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Check it out every Saturday at 7.30 p.m.

621
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh boy.

622
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm getting ready for the Elite Four right now,

623
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
eighth badges, here we go.

624
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Anyway, I wanted to get that fucking munchlax,

625
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but when I see this shit, it is impossible.

626
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There's a zero chance I'm gonna get this fucking munchlax.

627
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You'd just be throwing away your random encounter for the area.

628
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yep, yep.

629
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Supressing.

630
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh god.

631
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Hey, something cool happened in Pokemon Go.

632
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Tell me if anything like this has happened for any of you.

633
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So, there was, so I have my house.

634
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
My house does not have any stops in range of it.

635
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There's one kind of down in the corner.

636
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like it's like around the corner from me,

637
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
there's one at a church.

638
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then a little ways down a side street,

639
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I pass this church like on the way to and from like the convenience store a bunch.

640
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then a little ways down, like one block down the side street,

641
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
there was a stop, a gym actually.

642
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
A weirdly located gym in the middle of,

643
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
in like this nothing little corner.

644
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I think it's with the new update that they've switched,

645
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and now the gym is the one that I pass on my way to and from the convenience store.

646
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And now that what was for me, the gym is now just a stop,

647
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
which is great.

648
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That's very strange.

649
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That is weird, but that's also cool.

650
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It definitely happened.

651
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That place was absolutely a gym.

652
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I have walked there and like stood on their,

653
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Do you have the gym badge still?

654
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
In people's corners and like probably wears them out by just walking down the street,

655
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
standing on their corner for 10 minutes and looking at my phone and then walking away.

656
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I used to do it all the time.

657
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I do that all the time, dude.

658
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Guys, get a fucking electric skateboard, increase your efficiency.

659
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm just telling you, it's such an upgrade for Pokemon Go specifically.

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I like the walking.

661
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hey, it's what fucking...

662
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I don't want anything to add noise to my walk.

663
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I walk through the park and it's really peaceful.

664
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I also don't want to go fast for any reason.

665
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I like that it takes a long time to get from point to point.

666
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But you can be more efficient at getting more Pokestops and stuff.

667
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Because it's more pleasant and I enjoy it more.

668
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I can walk around the park nearby my house.

669
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It takes about an hour to go all the way around it.

670
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We want to shred hardcore on the pavement and make old ladies jump and fucking splash them as you go by.

671
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm with you, Nate.

672
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm all about that efficiency.

673
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The walk I have is like an aesthetic thing.

674
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You go down the path alongside the river and then you get to one end of the park.

675
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You turn around and you start going up this hill and then right at the top of the hill there's like a gym.

676
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You can just sit on the hill, on the grass and just look out over the whole park.

677
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You sit there, you spin the Pokestop a few times, you beat the gym and you just sit there for a while.

678
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And then you go home when you feel like.

679
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's what I do.

680
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Having a skateboard would be completely useless for me.

681
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I have a lot of stops in my vicinity so the skateboard really helps me hit them all real fast.

682
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Because otherwise I definitely would not walk.

683
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't have a lot of stops where I live so I have to kind of walk.

684
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah, I've noticed your trainer ID says you've walked over 10,000 kilometers.

685
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
No, over 1,000 kilometers, not 10,000.

686
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I just want to let you guys know.

687
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The clock just turned over in Pokemon Go.

688
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I have it open and all the Belldoms appeared.

689
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
God, fuck this podcast.

690
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I want to be catching Belldoms.

691
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Can we call it here?

692
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No.

693
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Quick other life update.

694
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I just want everyone to know that I've got like, when I record this, I usually sit with like a blanket wrapped around my legs.

695
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And currently my dog has entered that blanket and is sitting on my feet.

696
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And it's the most comfortable and adorable thing in the world.

697
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm happy that you have a dog name.

698
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's such the most positive character development that possibly could have happened to you.

699
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm so ambivalent.

700
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm going to harvest him for his meat one of these days.

701
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I could not be more ambivalent about your dog.

702
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This is a stepping stone and practicing responsibility to be a fucking dad like how I know you want to be.

703
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I agree.

704
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's a fun aesthetic thing that is like the platonic ideal is you're a human who eats bread and has a dog.

705
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And it's just great.

706
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
How are you so heinous, Munchy?

707
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
How are your values so...

708
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm the only sentimental person left on this podcast and the only person who cares about the good things in life which are on the way out.

709
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Munchy, we were having a talk before this episode and I want to now grill you.

710
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's time to get deep into it.

711
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Okay, this isn't...

712
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay, we've all talked about how we hate college and we'd only do it if necessary.

713
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You're like currently working on going to college right now.

714
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I feel like it's been a big, weird elephant in the room and I just want to know why.

715
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Like what is your plan to justify the cost of going to college?

716
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well, my plan to justify the cost is first of all that my mother's been saving up all of her life for me to go to college.

717
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So it won't be...

718
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You could use that money on anything else, but okay, go on.

719
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay, well, she doesn't want to and she wants to use it on me.

720
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And the reason I want to go to college is for a lot of reasons.

721
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
First of all, obviously, I like art and I want to continue doing art and I want to do art for the rest of my life.

722
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Do that for free or perhaps for profit as you do now.

723
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Can you let me finish any statement whatsoever?

724
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay, I want to get better at art and I want to be taught by a trained professional who has been in the art industry for any amount of time and who I trust their opinion on.

725
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I have been trying, or not trying, but I have been learning things online.

726
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I've been self teaching myself my entire life, but I don't feel like that is a sustainable thing to do.

727
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
As it is hard to self teach yourself.

728
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It is not easy to find the right tutorials and to try and mix and match all these different YouTube videos and try and create a through line.

729
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And all YouTube videos are just a standardized formula for the masses.

730
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I want to be able to have a teacher that is able to respond to me personally and is able to give me accurate and in-depth information and good education.

731
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In order to further my art career in ways that I can't fully predict.

732
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:13,000
There are going to be ways that the teacher could teach me things that I wouldn't think to look up, that I wouldn't know that I am missing, that I wouldn't know that I need to know in order to be a good artist.

733
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So I want to do it for purely academic reasons.

734
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I want to do it so that I can be a better artist and I genuinely believe that I think being in a college or any school type scenario, but I am past high school now and my high school didn't have an art program.

735
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But any sort of classical training and sort of classical teacher helping me in any sort of tutors or something like that.

736
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I think that will be extremely beneficial to me as I think I learn better that way and I'm more proactive in learning anyway.

737
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And that's the academic reason.

738
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Social reason.

739
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's so weird to hear Munchie talk seriously.

740
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What?

741
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's so weird to hear you talk like seriously just in a calm voice.

742
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not bad, it's just weird.

743
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I want to hear the rest.

744
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The second reason is the sort of social reason.

745
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I have been cooped up in my room for a long time.

746
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I have been cooped up in my room doing internet stuff for a long time.

747
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And as such, I have let my life run me by completely and utterly.

748
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:33,000
My friends who I cherish with all my heart, my offline friends who honestly I like way more than a lot of my offline friends.

749
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I have not seen them in so long because I've been so single-mindedly dedicated to achieving internet e-fame.

750
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What does this have to do with college though?

751
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't get the connection there.

752
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm getting to that.

753
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Hold on.

754
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They have gone and now they're in college and I can't see them anymore.

755
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
All of my social interaction is nil.

756
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And if there's one thing that I think you can't knock college for in any way is that it's a positive social experience right down to the fact that you are living with someone who you don't know.

757
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Aside from all of the classmates you will meet, especially in art college where everyone will be of a similar mind to you.

758
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Everyone will be of a similar predisposition to be an artist, to be creative.

759
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Aside from all of that and how you're going to be able to network with other people, young, up-and-coming artists, artists of my age, people who I relate to more than random people on the internet.

760
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
People who I will be able to maybe even collaborate with or resonate with.

761
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Aside from that, the fact that I just simply will be in a room with another person and I will be able to maybe not fully agree with this person and everything.

762
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Maybe I will have differences with this person.

763
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Maybe I'll be able to have arguments and people have-

764
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I mean, you can just get a roommate.

765
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What?

766
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You talking about just a dorm mate?

767
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah.

768
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's weird.

769
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's kind of a weird thing to be excited about.

770
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You can just get a roommate.

771
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Living with someone else is not special.

772
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

773
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That's what I'm doing is I'm getting a roommate.

774
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I would say that's a terrible reason right there.

775
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Throw that one right out.

776
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't want to hear it.

777
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Well, I just said other social reasons as well.

778
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm saying that this is an emblematic thing that I will have to interact with more people in my life and that's what I want to do.

779
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The only question behind all of this is, is this worth the debt that will be accrued or the monetary expense?

780
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Because I feel like a lot of this can be done for less money than a college education.

781
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I've already done the entire financial system.

782
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Obviously, I'm not going into this blind.

783
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I have been on the podcast and I've said that I don't think that college is cool.

784
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I understand the financial risk.

785
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I've calculated it at all.

786
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I know how long it will take to pay it off.

787
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And I know how much money I'll be going in, like you'll be able to pay like down.

788
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I know the risks.

789
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And I think that the positives outweigh the negatives.

790
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And everyone in my family is supportive of me.

791
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
My mom is more than happy to help pay because she's wanted me to go to college all of her life.

792
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I think that the financial risks, while they are risks, I think they are worth it in the end.

793
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I want to be able to get an industry job.

794
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I want to be able to be an illustrator out in the industry, creating, I don't know, the future lays in store for me.

795
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But to something to the effect of maybe working at Disney.

796
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Maybe that's a pipe dream, but I would like to be able to do it.

797
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I like Disney.

798
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think it's a great company.

799
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I would like to be there.

800
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I would like to be able to work on logos freelance.

801
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I would like to be able to do industry stuff like that.

802
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm not saying that I would abandon the internet or anything, but I think...

803
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I don't care if you do.

804
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm just wondering about that.

805
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I think having this outlet is a good idea economically.

806
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think it's a good, or having the diploma that is, you know, with our colleges.

807
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There's obviously risks and balance, and you know, it's going to be a large investment upfront.

808
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I think ultimately it will pay off.

809
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And even if it was like, you know, like I can't use the art degree for the things that I wanted to,

810
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and it would have been fine if I didn't have it.

811
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I still think that the positive social experiences...

812
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
There's one other thing that I didn't get to mention, by the way.

813
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's that I will be able to live in Boston far, far sooner than I would be otherwise.

814
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And I love the city of Boston.

815
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's my favorite city on earth.

816
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I've been traveling a lot recently to really great places.

817
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I've been fortunate enough to travel to very old cities like Rome and see the sights.

818
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But nothing has captured my attention more than Boston.

819
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Boston is everything that I like about cities and everything that I want in cities.

820
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I want to be able to be there as soon as possible.

821
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Then just move there and pay rent. Just do that.

822
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I have no idea when I would be able to do that.

823
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I have no idea when I would be able to do that in any sort of reasonable timeframe.

824
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Of course, guys, I know that there are other ways to achieve what I want.

825
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But don't you understand that these are all of these things in one package?

826
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
These are all of these things in one thing.

827
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
All it is, this all strikes me as these are the reasons that the millennial generation went to college

828
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and the vast majority of them regret it immensely.

829
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And so I'm just wondering, what's the difference here?

830
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Alright, I'll jump in here.

831
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
By the way, you owe me nothing and don't have to defend anything to me.

832
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I went to uni for similar reasons.

833
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I wanted to know what it was I wanted to do.

834
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And I thought animation might be something that I was interested in.

835
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But I came away with a degree that I think is kind of pointless for me

836
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
because nobody is going to care about whether or not I have a degree.

837
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They just want to see my animation and how good it is.

838
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So art degrees, they're just like a formality really.

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But the teaching I learned, the things I learned that were important

840
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and very much so, the social aspect, the fact that I was living alone for the first time

841
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
made me grow a lot as a person.

842
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
In many ways, I would have just stayed like a weird baby if I stayed at home.

843
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Some of my friends, or one of my friends, he commuted every day to uni.

844
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And now he looks like the guy at the end of Aunt Boley.

845
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, he stayed with his parents and commuted to uni.

846
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And the rest of us in the friend group were living in the town.

847
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And by the end of the three years, it was quite obvious that we had become more mature and he hadn't.

848
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And we just sort of stopped talking to him.

849
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And it was kind of brutal, but it really crystallized for me how important it was that I was doing this.

850
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Even though it's a lot of money and I'll probably never pay it off.

851
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
See, that's the important part for me right there, at the end there.

852
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I don't know how it works in Britain, but you can't shake that.

853
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't have to start paying it back immediately.

854
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I only start paying it back once I reach a certain income threshold.

855
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So I'm more okay than someone in America.

856
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So I don't know exactly how it works over there.

857
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But from what I understand, as soon as you stop, you have to start paying back interest or something.

858
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I think a lot of the reason why...

859
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm going to use Tom as a sort of case example here.

860
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Tom, please listen to this episode and correct me if I'm wrong or anything.

861
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But if you recall, he talked about this on the PCP before, that his father just said,

862
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Don't think about the debt. Don't think about it. Everyone has debt.

863
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There's no reason to do it. Just go to art college because it will be a good opportunity.

864
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And I feel like the distinction here is that I'm not in the dark about any of the faults of college.

865
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And I've accurately prepared for them.

866
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I have all of my finances in order.

867
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm not going to be able to pay literally 100% of it off immediately,

868
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
like my first time that I get a debt notice.

869
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But I have calculated the amount of time that it will take.

870
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And it's not a big deal. It's like 10 years. It's not a huge deal.

871
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
How is that not a big deal?

872
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm sorry, but how is that not a big deal?

873
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
A lot of the time, it's like 30 years or something.

874
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I understand that 10 years sounds like a long time. It's a decade.

875
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But in the grand scheme of things, if I'm going to be able to get these four years of the experiences,

876
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
which I think I'm in tail for, 10 years does not sound like a bad deal.

877
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So you mean 10 years after you're done, right?

878
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah.

879
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So you'll be 32 when that's done?

880
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

881
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And then whole time, you'll be paying...

882
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay, all right.

883
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, I mean, if you think it's worth it...

884
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm not your fucking dad. I'm not trying to dissuade you.

885
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm simply trying to... We've all recognized it.

886
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We have talked a lot of shit about college here.

887
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And it would be weird to not bring it up when Bunchie is going to college soon.

888
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't know.

889
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I mean, you say that that's not a big deal, but suddenly it's like, oh my god.

890
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:55,000
What exactly are you spending 10 years in debt for to move to Boston and have a roommate?

891
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And to further my career?

892
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You can do that for like $500 a month.

893
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You could split a room with someone in Boston.

894
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,000
To further my career, to have academic credentials, to become more proficient in art,

895
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
to do the things that I love in the city that I love,

896
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and be able to meet new people and network and have more opportunities in my life.

897
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's what I'm paying for people.

898
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
See, those reasons make perfect sense. They make perfect sense.

899
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But, you know, people have regretted it.

900
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, there is no but.

901
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm not trying to tell you not to.

902
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,000
When it comes to art specifically, it is kind of important to have somebody over your shoulder

903
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
like if you have a specific question to have somebody who can give you a specific answer.

904
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Because everyone on the internet has a different idea of how you're supposed to get good at some sort of art

905
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and you'll never really understand how to improve fast enough.

906
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There is no answer.

907
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There is no answer.

908
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
There is no right way to do it.

909
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I know that, but there are some fundamental things that just increase your ability to do whatever you want more and quicker.

910
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Me, right? I went to college, but my professors did not teach me anything that I could not have read in a book, you know?

911
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Did you go to an art college?

912
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Yeah, I had the books, I had the textbooks, and the professors told me the same stuff.

913
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I thought you got a calculus degree or something. I thought you got like a physics degree.

914
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah, you didn't go to art college. You went to liberal arts.

915
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I have some experience with college as well.

916
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
First year college, something, art and design, I think.

917
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And all they taught us was like the color theory and some other basic stuff that I already knew.

918
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So it was a little underwhelming.

919
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't feel like I learned anything in that year, but I might have learned something in following the year.

920
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The thing is with, I mean, it's not good that they do this, but they have to do it, because they have a wide amount of skills.

921
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The point of the first year is to get everybody on the same page so that they teach all the basics to people who don't know.

922
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
For those who don't know, let's go over this.

923
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So expensive.

924
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I know, but like...

925
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:33,000
The thing is though, I'm pretty sure I was put in the slightly above average course of art and design, because they were like levels, I think.

926
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So I was put in the advanced ones. You think we know color theory by that point?

927
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Well, okay. I mean, I agree with Mage. Here's where I come from.

928
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I totally accept the value of an art education. Absolutely.

929
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I went to college. It was a STEM, and it worked out well financially. It's not like a passion project or anything, but it worked out well.

930
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So yeah, college totally makes sense.

931
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But I contrast the two realities in my mind.

932
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Okay, there's one reality where one goes to art school, works on it, and then applies for a job later, has to deal with debt for an amount of time.

933
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Okay, fair enough, and they'll have more credentials, maybe they'll have significantly more skills who knows.

934
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:20,000
There's another path in my mind of where the same person, I don't know, gets like some meaningless job, but they're earning money as opposed to losing money.

935
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So okay, that's cool. What about the art?

936
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Well, what if this person in their off time, which is exactly how my YouTube career has been, has been like offline, they like work on a webcomic for four years.

937
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And in four years, that's a pretty good amount of time to develop something cool, or maybe not even one thing, but like lots of stuff.

938
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Like they invest their creative energies independently, and they work in that way.

939
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So they're not taking on any debt. And in four years, you can probably make some pretty good stuff.

940
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And I totally accept that you won't get the kind of professor one-on-one exchange thing there, but comparing those two futures, I don't know.

941
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think that's the ideal situation, in the sense that I don't think that that can apply to not just me, but like the general public.

942
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:22,000
A person who just tries to draw a lot, while obviously practice is the best way to practice, you still are not going to be able to get the same sort of success

943
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
or the same sort of understanding that you would have if you teach yourself.

944
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You could teach yourself on the internet, or you could teach yourself with a professor and you pay for it.

945
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I mean, if you've seen like a lot of certain DeviantArt accounts, where they just draw the same thing over and over,

946
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
they are drawing a lot of stuff, but they are not getting better at drawing.

947
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They are getting better at drawing the one thing that they think they know how to draw.

948
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's important to get advice from lots of different people.

949
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And one of the more direct and powerful...

950
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I mean, it depends on the college, obviously.

951
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I had a good college and it had a good track record, and the lecturers and the people there were really cool

952
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and well connected to important people, like the new people from Aardman and stuff.

953
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It depends on the professors, but it is invaluable if you want that.

954
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's worth the debt.

955
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Will you be saying that in five years, though, when it's still there, looming?

956
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's the horror show. That's the true Halloween spook.

957
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The horror of debt is what I live and feel.

958
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm out of it, man. Thank God.

959
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But only because I was in the STEM field that pays really well.

960
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I want to ask, because I don't really know how the debt works in America.

961
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
How did it work for you? What did it do that made your life bad?

962
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Well, it is a financial burden for some out of time.

963
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
In America, I believe the way it works when you take a federal student loan is...

964
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
If you want to, you can call them up and be like,

965
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
hey guys, can't pay, please just delay me paying entirely.

966
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You get three years of that total that you can split up.

967
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
If you lose a job, you get another job.

968
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
After that point, you do have to pay it, and if you don't, I don't know what happens, but something bad.

969
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But when you are paying, they work with you and they budget, I think, based on your income,

970
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
how much you're going to pay.

971
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But you are continually racking up interest, so you might not even touch the premium or the base or whatever.

972
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's going to take a long time. The less you earn, the less you're paying into it, the longer it's going to stretch out.

973
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Possibly, probably not forever, but I don't know, a really long time.

974
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So there is an expectation that you will start paying after some amount of time.

975
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't think it matters if you make literally zero money.

976
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
There's a time when the time runs out and you have to start paying in some amount that they decide with you.

977
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I've refinanced a bunch when I still had the debt and I'm no hero.

978
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Why don't I hear anything?

979
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I don't know.

980
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
How are you responding if you can't hear this?

981
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Headphones issues? He's probably just talking to himself.

982
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, it's funny.

983
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Well, whatever. That was the point. You do have to pay eventually, even if you don't earn enough.

984
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't know what happens if you just literally can't.

985
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I know that they'll garnish your wages or something, they'll directly just take the money after a while if you get any job.

986
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So that's the basic gist, I think.

987
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't know why that is like...

988
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I mean, maybe they can, but they can't just take all of your money so that you just starve to death.

989
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I mean, I don't know.

990
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Presumably, that's the worst case scenario.

991
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,000
If you get some shitty minimum wage job and your degree counts for nothing, as is the case for a lot of people.

992
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Does the money just keep getting drained and then they get beaten by the police and then they die in the streets?

993
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Does that actually happen? Or is that just what they scare you with?

994
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Maybe to some people. Here's the actual thing to be scared of.

995
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
This is the actual thing to scare you on this Halloween night, ladies and gentlemen.

996
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It is pretty scary.

997
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It is pretty scary, but more realistic is it's years later, whatever, you've got your debt, you have a job.

998
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The real terror is that you're not able to get the job you want.

999
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And so you're forced to take some other job doing, you know, like so many baristas working at Starbucks, paying off their thing.

1000
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Well, will people turn you away if you have debt?

1001
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Sorry, what?

1002
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
No.

1003
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Will a job turn you away if you have student loan debt?

1004
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
No, I mean, they don't care if you have debt or not, they'll employ you.

1005
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But like, what's scary is just that your education didn't really give you like a guarantee of a job.

1006
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And then you aren't able to get the great job that you want.

1007
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yeah, but this is alright.

1008
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And so you have to take a shittier one.

1009
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, but this is different.

1010
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That's not the problem with having debt.

1011
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The problem with having debt is that your credit will be bad and you won't be able to get a loan.

1012
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm painting a picture. There's that.

1013
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And then on top of that, you aren't able to live a great life because your wages are getting garnished

1014
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
because you have to pay off a certain amount of your debt so that your total take-home income is like pennies.

1015
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And you have to live in a shitty place.

1016
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You can't have the kind of life you want.

1017
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Your wages are getting garnished.

1018
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Your wages are getting garnished, but that's just you paying what you were supposed to be paying in the first place, right?

1019
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
In this case, yeah, that's what I'm framing it as.

1020
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
For your debt.

1021
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But they will literally garnish your wages after a certain amount of time though and just take it off the top.

1022
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The reason I bring up all of this is because I just want the best future for you much because I care about you and I like you.

1023
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Thank you. I appreciate it, Nate.

1024
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And that's why I bring all this up.

1025
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm not mad. Obviously, I'm defending myself.

1026
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm kind of challenging your life decisions, which I understand is a sensitive kind of topic here.

1027
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, I mean, it's fine. I just haven't heard anything that's made me change my mind, you know?

1028
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Do you fear being naive because I fear that all the time about myself?

1029
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Sure, sure. I fear that maybe I won't be able to get an industry job.

1030
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And I don't think that will be the case, but I'm prepared and sure that will suck.

1031
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But I feel like there's a distinction here that, wow, things might not go my way when I'm out of school.

1032
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And, you know, sure, I will have debt and that's not good.

1033
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And you don't need to have debt. That's not a natural part of life. It's bad.

1034
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1035
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I might not be able to get an industry job.

1036
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
But the lessons that I will learn in college can't be taken away from me.

1037
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I can't ever lose the academic or the skills that I learned there.

1038
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I won't be, no one will be able to take away the social interactions that I have.

1039
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
No one will be able to take away the experiences that I accrue.

1040
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And no one will be able to take away the friends that I meet.

1041
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
That's technically true of anything, though.

1042
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah, when you're gathered around the fire in the dumpster with the other homeless people

1043
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
scraping the last bean out of the can, no one can take that experience away from you guys.

1044
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah, that's yours forever.

1045
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I mean, yes. That's not an experience I would want.

1046
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So these are experiences that I want.

1047
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, it's technically true that I can have fun without college.

1048
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Do you see my reasoning?

1049
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's not even about having fun.

1050
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
It's about any experience you have is something that can never be taken away from you.

1051
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay, I wasn't speaking literally.

1052
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I don't think they can reach to my brain and take my memories.

1053
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Okay, well, here's a more relevant example.

1054
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
What don't you have as college days?

1055
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You don't have to just resign like, okay, Munchy, you know, you're making a bad choice, but don't do it.

1056
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
No, I'm not resigning. I'm just saying, we've been talking about this for like how many, 20 minutes, 25 minutes.

1057
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
This is an interesting goddamn topic in my humble opinion.

1058
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Well, you're not going to change Munchy's mind.

1059
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Well, I don't want to phrase it like that.

1060
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I mean, I can listen to reason.

1061
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Mage, debates, if this even counts as a debate, are an attempt to convince the audience.

1062
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
No, we just got to let the baby have his bottle, Mage.

1063
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It just, okay, last thing I'll say is it just reminds me of, especially that last stuff you were saying,

1064
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
on Kanye's album, I think it's late registration.

1065
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
There's a bunch of skits, or it might be college dropout or whatever, where he's just like,

1066
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
my dad got so many degrees.

1067
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Well, me and mom were starving in the street.

1068
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
My Christ, he had so many fucking degrees, and he kept going back for more degrees,

1069
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and he loved those degrees.

1070
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And when I have his degrees now, and I'm going to pass those degrees on to my children,

1071
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and when they had burned them from worth, we're going to think, wow, our dad was so educated.

1072
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It was so great.

1073
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
All right, that's a joke, but that's a hyperbolic example of the story here.

1074
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Am I okay?

1075
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
America's fucking scary.

1076
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I agree.

1077
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I don't really know how that relates to me, in a way.

1078
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Because you were talking about how the inherent worth of the degree, which I would argue is objectively false.

1079
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I think the value comes within the four years that I'm in college.

1080
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I think that's where the true worth of it will lie.

1081
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I think the only value in a college education is what it gives you afterward.

1082
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That is my humble opinion.

1083
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah, the skills increased faster than they would have otherwise been increased.

1084
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
For the cost of a huge amount of debt, or maybe a little if you go to like community college.

1085
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I mean, I don't know.

1086
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Oh, lay an egg.

1087
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That's important, goddamn it.

1088
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's important, Nate.

1089
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I don't disagree with you at all.

1090
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I don't know if you guys are trading, Nate.

1091
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Like, he's just being a big old scrooge over here.

1092
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I know.

1093
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
He's sensible, but it's just like, clearly, Munchie is going to get more out of college than most,

1094
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
because he very much wants that.

1095
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Why do you assume that?

1096
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Why do you assume that?

1097
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
To get a lot out of it.

1098
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah, why do you assume that?

1099
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Well, compared to people I've seen in college who just go because their parents told them

1100
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
to, and they don't really know what they're doing, they rack up debt, they go to college,

1101
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and they don't really try very hard because they think of it as just school, and then

1102
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
they leave college with big debt, and they're like, oh no, I don't have any skills because

1103
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
they didn't try very hard.

1104
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Munchie clearly wants to do this.

1105
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So, he's going to get a lot of skill, art skills out of this, regardless of whether he gets

1106
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
like a job in the industry or not.

1107
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
He can apply that to like anything he wants to do.

1108
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I think that that drive that is like, yeah, he will do good in school and get a lot out

1109
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
of it because of his attitude.

1110
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I think that attitude would serve him well in any, like whatever path he chose, right?

1111
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I don't understand...

1112
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It would serve him...

1113
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1114
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I can finish.

1115
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm sorry.

1116
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It would serve him just as well if he decided not to go to college and just work on his own

1117
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:12,000
stuff, like that attitude would still be there, and that's what it's about, right?

1118
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It's about your fucking attitude more so than whether you go to college or not.

1119
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
In my humble opinion...

1120
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Sure.

1121
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You guys don't have to walk on eggshells as much.

1122
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm not going to get mad.

1123
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I mean, I fully expect in your minds thinking that I'm retarded, like I don't...

1124
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Like it's obvious, but...

1125
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
All I care about is that it's worth the investment.

1126
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That's the only thing I care about at the end of the day.

1127
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I don't claim to have...

1128
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't claim to know the right answer for everyone, but I wouldn't do it.

1129
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Hold on.

1130
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Hold on.

1131
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Hold on.

1132
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000

Hold on.

Hold on.

1138
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Hold on.

1139
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Hold on.

Hold on.

Hold on.

1142

Hold on.

1151
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Hold on.

1152
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Hold on.

1153
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Hold on.

1154
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Hold on.

1155
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Hold on.

Hold on.

1160
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Hold on.

1161
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Hold on.

1162
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Hold on.

1163
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Hold on.

1164
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Hold on.

1165
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Hold on.

1166
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Hold on.

1167

Hold on.

1168
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Hold on.

1169
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Hold on.

1170
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Hold on.

1171
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Hold on.

1172
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Hold on.

1173
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Hold on.

1174
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Hold on.

1175
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Hold on.

1176
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Hold on.

1177
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000

Hold on.

1238
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,080
paying the money like I'm just doing the work I was doing it's also worth it to

1239
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:42,680
mention that I have a man on the inside and I'm not oh shit I'm not going into

1240
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,960
this line not only have I researched extensively the college I'm planning to

1241
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,840
apply for and I vetted it with all my little toes and hands with my

1242
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,600
grippy little hands but also uh Kazi goes there now and everything she tells

1243
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:05,560
me is good and it sounds great all the hard homework all of the fucking like

1244
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,440
like weird out there stuff that they teach you would normally think to do it

1245
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,360
all sounds like you know good stuff like stuff that I want to learn learn

1246
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,480
stuff that I want to be able to know that you can't find like a YouTube how-to

1247
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,200
to do so what you tell me munchie is you're going there for a girl all right

1248
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,560
throw it in the trash wasting time there goes the money everybody I'm Ben wait

1249
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:32,440
before I'm sorry Nate Nate do you think that actually literally no okay

1250
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,640
you know what it probably is part of the equation well okay I'll try like this

1251
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,840
Kazi being in Boston is one of the reasons I want to be in Boston but not

1252
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,560
one of the reasons I want to go to college I'll phrase it like that okay also

1253
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,120
by the way one of the reason I want to go to college is so that I can fucking

1254
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:53,720
form PCPHQ more by the way that's one of the reasons I value your financial

1255
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,320
future more than the formation of PCPHQ at least where you are concerned yeah so

1256
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,440
yeah everything I say stands it would sure be convenient for me to encourage

1257
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,160
you and to go into massive debt so that you'd be around to work with me and yet

1258
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:13,640
I don't so I appreciate me I don't have I'm glad that you've been willing to

1259
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,980
challenge me in such a way well good I'm the dad just to be hard but fair to

1260
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,800
lay the truth's on the line as I see them maybe I'm wrong in fact I appreciate

1261
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,200
research and you looked into things and you know what the curriculum is that's

1262
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,960
very encourage I mean I'm obviously like not as aware of like the the money

1263
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,440
ramifications because for me the debt is not really an issue yet and it won't be

1264
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,040
a big issue ever yeah well no no no no I can just say Britain adults pass on to

1265
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,920
their children at their debt is it sure nice no I'm kidding I assume low I can

1266
01:00:48,920 --> 01:01:00,920
just I could just you know just throw it in the trash you also just like throw

1267
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,120
taxes in the trash if I recall correctly there's like ladies debts that you have

1268
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,920
to pay and just don't do this you weren't thinking of Jesse with that sounds

1269
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,040
like a Jesse thing I'm sure Jesse as well I'm sure Jesse as well when what

1270
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,120
there's some sort of payment that we were that you were talking about unlike I

1271
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,880
think it was a shekels for heckles that like you just don't pay some money thing

1272
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,240
I forget what it is damn sounds like what a great like a ticket what a promised

1273
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:30,440
land like a what a ticket or something Nate you remember right yeah give there

1274
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:35,160
was something you were talking about some fee to be like on some like housing

1275
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,240
thing that you had to pay but you hadn't been paying oh well no I didn't had to

1276
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,960
pay it was the government that mixed up the forms and they said I had to pay and

1277
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,560
I was really mad it was it was it was it was council tax yeah that sounds right

1278
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,840
but I didn't have to pay council tax because I was a student living in the

1279
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,160
house but the they they mixed they mixed it up like something went wrong and I

1280
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,560
thought I wasn't a student and then angry letters and I threw them in the trash

1281
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,000
and then they sent me a court summons and I threw that in the trash and they

1282
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,400
never did anything and that all worked out because they can't they don't have

1283
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,760
the money to look for me right and I'm long gone I'm fucking long I'm out of

1284
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,960
there okay what I'm about to say is not to de-legitimize this conversation

1285
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,680
because this conversation has been fruitful and productive but I will say

1286
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:31,200
that like I have been in the PCP for a while now I've listened to the school

1287
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,440
sucks podcast I really want to emphasize that I'm not going into this blind or

1288
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,640
with way crazy expectations of what I will accomplish I'm talking a lot about

1289
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,800
experiences and and industry jobs and stuff like that but I realize that the

1290
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:52,560
future is not as smooth as I would like to think about it and I realize that

1291
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,960
there will be trials and tribulations both in school and out but I am taking

1292
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,960
what I believe to be an educated decision maybe not the best decision but an

1293
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,720
educated decision nonetheless and I have weighed the pros and cons more than I

1294
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,800
feel my contemporary ill cap not you guys but I mean like you know like

1295
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,920
like millennials at large I feel like I have done more research and am more

1296
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:27,280
confident in that this is a sustainable idea more so than might be normal and I

1297
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,600
not trying to say that guys like I know what I'm doing don't talk to me that's

1298
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,280
not what I mean I just mean to remind everyone that there might it's

1299
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,320
specifically in the comments there might be some offshoot that was talked about

1300
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:48,160
in school sucks that we haven't addressed but I know I know feel free to

1301
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,400
comment but like I know I know I always said that college is definitely right

1302
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,440
for some people and that could certainly be the case here so you know yeah not I

1303
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:04,960
mean I'm definitely not gonna sit here and say don't do it cuz I like I I went

1304
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,000
to college and never used my degree and I'm still in debt over it and I don't

1305
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,280
even really care that much I don't even necessarily think it was bad because it

1306
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,480
was just like some good years of my life and I like the person that I ended up

1307
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,720
being so I guess it all worked out I don't know

1308
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:28,480
yeah my gripes was the first year I had in college it was a pretty good year I

1309
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,520
met one of my bestest friends ever there and it was it was funny it was a fun

1310
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,640
year yeah see this is why I was supportive of what when she came to me

1311
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,280
and told me he was doing it and like he seemed very serious about it like

1312
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,560
clearly like there is gonna be good that comes of it even if like the debt is

1313
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:51,320
one thing obviously there's gonna be that to deal with but like everyone who has

1314
01:04:51,360 --> 01:05:00,800
debt seems to be okay this whole distance break I think it's gonna be a

1315
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,240
bad I know I said I won't be that long of time relatively but that doesn't mean

1316
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:10,000
that it won't be that that it is like fine I totally accept that I am more

1317
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,280
financially kind of concerned than your average person my age I'm not gonna say

1318
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,440
that I'm great it's just I do worry about it a lot and care about it a lot

1319
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,800
being having my future secure financially so you know fair enough fair

1320
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:29,200
enough I get it but I'm not when I fucking leave my job and go full-time

1321
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,800
YouTube which is all I think about and you know okay okay this is sort of

1322
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:42,440
tangentially related Nate why do you want to become a youtuber like because

1323
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,480
it is the most rewarding experience I've ever had that's why it's scary and I

1324
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,840
completely agree because when I when I go to work it's fine when I come home and

1325
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:58,680
work on my projects I feel alive and I love it okay I mean I mean I mean I yeah

1326
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,680
I mean and this is in no way me saying don't become a youtuber or that's

1327
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,160
negative whatsoever feel free to challenge it you know it just sounds like

1328
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,960
like YouTube is just constantly getting fucked so I just I really all I want to

1329
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,640
know is what's the experience like like how do you feel as someone who has a

1330
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,960
sustainable job that wants to enter at not an unsustainable job but a

1331
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,720
fluctuating job does that concern you has that entered your thoughts at all

1332
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,160
absolutely there's a major difference with me versus other people which is me

1333
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,840
I'm coming into this thing like my whole last couple years has been paying off my

1334
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,520
debt building up my financial reserves so then I can make an honest to goodness

1335
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,040
serious long-term attempt to make it on YouTube and if that fails have a

1336
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,160
contingency to go back which is that that is what I've been building towards so

1337
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,360
right I don't think the risks are very high for me at all and like YouTube might

1338
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:59,080
it I might not even fail it just will turn out that YouTube is not as look at it

1339
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,440
not as fun anymore you know yeah or not as fun in which case I will be you know

1340
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,160
prepared I have a degree in a in a in a good field I've had a job I've got a

1341
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,520
resume of work that I can fall back on and use and and find another job if

1342
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,600
necessary and like my YouTube career has been honestly going fine with it as a

1343
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,720
part-time job and I could continue to do that it's just that I know I would be so

1344
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,040
much more like productive and you know and successful like even if I don't even

1345
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,640
if I fail like to make it big time as a YouTuber like I could do better than I'm

1346
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,720
doing right now because all my time is you know taken up by you know normal job

1347
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:42,400
so like do I worry about YouTube in general failing absolutely I do think

1348
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,480
that I am more willing to adapt and change like like for example all this

1349
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,840
copyright shit's going on right now I'm gonna I will I will adapt to what's

1350
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:58,280
necessary we Agua itself was a big adaptation to try to figure out how to

1351
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,640
survive on YouTube doing we Agua consistently was by far the most

1352
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,800
lucrative period for my channel so I know what to do and that's what I would do

1353
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,440
instantly when I go full-time doing it like maybe YouTube will just find my

1354
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,560
content objectionable and fail and you know I'll have to like stop doing it

1355
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,680
entirely because everything will close down except for like Jimmy Kimmel and

1356
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,920
shit it's possible it's possible and at that point I will I will just always like

1357
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,040
if I if I go full-time YouTube I'm just gonna always try to make sure after I've

1358
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,080
got this idea of like I'll do it for a year if it's going well I'll keep doing

1359
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:36,480
it after that point I will switch plans to make sure I have enough money that if

1360
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,920
things go belly-up I can survive long enough to you know switch out and get

1361
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,880
back to a normal job and survive on that and then I'll you know that that's what

1362
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:50,520
I'll do let me ask you this would you consider yourself to be that you want

1363
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,040
to be a YouTube creator or like an internet creator would you be fine

1364
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,760
moving to different platforms or is this platform specifically something that

1365
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:04,680
you are invested in you want to become a video content creator on YouTube I have

1366
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,040
found the most joy specifically making video content and so I would like to

1367
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,760
stay in that that medium it's kind of my field of expertise but I feel no

1368
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,920
particular allegiance to YouTube itself it's just that YouTube does create a

1369
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,560
specific kind of ecosystem that you know like my kind of content does fairly

1370
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,000
well on and I hope to you know expand and keep trying it so I wouldn't say I'm

1371
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,640
inherently like I like if Vimeo took over I wouldn't really care I just keep

1372
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,440
doing what I'm doing and just hope that you know people are still able to find

1373
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,280
my shit and I can spread it around so you know hopefully that answers the

1374
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,520
question yeah okay and this really is a scary episode I'm thinking of my future

1375
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:50,440
now yeah what a dude what am I doing it's like I got a cool like I got a cool

1376
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:55,480

1433
01:14:54,360 --> 01:15:00,440
London yeah this is where James Cromwell pissed his pants I just want to

1434
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:11,360
lick it right up yeah well that's all very good episode no now on to onto the

1435
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:21,080
topic at hand Halloween yeah yeah I have I have some scary joke from last time

1436
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:25,400
where I breathe we briefly had a little spat a little fight about like Jack

1437
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:32,040
O'Lanterns shaved or cut right right I've solidified my my problems with

1438
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,840
shaved Jack O'Lanterns good okay they are they are technically impressive but

1439
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,600
more often than not they are just a copy of a photograph or a piece of other

1440
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,840
yeah draw that's true that's true that's strike one strike two is that they're so

1441
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,080
often not Halloween themed like if it was a spooky skull etched into a pumpkin

1442
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,280
then it'll be like oh cool you know Halloween themed it's a spooky scary

1443
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,920
month you put spooky scary things on pumpkins pumpkins themselves are not

1444
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:08,520
spooky if you draw a tiger on they are festive the pumpkin aspect I suppose the

1445
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,600
pumpkin is like a timely of the year but like it's not spooky you got to make it

1446
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,920
spooky that's the whole point is like the tree during Christmas but you have

1447
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,680
to decorate it's it's it's a bunch of pumpkins on your Christmas tree it's

1448
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:27,720
gonna be like what the fog like like if you like shave like a photograph of a

1449
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:33,380
tiger or like a legend of Zelda image skyward sword or whatever the fucking

1450
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:41,600
breath the wild yeah but like oh I'm a epic gamer you put that dude on a pumpkin

1451
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,800
the equivalent is to like decorate your Christmas tree with like legend of Zelda

1452
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:56,960
gamer Mario I hate that though it makes me sad dude that'd be so fucking or even

1453
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:04,240
funnier just to have a tiger themed Christmas just have to brief aside

1454
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:10,920
brief aside when I worked at Astor Camp there was a slightly older guy working

1455
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,680
there and that I say slightly older he was like in his 30 he was slightly older

1456
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,840
than me okay and he it like had used to be a teacher whatever but he had changed

1457
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,720
jobs but that's not the point the point is that like you know we we had like a

1458
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,200
pool area there was like a lifeguard zone so you know we there was a locker

1459
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,880
room and we were changing in there one time and he can't behind you and start

1460
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,520
touching things he shouldn't do that's not right and he was like I learned this

1461
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:44,840
in the public school he had he had two tattoos on his back one of them was on

1462
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:50,400
his shoulder blade and it was a small kind of crude profile drawing of a tiger

1463
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:55,800
and the other was like a bigger sort of maybe like maybe six or eight inches it

1464
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,560
was kind of like a big thing of like like it was a like a tiger's face and claw

1465
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,360
like tearing a hole you know what I mean yeah I hate those so stupid those

1466
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,000
are reprehensible yeah he was it was a tiger to and I was like why do you have

1467
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,240
these two tiger tattoos and he was just like I just really like tigers he had

1468
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,280
gotten the smaller one when he was like a teenager and then later on he had like

1469
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,560
treated himself to like the bigger like superior like really cool one or

1470
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:32,400
whatever treated himself wait what he just treated himself like that's like

1471
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,080
his little oh no cake for me tonight I'll just get this big man he was like

1472
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,960
when he turned 30 or something or some milestone he was like you know what it's

1473
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,960
time for me to get a new tiger tattoo to upgrade can you imagine what you're gonna

1474
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,080
get it for what's he gonna get at 40 that's gonna be at 40 he's gonna get a

1475
01:18:50,080 --> 01:19:01,920
tuger which is a two-headed tiger oh god that's anyway what I don't even

1476
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,440
remember what story did I interrupt with that so wait wait wait wait at three

1477
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:11,160
headed tiger would be a trigger that that that that that that that that that that

1478
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:16,000
that that be a trigon yeah I don't know what we were oh I just like the pumpkins

1484
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:48,040
I was talking to a Kazi actually about Halloween and she somewhat convinced me

1485
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:53,320
about Halloween and her argument was pretty good she was like she said it's

1486
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,680
a hot because you know I've said that I don't care for Halloween very much but

1487
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,800
she said like Ben Halloween is a holiday where you don't have to do any like dumb

1488
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,320
family shit it's just about like hanging out with your friends and having it's

1489
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:12,400
just about having fun and nothing else and I was like well that's uh huh what as

1490
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,440
an adult I suppose that's true and I was like you know that's fair that is good

1491
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:22,480
about it and I do like that but it's not the only holiday like that like I would

1492
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,280
say that St. Patrick's Day is pretty much the same like you don't digi likes

1493
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,960
New Year's cuz New Year's is kind of like that yeah I don't really I don't

1494
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,680
really like any of the specific like details that come with Halloween I don't

1495
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:41,360
like spooky shit I don't like horror movies I don't I don't love these the

1496
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,260
Halloween aesthetic it's fine I don't watch the extra I don't hate the

1497
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:48,740
like I don't love it either and watch the exorcist you will you will love it I

1498
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:52,720
think you will love it legitimately it's like not scary and it's all Christ II

1499
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,400
and shit wait really your aesthetic yeah huh it's really good I watched it

1500
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,260
last night and I love okay all right you would enjoy it very much it's like a

1501
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:05,140
horror movie that there's no jump scares it just is occasionally there's creepy

1502
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,860
shit and there is some absolutely disgusting moments but they're good and

1503
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,300
I like them and most importantly is that there's a there's a sensation that this

1504
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:20,300
movie is from the 70s and they throw out like fuck and cunt and in tasteful

1505
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,860
ways that to us are totally tame but to those people it's like the actual words

1506
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:29,820
of the devil and I love that aesthetic it feels great it's awesome it's the one

1507
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:34,180
with the spinning head girl that's the one yeah it sucks cocks and hell yeah

1508
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,740
yeah I should watch The Shining I've never seen The Shining the Shining is my

1509
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:43,860
literal favorite scary movie it is absolutely ball dropping terrifying

1510
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:49,980
wait I'm a zoomer right yeah you are okay as a zoomer as a proud zoomer who is

1511
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:55,860
proud of my heritage I cannot wait for your shitty old people movies to fucking

1512
01:21:55,860 --> 01:22:01,060
die and for creepyposses to take over as the rightful Halloween material the

1513
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:06,900
true creepypasta munchie munchie well when he's old crack open like like a

1514
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:12,740
coconut water like zero yeah whatever he'll sip it gingerly at age 35 and

1515
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:21,500
say crack open Jane activity 10 now there was a movie I can't fucking wait for

1516
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:27,140
like and like a real movie of a creepypasta where a guy buys an n64 game

1517
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:31,340
and there's something wrong with it okay because because nostalgia nostalgia

1518
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:36,140
like plundering dictates that somebody will think that's a good idea Nate the

1519
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:40,340
paranormal activity thing like yeah you what are we on what paranormal

1520
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:43,860
activity or maybe or something okay well how likely do you think it is

1521
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:47,300
because people do this for fast and furious and maybe it's true I don't

1522
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,740
know because I haven't seen them but what if like five or six fat of paranormal

1523
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:56,020
activities from now zoomers on YouTube are making the case like here's the case

1524
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:01,500
for paranormal activity and how after number 10 they became a like metatextual

1525
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,180
commentary on their own John we'll achieve the and achieve the pinnacle of

1526
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:09,420
what hard the horror genre is capable of that will definitely happen I mean

1527
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:13,740
that's not even that unlikely to happen because after a while you're almost more

1528
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:17,300
likely to try something different and like do okay then just do the same thing

1529
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:22,340
over and over by the way there there have been six official ones and there's

1530
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:32,140
one unofficial film called a paranormal activity to Tokyo night one of my

1531
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:39,140
you mean Tokyo night with the K right unfortunately not one of my favorite

1532
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:45,500
experiences of being alive like one of the best times I like like like like

1533
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:50,380
intervals of time that I've ever breathed in my entire life was I went to

1534
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:55,740
see the slender man movie recently in theaters with my friend Kyle my friend

1535
01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:02,220
and as all diehard diehard bobble horn its fans it was so good to see slender

1536
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:07,860
man and just know that life will never be the same and that I shouldn't feel

1537
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,740
myself really upon leaving the theater it was great and okay okay aside from that

1538
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:15,980
and something the legendary experience of slingy scene slender man completely

1539
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:20,220
messed misrepresented and interpreted and literally they just saw the fucking

1540
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:23,580
character designs like I'm gonna make a movie about this aside from all that

1541
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:28,940
for the next fucking like hour and a half it was just one after another it was

1542
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:33,100
us making a joke that there would be a creepy pasta cinema universe and it was

1543
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,060
us coming up with after-credits scenes for different creepy pasta so it's like

1544
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,940
the main characters to drive the slender man movie she would walk into a bar all

1545
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:42,020
wistfully and like there would be no music and she would go over a guy with a

1546
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:48,100
hood over his head and she'd be like I hear you're good at killing and then

1547
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,740
and then he would turn slightly and he would say well I am Jeff the killer and

1548
01:24:53,740 --> 01:25:03,060
then the credits would roll there was a fucking Freddy versus Jason movie so

1549
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:07,420
it's inevitable there's inevitably a fucking slender man versus that black

1550
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:14,900
Pokemon cartridge the girl gets on playing like I'm so glad to be rid of

1551
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,300
slender man I'm so ready to have that chapter my life be over oh time to get

1552
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:25,700
on a vacation hmm that that or like kind of have a vacation goes to Orlando

1553
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:32,020
Florida you know I like Disney World but what's this abandoned river country hmm

1554
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:38,500
I sure hope I don't get abandoned by Disney credits roll

1555
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:46,460
I don't know what that one is actually I watched I watched this as Fuki sort of

1558
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:59,940
liked it at the beginning I really like it gave me sort of a bit of a dangin

1559

1573
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:09,980
it's called s cried and there's no way it has the worst name of any really bad

1574
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:15,460
name it doesn't I like I haven't read the mind I and I thought and I thought the

1575
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:21,260
procrastinators was a bad name for a whole new level a major major

1576
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:28,940

1578
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,380
really love this one looks legitimately good kind of it also has me in it for

1579
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:47,020
those who aren't aware there's a big meme literally means in this anime and I

1580
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:50,860
guess you meant IDOL but I was thinking like idle anime is like an idle game

1581
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,700
like one that you just let run in the background yeah yeah you don't even have

1582
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:57,500
to listen to it or watch they're gonna make the cookie clicker anime that's what

1583
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:06,460
I want you or teal listen or teal license cookie clicker right now oh my god

1584
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:10,540
I'm playing cookie clicker right now I forgot there's a legit are you really is

1585
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:15,180
that true yeah I started up today no reason I had cookie clicker open for a

1586
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:19,660
couple of weeks there like maybe as of a month ago I it was just open on my

1587
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:22,940
desktop for weeks and weeks I had a bunch of add-ons that basically played the

1588
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:26,620
game for me right pretty much the only thing I had to do was the gardening

1589
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:30,580
minigame I've never played that I don't know what the fuck that is yeah it's

1590
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:35,340
it's one of the later additions there is you can you you have well you have to

1591
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:38,940
grow sugar lumps and you spend your sugar lumps to upgrade your farms and

1592
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:42,700
once you spend them on your farms you have plots of dirt and you have to you

1593
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:47,420
have to like find seeds and plant seeds and hope they cross pollinate into new

1594
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:51,740
seeds in order to get more seeds in order to get more sugar lumps in order to

1595
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:55,660
grow more cookies you see because it all comes back to the cookie cookie clicker

1596
01:28:55,660 --> 01:29:00,780
is a great game and it is it is on a on ironically no lean it is a great game and

1597
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:04,860
the lore is honestly pretty damn good I could honestly see some kind of like

1598
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:08,860
lore product being made based off of cookie clicker it is fucking great on the

1599
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:14,940
on the one hand it's like I get it it's a elder tar the grandma's but on the

1600
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:21,580
other hand it's like fucking sick dude like fucking yes I love it yeah I don't

1601
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:25,820
know perhaps a little thin but whatever I still like it I don't know I do love it

1602
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:32,540
it's it's it's it's it's the effort was just the way that he boldly that he boldly

1603
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:39,500
filled his uh his fucking idle his idle clicker game with this this like huge

1604
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:46,940
he vast array of like dumb cliches this like it has this big fucking weird yeah like story

1605
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:53,900
going on it's sort of in the background uh and it just fucking spirals uh I love love cookie

1606
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:59,340

course by who okay I was talking about the other day wait really don't say it don't say who it is

1632
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:32,620
because last time oh yes yep yep yep okay yeah but okay I went back and listened to it again

1633
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:37,340
because something about it creeped me out right I found I found the video I think I know exactly

1634
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:45,100
and I went back and I yeah yeah okay it is halloween I'm spooked the thing okay so ostensibly the

1635
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:49,980
video is about how what she was quote unquote abused or harassed by this guy she tells the story

1636
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:54,940
and it's not what happened like just that is just not the story that she tells even though she claims

1637
01:32:54,940 --> 01:33:01,500
that it is yeah um but there's there's more right because like the setup to the story like what she

1638
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:07,020
says happened is that she got on a call with you know the the the the villain the supposed

1639
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:13,900
villain of the story um and she quote showed off for it right oh no but you go back and you listen

1640
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:22,140
to the context that sets up this and what she says is that she was in a call with with an y pony

1641
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:28,220
right and um it was his birthday it was his birthday yeah it was a birthday call for an y pony

1642
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:31,900
and she says this with like a little giggle she's like tee he you know yeah you know how it is guys

1643
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:38,540
she says we were on a call and me and the girl me and the other girls were giggle showing off yeah

1644
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:44,060
what does that mean okay what kind of a fucking birthday is this so all these bronies get together

1645
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:49,900
and have their girlfriends show their tits to yeah all right they might have done it to to the

1646
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,620
birthday they might all just be sluts that's definitely possible I don't think it's okay I think

1647
01:33:54,620 --> 01:34:00,620
it's probably likely for bronies just to think that that's okay to do it's is that I mean yeah I

1648
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:05,020
I listened to this I listened to this and it was like I was gobsmacked right like I went on a long

1649
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:09,660
walk and like a sad song played like I looked out a window into the rainy night and I just thought

1650
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:15,660
about my life and I was like it was who's who's crazy someone's crazy here and I and I and I think

1651
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:21,820
maybe it's me maybe maybe I'm some kind of weird puritanical weirdo to like hear this story and

1652
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:27,740
be creeped out by it like maybe I need to check my privilege and fucking realize that I live in 2018

1653
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:32,380
and everybody's trans and poly now and there are no and they're and God is dead and there is no

1654
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:37,980
objective morality and nothing is not true and nothing is good no no no no no I was I was jealous

1655
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:44,220
I wanted to be a and wise birthday on my birthday this is why I hate having left the fandom you

1656
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:48,620
guys I could get all that bronies we gotta go back we have to go back there's so many no they're doing

1657
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:52,140
over there finally a good reason to go back there's so many girlfriends in that community and as you

1658
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:56,940
know dating a bronie like the contract of dating one of these bronies that all on on your on your

1659
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:01,420
boyfriend's friend's birthday you gotta fucking you gotta fucking show up you gotta fucking show

1660
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:05,740
up and show out like the piece of meat that you are that's you will you sign the contract your

1661
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:11,900
communism it's pure everyone gets a piece of everyone yeah you introduce yourself into a big

1662
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:16,700
communal marriage of everyone with everyone and I mean I mean yeah yeah effectively like like

1663
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:21,340
if you're dating if you're dating one bronie you're basically dating all yeah which basically means

1664
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:26,540
that that what what this the me too girl did was fine because that was just part of the contract

1665
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:31,980
makes they're all they're all public use I self-identify as a liberal and I would say that

1666
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:39,340
I'm I'm probably liberal on a lot of social things but what I can't ever get my head around

1667
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:44,780
or like appreciate is polyamory and open relationships like I can't do it it's the

1668
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:51,340
one thing where I just am a fuddy duddy about it you know some people I'm sure it like I don't

1669
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:56,060
want to be overly judgmental like I'm sure yeah okay there's some people who tell themselves that

1670
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:00,540
it works when really they don't they'd rather they don't but I'm sure there's probably another

1671
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:06,060
subset of people that like actually are fine yeah I'm sure that it's real it just feel like with

1672
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:12,140
my own personal baggage it feels strange not in an open relationship obviously but you know

1673
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:19,820
having maybe one it feels like what you described Nate is a real thing that is worth looking into

1674
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:23,980
the idea of being an open relationship when you don't want to be in one I think that's

1675
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:28,700
fucking terrifying whoa whoa whoa whoa when you when you don't want to be in one then that's

1676
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:33,580
that's just cheating I'm not some people will they like rationalize to themselves that like I'm

1677
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:38,860
totally okay with this honey that you go and fuck you know down the road yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1678
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:43,660
sure um here okay here's the thing here's the thing and I don't know this might be a hot take

1679
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:51,980
we'll see tell me tell me if this is too hot to handle um I think I think okay I think being I think

1680
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:58,220
being poly or whatever is an umbrella term but within that term there's probably like as many

1681
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:03,260
ways to be poly as there are people that do kind of like kind of like being trans or being like

1682
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:08,460
gender like a gender and like here there's trans people but every individual trans person like

1683
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,700
they're not all this they're not all doing it the same way right like they don't all see they don't

1684
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:17,500
all see it the same way or do it the same way and it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone at the

1685
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:22,380
very least there's the trans movement that like believes in like I was born female in a male body

1686
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:26,540
like I'm switching now I'm like I'm just just and then there's people who are more like fluid so

1687
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:31,900
you know sure sure like the point is just that I think there's like probably a rainbow there's

1688
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:36,700
probably a rainbow of different situations and attitudes that would all be that would all fall

1689
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:41,660
broadly under the head of being in a quote poly relationship you know there's probably people

1690
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:47,580
in there there's probably people in there who just are who just are like who don't feel you know

1691
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:51,420
there's probably people in there for whom it is like a passion that they're like I like this is

1692
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:55,500
what I want to do I want to I want to fuck and my partner wants to fuck and we like to fuck but

1693
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,740
there's probably other people who are like maybe in an unhappy marriage in there but they can't

1694
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:03,180
but they they don't feel they can leave it for whatever reason and so the compromise they have

1695
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:07,420
reached like well let's just say we're poly now and then it's like whatever um you know I mean I

1696
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:12,220
guess that's fair you know and probably there's many others that I I wouldn't I wouldn't like for

1697
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:16,540
example though I wouldn't describe like let's say you got like uh like uh like in house of cards

1698
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:22,460
you had like power politician couple and like they don't get divorced for one of the reasons is

1699
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:26,780
they actually do love each other but they don't get divorced uh because like it'd be bad politically

1700
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:30,940
so like yeah even if those people like let's say they fuck other people I wouldn't call that really

1701
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:36,060
polyamory though you know I guess kind of literally is because okay if they didn't love each other

1702
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:40,700
anymore just kind of a show right well kind of yeah I don't know I don't know I I haven't seen I

1703
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:44,940
haven't seen how's it something that I don't like to talk about for obvious reasons but but I feel

1704
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:52,380
kind of is an important distinction nay I feel very kinship with you I was also a migtau incel

1705
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:57,340
yet you never want to admit that you feel so yeah yeah yeah that way lies madness

1706
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:05,100
yeah I was also like like oh like I had a lot of a tortured history with with small women this

1707
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:11,900
and stuff like that oh and uh and and this is the one thing from that era that I've never been

1708
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:18,220
into shake is that's really weird and I don't and it makes me feel weird just thinking about what

1709
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:24,780
what's the one probably amory no that's not you're not you're not weird for not being down with

1710
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:30,220
with polyamory that's I think that's the vanilla okay okay I know it's the vanilla position but I

1711
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:35,580
am like a cuck so like it would make sense okay I think polyamory is good but like that's the one

1712
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:40,620
thing you're saying it doesn't match your progressive values what does that mean I mean

1713
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:46,940
I mean that I'm like an sjw libtard and it's weird that I'm not down oh I think what you're I mean

1714
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:50,620
you would never stop anyone else it's not that you're not it's not that you're not down with it

1715
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:55,900
it's that you don't want it for yourself yeah yeah yeah you're right I mean I've never stopped anyone

1716
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:00,380
but it just makes me feel uncomfortable when people talk like if a friend of mine okay this is

1717
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:04,620
probably where we agree if a friend of mine came to me and is like hey man like like that's how I

1718
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:09,980
feel whenever there's a black person okay right there you go it's it's like a friend of your

1719
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:14,860
comes I was like hey dude you know hey do you want to talk listen so my girlfriend's been saying that

1720
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:18,780
like she doesn't want to break up with me but like she's polyamorous and I'm like wondering if

1721
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:22,700
like I should do it like maybe I'm polyamorous too dude like what I would tell them to break up right

1722
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:31,980
then yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah 100% uh yeah to all the to all the p the poly fans sorry I guess

1723
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,500
look yeah like it's totally fine if you want to do it I am suspicious that you're fooling yourself

1724
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:42,780
if you come into me yeah tell me that you love it but I think there is probably a lot of that

1725
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:47,580
I'm not I think there's not everyone maybe not everyone but I think that there is a lot of that

1726
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:52,300
is my is my impression people really want to be down you know they want to be down do you think the

1727
01:40:52,300 --> 01:41:03,420
majority of polyamorous relationships are of Caucasians poly want a cracker oh my god I hate you so much

1728
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:12,460
he fucking got me that's like the most stretch for a pun ever you're stretching cock Asian to be the

1729
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:19,100
cock of a parrot and poly to be a parrot I got it got it that's the most stretch of all there was layers

1730
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:25,900
you know hey oh I'm a pirate I'm a pirate skeleton I have a parrot here the whole time this is not

1731
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:31,260
even a point this is not even a point this is just a fact or a feeling or something I don't know

1732
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:36,220
just fuck I'm gonna throw it out there and see if anyone cares there's a thing that I have like

1733
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:43,180
read about or seen talked about the idea like like there's like real poly people right okay and that

1734
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:49,820
like lifestyles or whatever and then there's like this other thing this like light version this like

1735
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:55,020
this like dipping your toe into it and like thinking like tee he I'm I'm progressive or I'm different

1736
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:59,660
like I'm I'm poly now sure and it's and like the real poly people hate it and it's the like

1737
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:05,020
the girl right like a couple like a guy and a girl couple like getting a getting the quote

1738
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:11,180
unquote unicorn to be their third or whatever and this is like this is like okay specifically I'm

1739
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:17,980
thinking there's a there's a hello not not not uh what's that fucking comic with the comic uh

1740
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:24,300
ojoy sex toy there's an ojoy there's a guest ojoy sex toy that is about like like here's my experience

1741
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:30,060
with polyamory I fucking was best friends with these two people who dated each other and then I

1742
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:35,420
dated them both two and we had sex with each other and blue sure and it's like and now I'm poly

1743
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:40,620
and everything is great and I love my life and people and the response to this was like you are

1744
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:46,860
just you are just a unicorn this is like this is like some fake trans shit you've been like coerced

1745
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:51,740
into a threesome by like these two people like they've this is like this is bullshit this is

1746
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:56,700
this is the bullshit version of our lifestyle this is like yeah yeah yeah this is this is just

1747
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:04,780
some garbage that's so weird that's like bizarre and I don't understand the distinction I think I

1748
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:10,700
think what it is is that I think in this situation I think this is a pretty common like a relatively

1749
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:15,100
common way to be you know poly or whatever this is a relatively common way to do it but it's like

1750
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:20,460
I think that the power balance is off I think the power balance is that there is two like this person

1751
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:26,060
is writing like now I'm now I'm you know I'm I've found my two soulmates you know I'm in love with

1752
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:32,060
my two best friends haha and and they're in love with each other but like but really there's the

1753
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:37,660
couple and the other one and she's like even if she likes to tell herself other I think I think

1754
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:41,660
that generally the way the way that the reason this is looked at as negative and this is not

1755
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:46,460
seen as great is that the way this usually plays out is that there is the couple and the other and

1756
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:50,620
this person might see herself as a part of this but really she's the other one okay and she's

1757
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:55,100
and she's less that's kind of a compassionate thing like they kind of want this person to not

1758
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:59,660
like trick themselves don't get her heartbroken or whatever like this is this is kind of maybe

1759
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:05,580
subtly manipulative or emotionally abusive and or deceptive or something you know I don't know

1760
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:10,940
people don't like that hard the hardcore lifers they read they read a story like this and they roll

1761
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:16,380
their eyes and they go oh another fucking unicorn who gives a shit that's how I feel about people

1762
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:21,180
who say they're gay wait no uh not me just kidding uh sorry we gotta move on quick

1763
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:28,380
oh we suck guys dick oh yeah real gay just what a fucking what a poser you call that gay come on

1764
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:32,300
let me show you kid this guy doesn't know about being about the hard gay you know

is about that mage mage what do you think oh yeah okay weigh in it exists I I don't care to think

happy okay well good first voicemail is from from from african afy this guy is this guy I know

1776
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:55,500
and he actually had his channel deleted with like 75 000 subs recently for uh well he so he made these

1777
01:45:55,500 --> 01:46:02,940
meme videos about um there was an elf there was like an elf character who was named stated to be 14

1778
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:11,260
years old afy what what his name was afy oh yeah afy or afykun it's anime for you I think it's his

1779
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:17,580
channel something like that so he got his channel like instantly removed zero strikes just gone uh

1780
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:22,060
after really releasing this video about an elf character and the point of the video is that the

1781
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:28,220
character is stated to be 14 but then he he humorously looks up how like elf years to human

1782
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:33,900
years and she's actually like 140 or something and then he has a bunch of crabs dance and it's

1783
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:40,620
funny that is the joke also she has huge tits and they're portrayed prominently in the anime so you

1784
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:46,700
know whatever okay um uh uh he eventually got his channel back just congrats afy glad to hear it good

1799
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:32,140
like he was using the the neon genesis a vangillian opening theme yeah like if we get content id for

1800
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,020
that we're gonna have to mute him and then and then we get our channel then and it's a virus it's

1801
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:41,660
it's an infection that spreads that is definitely possible you might be muted you might be muted

1802
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:45,100
guy yeah we might have to mute you if that gets fucked up uh we'll see what we can do we'll see

1803
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:51,180
what we can do um all right well good uh we gave him his thing all right next up another regular

1804
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:57,180
one spar let's see what one spar has for us today the boy go he's not wolf hey pcp it's me and

1805
01:48:57,180 --> 01:49:02,620
got no gimmick this time just a basic hypothetical question for you which temporary video game do

1806
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:08,700
you think could benefit most from a pcp themed mod pack like uh one good one that i can think of

1807
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:13,100
would be a grand theft auto five story mod where you replace the three main characters with munchie

1808
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:18,460
digi and nate and then you know you can have like some uh some podcast voice clips thrown in their

1809
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:23,580
forum for comedic effect i think that would be great uh we'll be some other good ones uh you guys

1810
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:33,260
do the work for me undertale uh uh uh uh we talked about imagine imagine undertale bonus bosses

1811
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:38,220
like like bonus like like we're like someone makes us okay okay i was thinking about this

1812
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:42,620
extensively earlier i don't know why ben and this is real this is true i was imagining you

1813
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:47,420
was an undertale boss but it wouldn't be like you were drawn it would be like it's an fmv video

1814
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:52,300
of you just like maximum black and photoshop and would just be a voice clip of you like pointing

1815
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:56,220
the camera and saying stop that over and over again when you got hit and for some reason i thought

1816
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:59,900
about this like for like 30 minutes i was just thinking about like yeah like how can i program this

1817
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:08,700
like a little fmv like like um threshold like black and white only yeah and there would be and

1818
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:12,460
since you couldn't get a perfect like wall in the background there would be a little bit of pixels

1819
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:16,300
that wouldn't be able to render right and so it would be like there's like an oar of white around

1820
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:22,460
yeah we should build that in minecraft as well uh minecraft it's not it's not a very new game at

1821
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:26,860
this point but uh what about binding of isaac what if we there was a patch for binding of isaac

1822
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:32,140
we're like with each of us and we can talk about that yeah yeah yeah pcs we gotta get we gotta get

1823
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:39,100
forward and back home i want i want a mod of smash a nate would be cat and falcon i would be getting

1824
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:46,300
a door sure uh then would be like some like like projectile character i don't know who though

1825
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:55,500
greninja i don't know pit i hope so i hope i'd be greninja um i don't know hippo would be like

1826
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:02,140
villager yeah he would be he would be rosalina and the luma would be ah oh that's a good one

1827
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:07,020
that's a good one uh i'll be floating around for some reason we see who else have we got

1828
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:13,340
that i can't think of any other characters yeah that's about i think that's about it for the roster

1829
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:19,020
mutu uh once you would be mutu i'd play mutu i love mutu he would just be blasting psychic

1830
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:24,140
energies i would be constantly transferring myself over nowhere again i could i could be

1831
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:30,220
be annetta am i am i on the right game yeah yeah it's not me annetta's in there now okay she

1832
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:38,780
has glasses i have glasses and that's all right oh yeah is there any other with glasses i don't

1833
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:44,540
think there is i can't think of any uh yeah no i don't know only one representation for glasses

1834
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:48,620
that's very discriminatory how embarrassing there might be more i can't more more i would just

1835
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:52,700
wait wait i would just be pokemon trainer and i would just be oh wait wait do they is that even

1836
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:58,540
a thing anymore uh yes yeah it's it is i would just be pokemon trainer and you could just change

1837
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:02,620
my sprite in the background and everything else would be exactly the same yeah that's

1838
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:09,580
all the pokemon have like lace chokers and like emo goth stuff on yeah i like christ tattoos

1839

1841
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:31,980
activated like a sx oh my god yes oh my god make me a sacks and hail boss that would be

1842
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:35,740
the best thing to ever happen in the ground you fucking nigga is the thing you say over and over

1843
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:39,180
again yeah sacks and hail sacks and hail is a game mode where it's like one person is super

1844
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:42,540
overpowered and you have to in the entire team has to take them down and really hard because you can

1845
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:48,220
get one shot activated christ people have like made mods for like pinky pie being yeah yeah

1846
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:54,300
running around oh dude people have made so many fucking models for like the pyro to have huge tits

1848
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:07,100
of this nine classes nine pcp members do the math who's who i think one oh isn't our ninth

1849
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:14,700
wait no that you're right yeah you're right um um question uh i'm sniper how many i'm a sniper

1850
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:19,020
how many dragons are there in skyrim have you seen the randy set or the uh the macho man

1851

1852
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:31,020

01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:35,740
give me different dragons the dragons being thomas the tank engine and then they just fly around

1854
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:39,900
but but i don't i don't know if there are i don't know how many dragons are in skyrim i'm assuming

1855
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:46,940
more than nine probably yeah the very first dragon mod of skyrim i saw was a giant fluttershot

1856
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:51,340

01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:52,460
up there is no rap i will be forced i will absolutely have to make an account called at the

1866
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:59,740
real munchy enlist as a killer and vaguely insult rowdy's hypocrite i can't do anything

1867
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:07,580
unrelated to rfck but when munchies credibility is destroyed like this you're gonna be

1868
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:11,660
missing out on those sweet sweet chibi baka add dollars you know you're right

1877
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:17,900
and make it really fast okay uh just speed it up chipmunk style there it is

1878
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:25,500
i'll it lasts like three seconds it was long enough all right here we go next one's from help

1879
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:32,540
help we're sending in a message all right where's your brother kelp i have this friend

1880
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:42,220
she's basically the definition of a pcp fan she's bi she watches anime she draws uh and knows about

1881
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:51,500
internet shit but introduce me the only thing that's not right is that she doesn't work in pcp

1882
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:59,500
how do i convince her to watch the pcp this is a good question well okay okay did she not like the

1883
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:05,340
pcp she does not know about it he says that she doesn't watch we also like an i okay and there

1884
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:10,540
there are people who draw in the pcp really relate really yeah yeah this is actually a pretty good

1885
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:15,980
question because there might be people out there who love us and love our stuff and want to introduce

1886
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:20,140
us to other people but don't know how i feel like this might be fairly common i agree like a fairly

1887
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:25,420
common problem uh okay just throwing this out there let me know what you think i mean i think you

1888
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:31,180
should the way to introduce the pcp would probably be through one of the not one of the other things

1889
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:37,260
one of us have done right like show them like i don't know show them like uh fucking you know

1890
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:42,860
best uh best anime ever take a good top of gurnlog and if that's their jam or if that's their jam

1891
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:47,180
or show them you know the ben's ben ben's ain't nuzlocke conquest if that's if that's what they're

1892
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:52,780
into or you know or or punk or something or just or like the ghibli curse that's quite yeah yeah yeah

1893
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:57,740
or the ghibli cast you know or maybe some of the radcon stuff any of the lectures the point of

1894
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:02,620
the entry oh yeah the lecture they need an entry point the p the pcp is not an entry point the pcp

1895
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:08,140
is the end point the pcp is the end of all things once you're you want you you've only you only

1896
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:13,180
arrive here once you've circled the drain and finally been pulled down he's right uh so you

1897
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:18,060
have to start the process you have to get that penny wobbling as it spins on that uh you know

1898
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:21,900
tourist thing where you put a penny in and it goes around the circle many many times you got to get

1899
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:27,340
that penny put in there before it goes down there so find some some video yeah don't think about like

1900
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:30,940

1910
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:24,380
on the inside that was made of the cheapest garbage wood they can find and then badly

1911
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:28,380
stapled together and i mean that is literally as possible that shelving unit against your wall

1912
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:32,620
right now it's made of particle board which if you didn't know is literally just sawdust and glue

1913
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:37,900
i literally have a particle board so here you say well look at the underside it's particle board

1914
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:43,020
with a wood textured sticker on it it's all fake and flimsy and way too expensive a few

1915
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:46,460
episodes back you were talking about wanting to make stuff with your hands well i'm a real crafty

1916
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:51,500
boy and i made two six foot tall bookcases for my games a set of shelves for my consoles and a

1917
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:55,980
little end table and it was all for 15 bucks i'm a rat 35 dollars if you include the cost of the

1918
01:59:55,980 --> 02:00:00,780
tools which are reusable and all of it was solid wood and sturdy as fuck and will last for a century

1919
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:05,260
minimum because it's fucking immortal it's probably true if you any of you procrastinators out there

1920
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:10,060
and only the procrastinators fuck the rest of you want to learn to be crafty like me hit me up on

twitter i'm fast talking megastar an indestructible super god tar buck transom spelling is in the

1922
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:23,740
title i like him too i'm i'm really i like this guy yeah wait no was that an ad uh did we

1923
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:28,540
kind of we just use as a vessel for advertising no no no i don't think it was an ad it was that

1924
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:33,580
just just for us he did just simply say he doesn't want to hear from anyone except us

1925
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:40,780
okay acceptable it could be deceptive but yeah i don't know i trust this man with my life i have

1926
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:47,820
i literally have a piece of shit particle board shelf right over here um my shit is on it it is

1927
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:52,780
not it does not have a wood panel sticker on it is painted white interesting thing about it i'm

1928
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:58,700
looking at it and there is appears to be a whiteout or some kind of like like cover up paint

1929
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:03,020
painted over but if i look at it at the right angle in the right light i can kind of see what

1930
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:12,140
this whiteout is covering and it seems to say it says i love came possible a lot blade or blade

1931
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:20,300
or blame i love some i love lake so much with a heart i'm glad that was painted over that's

1932
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:26,540
quite a it was painted over with something but the the the remnants are still there fascinating

1933
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:31,980
it's a metaphor for life uh well that's cool i hope those two have a happy future together

1934
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:36,140
doubt it otherwise it would have been would have been one to wish them a happy wedding

1942
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:25,740
we got we we got like six more let's let's burn through them all right here we go here's mission

1943
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:33,660
response let's get to it boom you know what annoys me people who talk about ketosis but they also

1944
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:39,740
don't work out and they don't actually take care of nutrients in the body yeah these these people

1945
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:45,980
are just using the whole ketosis meme as just an excuse for not buying food because they're poor

1946
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:51,820
also this goes out to mr bones i think you got the wrong podcast the best debate in the universe

1947
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:57,260
is to block down i forget what that end part is about the best debate in the universe oh yeah

1948
02:02:57,260 --> 02:03:01,340
bone said something to him last time i think i think he's a bitch or something i don't remember

1949
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:05,820
i don't remember mr bones his message i'm sure it was wonderful

1950
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:11,740
the time is spreading amongst the people you know is a fucking hope that ketosis is

1951
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:16,860
a kind of a meme it is kind of a meme yeah yeah okay well great i should i should work i should

1952
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:21,100
work out more but that's a separate issue that's a separate that's a separate

1953
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:26,140
failing of mine i like his idea that people people just say they're in ketosis when really they're

1954
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:31,180
just too lazy to buy food that's their real problem you know food is more expensive because

1955
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:36,220
i'm on keto i spend more on food because i buy like brazil nuts and like meat and poison yourself

1956
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:40,700
i can't just i can't get by on ramen whatever yeah well fair enough all right next one here we go

1957
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:44,620
tazzle spur tazzle spur go

1958
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:55,740
mirror mirror on the wall who is the gayest one of all i'm terribly sorry my lord but you're not

1959
02:03:55,740 --> 02:04:06,540
on top there is still one guy who's holding that spot the true king a mighty foe no one says gay

1960
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,380
as digi bro

1961
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:23,260
i don't know i don't know if digi's the gayest i mean he says i'm gay more so that that is what

1962
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:30,300
makes it no i don't agree i think this magic mirrors aim is off i would say that uh i would say it's

1963
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,500
i would say it's uh tom

1964
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:40,460
means he is gay he is actually over gay he is currently digi adjacent so yeah yeah

1965
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:44,220
okay next one next one next one next one next one next one next one next one next one next one next one

1967
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:54,140
know i don't know we'll we'll see what this is about i hope it's the real tom oliver being the first

1968
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:59,500
result on google images when you search for worst guy ever is tom grasping at straws and some kind of

1969
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:04,140
astroturfing campaign to get as much attention as he's human he can without looking like a

1970
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:12,380
fucking idiot what the fuck was that it's like auto tuned roba why did he auto tune this random

1971
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:17,820
to the to the point where we couldn't understand him yeah well he was just saying that like tom's

1972
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:23,260
like he he is like editing google search results so that he is the top result on worst guy ever

1973
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:29,740
as some sort of campaign for attention or something um why would anyone do that uh

1974
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:35,500
he is a bizarre coincidence he must not believe that it's genuine i i guess that's what he's saying

1975
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:41,340
i guess that's what he says he's he's he's this is a conspiracy theory worst guy ever it's the

1976
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:47,660
funny that comes up tom that is bizarre um okay let's let's get to our next one small world small

1987
02:06:56,060 --> 02:07:02,140
huge fan and i just wanted to point out that ben saint is the personification of the doomer meme

1988
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:09,100
he is the meme made flesh discuss just i said discussed for a second i've discussed that

1989
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:15,900
ben said just discussed as well um kind of uh what's a doomer what's what is i wasn't on that

1990
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:22,940
episode okay what specifically is a doomer a doomer is uh a type of millennial who is nihilistic

1991
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:29,020
kind of given up on life uh just like smoke cigarettes and doesn't place much value in his

1992
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:34,140
life or plan for his future and is just kind of content to watch the world burn basically and

1993
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:40,620
just hates everything well i mean can you be a happy doomer i'm kind of like that but like i'm

1994
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:44,620
i'm fine with it i'm not i'm not bummed out about any of it that's the thing you don't actually fit

1995
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:49,580
the profile of a doomer in attitude because you don't like beat the world that much all of those

1996
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:56,220
behaviors right i do all of those behaviors right so my attitude is not is not doom it's a yeah a

1997
02:07:56,220 --> 02:08:03,260
doomlet bed's kind of a doomlet that's i'm do i'm doomer lights yeah i'm doomer adjacent i mean

1998
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:08,380
yeah you're no one would say that you're a bloomer or anything like me uh uh you know for various

1999
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:12,060
reasons because you're not are you wait what's a bloomer again uh one who wants to secure a future

2000
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:19,820
for the white race oh yeah that yeah i'm not that cool like an like an optimistic uh like

2001
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:25,100
kind of that it's kind of that uh like positive negative uh thing about like nothing means anything

2002
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:31,900
the the bloomers that nothing means anything i can decide my own my own destiny yeah exactly

2003
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:36,940
just somebody i feel like i feel like i embody all the behaviors of a doomer but my attitude is

2004
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:43,660
more like a bloomer yeah i am i'm a more pretty positive person i think and i i share a lot of

2005
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:48,940
the doomer conclusions about i don't i i sure i don't believe in like an objective it's almost as

2006
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:55,580
if labels are stupid yeah it's almost it's almost as if people can't be like broadly slotted into

2007
02:08:55,580 --> 02:09:02,220
white categories like haha oh all right well all right all right no sorry there's one more from

02:09:45,580 --> 02:09:48,860
saying before that you don't have a soul you you jumped the gun then because i think what

2015
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:54,060
just happened is he separated the soul from your body during that call the lord of ghosts

2016
02:09:54,060 --> 02:10:01,980
and that was your soul crying out which is now separate from you uh that's my yeah how tedious
