00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hello everyone and welcome to Your Nightmare. It's The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,840
best guy ever. And today we're joined by Ben and Tom. Hey. We're just one person. We're

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,080
one weird amalgamation of internet hobo. We did the fusion dance before the show. Hey guys.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,800
It's happening. I'm here. Bombsoliver. And I got a lot of personal problems. I got a

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,160
lot of emotional weight. I'm going to need you guys to shoulder for me, right? I'm going

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,440
to need you guys to do a lot of the emotional lifting for me, if you know what I'm saying.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
That emotional lifting can most efficiently be done. I can't really support myself, you

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,080
know what I'm saying. I agree. I can't really, kind of a burden on others, you know, is what

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm going to be. That's what I strive for. You need an emotional spotter, so to speak.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Yeah. Kind of an emotional vampire. Yeah, yeah. If you wear a burden most of your life, you

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,120
probably have huge thighs. They're very muscular and able to do so. Or is it like the opposite,

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,200
where they're just worn down over time? You start with a certain amount of hit points,

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,720
and they just get ground down over time. It's not a load like the load of iron that one

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:21,400
might lift to become strong. It's more of a load of like extra DNA in your bloodstream

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:29,360
that might make your blood cells spherical or some weird shit, right? Do you think that

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
people with Down syndrome weigh more than people with that, because they have the extra

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,120
chromosome in all their DNA? I don't know. You mean the weight of the chromosome itself?

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,360
Well, like every cell in their fucking body, he's going to have tons of DNA strands. They

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,440
must. Is this the least logical thing ever said? I don't think so. Here's my counter

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,280
argument. What do you think is the weight of chromosomal matter as compared to average

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,760
material of a human body? Do you think that a chromosome is more or less dense than the

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,960
rest of a human body on average? I'm going to bet that it's more. Well, if a chromosome

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,000
is like one one hundredth of a cell's weight, and we're all made up of cells, and all our

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,160
cells are made up of trillions of cells, we're getting like 1% heavier, right? No, I'm saying

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,720
though, it's not about, I don't think the chromosome adds overall weight. I think the

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,960
chromosome must add proportional weight, right? I think you're going to, it's like buoyancy

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,400
problem. You got to find the chromosome's density, you know, and then find the additional

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:37,000
or subtraction as opposed to a comparable volume of otherwise presumably average human

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,480
matter. Well, okay, you're talking about buoyancy and whatnot, and that makes sense. What if

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,280
we could do it in a vacuum and just, okay, maybe just mass based on total mass is the

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,720
average mass of an individual with Down syndrome more than someone without. I would guess it's

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,840
more for all of the things being equal. That's the same question, that's the exact same question.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,880
Maybe I just don't understand. Ben has a physics degree, we can't even argue about this. That's

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,600
true. That's too powerful for us. It's not a biology degree though, maybe that's a factor.

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm trying to be right. He's doing physics calculations right now. I'm trying to be

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,880
right about this. The problem though is that I cannot find, I cannot find how dense is a

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,720
chromosome. Google's not helping me. Yeah, well, it's like, it's, there's no article on Wikipedia,

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,200
so I just, I'll never know the answer, I guess. Well, let's see, a chromosome, massive a chromosome.

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh, okay, the average human chromosome contains about one times 10, 108, I'm going to assume

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:43,840
that's one times 10 to the eighth BP of DNA. If each base pair has a mass of about 660 Dalton,

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:52,320
Dalton's, and there are about two G of protein plus histones plus non-histones per gram of DNA,

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,920
how much is a chromosome way? What's the end, don't ask me the question, I want the answer. Oh my

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,520
god, this is like a fucking quiz I have to take. They're still, they're still working on this. We're

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,800
still trying to hammer out this answer even now. What the fuck is a Dalton? I've never heard of

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,680
a Dalton before, although that is that guy from Chrono Trigger who steals the, the bird, the

46
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,440
Silbird from you? I'm shocked, isn't Dalton like a guy from One Piece, I thought you would say? That's

47
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,480
also a guy in One Piece who turns into an ox, yes. He's the guy from, from Cherry, not Cherry Island.

48
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,000
Chromosomes, Dalton's, all the Dalton's change into things or steal things. It was Drum Island,

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
now renamed the Sakura Kingdom. Actually, you know what, it probably still is Drum Island that

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,520
just houses the Sakura Kingdom that was previously the Waffle Kingdom. So I wasn't completely off base.

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah, he's the guy, he's the, the cool guy, he's the, the cool warrior man. Yeah, he's all right.

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
He became king. Down syndrome is cool, confirmed by fiction. Hey, Monarchy,

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,560
yay or nay, as an institution. Dude, the Diviner and the Kings do. I'm leading a hard yay right now.

54
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,960
Like the, the absolute consolidation of power, dude. Yeah, pretty good.

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,440
Dab, dab on. Cool, look, I'm the king, not cool if I'm not the king. What if you were the one with

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
the power though, Ben? What if it was you who was king? Then I would. Yay or nay? Dab on it.

57
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,280
I'm gonna dab on that throne, boys, for all to see. And the sword is just a simulation of the

58
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,880
divine right of kings, for Ben and Munchy. Hey, you know, if you go to patreon.com

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,720
slash PCP Minecraft and you join the Minecraft server, you can walk your hot little feet on

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,880
south and take a right towards Dabbington. And you can see what I would imagine would be

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,640
Ben St. Throne Room, which is those, those dabbing statues leading up to someone's house. I forget

62
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,920
whose house that is, but it is a real place in a fictional world that is the PCP Minecraft server.

63
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,120
More like, more like. The Minecraft server is more real than real life.

64
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,040
I prefer to spend my time in the PCP Minecraft server as opposed to real life.

65
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,920
Oh, that's right. We're not gonna do it again for the holidays.

66
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,960
Like, I don't want to do more. I want to do more Minecraft. Guys, did you know Minecraft is a video

67
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,160
game that's enjoyed by millions? No. That doesn't sound right to me. I can't be true.

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,320
How long have, how, people have been being entertained by this software for years and

69
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:14,080
nobody told me? That's why I wasn't I invited. It just happened that way. Hey,

70
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,440
speaking of, of tedium of life dragging you down bit by bit towards the shallow grave that's

71
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,960
inevitable for us all, I had a tragic experience this week in multiple ways as you will hear now,

72
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,480
which was just so I had purchased. Actually, okay, I won't start the story there. I will

73
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,720
circle back to reveal this information that will now be a secret until we get there in the narrative,

74
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
which is, so I'm taking Sessho out for a walk, right? He seemed maybe a little sluggish,

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
maybe a little sleepy that day. I don't know what was going on, but he seemed fine. So I take him

76
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,520
out all of a sudden. This can't end well. He's projectile shitting, like you wouldn't believe,

77
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,040
like a steady stream of liquid shit out his ass. He's like propelling himself on the ice with

78
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,720
the rocket. Basically, basically, yes. It was with the force of a thousand suns. It was an

79
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,920
incredible sight to behold. And it was something I'm imagining like a I'm just I'm just imagining

80
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,360
that that starts happening. You grab the leash to stop him. But of course, you're on the ice as

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,680
well. You're all behind the laws of physics. You end up going like down a hill really fast,

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:33,600
you know, propelled by dog shit. It was a Christmas miracle. So that's happening, whatever. He took a

83
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,600
horrible, nasty liquid shit. I got over that. And then I went inside and I was I was wondering,

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,120
I was like, Michelle, Sessho just took like the weirdest shit I've never seen before. What is

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,000
happening here? We didn't know he seemed generally fine besides that. Anyway, like the day goes on

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,320
and then all of a sudden I realized, guys, I had bought my parents for Christmas, a lovely box of

87
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,840
chocolates, just the nicest little box of chocolates from Godiva. It was wonderful. I just suddenly

88
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,960
noticed under the chair, there is a ripped up piece of this box. And I'm thinking about how did this

89
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,920
get what so up with this? And in case you guys don't know, chocolate is lethal to dogs. This is

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,080
when I'm this is what's reported. They're like, I've been in the past, such as like gotten little

91
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,400
bits of chocolate. And I've rushed to like is my dog dead.com for like the chocolate.

92
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,080
The answer is always resounding. Yes. It's always yes. Thank God I didn't buy the dark

93
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,080
chocolates or he'd be dead where he stands today was milk chocolate, I guess, probably.

94
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Anyway, obviously Sessho had he this is insane. We had it in a bag on top of a table there. I

95
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,560
guess there was a chair kind of nearby. He must have done some crazy parkour shit to get up there.

96
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,280
But he pulled out like the box of chocolates he ripped it open. He ate every single chocolate

97
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,400
that were individually wrapped in the box except for one that I guess his fat little body couldn't

98
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:58,240
reach. And I mean, this this this is the reason why the shit was weird. So we deduced this he was a

99
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,600
terrible person. Hopefully he regrets it. But then he's just shitting in the worst possible ways

100
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480
all over the place. And there's like a room that he goes to shit in if we don't walk him fast enough.

101
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,840
And you know, sometimes that happens, whatever, we try to walk as best we can. And then I walk in

102
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,720
and there's like half on like the pad, we put down these puppy pads, whatever they'll piss his

103
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
shit on so he doesn't do it on the rug. It's like half on half off. There's just a spray of liquid

104
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:31,280
shit all over the fucking rug and this pad. It's just a true nightmare. The point of the story is

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
he ate all the chocolate. It was a it was a Christmas gift for my mother. Sessho ate it

106
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,560
callously. He shit everywhere. He almost killed himself. He would have been dead. And now he's

107
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,400
currently in gay baby jail where we have put him, which is to say he's in like the the shelter,

108
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,360
not the fucking shelter. He's in fucking daycare until we come get him after after we get back

109
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
from visiting the folks. And I have to go replace the fucking chocolates with something else for my

110
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,080
asshole mother. This is why you don't let your dog you made it clear to him that he is being

111
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,520
punished. His abandonment is a punishment. Yes, I think I think that's very clear. He definitely

112
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,440
knows very clear. Yeah. And one other factor here is just that I so so as everyone knows,

113
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
we've been trying to work to lose Sessho. Wait, he he succeeded. He I mean, he weighed like 28

114
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,120
pounds. His goal is like 25. He reached 25. And the last measurement he was like 24 and a half or

115
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
something. So like he's doing great. He's at his target weight, whatever. But I think that because

116
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,840
we've been feeding him so little, I think it's actually draw driven him into the kind of a

117
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,760
Garfield-esque diet week madness where he's just been he's been particularly energetic. He's been

118
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,400
freaking out when we give him food. Dude, maybe he's got maybe he's got keto energy. Maybe he's

119
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,160
achieved clarity, mental clarity. That's probably it. That's what he's accessing energy centers that

120
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,080
he didn't know he had, I think. And so he's been like, for example, we had a pumpkin. It was just

121
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,280
a pumpkin that we had on the shelf, you know, since Christmas, it was doing fine. And it was in range

122
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,120
of him for months. And only now, only yesterday, did he decide it was time to rip into that pumpkin

123
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,760
and eat the precious seeds and gunk inside. So I think based on these conclusions, I think that

124
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,240
we are it's time to up his food a little bit. So he'll stop being a monster. But still fuck you,

125
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,040
Sessho, for eating those expensive chocolates, your piece of shit. So there you go. I hate my dog.

126
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll end his life. And that's it. This story would be not a problem for me at all. If he just

127
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,240
hadn't shit on the carpet. That's the one thing I can't forgive. Because we yes, we have like this

128
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,640
liquid cleaner thing that you put stuff into to try to clean. I cannot get all the shit out of

129
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
that carpet. I just can't do it. It's soaked in there. It'll never be clean again.

130
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,280
Good job, Sessho. You did it. Yeah. Yeah. That's why you don't let your dog play near his edge.

131
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,480
Those are clearly transferable skills. And he got the parkour abilities. And now he's just all over

132
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,600
the place. You gave him energy and you gave him the means. You fool. It was a mistake. It was a

133
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,640
mistake. So there's your Sessho update for the week, everybody. He's the worst. And he's paying

134
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,160
for it. Fascinating. More proof that pets are a mistake. Never get them.

135
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,680
He's a burden. I guess I had a fucking wacky adventure this week. Yeah.

136
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,640
It probably will suck, but whatever. What else are you listeners fucking doing besides listening

137
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,800
to my stupid ass bullshit? I'm already at the bottom of the podcast barrel. I might as well just go full.

138
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,800
So I had a date with a girl. Wow, incredible. It was weird. Unforgivable.

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,560
All right. So this is... I'm getting on the bus, right? I'm getting on the bus to go hang out

140
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:01,520
with Munchy, Kazzy, Kazzy's friend Dusty, and Munchy's friend Leif, who's in town for the week.

141
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,200
Right? This is the setup. And I'm on the bus and it's cold outside, but when it's cold, they fucking

142
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,800
blat... Okay, time for a tangent, guys. I get so fucking mad in the winter because they blast

143
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,400
the heat on public transit. So I will get on the bus and I will immediately start sweating, right?

144
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,120
I will... And like, I'm the only one. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with these other freaks.

145
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,840
Like, I get on the bus. It's like 80 fucking degrees on this bus. I'm sitting here in my full

146
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,480
coat. I have to take all of it off. I have to strip down on my fucking t-shirt and I'm still

147
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,120
too hot and I'm still sweating and everyone else is on the bus and they're fucking, like,

148
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,800
woolen hats and, like, gloves and, like, full-on winter regalia. And I don't understand. I don't

149
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,560
understand what the fuck is wrong with them, okay? It's the uniform of the time. They can't take it

150
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,480
off. It's, well, why aren't they fucking sweating bullets? Like, I am and would definitely be...

151
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,960
They're not. I'm looking at their faces and they're not glistening. I'm glistening. I'm

152
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,080
fucking perspiring. I'm stopping. Anyway... I know what you're talking about, though. It sucks.

153
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,520
Such is my situation today. On that day, rather, I get on the bus, I sit down,

154
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,840
I start sweating and this girl on the bus is like, hey, hold out a fucking napkin at me.

155
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,320
It's like, hey, and I'm like, oh, god, is it that obvious? And she's like, yeah. And I'm like,

156
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,760
all right, cool. So I fucking mop my sweatbrow. And I don't know. At least how you talk about, like,

157
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,040
oh, yeah, where do you live? You live around here? Yeah, cool, cool, cool. And so I get off at Harvard

158
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,880
Square and she's like, the bus takes us a little too far. We both kind of miss where we're going.

159
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,960
We're like, okay, let's walk back to the station. So we walk back to the station, talk about shit.

160
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,760
She's like, okay, hey, what's your number? And I'm like, nice, epic, dab. So we exchange numbers,

161
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,480
right? So I go and I meet up with the guy. I meet up with the boys, right? We go, we're walking

162
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,800
around Boston, we're having a great time. I forget what we did. Oh, yeah, we got Chinese food.

163
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,360
Doesn't matter. Dumplings. So I like, I checked my phone, and this girl called me,

164
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
and she left me a message, and she's like, hey, do you want to hang out right now? And I'm like,

165
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
we had concluded our business. We were just kind of fucking around. I think we were going to go

166
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,400
back to Kaz's apartment and just fuck around some more. But I get this call and I'm like,

167
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,000
uh, should I go? And everyone's like, oh, Ben, you should go. Oh, you should.

168
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,160
True love only happens once in a lifetime, Ben. Yes, it's a once in a lifetime chance.

169
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,800
Like, oh, if you miss this, you'll always wonder, you'll always wonder what could have been. And

170
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm like, oh, God, whatever. All right, fuck, fucking fine. Goodbye. So I leave. And I go,

171
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,920
and she's little did Ben know they just wanted him to leave. I think so. I always suspected.

172
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,600
But now it's confirmed. And she's saying she's at the Starbucks. It takes me forever. I'm on the

173
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,480
train and they tell and we get an announcement of the train. It's like, um, sorry, everyone,

174
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,440
some lovely customer decided to run onto the tracks. So we're going to have to resolve that

175
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,400
situation before we move the train again. So I'm like, I'm like half an hour late. And I'm like, well,

176
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,640
oh, well, but she's still there. She moved next door. Anyway, so anyway, she's a fucking,

177
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,720
she's a fucking crazy person, right? Because the moral of the story is she's fucking

178
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,840
crazy person, probably some straight and this is not an insult, probably some strain of autism,

179
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,880
like a certain, a certain, a certain disregard and an unawareness of like human social convention

180
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,720
definitely shown through. Surely that was what attracted her to you. All of her words and deeds.

181
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,160
We need examples. We need concrete examples.

182
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,520
We need social security numbers, Ben. We need, you know, what was the one thing that like broke

183
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,200
the camel's back and you're like, Oh, no, this, this is clearly a deadly situation.

184
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean, it wasn't that bad. I was mostly just kind of amused. But she, well, okay. She, she was like,

185
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:17,920
she was like super forward about like sex questions. Like, she was really just like,

186
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,800
okay, we're sitting, we're sitting at the bar. Like, we, like we go to, we go to a bar in Harvard

187
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,320
and she's just, we sit down and she's basically just like, hmm, so what are you into? And I'm like,

188
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,560
what do you, and she's like, interpret that however you want. Like Minecraft? And I'm like,

189
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,680
yeah, I don't, I was like, you know, I declined it. I declined to answer. It's too early for that.

190
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,320
Yeah. And she, but she's like, and she just like, like the bartender that, and she's just like,

191
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,320
oh, hey, are you, are you straight? And I'm like, yeah. And she's like, ah, dang, darn, I hate fucking

192
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,360
straight guys or whatever. Like what, like, like what a disaster. You know, I'm looking for,

193
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,440
I'm looking for a quad and I'm like, I'm looking for, for people to fill out my quad. It's got to

194
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
be two guys and two girls. And I'm like, dude, she's a fucking troll. She's trying to fill out her

195
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,840
quadrants over here. And I'm like, impressive. And I'm like, what are you, I don't know what a

196
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,560
quad is. Can you, can you back away the fuck up and explain to me what a quad is? Turns out it's

197
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,880
really simple. It's a four way polyamory thing. And it's got to be, and it's got to have, you got

198
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,440
to have the X in the middle. You know what I'm saying? I don't. Is this four or five people?

199
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm lost now with this X fact. Four people, but you can't just, it's not like it's everyone,

200
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,360
everyone's dating everyone. Right? Okay. Yeah. It's not like, you know, one person's dating two,

201
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,560
and one person's just dating one, and one's dating the other three. No. It's a mutual,

202
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,360
mutually shared pool. Yes. Each of the four is dating all the other three. This is a fully

203
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,200
realized quad. So while she may perhaps have been attracted to all of them individually,

204
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,360
this would be a no go over relationship if in fact those others were not attracted

205
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,680
to each other. That would just kill it for her. Okay. All right. Sure. Sure. And her,

206
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,480
and it's not necessary for a quad, but her quad that she desires is two guys, two girls.

207
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,120
So, so she's just like, she just says this in like a totally like normal tone of voice,

208
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,240
as though she were describing the weather. Like she, the way you said it before, it sounds like,

209
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,920
like with the barkeep or whatever, just as like also there probably. She's like,

210
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,480
she's talking to the bartender. Okay. We're there. We're on a date. She like, she asks

211
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,800
the bartender for his number, like later, like a couple hours, like before, like before we leave.

212
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,960
She says like she's never, at some point, she has maybe like three drinks. At some point,

213
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,520
she's like, yeah, I've never been drunk. Yeah. One time I drank like 18 drinks. I've never,

214
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,400
I'd never got drunk. Nope. Never. Like, you know, total, probably biologically impossible.

215
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
This person is starting to sound a little delusional. She says she's never been drunk.

216
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,760
She drinks like three, then like we get out, we start waiting. I'm kind of tipsy, right?

217
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,000
We leave the place, I've had like five or six, we leave, we're calling an Uber,

218
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
she fails to call an Uber three times, maybe it's not her fault, whatever. I finally managed to get

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,800
one, like after like an hour of waiting, we get in the, in the car, she starts talking about how

220
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,520
she's got like low blood sugar or whatever, and like she needs a, she needs her medication. She

221
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,440
like she pukes out the fucking passenger side. She pukes, she does. She does, she does. Not drunk,

222
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:31,520
never been drunk. This is a blood sugar thing. Always needs blood sugar. So, and then, and then

223
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,520
I don't, I don't think I lost her phone. I don't think it was me. I think I gave her phone back

224
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,960
to, I, I hailed the Uber with her phone because mine was dead. I'm like very sure I gave it back

225
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,800
to her, but one way or another, we go back to her house and her phone is gone and she's like,

226
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,120
but you know what? Honestly, she was a good sport about that. I felt bad about it, whatever.

227
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,320
She lives at her parents house. We go into her fucking parents fucking like boomerass house.

228
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,600
I just, I have to use the bathroom. It's not that far from where I live. So I'm like,

229
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm like tiptoeing around, you know, she's got a nice cat. I pet the cat and I'm like,

230
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
hey, okay, I'm going to, you know, I walk home from here all the time. So I'm going to go and

231
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:21,440
she's like, okay, yeah, okay. So anyway, it was very weird, very strange. Yeah, that's it. That's

232
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,680
the, there's no moral to the story. That's what happened. And this was on, and this was on like

233
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,640
a Tuesday. Imagine, imagine all that happening on a fucking Tuesday. Yeah, you know, I think our

234
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,920
listeners would perhaps appreciate that when you just kind of go out in the world and do not in

235
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,560
fact spend all day just playing Minecraft, but just like occasionally talk to people. You can

236
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,640
have kind of mini adventures. We want our audience to play Minecraft. It's always a mistake. You

237
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,880
should subscribe to the PCP Minecraft Patreon server so you can avoid this sort of bullshit.

238
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
Keep your autism contained. Don't go out into the world. Keep it on Minecraft where it belongs

239
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:06,400
for a nominal fee. Anyway, I haven't told this to anyone. Like, Kazy messaged me earlier in the

240
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,000
week and was like, how to go with that girl? And I didn't respond because I'm like...

241
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Did true love win, Ben? The truth is boring. The truth is like lame. I don't know. I don't want to say it.

242
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,760
People want a salacious story or something. So obviously it's an amusing anecdote, which I was

243
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,960
happy to hear, but... That's why you just have to respond bad. And that's it. Just let their

244
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,680
imagination fill in the rest. Then they want to know the fucking details. It wasn't even like a

245
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,040
terrible time or anything. Just kind of like... That's weird. The ambiguity of the statement,

246
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,760
though, it creates a bit of intrigue that you can't do by yourself. Of course. That's the

247
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,000
point. The goal is to create... Well, you know, I watched a favorite movie of mine. Keep them

248
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,040
guessing. Make them think they're the crazy one. Gas clay. That's the way. That's the way.

249
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,960
And the movie, The Prestige, is a very valuable lesson in it. It's a good movie, whatever. It's

250
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
not Christopher Nolan. It's... No, it is. The guy who made The Dark Knight, whatever. It's

251
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,320
obviously really edgy and cool. But the main thing I get away from it is that there's this

252
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,440
moral that if you're a magician, people will hound you for your secrets, but the second they give

253
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,080
it to you, you are worthless. You're not cool anymore, and you can fucking die. So always hold

254
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,040
on to your secrets, guys. It keeps you interesting. Don't be overly forward and honest like I can be,

255
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,960
and it makes you boring. It's important. I don't have any secrets.

256
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,600
That's your secret. You need to keep secret. You have to keep it a secret that you have no secrets.

257
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,920
That too. Literally true. Literally true. It's helpful in making you seem like a cool guy.

258
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,320
People always like to think. I mean, Ben lives a mysterious, degenerate life. That could mean

259
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,200
anything on any given day. Oh, the mystery, the intrigue. What are the details?

260
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,200
You just got to keep your statements vague. Let people's imagination fill in the gaps

261
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,480
with the best possible interpretation of what you say, so you become cooler to them just by

262
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,360
their own projection. I've been thinking about reading Sam Harris's book, Lying, specifically,

263
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,200
because I've long been a believer that lying is a very immoral thing to do, and I want to do as

264
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,080
little of it as possible for a number of reasons. But with subjects like that, that's not a lie.

265
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
You're not doing anything that's a lie, but I wonder about the world.

266
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,240
Some would consider that a lie by omission. Well, a lie by omission, or even

267
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,320
is it immoral to create an air of mystique around yourself to make you seem cooler than you actually

268
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,960
are? I would suppose it depends on the purpose of the mystique. Well, it serves you like a practical

269
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,240
purpose of like making, like upping your like, I don't know, social capital. But like, if that's a

270
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,680
lie, then you're kind of misleading people sort of into being more interested in you than you deserve

271
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,160
I don't know. I suppose you could play it off that you just want to keep your personal information

272
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,480
to yourself, and whatever conjectures people come to based on your vague statements is their

273
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,280
own issue and not yours? I mean, that's true. And I mean, there's another factor here that's like,

274
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,200
like, let's just say that you decide it's immoral to like, pretend to be cooler than you are,

275
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,840
like in any small way, that you insist on being an open book, like overly so. The thing is, that

276
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
makes you stand out in a weird way compared to every other person on the planet. And now,

277
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,560
so you just like totally sunk your social capital in a way that like no one else does.

278
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,200
You become the girl we just talked about. Yeah, sort of, sort of, which is

279
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
you become the autism arbiter, and we just don't want that. Nobody wants that.

280
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,800
It was a tough game. It's a tough game to play. It's to be

281
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,640
Socrates had it down. Golden mean, my dudes, don't be too autistic, but be a little autistic.

282
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,440
Keep them on the edge of their seat. Mm hmm. Agreed. That's what we've learned today.

283
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
Life lessons going into the next decade audience. Remember these words.

284
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,920
Oh, hey, speaking of decades, I just I noticed a random factoid is I was scrolling back.

285
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,840
I was just thinking today at the end of this decade and year and whatnot about how old the

286
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,240
PCP was the first episode of the PCP was released. Today's the December 22nd was released December

287
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:08,960
23rd, 2015. So tomorrow is the PCP's fourth birthday since the first episode was posted.

288
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,600
Isn't that interesting? Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy. This is all we have to show for four

289
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,480
years of labor. Indeed. God damn it. I was just tweeting about how I miss the old days. Now

290
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,200
everything sucks now. Oh, yeah. I guess you've got to revive horse cast is what you're saying.

291
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,360
Yeah, just how back in the pony days, it felt like we were all going somewhere.

292
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,080
Look, we all got to hit it hard. When pony life drops, we all have to pick up, you know,

293
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,240
back in the saddle quite literally. Back in the saddle. We'll call it that. That'll be the new

294
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,800
podcast. Exactly. I mean, maybe we should do it. I mean, we did it for the movie, right? Didn't we?

295
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,600
I have no problem with like a one, I mean, just for example, like a one time episode of us watching

296
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,200
like season, would it be gen five, gen six? I do it. Oh, I agree. Get Dr. Wolf on for the

297
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,520
guests for that episode. It'll be a good time. Let's get, I love Kim Possible a lot for the

298
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,480
guests. Dude, yes. Dude, we, okay, we should, we need to have more guests. It's fine. I agree.

299
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
It's fucked up. It's fucked up. I mean, look at the people who showed up for today's episode.

300
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,040
It's clear we need guests. It's clear we need, yeah. There's three degenerates. This is just

301
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,560
not going to cut it last. You know what? On the guest thing, I think that the guest format is just,

302
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,840
is a little easier for me to think about if we have like some kind of like thing that we're going

303
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,120
to discuss with them, even if it's just like their project or something. We should have a prepared

304
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
topic if we're bringing a guest in. I think that maybe for those, it makes sense, even if it's

305
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,120
something soft. Absolutely. But yeah. Well, I mean, it should be something relevant to the

306
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,760
guest, right? I agree. We should, we should give them a bit of an advantage. We should, we should

307
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,320
just ask them to suggest something, yeah? Or, or maybe there's just something like we could just

308
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,680
suggest like, hey, you know, fucking, you made a new game, sir, or you are a really cool guy. Let's

309
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,160
discuss your work. No, no, no. No one who actually has accomplished anything would ever want to be

310
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,640
on our podcast. We're going to have to, we're going to have to softball him. Okay. We're going to,

311
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,560
we're going to have to make suggestions like, hey, what do you think about climate change?

312
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,160
What should we tell us? Sure. Sure. What a riveting topic.

313
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,200
This, this, this I think is the strategy. I think we can all agree that having like more diverse

314
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,320
different voices on the episode is always good. They're sick of our shit. And I don't know. And

315
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,960
also I think that having topics of some kind is generally a good focusing point for us to just

316
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,920
have something to bounce off of. So yeah, we're just going to like lean into the meme and just

317
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,680
become Digi's anime podcast that everyone thinks this actually is. We should embrace the meme.

318
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,200
Okay, wait, don't tell anyone, don't tell anyone this, maybe future bonus episode,

319
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,800
maybe just an episode. We just call it Digi's anime podcast as the name of that episode.

320
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,720
I feel like the only people that think that are the people who have never actually listened to

321
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,040
it, right? Agreed. I mean, I agree. I agree. And that's, and that's why it's funny. You can just

322
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,120
tell immediately who has never listened to the show. They know it's much worse than that if they

323
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,040
wouldn't. In the process of like capturing new viewers in any mechanism, in any way, like that

324
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,920
would not be by like, oh, I'm now suddenly interested in this podcast or these, it'll be like, oh,

325
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,480
there's something cool about this show that's presumably not anime or Digi podcast related

326
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,880
specifically, probably, you know, as part of it perhaps, but we have something else to bring.

327
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,280
If this is Digi's anime podcast, he's like the CEO just stays in his office and does nothing

328
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,160
while all of us, the workers, toil away. Absorbing our surplus labor value, god damn it. Oh,

329
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,960
it's infuriating. That's not really the case, though. Nate's the only one, Nate's the only one

330
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,880
who skims anything off the top. And I mean, Nate actually does like actual work. But he does earn

331
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,880
his keep. I would argue that I am underpaid for the amount of time I put in, but hey, that's,

332
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,680
that's life, baby. You actually do like sort of make it all run.

333
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,320
Yeah. I pull the gears and levers. I turn the wheels of the world as it is. I am a god.

334
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,080
I'm about to shrug, motherfucker. I know big way. Do we have a potential guest list?

335
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,560
You know, I think we had some list of like a couple of people who we were thinking of inviting.

336
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,600
That should be our resolution for the new year is more guests on the PCP.

337
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,240
Make the podcast not shit. What? Yes. Let's not go crazy.

338
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
Yeah, that's true. That's asking a lot. I'm sure we could think of some people who we'd want to

339
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,040
have on the show. I mean, and I frankly, I know quite a few people. Look, even if these people

340
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,120
aren't like, I don't know, super famous wouldn't give us like tons of new viewership, just having

341
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,280
a new voice. I know people who would be interested. We should get Vivzi on. We should get Vivzi Pop on

342
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,080
to ask what she thinks about the knot. We should get Vivzi's dog on to hear, you know,

343
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,760
he's kind of sorry about it. Get old Fido on the show. You can just see it in her eyes that

344
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,920
she's thinking about the knot. I'm sorry. She's thinking about it. We can call the episode the

345
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:59,680
knot or tying the knot, perhaps. Can you, can you not? Can you not?

346
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Holy shit, that's a great name for a show. Oh, like a furry podcast? Can you not? That would be

347
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,680
incredible. Damn. Did you just discover our new revenue stream? Copyright Tom, you can't have that.

348
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,560
New side stream. That's another great bonus episode idea. New side stream. It's all just

349
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,680
punching down at furries and other furries. Well, they've thoroughly earned it, I would say. Can you

350
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:35,120
not? I'm also writing Digi's anime podcast. It's called Can You Not? Digi's anime podcast.

351
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,880
Endorsed by Digibro. Send all complaints to Twitter at Digibro.

352
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm sure he would enjoy that. Let me say, let me say, what else am I going to bring up? I think

353
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,560
there was one or two other things. Oh, hey, hey, I was curious. Oh, I made another big batch of

354
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:08,480
curry yesterday, guys. It's large. It looks beautiful. Oh, it is. It is so good. And you know,

355
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,960
I think you guys would be proud. Maybe I'll get a picture of this later. But there's a, when I went

356
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,920
to the store this time, I was bereft of curry for a full, I don't know, like month, and it made me

357
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,400
want to kill myself. So this time I bought, you know how they have those like wooden, or sorry,

358
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,480
not wooden, like the cardboard, like things that like the product sit in on the shelves of any

359
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,800
individual product? Yes. I just bought the whole thing. An entire one of those. Damn.

360
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:39,760
It had a full like 12 boxes of curry. And it was the best purchase. So curry comes in like a box,

361
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,040
right? And it comes in a box of like cubes that you that you break up and put in the stew.

362
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,480
That's right. That's right. So how many boxes did you get? I bought 12 individual boxes and each

363
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,040
box is like one. I mean, I use two for my things, but like I use a big pot and make like a lot of

364
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,520
it at a time. So it's probably like double the normal amount or whatever. So like 12, you know,

365
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,360
12 boxes. And I'll buy more. Oh, it's so good. It's my favorite food, probably right now. I make

366
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,120
it myself. It's delicious. It's pork, carrots. And I got to tell you, you know, yesterday, when I was

367
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,200
making it, Michelle was like, Nate, you those sweet potatoes look so gross, because I was chopping

368
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,240
up these incredibly old sweet potatoes. Oh, they were, well, I'll tell you why it's the fact,

369
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,960
it's the fact they were old and moldy and oozing liquid. And I was like, no, no, no, Michelle,

370
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,120
these are the best part. We can cut around. Okay, okay. We can cut around the mold. Oosing

371
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,840
liquid is a little far. It's a little too far. I was so willing to put those in because they're

372
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,040
so good. They're the best thing in the curry, the sweet potatoes, the yams. Oh my God, I love them

373
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,720
so much. And that bitch, Michelle, she robbed me. She was like, I will not eat that. And I was like,

374
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,480
well, this is why God invented divorce, I guess, for this very purpose. You should have just been

375
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,640
like, you're lost, bitch, and just made them anyways. What were you thinking? I mean, I'm with

376
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,120
you. I don't know. Like, for instance, downstairs in my fruit bowl, there is an overripe avocado.

377
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,760
And I am angry at whoever left it there, whoever purchased that avocado and didn't eat it, right?

378
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,320
Sure, I understand. I consider it a crime that has been dealt to me personally.

379
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,560
I do hate, now that I buy all my own food and shit, I do hate wasting it. It is very

380
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,960
annoying to see any food go to waste. I have one of my roommates works at a deli, basically. And so

381
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,280
I think that food does not carry quite the same intrinsic moral weight to him because he just

382
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,720
got it all the time and probably has to throw tons of it out in the course of his job.

383
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,360
It's become a crime.

384
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,960
So he's just got all this, he'll cook food and leave half of it in the fridge and just let it

385
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,960
go bad. And I'm over here like, just let me eat it. Just let me eat it all. God damn it.

386
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,520
We have to find an answer to the food question sometime because I hate this fucking, we throw

387
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,920
out so much food and it annoys me to no end. I never throw out food unless absolutely necessary.

388
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,720
I'll eat it, whatever the fuck it is. I don't know. Sometimes things are in the fridge too long

389
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,760
and they get gross. And I guess the worst thing I do is I'll buy a bunch of vegetables and then I

390
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,240
just won't cook with it. And then it's too old to cook with and then I throw it away.

391
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,600
That's the only thing I do.

392
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,800
Somebody got heavy cream, like two very small, very small containers of heavy,

393
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,080
heavy cream, like one cup containers, like really little. And they were in the fridge

394
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,760
because we had other heavy creams, so nobody opened them. And like it finally comes down

395
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
to, oh, we're done with that, that carton time to open up the new one. Oh, we got these two

396
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,920
little ones. And they were like a month overdue or over ex expiration. And like their contents

397
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,720
was just like solid, like a paste. Yeah, like it didn't even didn't smell or anything. It just

398
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,240
had sort of turned into sort of a-

399
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,880
You just got to stir it around. That's still good. That's still good.

400
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,560
Honestly, honestly, it seemed like maybe if I had like sweetened it or something,

401
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,200
I could have eaten it as like a custard. Like it didn't seem-

402
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,160
Oh, dear.

403
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
It didn't seem that nasty. That's how they make yogurt, right?

404
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,280
To be perfectly honest.

405
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,000
But I mean, if you want to have the authentic Sessho experience, and yeah, you would just

406
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
eat that in a custard, I guess.

407
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,640
I mean, okay, what is cheese? Like what is yogurt, right?

408
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,960
Exactly. It had become some kind of cheese.

409
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
I feel like there's more artistry to cheese than that.

410
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,520
No, there's fucking none. I don't know.

411
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
It's just a sun net. It's just nature taking its course.

412
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,400
It's just a complete accident that happens every single time.

413
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,080
Oh. I mean, you could argue that like the yogurt industry was like originally made,

414
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,960
like on the back of like spoiled food that they found a way to market, which I think is true.

415
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,080
But now I'm pretty into it. It's pretty good. It's pretty good stuff.

416
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,040
I like a gogurt on occasion.

417
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,400
I'm a pretty energetic guy. I'm a kid on the go.

418
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
I don't have time to fuck with a spoon.

419
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,720
I hope we get to that point.

420
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,800
I need something to keep my lunch cold. I gotta freeze my fucking yogurt.

421
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
Freeze my yogurt. Yeah, it's good cold or room temperature.

422
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,960
Hot or cold, you know?

423
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,800
I mean, I was going to say that I can't wait for like businessmen to be eating yogurt.

424
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Sweet or savory.

425
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
It's the optimal food. But then I think about, I actually,

426
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,800
I don't know, in animes, but occasionally in like Japanese stuff,

427
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,120
you'll see like businessmen eating those like, like,

428
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,640
they're kind of like baby food pouches that you can get at convenience stores in Japan and stuff.

429
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Fruit mash or whatever.

430
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640
Yeah, yeah. Which is, it's good. It's good. I've had a couple of them.

431
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,240
I had one. I liked it.

432
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,840
For men on a mission, you just don't have time to consume.

433
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,000
But just like all individually packaged foods, it's too expensive. It's horseshit.

434
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,120
Well, that's true. I would never purchase it at my own volition.

435
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,400
The struggle.

436
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,440
I just want, I just want the world to adopt, like,

437
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,480
forget like a universal currency. I just want a universal food.

438
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,000
We all just agree. We give up food and we just eat,

439
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,440
slop, optimally, like, nutrition, slop.

440
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
I know it's going to be a little different for everybody.

441
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,240
Wait, did you get the email? Did you get the email?

442
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,840
Are you on the Hewlett mailing list?

443
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
Yes, I am. Hewlett 3.0.

444
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
Did you see Hewlett 3.0?

445
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
New Hewlett bars, that's right.

446
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,760
But they also said that powders, they've revised the formula.

447
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,440
They now have Hewlett version 3. Oh.

448
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,400
And I'm curious to try it.

449
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,600
What a fucking minute.

450
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,920
I just bought a bunch more version 2, goddammit.

451
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,800
So Hewlett has moved into the solid food market?

452
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
Ah, yes, they have.

453
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,040
What a bunch of bullshit.

454
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,120
What a betrayal of all its principles.

455
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,520
No, it's not.

456
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,880
We know that Hewlett, Hewlett's like single serving, like,

457
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,040
drinks and the single, and like, these bars,

458
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,600
they're obviously just a cater to the norm modes, right?

459
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,200
You're like, optimally efficient.

460
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
I have to wonder why they even bothered with the liquid in the first place.

461
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,120
If you're as real hooligan as they call you in the email,

462
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,080
you only buy the powder because it's the best price to performance ratio.

463
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
You get it, it lasts forever.

464
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,760
For us, the consumer, absolutely.

465
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,480
But like with those products, they're clearly trying

466
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,640
to just get like normal people to consume you.

467
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,280
I bought the bottles and I felt like I betrayed my own values.

468
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,000
So I'm like, this is too convenient and too expensive.

469
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,560
They're so convenient and they're so delicious.

470
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,840
I mean, I love the chocolate ones.

471
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,880
I think they're absolutely fantastic.

472
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
It's just, but it's just a mistake.

473
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,880
Guys, no, it's about Questbars.

474
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,440
It's all about Questbars.

475
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,040
Questbars are fantastic.

476
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,240
The problem is I lived off Questbars for like three weeks once

477
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,480
and I couldn't shit for the rest of my life to this day.

478
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,040
I just can't.

479
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,880
They've got low net carbs.

480
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,440
They do.

481
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,400
They're fantastic.

482
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
They taste great.

483
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,560
They do.

484
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,840
They're like candy.

485
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,640
They're like my candy.

486
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
The texture is actually pretty pleasant.

487
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,920
I have tried like, there's okay, there's only like two flavors.

488
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,560
I looked up online to see if I've missed any.

489
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,760
And there's only like two flavors of Questbar that I've never tried.

490
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,600
And I, if I ever see them in a store, oh my God.

491
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,080
Ben, what you need to do.

492
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,680
I mean, try the donut sprinkle.

493
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,840
The donut sprinkle is very...

494
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Ben, what you need to do is you need to go on eBay

495
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,760
and you have to buy a lot of Questbars.

496
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,360
They'll sell them like a box of 50 for cheap prices,

497
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,240
like half the price of what they are in the store.

498
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,360
So like $3 a bar, which is bullshit, too expensive.

499
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,880
I told my parents.

500
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,240
I told my parents, instead of candy in my stocking,

501
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,840
please just fill it with Questbar.

502
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,120
I passed that along.

503
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,760
I passed that along.

504
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
I told mom.

505
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,680
So she shouldn't have...

506
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,000
What is it?

507
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,320
What is it?

508
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,880
Hold on, hold on.

509
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,800
The one that I haven't tried.

510
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,520
Okay.

511
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,360
Fucking mint chocolate chip.

512
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,880
I have never seen mint chocolate chip,

513
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
but that, it sounds incredible.

514
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,480
There's like one other, whatever.

515
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,280
It doesn't fucking matter.

516
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,880
Unironically, last year for a while,

517
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
like when I was living in the car

518
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,360
and when I was first moving with Digi for a little while,

519
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,520
I had nothing but Questbars and Hewlett

520
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,360
was all I was eating because I had...

521
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,720
Weird, because I've never seen them.

522
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,960
I only started seeing them around like a month or two ago.

523
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,120
Really?

524
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,480
And now suddenly I see them everywhere.

525
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,880
Yeah.

526
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,160
I saw them in a Target.

527
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,600
I've had them for at least two years,

528
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,440
or been aware of them for at least two years.

529
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,320
They're around.

530
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,000
They've just been on the down low, I guess.

531
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,440
But I'm assuming it's because Keto's gotten bigger,

532
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,640
that they have expanded their business for obvious reasons.

533
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,000
They are very Keto friendly.

534
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,080
Maybe, yeah.

535
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,600
I mean, that's why I like...

536
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,480
Two years ago, Keto was not nearly as big of a deal.

537
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
It's like Ben found out about it

538
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,840
and then the whole world was like listening to the PCP.

539
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,280
Yeah, I spread the word.

540
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,000
Of course, yeah.

541
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,600
I, you know, the two Keto dudes podcast

542
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,640
spread the word to me

543
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,320
and then I spread the word to everyone else.

544
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,200
The reason...

545
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,880
It's the circle of life.

546
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
I found out them not because they were Keto,

547
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,040
but my sister told me she can't have gluten

548
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,240
and they are gluten-free.

549
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,480
And so she's like, these are great bars to have

550
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,560
if you have a gluten allergy like I do.

551
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,120
And they just happened to be Keto on top of it,

552
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,240
which was a good bonus.

553
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
Although, I mean, they're Keto,

554
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,920
but not if you eat like 12 of them, which is what I do.

555
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,440
No, that's a bad call.

556
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,080
They're so fucking good.

557
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,040
How do you shit?

558
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,200
Like, they literally just destroy you.

559
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,000
Um, I don't know.

560
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,240
No.

561
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
Fuck it.

562
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
I guess you're just so Keto-powered now.

563
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,160
Your body's adapted.

564
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,200
Yeah, although I'm off Keto for the holidays

565
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,080
because like, fuck it.

566
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,880
Yeah, it's...

567
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,120
What am I not gonna eat?

568
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,040
Mashed potatoes?

569
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,960
Hey, Ben, I've heard in the grapevine

570
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,240
that your weight loss may have hit its goal

571
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
and that it's time to perhaps relax and stop losing weight.

572
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,920
Who the fuck told you that?

573
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,880
Any feedback?

574
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,920
Oh, I'll never tell.

575
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,200
I'll never tell.

576
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,840
It never quite hit the goal I was looking for.

577
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,680
I wanted to get down to like one...

578
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,200
I wanted to get down to 150,

579
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,680
and I never got below like 154.

580
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,080
Damn.

581
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,200
Okay, that's pretty impressive.

582
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,520
It like got close and then kind of stalled out.

583
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,040
Well, that's not bad.

584
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,720
I mean, within four pounds after all that,

585
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,840
I mean, that's what I got to was 173, I think,

586
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,040
which was pretty good.

587
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,720
Hey, that's pretty...

588
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,960
Yeah, that's all gone now though, unfortunately.

589
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,200
I'm gonna have to start again after the holidays.

590
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,560
I've probably gained a few pounds.

591
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,480
I'm probably up in like the low 160s right now.

592
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,120
I had like two slices of pizza and sugar cookies yesterday

593
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,240
while I was holiday shopping.

594
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,360
I felt like a monster.

595
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,040
I also ate pizza yesterday.

596
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,640
I was like, it's that time of year.

597
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,360
Yeah, I suppose it is.

598
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,000
You know what?

599
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,400
I eat pizza and I feel sick immediately afterwards.

600
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,600
I don't know why I do it.

601
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,640
But I always forget.

602
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,760
I always forget.

603
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,360
Like every time I have pizza and an hour later,

604
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,080
I feel like garbage.

605
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm like, why don't we go like shit?

606
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,120
I'm like, me and Michelle, me and Michelle were out.

607
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,840
And I just saw like, Michelle, I haven't had pizza in so long.

608
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,880
Like I want a piece of pizza.

609
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,960
Michelle's like, no, Nate, you don't want to eat that.

610
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I'm like, I want a piece of pizza.

611
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,040
So I got a piece from Whole Foods

612
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,480
from their like delicious looking pizza.

613
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,760
That's where I got yesterday too.

614
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,240
I felt so horrible.

615
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
Why would you get pizza from Whole Foods?

616
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,000
I mean, it's...

617
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,640
Oh, because I was...

618
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,400
I went to see a movie and it was right next door.

619
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:26,800
And I was hungry.

620
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,600
I mean, we go to Whole Foods.

621
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:27,920
It's okay, I was right there.

622
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,000
I ordered, I ordered from fucking Domino's.

623
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,040
I got a $5.99 chicken bacon ranch sauce for dipping.

624
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,360
Classic American.

625
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,440
But I mean, I ate it and I just felt horrible.

626
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,600
It feels good while you're eating.

627
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,120
I mean, this is why we do it, obviously.

628
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,880
The salt and the grease and blah, blah, blah.

629
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,760
But I...

630
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,000
I thought I would feel that way, but I didn't.

631
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,280
I felt fine and I'm actually kind of in a pleasant way,

632
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,160
sort of looking forward to when I go back on keto.

633
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,760
Like when I start dieting again.

634
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,800
I'm looking forward to the sensation of like,

635
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,320
I can feel that I'm losing weight

636
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,080
and I can feel that I'm like, I'm not as heavy as I was.

637
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,760
Yeah, that initial like,

638
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,280
that initial couple pounds of weight loss...

639
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,080
I need to buy a scale because the scale is what keeps me going.

640
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,040
It's so important, Tom.

641
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,200
It's gonna feel good.

642
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,680
It's gonna feel good.

643
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,560
So important to have a scale.

644
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,280
You gotta get that.

645
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,400
That's a priority for weight loss.

646
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,760
Yeah, because like that's when you...

647
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,600
You're just afraid because I know I'm gonna step on it.

648
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,720
I'm gonna be like 25 pounds heavier than it was like last year.

649
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,360
And I'm like, well...

650
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,480
Wait, say it to Tom.

651
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,440
You're gonna get a scale.

652
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,640
You'll do it, right?

653
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,120
I will do it.

654
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,720
I will go get it before the end of the year resolution.

655
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,880
Did I mention that my roommate, same one that works at the deli,

656
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,160
he got a new scale because we had kind of an old craft.

657
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,080
When he got a new one, that was like, it had like,

658
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,840
it had a computer inside.

659
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Oh, I think you told the story when like,

660
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,440
you used it without permission and like,

661
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,360
he got a notification on his phone or something.

662
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,640
I mean, that's not...

663
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,040
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,880
Well, I mean, it's not like he was like,

665
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,880
I mean, how much do you don't need permission

666
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,920
to fucking step on a scale?

667
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,640
But yeah, he would get like, he would get alerts on his phone

668
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,280
telling him how much I weighed because I looked like you used your scale.

669
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
It was like hooked to an app on his phone.

670
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,000
Dude, technology is too powerful now.

671
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,200
This is just, you don't...

672
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,280
There's some boundaries you just can't cross.

673
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,200
And like, the relationship between a man and his scale is just sacrosanct.

674
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,640
You can't do this.

675
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,440
Or can you?

676
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,560
I guess you can now.

677
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,320
But like, that's the whole point.

678
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,440
We've gone too far.

679
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,680
Yeah, well, we're making everything like, it's like in the,

680
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,280
like in Metal Gear Solid 4,

681
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,320
all weapons are like, like individually DNA tagged.

682
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,560
So like, every machine is like,

683
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,840
for use by a specific human ID and no one else.

684
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,360
Our scales, this is kind of similar to what's going on with the scale sort of.

685
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,760
I mean, it's plugged into like a system here

686
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,000
that's like expecting it to only be used by him.

687
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,640
Then we'll find a way to spoof DNA,

688
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,040
and then people get framed for crimes all the time.

689
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,240
And there'll be a whole other industry.

690
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,360
We're going to have to unravel.

691
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,600
Everything is shit.

692
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,200
And we do need to return to a mythologized past

693
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,680
wherein our people was, were great.

694
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,320
Do you have any,

695
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,200
do you have any sympathies for the anarcho-primitivist movement, Ben?

696
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,920
Absolutely disgusting.

697
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,320
Oh, really?

698
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,440
Absolutely vile and pitiful.

699
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,560
I couldn't agree more.

700
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,080
Pitiful weak cowards.

701
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,040
You know, because I remember a while ago,

702
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,520
I made fun of this guy who I'm actually quite fond of,

703
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,480
but he is a boomer.

704
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,520
And he has some silly opinions in my opinion.

705
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,800
This guy, ephemeral rift, ASMR guy on YouTube, whatever.

706
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,000
I like him a lot, but...

707
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
Is he the guy who did the mob boss ASMR?

708
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,280
That is based Tirar A. Duweyo, aka Lobster Boy.

709
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,560
No, that is a separate guy.

710
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,040
Both are heroes in very different ways.

711
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,880
Tirar is from Ohio though,

712
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,720
and maybe one day I'll meet up with that guy.

713
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,760
That'd be pretty sick.

714
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,800
But this is a different guy,

715
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,440
and ephemeral rift just...

716
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,640
He is a big anarcho-primitivist guy.

717
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,840
He's like, man, it's just fucked up.

718
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,040
We live in a society, man.

719
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,880
We should be living in the trees, man.

720
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,920
That's what humanity was supposed to be.

721
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,200
Man, that's fucking insane.

722
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,400
That is what a coward is crazy.

723
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,600
I mean, we know he's dumb.

724
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,360
Obviously, he's kind of like...

725
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,600
I know that most of humanity would die.

726
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,000
It's just...

727
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,200
I have sympathy that it feels like we're monkeys

728
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,560
in the wrong environment now,

729
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,240
which I mean, you know, kind of true.

730
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,120
Kind of true.

731
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,000
But you can't go back without killing everybody,

732
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,840
so I don't know what the plan is there.

733
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,560
I mean, that's fucking dumb.

734
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,040
Broader shoulder is not a lighter load, you coward.

735
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,160
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

736
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,800
I couldn't agree more.

737
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:25,680
Like...

738
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,680
I don't know.

739
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,760
I mean, so he doesn't actually think that we need to do it.

740
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,840
He's just kind of jerking himself off like,

741
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,480
boy, wouldn't it be great if we didn't have society?

742
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,720
I think he would agree with that largely, yeah.

743
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,240
As someone who creates ASMR content on YouTube,

744
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,680
I would assume he's not super sold on the whole idea.

745
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,760
I mean, he totally acknowledged...

746
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,360
He's done some vlogs where he's like,

747
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,360
yeah, I totally acknowledge I do stuff on YouTube.

748
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,360
I mean, he's one of these adult men

749
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,840
who started doing YouTube who has a job

750
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,640
and he does other things, so he doesn't need YouTube.

751
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,720
So that's a little different from our generation

752
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,880
of desperate e-whores trying to make it,

753
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,640
such as myself, you know?

754
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,480
Yeah, we're all guilty.

755
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,440
Yeah, we're all guilty.

756
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,720
Too close to home, man.

757
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,920
In any case, very, very silly in my head.

758
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,280
Now, Lobster Boy, on the other hand,

759
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,160
is an anarcho-capitalist hero who will stop at nothing

760
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,000
to seize the means of control over the world and...

761
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,520
Lobster Boy.

762
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,080
Check out Lobster Boy ASMR, everybody,

763
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,280
if you want a bad time.

764
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,920
I watch a lot of Terrar.

765
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,440
I watch almost anything he makes.

766
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,600
Oh, Terrar, DeGuello.

767
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,920
It took me like a year to figure out how to pronounce his name,

768
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,080
but I did it eventually and...

769
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,440
Degeo?

770
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,800
It's Dewey-o.

771
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,200
Dewey-o.

772
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
Terrar A. Dewey-o, which is like...

773
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,120
The lore behind this guy is deep.

774
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,400
Like, that is...

775
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,360
All these older guys...

776
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,280
I follow a lot of older guys on YouTube.

777
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,960
And they all have very...

778
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,920
Kind of like, larping stories about themselves,

779
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,320
but it's still fun to hear and they're mostly true.

780
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,480
And he was given this nickname by a South American friend,

781
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,200
a woman of his.

782
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,000
What, Lobster Boy?

783
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,440
Well, I'm talking about the man who runs the channel,

784
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,560
Terrar A. Dewey.

785
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,040
Lobster Boy is, to clarify, a character,

786
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,200
a horrible character on his channel.

787
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,560
I mean, this is the man who was shouted out by PewDiePie

788
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,200
for doing Pickle Rick ASMR back in the day.

789
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,280
So, you know, he's really...

790
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:23,920
That's amazing.

791
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,200
He's really hitting the ground running here.

792
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,080
He's got a lot going on.

793
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,360
He's a cool guy, though.

794
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,240
I like him a lot.

795
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,040
But, in any case...

796
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,120
Hey, speaking of the ASMR grind,

797
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,400
you know, ASMR content creation is interesting

798
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,320
and it'll lead into what I was going to say,

799
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,000
which is that like, with those guys,

800
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,080
you can do ASMR on anything.

801
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,160
Like, find a new box to tap.

802
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,480
Boom.

803
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,840
You got your next content.

804
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,080
For your next hour-long video of ASMR,

805
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,760
put an ad at the beginning and the end,

806
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,560
not in the middle.

807
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,000
That is a sin in the ASMR world.

808
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,560
Never do it.

809
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,760
And boom.

810
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,760
And you just keep doing that for years

811
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,240
and it seems to just generally work out pretty well.

812
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,360
Obviously, it's a bit violent.

813
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,520
And the swore slime ASMR when?

814
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,080
I don't know about...

815
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,040
I mean, it generally work out pretty well.

816
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,400
I mean, for the like...

817
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:06,960
Yeah, you're right.

818
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,320
Dozen guys who are famous for it.

819
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,560
You are correct, Ben.

820
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,120
I am the human.

821
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,960
Dozen guys and thousands of women.

822
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,160
It's a, you know, I feel a certain sense of envy, I suppose,

823
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,720
with like...

824
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,840
A lot of those guys do write scripts.

825
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,240
They'll come up with like characters and do things.

826
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,280
Others do not.

827
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,400
They just kind of do whatever.

828
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,400
But, you know, as opposed to people who are making more

829
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,480
complicated content or whatever.

830
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,080
I'm not even trying to say I'm good or anything.

831
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,200
But here's what I was going to say.

832
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,600
I just...

833
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,800
I am envious of how some of those guys are able to just churn it out

834
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,240
without having to do too much.

835
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,440
But here's what I was going to say.

836
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,720
So I'm leaving tomorrow for like four days away

837
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,360
off the grid or whatever.

838
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,320
I'm still going to be working on some stuff all the way.

839
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
But it's, you know, it's like a little mini-vacation.

840
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,360
First kind of dedicated one I've taken in quite a few months.

841
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,440
Except when I visited Digi, to be fair,

842
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,880
that we did actually work while I was there.

843
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,680
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

844
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,840
I feel like I could have stayed at the folks place

845
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,640
for longer.

846
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,320
But I really didn't want to.

847
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,680
Because I just don't want to be away from my computer.

848
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,360
Because I want to be working on things.

849
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,880
Because I have so much desire to make shit.

850
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,680
Are you there now?

851
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,040
No, I'm still in my place.

852
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,160
I'm leaving tomorrow to go.

853
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,120
You're leaving tomorrow?

854
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,520
Okay.

855
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,800
I'll probably get there.

856
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,240
I'm probably going to get there, like,

857
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,720
early on the day of the Eve.

858
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,600
Okay, that's cool.

859
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,160
That's cool.

860
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,760
That's my plan at the moment, anyway.

861
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,800
Sounds good.

862
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,280
I mean, yeah, Michelle and I'll be settling in,

863
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,200
then probably, the day before.

864
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,560
So, like, I was wondering if you guys

865
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,600
feel a similar sense of, like, I suppose

866
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,400
it's not really a guilt.

867
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,760
I mean, we've talked about this for a long time.

868
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,360
I know Jesse's talked about this a lot.

869
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,360
About, like, the pressure to always be working,

870
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,920
that I like, and I don't really want

871
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,080
to not ever be working when I can.

872
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,080
But, I don't know, do you guys,

873
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,760
how do you feel about, like, taking vacations

874
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
from your online content creation?

875
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,880
To fill you with nerves?

876
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,360
I don't really feel...

877
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,640
It always feels like a sin.

878
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,160
I don't really feel like anything that I do is work, per se.

879
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,480
I only do things.

880
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,920
Well, with a couple exceptions,

881
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,800
I basically only do things that I feel like doing.

882
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,000
Fair enough.

883
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,520
Like, I don't, like, the poo videos felt like work.

884
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,760
That was me, like, starting a project to be like,

885
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,040
how's this going to pan out?

886
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,880
And I felt like work.

887
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,400
I chugged through it.

888
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,240
Didn't get any, didn't yield much.

889
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,600
It's worth trying.

890
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,320
Those are good.

891
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,440
I enjoyed them.

892
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,960
But, like, slime and punishments,

893
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,280
what I work on mostly now, at this point,

894
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,880
although not for the last couple days.

895
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,520
And that doesn't feel like work.

896
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,200
Yeah, that's cool.

897
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,520
That's cool.

898
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,720
So, I don't know.

899
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,200
I guess I don't feel the same way.

900
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,480
For me, everything is an uphill battle.

901
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,120
Like, left to my own devices, doing what feels good,

902
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,080
I would become 300 pounds and just play video games

903
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,800
and watch anime.

904
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,280
So, everything that it's not that is, like,

905
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,240
an active, like, brain-busting effort.

906
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,320
You know, the funny thing about that, for me,

907
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
is that, like, you know, for example,

908
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,080
maybe, I don't know, you guys probably relate to this.

909
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,480
It's like, or, you know, in some form or another.

910
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,800
Like, the weirdest thing is that, like,

911
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,520
I have kind of been having tough, tough time,

912
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,160
making time specifically to get to the gym

913
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,040
for the last couple of months.

914
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,400
Like, I've been going, you know, maybe, like,

915
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,240
once every week, once every two weeks sometimes,

916
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,200
which is not great.

917
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,280
Obviously, that's less than it should be.

918
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,760
But, like, you know, I'm finding time to squeeze it in.

919
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,360
But, like, I have trouble doing it.

920
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,480
I find that the times that I most exercise

921
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,600
is when I'm on vacation.

922
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,160
Because then I'm finally not,

923
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,240
I don't have this thing looming over my head of,

924
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,960
Nate, you could be working on your project right now.

925
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,040
Like, you need to blah, blah, blah, do that.

926
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,200
It's when I am, like, set free.

927
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,320
That's when I most, like, go running and do my lifts

928
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,520
and hit the gym and stuff.

929
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,240
When I've, like, got free time to do that stuff.

930
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,800
I don't know.

931
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,280
I mean, what I did for the gym is I just made it

932
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,720
the priority number one.

933
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,040
Like, as soon as I woke up three times a week,

934
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,280
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I would go to the gym.

935
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,960
Like, it was more important than work,

936
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,000
it was more important than anything.

937
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520
Like, that was, because it, for me,

938
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,680
I only went for, like, you know, 45 minutes to an hour.

939
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,200
So, it was not a huge time constraint.

940
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
So, like, getting it out of the way early

941
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,880
meant the rest of the day was open to do whatever I wanted.

942
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,400
I absolutely should do that.

943
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,640
But, like, the mental block I keep hitting with that,

944
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,760
I know that the first thing I should do

945
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,040
is wake up and go to the gym.

946
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,320
I feel bad doing that.

947
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,360
And, like, I feel guilty making it priority number one.

948
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,720
Look, I know that a lot of this is, like,

949
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,640
rationalization and it's me being stupid

950
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,520
and I should just do it.

951
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,120
Absolutely true.

952
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,480
And there's no excuse to not do it,

953
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,680
blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.

954
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,760
But, like, when I, the hurdle I encounter is just, like,

955
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,320
I want to get up and get straight to work

956
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
on, like, editing and videos and stuff.

957
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,480
And, like, to instead go to the gym,

958
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,720
I just feel such a guilt and, like, a fear

959
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,400
that I'm, like, pushing back, like,

960
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,960
two more hours into the day is when I start editing.

961
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,960
Here's how, because I had that feeling a lot of the time too,

962
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,880
especially at the beginning, before it became habitual.

963
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,520
Right.

964
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:03,120
The way I justified it was, like, if I get up,

965
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,240
like, I want to go to the gym

966
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,840
because I know it's the right thing to do.

967
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,080
If I don't and I start working,

968
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,000
my work will be tainted by my conflicted mind

969
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,520
going back and forth between, like,

970
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,320
should I go to the gym versus continuing to work?

971
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,360
Whereas if I just do it, I will have mental clarity

972
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,840
and the work will be better because I will no longer be

973
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,280
caught between two brain spaces.

974
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,640
Okay, I understand realizing that in principle,

975
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,080
but there's no fucking way that you actually act rationally,

976
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,240
right?

977
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,680
You're right, Ben.

978
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,320
You're right.

979
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,880
That's my, like, that's me, like, oh, don't you know,

980
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,680
what, just get your homework done early

981
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,800
so that then you won't be, you can relax afterwards

982
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,760
and you'll be happy.

983
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,760
Like, fuck no, I can't do that.

984
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,280
No, I'm gonna fucking want it all night,

985
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,320
but I don't want to fucking do it.

986
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,440
Well, that's mean, Tom.

987
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,080
Six months straight.

988
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,360
Yeah, I'm gonna ruin my whole day.

989
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,680
Once you get into the groove, and I'm not trying to diminish it,

990
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,920
because I was like this too, it, like, after,

991
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,760
let's just say, if you do it for three months,

992
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,840
if you're able to force yourself, then it's a habit.

993
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,480
And then, like, it's basically easy at that point on,

994
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,400
because you've made it just part of your routine.

995
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,720
So that's the place everybody should be aiming to get.

996
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,280
But I have, I have solutions.

997
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,840
A lot of the time these days, because I have this fear

998
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,800
of, like, not doing my work, so I don't go to the gym as much,

999
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,040
what I will do is I'll just say, okay, Michelle,

1000
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,200
I know you don't give a shit, which she doesn't.

1001
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,520
I'm gonna swear to you, Michelle,

1002
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,760
that I will go to the gym tomorrow.

1003
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,600
And she's like, I don't care, but okay.

1004
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,440
And that's exactly what happens.

1005
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,080
And then, once I have someone else involved,

1006
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,960
like, holding me to a count, then I actually do it.

1007
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,520
Yeah.

1008
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,800
That's all it is.

1009
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,760
She's really gonna hold your nose for the crying stuff.

1010
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,200
It's not about her.

1011
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,400
You just gotta tweet it.

1012
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,160
You just gotta tweet the night before.

1013
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,600
I'm going to the gym tomorrow.

1014
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,360
And if you don't, all of your followers

1015
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,760
will just blast you for the rest of your life.

1016
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,640
If I had, like, a personal Nate account, I would do that.

1017
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,040
Since I only basically-

1018
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,920
You fucking do.

1019
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,440
That's what Twitter is.

1020
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,520
I mean, I don't really think of it.

1021
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,800
Do you not read it like that?

1022
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
I do retweet memes and stuff, but I don't know.

1023
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,880
Like, I kind of make something of an effort

1024
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,920
to make it, like, not particularly personal.

1025
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,560
I don't know.

1026
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,240
That's just my, how I've been handling it.

1027
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,000
Like, maybe I will make, like, a personal Twitter

1028
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,960
that's for, like, personal stuff.

1029
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,640
Put it in your Discord server or something.

1030
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,560
Have all the people who give you money

1031
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,840
to know that you are a failure if you don't do it.

1032
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,200
You know, I'm sympathetic to this,

1033
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,040
and I get your point on it.

1034
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,120
It's fair to have the people hold you to a count.

1035
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,720
I feel a little bit weird getting, like,

1036
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,920
my personal things involved with, like, the people at large.

1037
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,280
But I'll tell you what I would do.

1038
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,520
Perhaps either of you guys would want to enter

1039
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,320
in some sort of illicit demonic pact right now

1040
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,880
when it comes to, perhaps for just the first month

1041
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,120
of the new year coming up, to swear to,

1042
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,240
I mean, my goal, I want to work out three times a week.

1043
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,520
And that's what I would hold my,

1044
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,360
that's what I would want to hold myself to.

1045
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,040
What do you think, Tom, you want to do that?

1046
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,360
I mean, I can hold you to a count.

1047
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,560
I can't do any working out,

1048
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,040
but I will, like, try and hardcore get back on my diet,

1049
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,800
and we can hold each other accountable for that.

1050
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,360
Okay.

1051
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,640
Check in and make sure you're not fucking up.

1052
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,240
I will get, I will, I am willing to do that for a diet.

1053
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,800
For diets?

1054
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:56,960
Okay, okay.

1055
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,600
Working out.

1056
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,800
Me and, me and Kazy were working out all the time,

1057
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,560
but now she's, like, busy with schools.

1058
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,920
And I don't have a gym buddy anymore,

1059
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,280
so now I can't bench.

1060
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,360
I can't, I can't fucking squat by myself.

1061
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,160
I'll fucking die.

1062
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,080
You can squat by yourself.

1063
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,000
I mean, benching seems more dangerous to me.

1064
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,040
That I always worry about executing.

1065
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,080
I'll fucking die.

1066
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,960
You're trying to kill me.

1067
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,400
You just shrug the bar off if you're squatting.

1068
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:20,800
What's the danger there?

1069
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,160
This is an assassination attempt.

1070
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,000
I mean, I, I never benched with a buddy,

1071
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,440
which I know is irresponsible,

1072
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,960
and even when I'm alone in the gym,

1073
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,800
I'm just willing to roll the dice,

1074
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,360
because it's too embarrassing to, like,

1075
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,160
use something else.

1076
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,320
I'm just willing to die if it comes to it

1077
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,800
to avoid any kind of social interaction.

1078
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,440
Yeah, but, I mean, there's other people there, right?

1079
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,240
Not every time,

1080
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,760
because sometimes I work out really late,

1081
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,720
and I'm the only person there.

1082
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,320
Even if someone's not behind you

1083
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,680
with their hands under the bar, like,

1084
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,560
light weight, light weight, light weight, light weight,

1085
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,840
ain't nothing but a peanut.

1086
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
If the bar ain't bendin', you just pretendin'.

1087
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,680
Even if you're not doing that,

1088
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,280
like, as long as someone's there,

1089
00:58:59,280 --> 00:58:59,920
you won't die,

1090
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,880
because they'll hear you going,

1091
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,880
you know, that's the thing.

1092
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,760
The bar on your throat.

1093
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,640
I haven't thoroughly investigated it.

1094
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,600
And they whip out their phones

1095
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,280
and record your death instead of helping you.

1096
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,720
I'm kind of banking on,

1097
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,320
like, because it has happened to me before

1098
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,400
that I've been benching back in the day

1099
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
when I have gone for that extra rep,

1100
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,760
and it has been a mistake.

1101
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,120
And, well, I mean,

1102
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,880
it wouldn't be a mistake if someone was spotting,

1103
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,840
but I wasn't able to do it,

1104
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,960
and thus I almost died.

1105
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,720
But then there's people around who can, you know,

1106
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,440
pull it off.

1107
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,280
I'm just banking that I'll probably

1108
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,640
be able to shrug it off,

1109
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,640
or, you know, I don't know.

1110
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,080
I'll probably survive, right?

1111
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,720
I mean, nobody dies.

1112
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,200
Your problem is, like, you're getting older,

1113
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
and your body will start to break down,

1114
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,520
and those gambits will not pay off anymore.

1115
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,080
It just, I mean, it happens to everyone.

1116
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,560
I mean, you're right.

1117
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,400
You gotta pay the piper at some point.

1118
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,840
I'm not even doing a thing about, like,

1119
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:43,920
I'm strong enough.

1120
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,760
You're livin' on borrowed time now.

1121
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,600
I've already been in my life,

1122
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,520
in positions where I easily could've died

1123
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,240
while lifting.

1124
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,240
If there wasn't people to save me.

1125
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,840
But then again, like, I wasn't pushed

1126
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,280
all the way to the limit, though.

1127
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,720
Like, we're talking about situations

1128
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,920
where I'm benching.

1129
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,640
I don't know.

1130
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,600
This is probably back in the day,

1131
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,440
going for, like, a round two plate or so,

1132
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,360
which was, like, my peak ever,

1133
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,320
and I was trying to do it.

1134
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,520
I'm below that now, whatever.

1135
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,320
And I'm doin' a bench,

1136
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,360
and I go for that last rep,

1137
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,240
and you're lying on your back.

1138
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,480
You got the bar hovering over your face,

1139
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,200
and you go down.

1140
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,520
You bring it down to, like, onto your chest,

1141
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,040
and then you try to push up,

1142
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,480
and it will not go,

1143
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,000
because you just ran out of steam.

1144
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,720
You can't do it.

1145
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,400
So, what happens naturally

1146
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,880
is it kind of sags back onto your chest,

1147
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,320
and it'll naturally kind of roll,

1148
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,480
it'll try to roll towards your neck.

1149
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,080
And that's where it just will naturally go.

1150
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,520
And if it gets there,

1151
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,480
it'll crush your throat,

1152
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,840
and you'll probably die.

1153
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,680
But, like, maybe you could, like,

1154
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,840
swing the bar to, like, the right,

1155
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,560
and get the thing kind of pushed up.

1156
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,200
If you just push,

1157
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,720
you're pushing now, like, half the weight,

1158
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,080
kind of to the side.

1159
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,680
Hopefully it doesn't hit anyone.

1160
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,240
I assume things like that will happen

1161
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,600
if I'm in that situation.

1162
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,400
I've never tried it,

1163
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,640
because, obviously, it would be embarrassing.

1164
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,480
And you might be out of strength at that point.

1165
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,040
I might die.

1166
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,840
I could die.

1167
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,320
Who knows?

1168
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,240
This sounds like a terrible plan.

1169
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:58,880
It is a terrible plan.

1170
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,680
I'm just throwing that out there.

1171
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,640
But what's the alternative?

1172
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,440
Socialize?

1173
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,560
Ask for a spotter every time?

1174
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,320
No, the plan is just don't

1175
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,840
push yourself farther than you can.

1176
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,840
That's a pussy plan, Tom.

1177
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,280
Or just don't work out alone.

1178
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,600
Just work out a place where someone could save you

1179
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,840
if you were on lethal scenario.

1180
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,280
The easy way around this is just,

1181
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,400
I have a 24-hour gym,

1182
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,040
but just work out when there's at least one person there,

1183
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,400
because if you're going to die,

1184
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,000
that person will save you.

1185
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,520
And you'll probably make a friend.

1186
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,480
So won't that be nice?

1187
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,640
I look forward to it.

1188
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,280
Indeed.

1189
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,640
So speaking of Twitter.

1190
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,680
Wait, so are we agreed?

1191
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,120
Are we entering the Sacred Pact?

1192
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,840
I'm done.

1193
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,720
I'm entering the Pact.

1194
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,920
I'm entering the Pact right now.

1195
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,880
With regards to diet, yeah.

1196
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,280
Okay, so you guys are agreeing to stick to your diet.

1197
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,640
Let's just make this a time-bound thing

1198
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,000
for the month of January.

1199
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,880
A month is easy.

1200
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,560
30 days, no problem.

1201
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,640
Maybe starting now until the end of January.

1202
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,560
Or so, I mean, I won't be able to work out.

1203
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,680
New years, new years.

1204
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,840
Okay, starting new years through the month of January.

1205
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,160
We three warriors, we three kings are agreeing to this.

1206
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,440
You guys stick to your diet.

1207
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,240
I will work out three times a week.

1208
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,760
This was my plan already was to get back to diet.

1209
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,960
It's not only us.

1210
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,400
We are now beholden for the entire PCP audience.

1211
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:08,880
That's true.

1212
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,520
That's able to hear this.

1213
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,240
Goddamn.

1214
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,520
And if we can make it through this month,

1215
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,520
that's a long way to setting the routine,

1216
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,800
which is exactly what I want to do.

1217
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,000
If you can make it through a month,

1218
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,440
it's basically, you're basically set.

1219
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,160
You're on cruise control.

1220
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:18,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1221
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,360
So, hey folks, if you want to also,

1222
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,040
perhaps post in the comments below,

1223
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,000
something that you want other people

1224
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,200
to hold you to account for.

1225
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,480
Perhaps you'd find that useful.

1226
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,200
I don't know, up to you.

1227
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,080
It's not a bad idea.

1228
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,400
There it is.

1229
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,160
This is the healthy bro pact.

1230
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,520
So it shall be, so it shall be.

1231
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,480
Three times a week for me, as soon as possible.

1232
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,520
So, I guess speaking of keeping yourself healthy,

1233
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,840
I think I want to back off from Twitter.

1234
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,000
I hate it.

1235
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,360
I hate Twitter so much.

1236
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,000
It's so bad and so terrible.

1237
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,640
I agree.

1238
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,240
I've said multiple times that Twitter

1239
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,680
is a net negative for society.

1240
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,680
This is why, I think Ben,

1241
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,440
I think we probably feel similarly.

1242
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,520
This is why I just made a conscious choice

1243
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,280
to just make it like an anime girl image thing for me.

1244
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,240
That's like all it is.

1245
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,600
And also, my friends will tweet.

1246
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,280
And even they fuck it up sometimes.

1247
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,320
I don't know, it's like, it's the platform

1248
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,560
that I have like the most, you know,

1249
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,960
I got like 5k followers, almost 6k.

1250
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,520
Yeah.

1251
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,320
Making a tweet is not an effort

1252
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,000
like making a video or something.

1253
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,240
I just, you know, I want to talk,

1254
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,320
I want to say stuff and have people hear it.

1255
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,840
That's like, that's where I go.

1256
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,120
I don't like it.

1257
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,400
Fuck you, don't like it.

1258
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,880
I was on there, I saw the fucking J.K. Rowling.

1259
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,680
J.K. Rowling getting all turfy on Twitter.

1260
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,000
And I was like, I'm fucking upset about this.

1261
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,560
And I say so on Twitter and everyone hates me.

1262
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,480
The long story short, everybody hates me.

1263
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,080
Lose 20 people unsubscribed from me.

1264
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,480
You're wading into tumultuous waters

1265
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,600
every time you talk about those kinds of things.

1266
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,040
And I'm not saying you shouldn't,

1267
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,880
I'm just saying that kind of comes, unfortunately,

1268
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,760
with the territory.

1269
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,520
Is that when you plant your flag on something,

1270
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,160
you're going to get blowback from people who destroy you.

1271
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,000
That's what Twitter's for.

1272
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,840
Is that not what I don't understand?

1273
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,040
Well, all I'm saying is, all I'm saying is,

1274
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,320
that's what Twitter's for.

1275
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,080
I'm using it as intended.

1276
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,400
The results are horrible and make me feel bad.

1277
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,440
That's why Twitter, as intended, is a bad platform,

1278
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,840
which is why I never make political tweets ever.

1279
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,000
That's what I was, look, I just think that Twitter

1280
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and a lot of the things, I just think this,

1281
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,960
it's not a fault of anyone.

1282
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,240
This wasn't intended.

1283
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,400
But I think it's just as a result

1284
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,560
of the world that we're in now, the digital age,

1285
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,360
just like the most contentious arguments

1286
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,520
and people's biggest disagreements

1287
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,280
are the things that get propagated.

1288
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,520
And just as a result, it just makes everybody more mad

1289
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,960
and more sad and stuff.

1290
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,360
Even though, I think I was saying last time,

1291
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,760
I think we all agree on most stuff,

1292
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,760
but that's just not what gets discussed.

1293
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,320
No, I don't think, I used to believe that.

1294
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,600
I don't think so anymore.

1295
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,480
Okay, maybe I'm wrong.

1296
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,200
Maybe I'm wrong.

1297
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,800
I mean, that's what Twitter does, though.

1298
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,320
It skews your perspective.

1299
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,760
Like, what's that game or that video or whatever

1300
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,760
that shows like the anger machine?

1301
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,880
It's like a game where one person-

1302
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,320
Is it a CGP gray video that's like the meme?

1303
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,040
Like the anger meme?

1304
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,880
I think I'm actually thinking of a video game

1305
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,800
that was designed to simulate like how anger spreads

1306
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,360
or something.

1307
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,360
The one of like the crowds watching the news and like-

1308
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,560
Yes, yes, exactly.

1309
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,840
Yeah, I know the one you're-

1310
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,320
I actually, I landed on that GameDev's Patreon page

1311
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,240
the other day, like totally randomly.

1312
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,560
Yeah.

1313
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,360
Um, I don't know why.

1314
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,440
Do you have a name or the name of the game or anything?

1315
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,160
Oh, god.

1316
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,120
I'm gonna Google it.

1317
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:23,920
Oh, wait, it's-

1318
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,720
Ignored you were talking about that.

1319
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,080
She has another game called like Adventures in Anxiety, I think.

1320
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,280
Oh, I know that game.

1321
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,640
I think it's by the same person.

1322
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:31,600
Really?

1323
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,840
I didn't know they made anything else.

1324
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,480
Yeah, yeah.

1325
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:40,720
They had a, Nicky Case is the developer and the old game

1326
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:46,800
that you're talking about is, uh, ooh, ah, ooh, what the fuck?

1327
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,440
I'm looking at her, oh, uh, I'm scrolling down her page.

1328
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,720
She's got a lot of cool games here, looking real good, but I don't-

1329
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,560
Oh, uh, what we have, we become what we behold.

1330
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,120
Here it is.

1331
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,840
Yes, found it.

1332
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,680
That's the one, that's the one.

1333
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,080
Here, I will, I will link it in the show notes for everybody.

1334
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,760
I think you can play it right here.

1335
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,960
Yeah, yeah, you can.

1336
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,920
It takes five minutes.

1337
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,800
I love those games.

1338
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,160
Yeah.

1339
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,880
So, I mean, this, uh, yeah, it's pretty much,

1340
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,200
this is the phenomenon that I think social media propagates to some degree.

1341
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
And, uh, that's-

1342
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:19,760
It's tough.

1343
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,400
It does.

1344
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:20,480
Tough.

1345
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,320
It definitely does that.

1346
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,000
I don't know.

1347
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:26,960
I don't like it.

1348
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,360
That's it?

1349
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,320
I mean, yeah.

1350
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:28,960
Man, I'm upset.

1351
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,280
I'm, makes me upset and I don't want to do it anymore.

1352
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,440
And, and you know, the other thing is, I think that-

1353
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,800
And I guess it's just my good fortune that I've come to the point in slime and punishment

1354
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,040
where I have to take a break to make the next big update.

1355
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,280
So, I don't really have to post very much there anymore.

1356
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,080
So, maybe I won't.

1357
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,760
That's fair enough.

1358
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,600
And, uh, it, it makes me think back to the curious case of the Spoony One.

1359
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,960
How he just, I, I don't know his full story.

1360
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,240
I don't know everything about it, but like, you can, and I feel this myself.

1361
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,360
Like, you see, there's like a sliding scale about like someone starts off being like a YouTuber.

1362
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,040
Then they start to stream.

1363
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,480
Then they just start to tweet.

1364
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,320
And like, like things devolve.

1365
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,480
Like, they stop putting effort in and we see less and less good things from them.

1366
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,600
And I feel that there's a pressure on almost everybody to do this.

1367
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,800
Like, I've been streaming more.

1368
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,400
I'm doing my Nuzlocke now.

1369
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,120
It's fun.

1370
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,040
But like, I, I think, I feel that people are here for me.

1371
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,640
The only reason anybody follows me is for like videos of enjoyment.

1372
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,640
Maybe they think I have an interesting perspective.

1373
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,360
Fair enough.

1374
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,840
But like, they're not following me for, I don't know, like anything outside that realm.

1375
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:35,200
And so I just, I try to put that as my focus of what I, like that's always should be my top

1376
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,520
priority, I think, for what I give to the world and some online space.

1377
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,880
Yeah.

1378
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,280
I mean, I thought that everyone followed me for comics, but now I've been like doing slime

1379
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,600
and punishment and like, nobody gives a shit.

1380
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,400
So I don't know.

1381
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,320
I mean, maybe people just don't follow me for any reason.

1382
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,960
It's a very, it's kind of punishment.

1383
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,240
It's pretty niche, dude.

1384
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:52,960
Like, you know.

1385
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,400
Yeah, but it's a comic.

1386
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,440
And I, I don't know.

1387
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,520
I don't get it.

1388
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,000
I don't get it.

1389
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,200
Well, I, I, I think.

1390
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,240
I don't get why everyone isn't as excited about slime and punishment.

1391
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,000
Slime and punishment is on Twitter and Twitter is a terrible place to host content.

1392
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,600
It's not only on Twitter.

1393
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,120
It comes out on Twitter first, but like it's on all the other fucking platforms that a

1394
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:11,840
comic can be on.

1395
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,640
Do people, do, do our like sphere of influence like frequent those sites?

1396
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,800
It just seems like I've never been on the, on like webtoon ever.

1397
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,240
I think this is part of the equation.

1398
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,920
It's not a site in my rotation.

1399
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,320
Do you, do you think that people would want to read it more if, if like when I get around

1400
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,240
to putting it on stcomics.com?

1401
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,680
Cause I would assume so.

1402
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,240
I think so.

1403
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:32,400
I do.

1404
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:32,880
I do.

1405
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,800
I mean, that is, that is the plan, like to eventually, once it's done, put it on

1406
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,680
stcomics.com.

1407
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,600
I mean, for now, okay, whatever.

1408
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:47,680
For now it's readable exactly as it will be on stcomics.com on tapas and webtoon.

1409
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,160
I mean, I guess if you don't like those platforms, whatever, I don't.

1410
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,680
I mean, it's not about like, it's just about.

1411
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,160
I don't see what's off putting about the way that it's presented.

1412
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,840
I feel like tapas and webtoon are good for like expanding your audience.

1413
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,440
Cause you know, those are discovery platforms.

1414
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,720
You would think so, but no.

1415
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,920
Well, that's my whole thing.

1416
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,920
Cause I think, I think slime and punishment is like, it's, I guess like it, it's sort

1417
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,880
of an insular work.

1418
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,480
Like there's just so much like going into it, you need to like be aware of.

1419
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,160
Otherwise it's just gibberish, you know?

1420
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,880
So like, it's not going to do very well on a discovery platform.

1421
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,840
I don't know that it is.

1422
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,520
Cause like it explains itself perfectly well.

1423
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,080
I don't know.

1424
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,840
I feel like even if you'd never heard of endless war, you could read it and like,

1425
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,520
you would still understand what's happening.

1426
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,760
Maybe, I mean, possibly, I don't know.

1427
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,720
It's hard for me to really even gauge just because I do know the context.

1428
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,000
Honestly, I took pains.

1429
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,840
I took pains to explain everything.

1430
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,600
Cause like sort of, uh, I mean, at this point, maybe it's a little beyond that,

1431
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:49,280
but especially for like the first couple chapters of it for the first while, like it's

1432
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,720
Slam and Punishment is sort of designed to be an introduction to endless war.

1433
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,280
And that's why you have like the humble juve.

1434
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,240
It's like explaining how mining works and stuff like that.

1435
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,920
It's sort of supposed to be a gateway.

1436
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,400
Not a thing that is gated by entry.

1437
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,200
I don't know.

1438
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,440
Maybe there's just needs to be more.

1439
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,080
If you can get them to, if you can get a human being to page one of Slam and Punishment to read

1440
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,520
it, I mean, I'm obviously biased and I know the source, so I can't judge for everybody,

1441
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,880
but I think they'll get a lot of it.

1442
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,760
The art is good.

1443
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,000
The story is fun.

1444
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,040
That's what I think.

1445
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,800
Honestly, that's the problem.

1446
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,680
How do you get them there?

1447
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,960
I mean, I just think that's the, that's the real issue, whatever that is.

1448
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:32,400
Well, I mean, I have gotten some readers front on like fucking um, uh,

1449
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,640
dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirt, on those platforms.

1450
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,520
I have gotten some.

1451
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,720
I was, you know, just not maybe like, maybe like a hundred, maybe like some,

1452
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,000
probably less, maybe less than a hundred, which is like, I mean, that's cool.

1453
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:56,120
I guess yeah, I think that slime and punishment even with it's like exposition is still a denser harder to penetrate work than the Vapors or the champion

1454
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,320
It's more complicated. There's more that would be the case, but I mean I

1455
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:07,160
Think it's just because like the Vapors and the champion are both self-contained works like designed to just be themselves

1456
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:14,000
Whereas slime and punishment is a tie-in for endless war and Chris Chen which are both like you need to understand both of those

1457
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,600
I think that there's in a wider context to fully appreciate what's going on in slime and punishment

1458
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,240
I mean that's partially true and that definitely helps the understanding

1459
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,240
But I think that there's like a slight

1460
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,880
Like misunderstanding here because I think that what Tom's speaking to which I agree with is that like

1461
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,160
Knowing the general idea of what slime and punishment is can be intimidating when you think like oh man

1462
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,240
It's like a Chris and an rfck and a t-bap and a pony. Yeah

1463
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:45,000
You don't need to know who Chris is or who nightstar is to like understand what like the premise which is that

1464
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,200
But knowing who they are makes the comic much more appealing. I mean just consider for example. Why have just take one example

1465
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:55,960
I assume this is true. Why hasn't Digi red slime and punishment because I don't think he has I

1466
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:02,360
Can answer that it's because he's intimidated by those factors. I mean, you know Digi's a very easily intimidated man

1467
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,040
Like it's cuz he doesn't he like he doesn't hear his lack of moral character

1468
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,560
He doesn't like I mean he doesn't identify as someone who like understands rfck

1469
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,440
So I think like just knowing it's that's involved makes him be turned off

1470
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,960
Whereas like the vapors what do you need to know you need to know what like a human going to school is okay?

1471
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,320
I think we all you know we get that and that's not easy to read

1472
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:31,280
It's just that's a that's an aura around it of perhaps an intimidating, you know, just set like I imagine digi

1473
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,600
Might be among that set of people who yeah, not gonna read it while it's still being made

1474
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,720
But once I can I say like okay, so I'm the punishment's done. It's over. It's complete

1475
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,920
Then he maybe he goes in because you know, that's that was basically me with them

1476
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,800
Bail jpe was like I was aware of it as it was happening, but I didn't really sit down and read it until hippo was like it's done

1477
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,400
I think that like the main thing when I hear like a comic like okay

1478
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,000
If you already care about any of the things that are involved in there

1479
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,440
You'll probably be interested for for many reasons

1480
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:07,960
But like in order to get like a new audience the the thing that should probably lead is like here is an awesome comic

1481
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:15,520
That's really cool with great art, etc. And also it's tied into these other things that are also cool if you which I think it is

1482
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,400
I got a lot of enjoyment out of it. So yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it's that's exactly what it's meant to be

1483
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,240
Yeah, that was the that was the goal. Mm-hmm. So I

1484
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,780
I understand I get that like if you know if you know who if you're invested in

1485
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,540
Chris Chan, yeah, and you know who nightstar is and you think that that's funny

1486
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,300
Like I get that that would heighten the enjoyment of it for you

1487
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:41,300
My hope is that it's not something that you cannot enjoy without

1488
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:48,220
Knowing the context or same for like endless war, right? Yeah, I think you can it's just a harder sell at that point

1489
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:53,180
A harder sell explain the slower and I don't really think it's about the quality of the comic

1490
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:59,300
Like you are interested in endless war. I think it's a must read if you are interested

1491
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:04,140
Yeah, I think it's a must read because Chris is like involved in its creation in a sort of

1492
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,780
Semi and occasionally direct way indeed

1493
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:14,460
And other than that, it's I think I don't know to me it's has got everything

1494
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,860
It's got everything it needs to stand on its own. I don't know. That's just my opinion

1495
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:23,300
I I still think this is a this is a marketing question as it is probably for most

1496
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:32,420
Maybe not most but you know, ironically marketing is the most important skill in the world. Yeah, probably probably

1497
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,940
Tragically, but I'm terrible at it. Unfortunately

1498
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:42,060
Which explains pretty much everything since we're all competing for eyes in this cruel internet digital age arbitrage economy

1499
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:51,380
On that side, we've got voicemails we could go to if you guys want to unless you want to talk about anything else

1500
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:58,220
No, I think it's fine. I think I've said enough for a lifetime

1501
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:04,540
Yeah, yeah, did you say anime podcast rolls right along with more hits?

1502
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,860
Let's uh, all right, let's let's go to them. Let me see

1503
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:13,420
We've got voicemails people you left them for us link down below to the speak pipe thing

1504
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,060
Record them leaves the name etc etc

1505
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,940
Okay, here we go. First one is

1506
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:25,580
From will it hold up is our first one here and let's find out if it will go

1507
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,340
Okay, so I'm probably way too early with this

1508
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:35,180
But I recently listened to the pcp episode 100. You know, it was one of the greats

1509
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:43,020
Right next besides the drug episode or the yellow episode or even the legendary virginity cast

1510
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:49,500
It was fucking live on the couch. It was epic. What about fucking French? It was magic. I mean friendship

1511
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,060
so

1512
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,060
I've calculated and

1513
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,740
The pcp episode number 200 will be on the

1514
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:03,180
Will be released on the 28th of February. So how the fuck are you gonna hold up?

1515
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,260
I mean red con 4

1516
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,220
Probably isn't gonna be in February. So

1517
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,860
What you're gonna do about it?

1518
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:14,460
Shit, he's got the first thing this calls to mind for me is like how the fuck

1519
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,900
Has it already been so long since episode 100?

1520
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,500
when

1521
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:24,460
Like which was at rad com 3 it just makes rad com 3 feel like an era ago like a like a

1522
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,700
A million years kind of was dude. We're going into like two years since right

1523
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:33,420
Yeah, like the last the Kickstarter launched in february of 2018

1524
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:39,820
Yeah, so we're getting close to two years. We're going into 2020 dude march 2020 will be two years since

1525
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:44,780
We kind of meant to do them once a year, didn't we did we fuck up pretty much?

1526
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,420
Have we have we we missed this entire year, dude?

1527
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:52,220
I mean there were extenuating circumstances, but yes, I mean, you know, it's uh, it's on us to a degree

1528
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,660
I mean entirely 100 but uh, okay. So the answer is

1529
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:01,820
I don't think our like I've been thinking about this too. I respect you doing the math figuring these things out

1530
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:04,140
I also looked up this uh, this ahead of time

1531
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,700
February is probably not a great time to do

1532
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,260
Anything to get get together

1533
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:15,420
So I doubt we will do any kind of in-person meeting, but uh, I don't know we should we'll we'll perhaps think

1534
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,580
Wasn't it in the chat? When we talk about march?

1535
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,180
Yeah, but that's not february. That'd be uh, that'd be a little late. This is this is the plan. All right

1536
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,180
This is what we're gonna have to do

1537
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:31,100
The week before episode 200 we'll do episode 199. Then we'll do episode 200 one

1538
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,860
Yes, and we will just skip 200 until rad con four

1539
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:43,500
Where the legendary missing episode 200 will search for 200. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah people will be so confused when they're looking through their feed

1540
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,900
They're like, why is I missing an episode? What happened here?

1541
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,460
Fuck the viewers played them

1542
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:51,100
That pretty much sums it up

1543
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:57,820
So I we will think about this. I'll uh, we'll keep you posted keep your eyes peeled around february rad con four temporally

1544
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,580
confirmed

1545
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,420
Rad con fourth dimension

1546
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:06,220
We control time. All right. Let's uh, go to our next voicemail. This is uh

1547
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:11,900
Keyblade spirit names a meme interpreter. Okay, right. Let's uh

1548
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,700

01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,260
Okay, pcp. I need your help

1550
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,140
I found this spicy meme at the end of a dosion that I need your help interpreting

1551
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,220
Oh, no

1552
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:29,900
The text says this h-manga was translated by two cooked for you gang we

1553
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:36,060
Okay more translations no virus act and then the url

1554
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,860
And the picture is a picture of heath ledger's joker

1555
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,740
and there's a an arrow

1556
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,180
So

1557
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:49,820
Pointing from the joker. Why are you asking us a red circle?

1558
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:55,740
Around an arabic looking guy. I think it's just a stock photo and it's got some arabic words

1559
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,380
at the top of that and then

1560
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,180
Another meme inside of this meme

1561
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,460
It's this guy with looking real surprised

1562
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,100
Going

1563
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:12,700
And then inside that meme there's another meme that says bra moment

1564
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,420
And then there's a minecraft skin

1565
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,060
of the arabic looking guy from before

1566
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,860
And he's standing to the right of

1567
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,660
naked thanos

1568
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,300
What

1569
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:30,940
That's he should have put a link to this so we could actually see what does this mean? Yeah, okay does it mean?

1570
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,580
I'll uh, we should help me. I'm gonna I'm gonna reach out. I'm gonna see if he can

1571
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:40,540
Yeah, this is too dense. We don't have visual. He did not provide one boomer for this

1572
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:45,100
Unfortunately, you should have put the fucking link or something in uh, you're the name of your voicemail

1573
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,140
Do you guys want to feel boomer today is december 22nd?

1574
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:54,780
I saw a post on twitter today saying it is the 15th anniversary of like the first official youtube poop. Really fascinating dude

1575
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,420
Undertale can vote now

1576
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:01,660
Feel old yet feel old yet. Oh, there it is. Yeah. Yeah

1577
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:07,260
Yes, I do but for a completely unrelated I can't interpret that meme

1578
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,460
But I will ask you on twitter later to give us a link to that

1579
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,740
So perhaps at least the people can can work it out for themselves what they're seeing

1580
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:23,100
Uh, yeah, look in the comments for the answer. Let me see here. Uh next voicemail. Oh, uh, this one is a star wars question mark

1581
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
Okay, let's uh take it away

1582
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:27,500
Hey

1583
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,380
Is any of you gonna see that new star wars film? No

1584
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:35,900
I know I am I like star wars. Does anyone in the pcp make star wars?

1585
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,540
You know

1586
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,980
I already did see the movie. I saw it yesterday when I heard this voicemail

1587
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,500
I was going to be like, I don't think any of us has seen the new movie

1588
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:50,540
Or gives a shit. I certainly don't but then tom had actually happened to see it yesterday

1589
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,260
What would you think tom tells the story? Uh

1590
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:55,260
I mean

1591
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:01,020
Do the story is that I had every intention of either watching it when it came out on like video or

1592
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,700
Watching a cam whichever happened across my desk first

1593
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,780
But then forgotten paladin in my patreon server is like here's 30 bucks

1594
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,740
I want you to go see it and shit on it. I'm like

1595
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:17,180
Uh, okay, it's a heavy burden. I bear but I I'll I'll carry this cross. I suppose

1596
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:21,820
So I went to saw the movie and uh, it was pretty dumb. I was so sure

1597
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,140
I didn't like it. Yeah, it's gonna be a totally

1598
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:31,980
Non-controversial like just like give it a standard fucking ending just like do do empire again

1599
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,340
You know just just uh soft to reboot it like they did with with force awakens

1600
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:41,900
Just make it I don't think there was any like they had rocked the boat and like robbed it of all

1601
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,500
I mean, look, I did not see the last one

1602
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,180
I saw the force awakens and I thought it was okay

1603
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:51,020
But like my understanding is that they fucked things up so that there was really no way to make it satisfying

1604
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:57,420
To the public. I thought it was gonna be I mean the movie the movie does heavy damage control for last

1605
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:03,820
Unsurprising like if I was gonna sum up like I did I did a 45 minute podcast that you can list to for a dollar a month at patreon.com

1606
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:07,100
So it's called station 2 link in the description. Check it out. It's fucking sick

1607
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:12,060
This was my contractual obligation to accepting this 30 dollars to see this movie was to make a podcast

1608
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,500
But um, if I was gonna like sum up the disney trilogy is in a word

1609
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:19,820
Uh, the force awakens would be uh inoffensive

1610
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:24,780
Uh, last Jedi would be insulting and this movie would just be retarded

1611
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:28,940
Uh, that that's really how like because the movie is like an almost all

1612
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,460
Sequence of set pieces and when it's just like explosions and blasters and lightsabers. That's pretty cool

1613
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:38,540
But every time I try and move the plot around along it just gets progressively stupider

1614
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,220
And it's just like I can't believe this is happening and they thought this was okay

1615
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:47,100
Like there's times where a character is just like I have a feeling we should do this and it's like plot integral

1616
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:53,420
And there's no reason why it's just it's just the worst insult I can give it is simply that I lost interest after

1617
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,180
You know the force awakens. I was like, yeah, I mean, you know, whatever sure

1618
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:00,220
Enjoy. Yeah, I mean, I've never been a huge star wars fan

1619
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,100
The trilogy is based I watched them back in the day

1620
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:07,660
They were good, but it's not like I've never been like I'm gonna buy star wars merchandise

1621
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:11,500
And I'm gonna like go see star wars opening day. I just like you know me and my buddy went to uh,

1622
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:18,060
I think we missed the grand opening of the phantom menace, but we saw opening night the uh episode two and episode three

1623
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:22,220
Because we were uh, we were way into it, but uh, I mean that was before

1624
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,580
Like I just I just that was before my brain awoke

1625
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:30,860
Uh, you know, like there was I I talked about this and there was an event like the first time I saw garen logon

1626
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,340
And the first time I saw ghost nashel. I was still a young man

1627
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:39,980
Then at some point in college my brain awoke and I realized actually I like I remember the last thing I saw

1628
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:43,740
Before my brain awoke was my first watching of kill like kill

1629
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:47,100
After that and I still I've been meaning to go back and watch that again

1630
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,780
Then I watched garen logon again and I'm like, oh now I get it then I watched ghost nashel

1631
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:55,180
And I'm like, oh this isn't shit. This is actually good and and et cetera, et cetera

1632
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,420
Um, so uh, that all the star wars prequels I saw before that

1633
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,660
But of course I seen red letter median all those things

1634
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:05,500
Anyway, I don't think any of us really care about star wars. Uh, so

1635
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,140
Just nope next question

1636
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:13,900
Next question it is we've got uh, oh ben you're gonna be happy to hear this. We've got uh

1637
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,460
Fido vizipops dog is calling in with a message for the progress

1638
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,700
Get him out of here. That's disgusting. Let's uh fido

1639
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,420
Take it away go

1640
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:33,020
Bark bark. This is busy pops dog fido and I'm here with a message to ben saint. Yeah, but sadly to my knowledge. She does not

1641
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:39,500
Fuck dogs. Yeah, that's what you want us to think and I'm sure you're uh, probably sad to hear that been saying, you know

1642
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:43,180
You did a call right but hey man, think about how I feel

1643
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:48,140
I was at the pound looking at this girl thinking man, this this one's definitely down

1644
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:55,660
I'm looking look at the hair the general face for like the choker, but you know, I'm I mean, this is a little early

1645
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:56,940
I've uh

1646
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,580
Got a couple intense belly rubs if you know what I'm saying

1647
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:06,860
But uh, if I do get laid, I'll be sure to let bent state. No asap. Yeah probably through speakpipes since I'm a dog and

1648
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:09,340
Please they don't let us have twitter accounts

1649
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:16,060
Bark bark, which is very speed. Yeah, make me the first. I want to be the first one to know. Um, I think he's lying

1650
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:23,660
Um, I think he's just doesn't want us to I think he wants to spread the misinformation that this isn't going on

1651
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,580
It's part of the jewish conspiracy to uh, to uh

1652
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:34,620
Well dogs are loyal and why would you want your master? He just he just doesn't want us to build the wall between

1653
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,020
America and the dog nation

1654
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:44,060
He doesn't want to know that they're coming over they're coming over the border and stealing our jobs stealing our women yada yada yada

1655
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:47,180
Y'all know it y'all know it. Mm-hmm sound off. We know

1656
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,460
Sound off. We want a human only

1657
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,980
All right next try to answer the dq

1658
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:04,140
All right next voicemail is from uh, this is uh, harlock aznebel who if you don't remember folks

1659
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:09,740
He's the one who uh got the um, the the gf from anime club his little brother

1660
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,580
Got a gf an anime club and if you recall he made a bet between

1661
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,780
I mean he made a bet saying if he kept the gf

1662
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,740
He would give you tons of fun bucks on patreon and if he lost the gf

1663
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:26,140
Oh, wait, no, no, if he lost he would give it to you if he kept it he would give it to me

1664
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,540
He came up with this

1665
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,500
But that's uh, that's what he did well. Do I recall?

1666
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:37,180
Indeed indeed. You're up to speed viewers. Uh, let's hear uh, how things are going for him harlock. Take it away

1667
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:40,140
So ben saint wins the bet

1668
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,060
Yeah

1669
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,660
Fuck

1670
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:48,060
I don't have his money yet because uh, I thought this would at least last till past christmas

1671
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:52,620
But it actually ended literally the second the semester of my college ended. So

1672
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,140
Fuck was he right?

1673
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:00,700
I mean, I guess he's always right. He's right. This is me to can presume when college everything

1674
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:05,020
I suppose it makes sense that you wouldn't be wrong here either praise papa saint

1675
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:11,580
Anyway, uh, I don't want people to get the wrong idea and think anime club gfs are a bad idea all around

1676
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,140
Brothers

1677
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,380
His girlfriend get along really well. So

1678
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:21,820
It is possible. Yeah, we'll see about that. You know, don't don't rule it out entirely

1679
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:25,180
Yeah, but but yeah, I didn't say when

1680
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,620
Didn't last till February

1681
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,020
Didn't even last till christmas

1682
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,340
This is cause for celebration

1683
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:42,300
Yeah, everybody wins the problem was entirely in the framing you should and you don't go to anime club looking for a gf

1684
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,580
You go to anime club looking for a quick fuck. That's what you do

1685
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:50,380
You fucking pervert you go to anime club looking for anime for fuck's sake

1686
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

1687
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:59,420
I go to mia.si if i'm looking for anime. Uh, there's um indeed indeed. There's um, what was I gonna say?

1688
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:04,620
Something about oh, right. I mean, okay. Now that we're in where we're past relate. We're post relationship here

1689
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:08,140
It's time for the period of reflection. I mean obviously we never met this girl

1690
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:15,020
We didn't know the nature of the relationship the fact that you were so unceremoniously dropped at the end of the semester like

1691
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,940
We that just reveals that this relationship was obviously

1692
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:23,580
Nothing of substance. It was an it was an anime relationship. The worst time

1693
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,980
Inherently unstable like a like a like a radioactive isotope

1694
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:34,620
Exactly, although, you know, what what's his face the young brother harlock bronable is is keeping his life

1695
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:37,100
So good for him, but uh as far as we know

1696
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:42,380
So he left another message actually that uh, I'm over there playing but he was saying that like, you know

1697
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:47,580
Like what should I do about like my next relationship? I mean, I think you should you should reflect

1698
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:50,780
It sounded like this was his first relationship. Okay. I don't know

1699
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,860
You're like, whatever. I mean, he was saying like don't don't do anything. It's fine

1700
01:28:55,740 --> 01:29:01,180
He was asking questions like like how long should I wait? Is it weird to move on? Okay, like what this is feeling? No, it's fine

1701
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,260
Don't worry. Don't worry about anything

1702
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,420
Harlock and there's no shame in it. It's all good. But like obviously you don't know what you're doing here

1703
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,500
And that's fine. I forgive you for that

1704
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
But you forgive him

1705
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:15,260
Like yeah, he knew he obviously didn't understand the relationship

1706
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:19,500
He just had if it was so flimsy all along and was so easy for it to dissolve

1707
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:25,020
It sounds like you had much more emotional investment than she did if if you're like reflecting on like what do I do now?

1708
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:29,500
I mean did this man sound like he was that emotionally invested when he was making bets online about how long

1709
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:37,580
Maybe there's he's just beaming with pride. Um, who knows? Yeah, yeah, it's a mystery. Um, don't worry about it

1710
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,420
Whatever. Yeah, I mean, there's nothing to worry about here dawg. It's fine. Just do it again

1711
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:46,140
Yeah, you have come and go but anime club is absolutely right tom

1712
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:51,580
Harlock, yeah, don't overthink it. Obviously this relationship wasn't that big a deal to her. Keep going to anime club

1713
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,020
Yeah, don't let her win. Don't let her take anime club

1714
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,820
Don't let them see

1715
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,180
Anime club was always meant for me

1716
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:02,620
That's right

1717
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:06,700
You can meet your else out there. Oh, hey, have you guys seen frozen 2 or heard about it by any chance?

1718
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,220
No, I saw big Joel's video about it

1719
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:13,420
What what did he think? I'm curious. He I think he thought it was weird in a good way

1720
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:19,660
Michelle saw it yesterday. I wasn't there. She saw it. I'm kind of regret not seeing it with her

1721
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,180
I was just I'm a stream at the time or whatever

1722
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,580
But like she said it was weird and michelle

1723
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:29,260
She kind of loves frozen one and it was just like this was weird and like there was like superpowers and weird elemental things

1724
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:33,900
And they give the mom a weird backstory that was obviously not intended from the start

1725
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:38,940
Uh, a bunch of weird stuff seems like they took like the trailer blocking blockbuster ever

1726
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,740
and they fucking uh

1727
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:45,820
Went fucking weird weird bizarre place with it

1728
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:51,900
It was so clearly not intended for a sequel and part of the charm of like a big temple disney movie

1729
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:56,220
Is like like just for example, like I mean moana is a dope ass hawaii island movie

1730
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:00,620
Like there's a whole culture. There's like a bunch of like, you know songs relevant to the period and whatnot

1731
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:04,380
Obviously frozen was like, I don't know sweeten or whatever

1732
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:08,460
It's like themed around that old land and just like making a sequel is like, okay

1733
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:10,540
None so we don't get any new stuff like that

1734
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:15,020
They're just like adding details to characters that we didn't care about in the first place

1735
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,820
And they're trying to put together something that was never intended

1736
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:22,860
Trying to give characters arcs that don't do it. I'm just I'm hearing this whole second hand from michelle

1737
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:27,180
So I don't know what I'm talking about but like I mean line king two and a half one and a half

1738
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:31,820
Now there was a sequel for the ages that filled out characters. We cared about that we had deep connection with

1739
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,180
Uh, it did not fuck up the lore any in a serious way

1740
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:40,940
Uh, I'm I'm lying but they say line king two is good. You said that tom, right? You're a fan

1741
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:44,300
I thought I mean I watched it as a much younger

1742
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,180
Child but I remember enjoying it at the time

1743
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:52,780
You know, I'm still mad at those motherfuckers are trying to lie to us and pretend that that kid who's exactly looks like scar

1744
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:56,940
Isn't scar's son. It's the most retarded ass thing they've ever tried to come up with

1745
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:59,260
He's obviously scar's son

1746
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,340
The weirdest thing is that they have a new television show called the lion guard

1747
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,300
That entire movie never happened video about that

1748
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,340
I did

1749
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,740
You made it look like real tempting

1750
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:16,620
Uh, yeah, you may I was on

1751
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:23,740
I mean if you want to watch I there's apparently in like a later episode like the the character bongo

1752
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:28,620
Who's that like farting guy made a fart joke. They have like a love scene with farting. I like farting. No

1753
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:34,060
This I wish I was lying. I've been told second hand. I've not seen it, but this is what I've heard

1754
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:36,380
That's that's somebody's fucking

1755
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:43,340
Life's dream to see that brappers unite our people are being represented last like like wet dream

1756
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,460
Realized beyond their wildest imagination

1757
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:53,100
I mean sometimes right the animators fetishes leak through that's this is definitely an example of that

1758
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,740
Indeed we're all richer disgusting

1759
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:03,020
All right, that's one word for it. Uh, what do we got here? We got uh, uh nuzlocke deep lore

That goes for that was neoliberal scum team ron

1767

They think they're big and tough as long as they're in the root but get them alone and they're weak

1768
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,980
They will be crushed by my venture capitalist fingers

1769
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,620
I hate them all you say out of my way

1770

Wait, which is the second one. He's in joe. If only if only the president we need the president of joe so to fucking sign a bill

1781
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:44,860
Breaking up his monopoly

1782
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,740
Yeah, that's that's what I would vote for

1783
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,700
We uh, oh and also ben you should know

1784
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:57,260
My I think I didn't mention this last time that people tried to get you to be the rival in the uh, in the thing

1785
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:02,140
Yes, and fucking shan ruined it. That's right. Voice of god, and I remember I'm a hood hoot

1786
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:09,420
And I said just keep just keep hypnosising with ben saint the hood hoot and do not switch him out under any circumstances

1787
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,340
How did it go?

1788
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,580
Uh, you know, we I did switch some things out

1789
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:17,100
But uh, that that hypnosis has been extremely useful

1790
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,420
Hell and even catching all kinds of great pokes

1791
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:23,500
So ben saint the hood who's actually been putting in some good workforce over on the next lock

1792
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:29,020
So nothing could make me happier other than other than a heroic death that lets me go god tier

1793
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:36,060
That's inevitable. That's definitely inevitable. Don't let me fucking don't fucking let me die a cow like radaway and the cowards

1794
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:42,060

For this opportunity

1829
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:17,820
And I was just kidding a lot of there were a lot of great entries for the pcbator contest

1830
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:21,660
I'm not saying even if you are the anti-christian person

1831

1839
01:39:55,820 --> 01:40:00,460
You know, uh, you know a wrinkle in time remember when uh, I don't know that was a complicated book

1840
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,820
There's a lot of weird shit happening

1841
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:08,460
But at the end the girl tries to like love a thing that like can't handle love or something and it like makes it die

1870
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:30,540
So we'll see you in 2019. Hey if you're doing any you want to do any join us on our quest to

1871
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:34,140
Whatever fucking uh fitness or otherwise. Uh new year goals

1872
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:39,180
Bullshit make it make a man goals are tough. Make it time-bound. Just do something for a month, man

1873
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:42,860
Once you're there then see how you feel. Um, anyone can do anything for a month, right?

1874
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:48,220
I empower you to take the challenge whatever it is you're trying to do make it reasonable michelle michelle said

1875
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:53,660
I'm gonna read a hundred books next year. That's too high. Don't set it unrealistically. That's like two books a week

1876
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:55,900
It is

1877
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:58,620
Yeah, that's way too high like I mean she could do picture books or something small

1878
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:03,100
So you got to do like a book a week is even even that's probably too many when you said it was her

1879
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:05,180
I assume that's what she meant

1880
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:08,540
I mean she she had this idea in her head that I argued against so she's like

1881
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:13,580
But if I set the goal super duper high then like I'll get close and I'll still read tons of books

1882
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:16,220
I'm like that's not how goals work. Once you will fail and give up once you break

1883
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,940
Yeah, once you break the expectation of keeping the goal

1884
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:21,180
Yeah, exactly
