00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
You're actually sitting here and you are your own human life size meme. Tell me who you are. Well, I'm

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
here to tell you what it is. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use. It's no use.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,860
You know the rules! And so do I!

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,020
I need scissors. 61!

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,140
As I'm a digital cyberte-

6
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,620
An-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,420
No.

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,440
No.

9
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,420
No.

10
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,460
Hello and welcome to this week's episode of the Procrastinators podcast.

11
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,100
I am your host for the week, the best guy ever, and I'm here with my panel of American

12
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,340
heroes once again.

13
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
First is Digi Bro.

14
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,020
Hey, what's up motherfuckers?

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,340
We have a true Blue American Gibbentake.

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,340
I'm...

17
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I mean Hippocrite.

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm a large water dwelling mammal.

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,300
The DeVoo.

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,020
Yo.

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
And our special guest for the week is our good friend Munchy.

22
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,820
It's about time.

23
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,820
Munchy is a guy who worked with Digi way back in the day doing art for him and is an eccentric

24
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
character we met.

25
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
He still does all of that.

26
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,820
He does all of that.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,820
He does my avatars.

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Yeah.

29
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,820
Oh yeah, his avatars have always been Munchy.

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,820
I forgot about that.

31
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Yeah, that's awesome.

32
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,220
So his influence is felt to this very day.

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,140
And he's here to just talk about whatever.

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,340
So the subject of this week's, yeah, that brings us to the topic of this week's discussion

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,820
which is memes that need to die.

36
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,060
So yeah, you know, I've had a problem with the use of the term meme.

37
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,980
It's been really bastardized these days to mean funny image macros has become the definition

38
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,980
of meme.

39
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,980
And frankly, it's official now.

40
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,340
Like everyone uses it that way including me.

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,140
But the real definition is like an idea, it's like a little nugget thing that's like a consistent

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,140
joke or whatever.

43
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,860
And so we're going to talk about once the guy I go.

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,700
They are no longer welcome in this world.

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
So yeah.

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,740
So anybody who's got one to start us off.

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,940
Okay, I got a powerful one.

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,140
Munchy I believe has the big list.

49
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Okay, shoot, shoot.

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,860
The one that I have highlighted and underlined and circled is the meme that Pizza Hut is

51
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,460
bad.

52
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,580
People who think that Pizza Hut is bad need to fucking kill themselves.

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,820
Pizza Hut is a great bargain.

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,540
You can get delicious stuffed crust, cheese crust, and it's just there's like one right

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,780
next to my house.

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,060
It's fucking great.

57
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,980
And if you don't think so, then you need to leave.

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
You know what?

59
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm kind of with you on this.

60
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,980
I'm sure I'm not surprised at all by that.

61
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,260
Now is that in comparison to other pizza places, other speedy pizza places or just

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,780
No, no, just in general, we find it.

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,780
If you think that Pizza Hut is bad, bad food, then I think there's a problem with you.

64
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,220
And I think we need to take out your brain and put in a frog's brain.

65
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,900
Yeah, I can buy that.

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,820
I'm with you, man, because like, you know, I love pizza.

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,620
I would consider myself on some level a pizza like a fish and natto and stuff.

68
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,900
I go around, I eat pizza from all over the place and I don't, I don't like there are

69
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,260
pizza places I've been to that are legitimately disgusting where it's like I don't want to

70
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,100
eat this pizza ever again.

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,260
Pizza Hut does not fall into that category.

72
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,140
Sometimes I've gotten them and it hasn't been great.

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,340
They've got, you know, the pan pizza, that shit can start to like, if you eat enough

74
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,860
of those, it just starts like eating away at your throat.

75
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
I don't know what it is.

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
Oh, yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
They're very like, greasy, spongy stuff.

78
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,620
I mean, it tastes great, but it will eventually start to erode your.

79
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,580
Just after watching so much of H3H3 videos at their whole Papa John's thing, I had Papa

80
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,940
John's the other week and did not enjoy it very much.

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,220
Papa John's is not any better than the pizza.

82
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,100
I actually like Papa John's, but it's probably different.

83
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,300
Did they have those in England?

84
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Yeah, they have them.

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,300
I didn't know that.

86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Yeah, but they're really good at it.

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,300
I just came back and I feel like talking about food.

88
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Yeah, they got, I'm starving as well.

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
I just came back.

90
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,460
Well, I've been to, I just had to say I wanted to talk, I want to talk about Pizza Hut a little

91
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,060
bit more because I've been to Pizza Hut in the Philippines and it's a pretty interesting

92
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,220
experience because it's treated like a classy restaurant there because pizza is so expensive,

93
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,340
like comparatively, because it costs the same amount there as it does here, but their money

94
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,420
is worth like far less than ours.

95
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,740
So you know, trying to pay the same amount for a pizza is like going to a high-class

96
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
restaurant.

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,940
So like, I was going to say, getting them in Japan, like not only are they super expensive,

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,460
they're fucking tiny, they're tiny little things, they're not an American-sized pizza

99
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
for sure.

100
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,300
Because I ordered a medium one time and I was able to eat the entire thing by myself.

101
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,460
That's not something I can normally say of a medium-sized pizza.

102
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,460
That's because Asias are small though and we're big eats.

103
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
That's true.

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Okay, Gib, you got one.

105
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Oh, I do.

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,460
Get good.

107
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
G-I-T-G-U-D.

108
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,460
I actually consider this a my list as well.

109
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,460
Oh, really?

110
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,460
This is a Gib classic.

111
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,460
Well, I've always had a problem with this ever since it's really become a thing because

112
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,960
it sort of promotes the idea that if someone's having trouble, you should ridicule them for

113
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,540
it because it's not really used as, it's like the most aggravating way to say you can do

114
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,460
it, you know, which is what people would be saying, but it just makes everyone angry.

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,540
For example, I believe in the game that shall not be named when you were facing that really

116
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
hard boss at the end.

117
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,540
I believe I used the phrase get good numerous times and you were getting extremely angry.

118
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,540
Yes, I had a big rent at you for that.

119
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Well, I remember.

120
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,540
My biggest problem with the phrase get good is when it's used as a defense of criticism

121
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,260
because anytime you were to say like, man, this game sucks, everyone will say, you just

122
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
suck at it.

123
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
You're just not good.

124
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Like people, it's a defense mechanism for people who don't want to admit that there

125
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:12,180
might be like that other people even might find there to be a flaw in a game you like.

126
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,020
You just say, well, you're not, you're just not good at it, which I mean, in fairness,

127
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,380
if what you're saying is I'm not good at enjoying the game, then maybe you're right.

128
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,220
If that could be considered a skill, you know, I will come and say I'm bullshit.

129
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,060
And then the thing about that is, is just that like those people have almost always

130
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,700
like really immersed themselves in that game and they've invested the time in when it comes

131
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,380
to like games, you really get out of it when you put into it in terms of enjoyment.

132
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,500
So like you could play a game like Ground Zeroes, like for hundreds of hours, even though

133
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,820
you can beat it in like an hour and you're done, but like it's all about what do you

134
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
want to do.

135
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
So I'm with you though.

136
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
I'm with in general itself.

137
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,540
I just think it's a matter of like, I appreciate that those people can have fun with the game

138
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,980
that much, but it's like, it's like they're denying that there's other ways to play it.

139
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
You know, like.

140
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Yeah, I know what you mean.

141
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,620
How could you like, oh, you didn't enjoy it.

142
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,140
It just means you suck and your opinion is now invalid.

143
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,220
You know, I hear it more often when it's just like somebody's getting frustrated because

144
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
I get frustrated at games.

145
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,700
Everybody says it would like Dark Souls, for example, it's a Souls thing for me because

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:22,420
whenever I get annoyed at a thing and I, you know, I don't usually publicly say, I hate

147
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,980
this game because I suck at it because that's stupid.

148
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Why would you do that?

149
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,580
But, you know, if I ever see someone else getting told to get good, I'm just like,

150
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,780
it's just, it's really annoys me because yeah, it's pretty counterproductive.

151
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,020
I mean, it doesn't like mean anything.

152
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,820
It's yeah, it's just, I don't know.

153
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I don't know how to explain.

154
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,540
It's like, what do you, what do you expect me to do after you told me to get good?

155
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,060
Am I supposed to just now like, oh, okay, thanks.

156
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,940
I didn't realize I had to get good.

157
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,900
It's equivalent to you mad, bro.

158
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
It's just right.

159
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,940
It is, you know, I disagree a little bit because I'm a big believer in trial by fire

160
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,340
and I want people to get mad at games and get, and get, I want, I want them to experience

161
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,500
the, the Jesse Wood Demon Souls experience of like, no, I'm not going to let this game

162
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
fucking beat me.

163
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,060
And I like to think that get good is just one way, you know, there's different styles

164
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,260
of learning and stuff.

165
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,980
Like I, I think hippo, like myself, I think is effective on me for example.

166
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,780
I think it does fuel me in the right way.

167
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,180
I know hippo is in particular, hippo is very like contrarian in mindset like that of like,

168
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,700
like that kind of reverse psychology doesn't work on hippo because he's just going to get

169
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,180
mad at you and doubly not want to play the game.

170
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,780
And as for me, I'm more like, I just am so unaffected, like for me, a game has to appeal

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,100
to me and I don't feel any like narrative self with the game, you know, I guess with

172
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,620
Dark Souls a little bit because I love the game so much that I was willing to put myself

173
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,140
through learning it, you know, like, and that's why with Dark Souls three, I'm like,

174
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,180
trying to go in blind for once and like, be able to actually have like that experience,

175
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,580
but only because I'm already so invested in it that there's no way I'd ever not play

176
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,580
the game, you know, like there's, there's no convict.

177
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,980
Like if I complained that it was too hard and you said get good, like it wouldn't change

178
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,380
the fact that I was already playing.

179
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,700
And I just like to point out to everyone listening that this is proof that Digi's

180
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,220
stance on spoilers is not always the case.

181
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,060
He is now proving himself wrong.

182
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,420
Please don't go back this.

183
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,980
I believe me.

184
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,820
I suffer through that a lot.

185
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,500
Like I've watched that video multiple times.

186
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,060
I'm glad Munchie's around because Munchie's watched like every podcast I've ever been

187
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,020
in so he can anytime there's a topic he knows we've talked about too much.

188
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,380
He can step in and I guess we could say that.

189
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,500
Yeah, Munchie's wanted to be in one of these for a while.

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
So it's good.

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,060
Munchie has been in one of these.

192
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,860
It just hasn't come out yet.

193
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,820
Oh yeah, that's true.

194
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
That's true.

195
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,020
Maybe one day Ben will finish editing that thing.

196
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,100
He said he's working on it.

197
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,140
Yeah, he said he's fine with it.

198
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,260
OK, who's next?

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,180
I like all of you.

200
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,700
You got one?

201
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,620
Any of them should die.

202
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,140
I'm just here to be a contrarian.

203
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,340
I see.

204
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,420
That's glad to have that on board.

205
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,460
Who did you?

206
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Do you got one?

207
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,260
She's completely skip over him.

208
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Yeah, I guess if you're going to say good.

209
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,300
I like it in regards to when someone doesn't realize that there that skill is

210
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,060
even a relevant variable of the situation, you know, something like that.

211
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,380
Like, why the heck do girls like me something like that?

212
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,620
Do you think it's not their fault?

213
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,340
Hey, get good.

214
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,980
Like, oh, really?

215
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
It's me. OK.

216
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,460
Well, the view, you know, I suppose in that way that is true, I suppose.

217
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,580
The view, I think I think you're going to.

218
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,820
I think you're going to come back on your stance when I say the mean.

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,620
Yeah, I'm also I'm also here.

220
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,820
You're going to be open mind thinking, well, I can't think of any means

221
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,740
that needs to die, but now I'm here.

222
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,260
I think you're going to be really on my side.

223
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,900
Oh, the meme view.

224
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,340
There's a few and we're not.

225
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,060
We don't need to get too deep into this, because I've talked about it before.

226
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,860
But the meme of objective criticism, I guess if that's a mean,

227
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,700
I don't really.

228
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,460
Yeah, that's a good one.

229
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,100
Well, it's a cultural idea that we're going to use the traditional

230
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,980
definition and yeah, lots of them need to die.

231
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,380
But if we're talking about internet memes, that's a bait and switch.

232
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,420
You we're using we're using memes in the sense of how Jesse constantly

233
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,060
uses the phrase X is a meme that needs to die about literally.

234
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,140
Well, I thought that I trained him in those ways.

235
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,460
That was only so I kind of had the mindset this was just going to be like,

236
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,460
I mean, like the Pizza Hut not being good food.

237
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,260
Like that's not really like a meme meme, but it's like an idea.

238
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,780
It's an idea.

239
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,140
Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,260
It's something that a lot of people seem to agree with on the basis

241
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,220
that it's something other people have said a lot.

242
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Let's let's make that our definition of room for this.

243
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,140
Something that an idea that has been proliferated through culture

244
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,180
because of the fact that people keep saying it when it's not necessarily

245
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,140
that everyone like has come.

246
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,900
Like, I don't think most of the people saying Pizza Hut is bad

247
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,980
are like everyone individually coming to the conclusion that Pizza Hut is bad.

248
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,460
I think it's more of like, you know, that I think you guys would agree with.

249
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,060
It's it's something that I would like bring in as a problem

250
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,100
if I was ever a guest on the biggest problem, but it's kind of a big one.

251
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,540
So we can come back to me whenever you want.

252
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,660
I don't know, but I guess I'll just go and then we can do you after.

253
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,340
I could finish up my objective criticism.

254
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,020
Yeah, please. Go ahead. Go ahead.

255
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,420
And it's the reason I consider it a meme is that it's one of those things

256
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,900
that people throw at you, especially if you are a critic.

257
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,020
You get it in your comments.

258
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,300
You get it in your messages all the time.

259
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,700
And people use it like like that's just how it is.

260
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,660
Like people say this review is not very objective or like a good review

261
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,300
is supposed to be objective or just anything like any use of the phrase

262
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,140
objective in my comments.

263
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,460
I'm like, why? Why do you assume that's what I'm going for?

264
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,180
Or that that's what all criticism is or that that's even what the world is?

265
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,860
You know, well, I'm not prejudiced.

266
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,780
You know, I don't objectify games.

267
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,980
I think all games should be equal.

268
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,540
So my reviews, yeah, it's really problematic to have any kind of standard.

269
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,900
You know what I said in a comment or games?

270
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,940
They're all I said, just recently, he was like, you criticize roller coaster

271
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,300
three with your own subjective opinions.

272
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,460
And I was like, I think it's objectively true that this game annoys me.

273
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
There. Boom. That's all you have to say.

274
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,820
That is true. I cracked the code.

275
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,460
You see, you know, because did you just want to touch on this real quick?

276
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,060
Sometimes when we that's true.

277
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,300
Well, sometimes when we, you and I argue about subjectivity and objectivity,

278
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,780
I think the thing gets lost is that there really are some things that are objective

279
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,340
and they're kind of what Davoo was saying.

280
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,340
And they're sort of well, according to your subjective human observation

281
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,780
that now see that's not that's not true, because it is it is an undisputable fact

282
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,860
that I am thinking the thing that I'm thinking right now that that can't be

283
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,420
how do I know that?

284
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,180
Well, how can you know that I do know that I exist?

285
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,620
I know that for a fact.

286
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,700
You can't prove that I guess I sort of having the same thing that you normally

287
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,980
have that I know in regards to what is it?

288
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,500
Determinism, you guys have the opposite philosophy when it comes to that issue

289
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,700
about how if something can't be objectively proven, then it doesn't exist.

290
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,260
We actually we've sort of a new agreement on that, I think.

291
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,700
My position is that I am a fragment of Munchie's imagination.

292
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,340
You're welcome to that. You can do that.

293
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,700
I think my favorite hippo quote is the figment talks how I am thinking.

294
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,900
That's what he said about me one time for him.

295
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,420
No, I'm for him.

296
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,460
When did I say that?

297
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,140
He said it said it at Brodycon.

298
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,580
You're like, you talk how I think.

299
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,020
Oh, yeah, I don't wear that on my shirt.

300
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,700
It was cool. Oh, oh, I get it.

301
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,500
Because Munchie will just like smunch it out.

302
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,420
Oh, he's like, you know, he's like, you know, he's like, you know, the same thing.

303
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,380
Yeah. Well, he's the voice in his head.

304
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
That's brilliant.

305
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
All right, so let me let me throw one out there.

306
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,300
OK, here's a classic traditional meme

307
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,220
that that really needs to die.

308
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,660
OK, it's it's the overuse of the term Sempai.

309
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,180
It has been with you for rated to the point of absolute.

310
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,820
I hate every time I say and I really blame PewDiePie.

311
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,420
Not really not PewDiePie, but PewDiePie's audience, I think,

312
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,860
is the ones that made it happen because he's been using it for a while now.

313
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,540
And it's like it's like fucking like kids.

314
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,380
Use that explains me.

315
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,180
God, that explains so much

316
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,820
because I was really wondering how that became such a thing.

317
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,180
And if it's PewDiePie, I believe that really makes sense.

318
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,180
Because like it might have come directly through a yandere simulator.

319
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,300
I think was like the the thing that started it off.

320
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,900
Yeah, it's I mean, it's too recent, dude.

321
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Senpai obviously is just a Japanese word.

322
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,500
It's just a word. It's a word.

323
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,220
So what's weird about it is that, like, notice me, Senpai,

324
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,980
like people now talk about it like it's this unbelievably prolific

325
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,980
Jap like anime cliche and it never really has been like it's not a thing.

326
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,580
You hear a lot in anime.

327
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,100
Usually most characters are in the same grade.

328
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,020
There's not a ton of shows where like it's girls pining after their Senpai.

329
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,500
That's like like I can't even think off the top of my head of a good example

330
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
of a notice me Senpai show.

331
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,500
So like that's why it kind of got weird to me because people kept saying like,

332
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,540
haha, is this like one of those notice me Senpai anime?

333
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
Well, like what is that?

334
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
That's not a thing.

335
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,460
That's like, yeah, I'm sure there's one anime has, but it's not true.

336
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,260
I don't even care.

337
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,020
I don't even care how specific it is.

338
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,500
The problem isn't how specific it is.

339
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,860
The problem is the overuse and the way that like it's been

340
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,380
God, it's been completely ruined.

341
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,860
I cannot hear the word Senpai in anime anymore.

342
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm thinking of like the PewDiePie comments section.

343
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,220
It's a nice thing.

344
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,340
Notice me. Senpai is something that I you could possibly hear at like E3

345
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,940
by some really by some fucking.

346
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,580
Yeah, that's right.

347
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,580
That's right.

348
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,660
That's what it's totally like when like the marketing department

349
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,020
of a games company starts using that phrase like in their marketing.

350
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,380
That's when you know, you've got a dead meme on your hands.

351
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,020
And it's or there was a hot topic that said it as Maddox.

352
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,900
See, OK, that is right there.

353
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,100
Proof that is 100.

354
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,460
No, I didn't say that there was one.

355
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,140
I said if there was one, because that's Maddox.

356
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,620
That whole article about how when anything that makes it a hot topic

357
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,180
is officially a dead like yeah, yeah.

358
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,780
But yeah, I think with the Senpai thing, it's also weird because,

359
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,180
like you said, it's been used so much that it doesn't mean anything now.

360
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,940
And I think a lot of people use it to mean like like person

361
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,900
who is more popular than me.

362
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,300
Yeah, I do.

363
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,660
People on YouTube all the time that refer to like YouTube content creators

364
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,460
as their senpai, see it in my comments.

365
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,260
And I'm always like, do that shit.

366
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,740
I don't understand how I am your Senpai.

367
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,620
Like, where is the logical thread just that more people know who I am?

368
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,260
Does that make me an upperclassman?

369
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,660
Like, is it that I've been?

370
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,140
I think that makes enough sense.

371
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,260
Am I older than you?

372
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,100
What does it mean?

373
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,380
Where what makes me your Senpai?

374
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,420
You're better than no one did you, so it can't be that one.

375
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,860
That's true. That's true.

376
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,660
It's just I mean, it's understandable more when like

377
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,180
because we were making fun of Jeff for messaging

378
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,900
Demolition D and saying, yeah, right, which is something that people say

379
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,740
to Demolition D all the time and especially content creators.

380
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,180
And I see why he made himself look like a total scrub.

381
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Right. I get why content creators do it because we're like,

382
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,780
well, Demo has more subs than us and we kind of do the same thing as him.

383
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,940
So he's kind of like our Senpai.

384
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,780
I get that.

385
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,740
But there's people who will leave comments on his videos,

386
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,060
like, notice me, Senpai.

387
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,420
And it's like, in what way is he your Senpai?

388
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,420
What class are you in together?

389
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,980
You know, like, what school are you going to?

390
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,980
I don't know. All right.

391
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,220
Yeah, it's it's your body on a slightly different level about this than me.

392
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,540
But OK, we can both agree.

393
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,740
It's well, I'm annoyed on the level you are, too, that it's just everywhere.

394
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,500
But like, I also just I hate when there's memes

395
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,860
that don't have like a strong logical thread behind them.

396
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,780
Like when people start using it in context where it doesn't make sense anymore.

397
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,900
Yeah, like, hey, would you like a muffin?

398
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,740
For instance, Jesse, like Jesse keeps using the phrase

399
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,140
like you can't teach that.

400
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,900
And I still I still find it funny because he always uses it in a situation

401
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,980
where it's like, and you can't teach that.

402
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,980
And you're like, ah, because it's something that comes natural, you know.

403
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,260
But like, yeah, when if you started saying like everything you do,

404
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,620
you're like, oh, I just got a headshot.

405
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,780
You can't teach that.

406
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,820
And it's like, what the fuck?

407
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,700
No, you can teach that. You can teach that.

408
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,420
Now, see, I kind of like that one.

409
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,260
I just got an A on my test.

410
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,180
And you can't that's why it's still pure.

411
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,460
You still like it because you haven't heard it that much

412
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,020
because Jesse's the only one really doing it all the time.

413
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,500
That's true.

414
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,580
In fact, the mere discussion of these would have any small meme

415
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,980
is only going to make it worse.

416
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,380
So perhaps we're doing a disservice to the world by just coming to rules, too, by the way.

417
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,740
Yeah, don't I.

418
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,300
Well, we already covered ironic comments or commenting things we don't want to hear

419
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,020
is a banable offense, so don't do it.

420
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,580
I want to go for a shadow man.

421
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,140
Shitposting. Oh, by the way, just to alleviate

422
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,900
maybe some of the concerns of our audience, I think we've only banned

423
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,980
like one guy on this channel.

424
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,620
And it's like, I'm pretty sure the only person who's been banned

425
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
was the guy who said that Jesse should be removed.

426
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,380
Now that they know if no one responds to them, they might be shadow banned.

427
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
They're living in fear all the time.

428
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,140
They just don't know what I would do is I would have a friend of mine

429
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,260
comment on one of my comments just to know if it was happening.

430
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,940
So if you're living in that fear, I mean, you should you should be afraid from now on.

431
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,740
But I think people were worried that we were already banning people

432
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,220
before like warning them about the comment to rules.

433
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,300
And it's like, no, we gave you some leeway for now.

434
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,860
But when that guy said, why can't you like, why don't you ban Jesse from the podcast?

435
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,980
That was when we I think that's the only guy we ban.

436
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,460
That's no good because because he didn't seem to understand

437
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,660
that Jesse also has access to the channel.

438
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,460
He broke so many rules with that one comment.

439
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,780
Yeah, it's it's no good.

440
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,140
Well, that's it for mine. Who's got another one?

441
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,660
Oh, Munchy, I'm sure you've got more.

442
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,700
I have a ton of more. OK, let me pick.

443
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,420
OK, OK, SJW slash Tumblr.

444
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,660
Core, I wanted Jesse to be here for this.

445
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,540
This also was on my potential list.

446
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,740
Yeah. OK, all right.

447
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,540
Go on. If you see a show that has a cal arts

448
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,980
art style and any like when I say that something comes in your head,

449
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,580
if you like Steven Universe is what you're talking about.

450
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,740
Yeah. Yeah.

451
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,300
If you see in public, a disgusting Steven Universe.

452
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,220
Yeah, being public cat shit.

453
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,060
And your first reaction is to just collect Tumblr core.

454
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,100
Then I think I need to put you down on the ground.

455
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,740
I need to put you into space.

456
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,540
I think your head needs to come off your shoulders.

457
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,420
I think I need to do some bodily harm to you.

458
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,580
That's so that's fair.

459
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,780
That's very fair, Munchy, because I also am extremely angry

460
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,700
when people dismiss a show like that just for its art style

461
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,740
without giving it a fair shake.

462
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,060
And it doesn't fucking mean anything. It's nothing.

463
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,540
Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.

464
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,820
I mean, the thing about Tumblr is that like it's a social media on

465
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,580
if you look at it on a broad enough scale, everything is Tumblr core

466
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,140
because there's there's Tumblr fans of literally everything.

467
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,940
You know, there's blogs for anything.

468
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,900
Most porn could easily be considered Tumblr core

469
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,340
because there's so much porn tumblers out there that like,

470
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,340
you know, Jesse is apparently here.

471
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
Bring him in. Oh, good.

472
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,140
Let's let's invite him in.

473
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,540
He needs to be a part of this particular problem.

474
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,700
Agreed. I need to brush my teeth.

475
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,260
OK, but, you know, just to clarify, I think when people say this,

476
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,860
I think they're mostly talking about the intersection between

477
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,100
like the SJW core and the Tumblr core.

478
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,140
I think that's the thing that comes to Jesse, Jesse, we're talking about

479
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,460
memes that we do die.

480
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,020
And the current meme is people calling stuff Tumblr core based on its art style.

481
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Yeah, so I got a meme for you.

482
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,620
I got I got a meme that needs to die.

483
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,700
Yeah, us doing these at four in the fucking afternoon.

484
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,860
Oh, yeah, because four in the afternoon is such an inconvenient time.

485
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,420
It's the most inconvenient time. Who would be awake if you do it at a respectable hour?

486
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,700
Like four in the morning when I'm awake.

487
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,020
Jesse, you're recording, right?

488
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,540
Cool. Can I point out that memes that need to die

489
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,940
is itself now a meme is being more than wanting it to non-internet memes.

490
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,020
We're just applying it to society in general.

491
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,660
No, no. No, no.

492
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,060
This means works.

493
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,980
Me and Jesse have been using it back and forth for a while.

494
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,060
And that's been a great meme.

495
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,980
And that's why I already accused X meme needs to die of being a meme

496
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,380
that needs to die on a previous podcast.

497
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,940
And then I made a comment, I think in the chat.

498
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,780
I think you said that in the chat as well.

499
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,340
I made a comment that that was a meme that needed to die.

500
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,300
And then what I said you did, but those are all funny goofs

501
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,100
because I love this meme and I don't want it to die.

502
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,340
I made this podcast and it might become one.

503
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,620
I need this meme to die because of the fact that Jesse says it so much

504
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,820
that now it's like it's in my head all the time.

505
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,380
Every time I get mad at anything on the internet, I'm like,

506
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,460
just fucking this meme needs to die.

507
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,060
Or like, I've been walking around my house.

508
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,500
I've like opened the fridge and there's no milk.

509
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,700
And I'm like, this whole not having any look at your page to die.

510
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,940
You passed it by a car.

511
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,100
Well, we'll get into that.

512
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,900
It isn't me that needs to die.

513
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,100
Having higher patronage than me.

514
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,620
I just surpassed you by a dollar.

515
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,460
Four videos you've made.

516
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,340
Oh, I'm I'm raking up the page around, baby.

517
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh, yeah, come slash Ben, saying yeah.

518
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,100
Yeah, it's my catch.

519
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,980
Actually, Ben just made a great catchphrase and no one should steal it.

520
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,340
It's mine. It's the best meme.

521
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,540
It's the name.

522
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,020
It's a meme I need to list for a hundred years.

523
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
We do need to talk about Ben Saints,

524
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,940
Patreon, though, because he just made this amazing Brunswick comic

525
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,140
and has no new patrons.

526
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Oh, well, it's Pokemon.

527
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,340
Everyone go to Ben, no, SaintComics.com,

528
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,980
patreon.com, Ben, Saint, go read it, go watch it.

529
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,500
It's another story.

530
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,420
It's really cool.

531
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,300
If you like Pokemon, if you people like Pokemon,

532
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,140
which I know you do, if you're watching this,

533
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,700
go to Ben, SaintComics.com, read this comic.

534
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,500
It's a really touching and emotional short story

535
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,940
that is really cool and well drawn.

536
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,460
And he gained he gained more views on it

537
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,140
than anything he's made ever, but no patrons at all.

538
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,940
So who even gives a shit?

539
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Right. No one.

540
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,980
I start the comic as the right.

541
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,380
So the meme that we're on is Tumblr for.

542
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,020
Munchy and SJW.

543
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,340
Good old Munchwick.

544
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,300
Yes. OK.

545
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,780
But we can let's we can move on.

546
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,900
I think we all get the gist.

547
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,340
Yeah, I got all right.

548
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,780
Here's that one.

549
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,140
Neutrality worship.

550
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,860
Ding, applause, applause, applause.

551
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,620
Neutrality worship. All right.

552
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,780
No, no, you fuck you get right out of here.

553
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,660
Oh, because that's that's pure Jesse.

554
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,820
That's pure Jesse right there.

555
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,780
Oh, it's cool to not give a shit about anything.

556
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,140
Neutrality is the best light.

557
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,660
It's the it's the one true path in life.

558
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,860
It's the only thing that makes sense.

559
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,300
I don't think Davoo's talking about

560
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,140
neutrality as in like, I don't care about anything.

561
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,020
He's talking about when when people

562
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,300
when there's two opposite two opposing sides on an issue

563
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,460
and everyone's like, oh, shouldn't we just meet somewhere in the middle?

564
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,700
That's obviously where the answer is when sometimes it's obviously where the answer is.

565
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,420
To say anything else is fucking retarded.

566
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,620
Oh, Jesse.

567
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,500
So you're you're you're if I say the two plus two is

568
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,660
you say to the problem with society is the other guys, right?

569
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,820
It's always the other team.

570
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,860
We got it. They're the ones making everything bad for everyone.

571
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,100
That's so fucking childish and stupid.

572
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,820
It's such baby logic.

573
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,860
Oh, we got it. No, you're wrong, Jesse.

574
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,100
You're dead wrong on this.

575
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
You've been for a while. Can I ask you guys a question?

576
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,420
Hey, Jesse, what's your stance on spoilers?

577
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,020
Don't don't don't.

578
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,820
What? I don't give a shit about spoilers.

579
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,580
Oh, that's so big of you.

580
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,620
That's so big of you to not give a shit, Jesse.

581
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,460
You're really the better man here.

582
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
No.

583
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,660
These fucking idiots, all 10 of them tried ganging up on me about

584
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,660
neutrality warship and not letting me explain what my actual point was,

585
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,260
not letting me get a word in.

586
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,660
And I was arguing with these morons for like 20 minutes before I realized

587
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,260
the recording had fucked up and none of it was even recorded.

588
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
So screw you.

589
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,060
I'm editing this and now you're going to listen to me, motherfucker.

590
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,660
These stupid fucking jackoffs.

591
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
They're all circle jerking about.

592
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Neutrality warship is bad.

593
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,660
What about you have a stance on spoilers?

594
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
You obviously have a stance on something.

595
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,660
Yeah, great point, Digi.

596
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
That's not what I was fucking saying at all.

597
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,660
Has nothing to fucking do with my point.

598
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,660
Nobody is actually fucking listening to my point because they're all fucking

599
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,660
circle jerking and talking over each other and not letting me get a word

600
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
in edgewise.

601
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,660
This podcast is fucking terrible.

602
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
I hate these idiots.

603
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
They're not my friends.

604
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
They were never my friends.

605
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,660
I fucking quit the band forever.

606
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,660
I hate them.

607
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
They're fucking...

608
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,660
Oh my God.

609
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,660
It's so fucking impossible to even communicate in this stupid podcast

610
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:07,660
that we've created, that we've birthed through some vile satanic fucking ritual.

611
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,660
It never should have been created in the first place.

612
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,660
The PCP was a mistake.

613
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
It's nothing but trash, okay?

614
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,660
You put like eight of us in these fucking podcasts, which makes us all have

615
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,660
to fucking talk over each other and nobody can get a fucking word in edgewise.

616
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
It's finally you're talking.

617
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,660
When you're finally talking, you're fucking no.

618
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,660
You know that you're going to be interrupted.

619
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,660
So you have no choice but to get all...

620
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,660
You get all muddled up and you fucking have to scream your point.

621
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,660
And it just turns into a goddamn screaming clusterfuck.

622
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
I hate these idiots.

623
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Oh my God.

624
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,660
They're sitting there.

625
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,660
They're not listening to what I was actually fucking saying about neutrality, okay?

626
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,660
DeVu brings in neutrality worship as a problem, as a meme that needs to die.

627
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
Oh, people.

628
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Neutrality worship is not a fucking problem, and this is my fucking point.

629
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,660
Neutrality demonization is a fucking problem, okay?

630
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Everybody thinks that you fucking have to have an opinion on everything.

631
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,660
Everybody thinks that you have to go out and vote for a rigged system that doesn't represent you.

632
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,660
If you don't vote, then you can't complain.

633
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,660
You're either a liberal or a conservative.

634
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,660
You're either a feminist social justice warrior, or you're an MRA neckbeard.

635
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
You're either one thing or the other thing.

636
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
You can't be anywhere in between.

637
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,660
There's no such thing as a nuanced issue anymore.

638
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Everything has to be black and white.

639
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,660
That's how much discourse has devolved.

640
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,660
That's how much people have fucking devolved.

641
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,660
Because they shame you for not picking a fucking side on everything.

642
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
They shame you for neutrality.

643
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,660
They shame you for apathy.

644
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,660
They shame you for being rational and seeing both sides of an issue.

645
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,660
And you know what that does?

646
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,660
It just folds over in on itself, and it compounds the issue and makes everything worse.

647
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:57,660
Because what it does is it encourages people who don't really have an interest in the topic,

648
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
or don't really understand the topic.

649
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,660
Well, they can't just sit on the sidelines.

650
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
They can't just, you know, think about it.

651
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
They have to pick a fucking side.

652
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,660
So you have all these uneducated fucking people who don't really know anything about the issue at hand,

653
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,660
who just need to pick a fucking side because that's what society expects of you now.

654
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,660
They'll fucking shame you if you don't have a fucking team behind you backing you up

655
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,660
with a big fucking foam finger that says,

656
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
Yeah, we're number one.

657
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,660
Fuck the other guys.

658
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
The other guys are at fault.

659
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
Kill the opposing team.

660
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,660
And it just encourages stupid people to start shouting each other down.

661
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
And it rewards that.

662
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,660
And it pedestalizes stupid people.

663
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,660
It pedestalizes idiocy.

664
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,660
And it shames intelligence because the intelligent people,

665
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,660
nine times out of ten, are the ones who aren't picking a fucking side.

666
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
They're the ones thinking critically,

667
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,660
but God forbid anyone think critically about anything

668
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,660
before jumping head first into the current socio-political debate.

669
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,660
We gotta get that fucking debate live and televised for everyone

670
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,660
with their fucking popcorn and their fat-gaping maws

671
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,660
while we watch the country tear itself apart from the inside out

672
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
because nobody can fucking be neutral anymore.

673
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,660
It's not politically correct to be neutral anymore.

674
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
You have to pick a fucking side.

675
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Pick it now.

676
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
You fucking maggots.

677
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,660
You brainwashed, simple-minded, knee-jerking shitlords.

678
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
Fucking demonized rationality.

679
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Demonized intelligence.

680
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Pedestalized ignorance.

681
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Pedestalized knee-jerking.

682
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,660
What are you fucking doing when you boo-hoo and whine and cry

683
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
about neutrality worship?

684
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,660
You know, every time there's a fucking issue in this country,

685
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,660
every time there's a fucking debate, what inevitably happens?

686
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,660
It ends up boiling down into two opposing, warring tribes of fucking shit-slinging apes

687
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
with nothing to fucking say.

688
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Two screaming tribes of extremists on either side

689
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,660
drowning out the rational, logical, cool-headed people in the fucking middle.

690
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Every single time, that's the fucking problem.

691
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
That's the meme that needs to die.

692
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
And you go, well, wait a minute.

693
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Maybe we can sort of see where both sides are coming from

694
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,660
and kind of come to like a rational compromise.

695
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
Maybe the solution is more in the middle.

696
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
Maybe it's not on one of these two opposites.

697
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Oh, no, that's neutrality worship.

698
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Oh, God forbid someone be too neutral.

699
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,660
God forbid anyone not be a fucking extremist.

700
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,660
The whole fucking world has turned into a bunch of idiotic zealots

701
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,660
who can't wait to shove their bullshit down each other's throats

702
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
and shout each other down.

703
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Oh, but apathy is somehow the problem, right?

704
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
You stupid fucking swine.

705
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
You make me sick.

706
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,660
You're fucking perpetuating this problem with your bullshit neutrality worship.

707
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,660
It's a meme that needs to die.

708
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
God damn it!

709
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Bunch of fucking idiots.

710
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Oh, you don't think neutrality worship is a problem?

711
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,660
So that means that you just think that you have to be neutral on everything

712
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
and not care about anything.

713
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Would you stand on spoilers then, huh?

714
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,660
You obviously have a stance that...

715
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
God damn it, you fucking idiots.

716
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
Fuck you, Davoo.

717
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Fuck your shitty problem.

718
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
It's not a meme that needs to die.

719
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
It's a meme that there needs to be more of.

720
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Neutrality demonization is a meme that needs to die, buddy.

721
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,660
You're a meme that needs to die.

722
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
You all need to die because you're stupid.

723
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
This whole thing is stupid.

724
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,660
This whole podcast, all of you, all of my friends are stupid.

725
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

726
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,660
Anyways, now back to the podcast.

727
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,660
I got the meme.

728
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,660
Okay, what's the meme?

729
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
It's the meme, Gib.

730
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,660
No, no, no, Davoo, no, Dave.

731
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,660
Dude, how big is Bernie Sanders' dick, dude?

732
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
Yeah.

733
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,660
Go on, Gib, Gib, please.

734
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,660
The meme that needs to die the most is conflict.

735
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
I'm sick of it.

736
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
I understand all of this.

737
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
You fucking idiots.

738
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Okay, you know what?

739
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,660
Alright, let me spin off this into one thing that's not really...

740
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Guys, wait, my recording stopped like 10 minutes ago.

741
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
No, no!

742
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Just start it now, just start it now, whatever.

743
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
We'll figure something out.

744
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,660
We'll just cut that entire obnoxious argument out of the episode.

745
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
We can do that, we can do that.

746
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
No, that wasn't obnoxious.

747
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
We can do it over and over again.

748
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
What do you want, Jesse? What are we supposed to do?

749
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660
The meme that now needs to die is mistakes.

750
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
We have to fucking...

751
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
This podcast needs to die.

752
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
No, we can't. We're not doing that.

753
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,660
My name's Endless Jess and I hate all people who don't...

754
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
Alright, Jesse, Jesse, are you recording now?

755
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Are you recording now?

756
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
I was recording. It wasn't my fault.

757
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
It stopped itself. My computer, all computers.

758
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Computers are a meme.

759
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Alright, we're not hearing any of this because I don't know if you're recording or not yet.

760
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Are you recording now?

761
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Yeah, probably.

762
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Computers are a meme.

763
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Okay, let's just sync it up real quick. Let's say one, two, three, fuck.

764
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Okay, one, two, three, fuck.

765
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
We're gonna just cut out my...

766
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Alright, we're good.

767
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Well, what else can we do?

768
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Anything else? The whole argument was predicated on everyone arguing and Jesse's part is gone.

769
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,660
We have to cut that entire probably 20-minute section.

770
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Well, my board was the only part that matters, so I'll just re-record it myself.

771
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Re-record it yourself and then add it in.

772
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,660
You'll be able to say whatever you want. You'll be able to make me look retarded.

773
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,660
It'll be funny. Go for it. Who cares? That sounds funny.

774
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,660
Okay, let me move on from that. Let's spin off to this because I got one that's related.

775
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,660
I got a big meme that needs to die, and it's the meme that children are people, okay?

776
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,660
The children are people. That is a total meme. It's not true.

777
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,660
You are not a human being until you're like 25.

778
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,660
And that's why I think that the abortion should be extended until 18.

779
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
I would have bought an 18-year-old who is not working outright.

780
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
I think that's totally fine.

781
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,660
I don't see any problem with that because they're not people and they don't matter.

782
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
It's just like putting down a dog, you know?

783
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
It's a job that you just had to do.

784
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,660
I know. It's a sad name for you, my friend, but that's just the way that cookie crumbles.

785
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Exactly. You guys just got to restart this whole operation.

786
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,660
You're not managing the crowd here very well. You're not really doing well on getting people on your side.

787
00:36:52,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Now, Sam, I'm trying to create a discussion here because I think you guys can agree that children aren't people and they don't matter.

788
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,660
I think...

789
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,660
Oh, here's neutrality worship again.

790
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,660
Forget the whole abortion thing.

791
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Forget the abortion thing.

792
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,660
When I do it, it's matter.

793
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,660
It's the right of all society, but everyone else can do it.

794
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
And it's just a solution, right?

795
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
I told you from the beginning it was a solution.

796
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,660
Jesse's ranting about stuff that we had to cut from the podcast.

797
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,660
The only point that I wanted to make is the crux of this issue.

798
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
The reason that...

799
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,660
You wanted to cut out my part because you knew that I was right.

800
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:40,660
The reason why I'm not laughing at your whole position about 25 being the age that you can't get murdered is because I just know that we're just...

801
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
That's going to be an actual debate 15 years from now.

802
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Oh, it's not murder. It's abortion.

803
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
And I can't wait for it.

804
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,660
I'll be an old man, and so it will matter to me.

805
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,660
And children, we all know children don't matter.

806
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
Because you're over 50.

807
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,660
That's fine. I'm not really opposed to the idea that...

808
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,660
If you really become a burden on everyone...

809
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Actual societies in our world actually do approve of this kind of thing.

810
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,660
It's different periods of time, and I just know it's probably going to be a thing.

811
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,660
It's probably going to be a real thing here in America in like 100 years or something.

812
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,660
And so it's an actual thing that happens for some reason, even though it should be,

813
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,660
even though I'm the person with that kind of humor, it's just not funny to me.

814
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Dang it.

815
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,660
Well, let me tell...

816
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
My real argument...

817
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,660
The real point I'm making here is the meme of children's opinions mattering.

818
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Because there is nothing I give less of a shit about than what someone under

819
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,660
probably 21 at the earliest thinks about anything.

820
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,660
I agree with that. They don't matter.

821
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
Everyone under 25 is...

822
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,660
In my opinion, anyone over a day or under 120 who's not me,

823
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
I don't give a shit about their opinions. How about that?

824
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
Just listen to their opinion, and if it's retarded, dismiss it.

825
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,660
This is a real position. I want to legislate based on this.

826
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,660
I want it to be so parents are always right. Children's are always wrong.

827
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
I don't care. You got a kid crying like,

828
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Oh, mommy, mommy, beat me up last night.

829
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I'm covered in bruises like, shut the fuck up kid. Nobody gives a shit.

830
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,660
And we all reiterate the fact that Munchie is like 16, by the way.

831
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
No.

832
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,660
I forgot.

833
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,660
Yes, we can. Munchie, how old are you now? You're 15?

834
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,660
You're 15? You fucking liar.

835
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,660
That's no way that's true. You're like 7 feet tall.

836
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
He's got his repeater files.

837
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Oh, shit. Oh, I'm sorry.

838
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,660
No, it's because Munchie is fucking Steven Universe,

839
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
so he's not aging properly. That's true.

840
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
He's the problem. He's 25, at least.

841
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
You gem things are all out of wave.

842
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Except that...

843
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Except that Munchie actually looks 25,

844
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
whereas Steven Universe... He really does.

845
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
...the idea is that he looks like a child.

846
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
What is Steven Universe?

847
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
I don't even fucking know. He's me.

848
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Nobody knows. He's him.

849
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
I'm somewhat...

850
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
I'm somewhat with you on this, Nate,

851
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,660
but I don't know where you're hearing this idea

852
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
that children need to be listened to.

853
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
I came up with it.

854
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
I have not heard people...

855
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
People listen to what children say about anything.

856
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
I think that's a mistake.

857
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
When do people do that?

858
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,660
When parents do what their children ask.

859
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
That's a problem.

860
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
I have a weird...

861
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,660
I feel uncomfortable talking to younger people

862
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,660
unless they like...

863
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,660
I can talk to Munchie, because Munchie...

864
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Oh, God, my fucking window farting.

865
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
What the fuck was that shit?

866
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
It was my window farting.

867
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
Well, yeah, window farting.

868
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Yeah.

869
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
Anyway...

870
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Fuckin' dirty Sanders just came in here

871
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,660
and got a fucking...

872
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,660
He got a quick promo on that.

873
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Got a fresh political fart.

874
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,660
I can talk to someone like Munchie,

875
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,660
because Munchie has expressed himself in a way

876
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,660
that is similar enough to an adult

877
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,660
and understands where his limitations are

878
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,660
in terms of how much he knows.

879
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
I've talked to Munchie and had the impression

880
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,660
that you understand that maybe there's some things

881
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,660
you don't know about the world

882
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
and don't have an opinion on,

883
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
but there's other things you do,

884
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,660
and you tend to talk about things you know,

885
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,660
and I think that's cool.

886
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
I talk to some teenagers sometimes

887
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
who act like they believe they are already adults,

888
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,660
and it really feels weird to me,

889
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,660
because I can see all the gaps.

890
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
I can see...

891
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,660
When a teenager talks to me, I know it's a teenager.

892
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,660
There's no disconnect where I'm like,

893
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660
oh, wow, you really sound like an adult,

894
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,660
but they'll talk about issues and stuff

895
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
like they're an adult, and I'm like,

896
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
how do you even talk about this?

897
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,660
You have not experienced this yet.

898
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,660
People thinking they know more than they do.

899
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Regardless of their age, just make that the rule.

900
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,660
Like, hey, only say stuff that you actually know about.

901
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Don't pretend to know what you don't know.

902
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,660
Just be fine with being ignorant.

903
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Or at least admit that you don't...

904
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,660
Say something like, hey...

905
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Look, I have seen people who are 90 million years old

906
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,660
and are ignorant about things, but they don't realize it.

907
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,660
This is something that applies to all ages.

908
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Maybe it's just not equally,

909
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,660
but there's plenty of old people who just get really set in their ways.

910
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,660
It's more so when it's...

911
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,660
When it's a young person,

912
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,660
it's more usually that they don't realize that

913
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,660
reading about it and hearing about it

914
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,660
doesn't mean that they know as much as everyone else.

915
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,660
Well, also just that like...

916
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
I've seen a lot of head ties, so I know how to pick up girls.

917
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
Alright, good man.

918
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,660
The thing about teenagers to me...

919
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
You trip over a stick, you crash a rounder into a corner,

920
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,660
your penis enters the vagina as it happens, you know?

921
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
That's just how it goes down.

922
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
You take responsibility.

923
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
I know the thing that makes me...

924
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
God damn it.

925
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
The thing that makes it harder for me to listen to teenagers

926
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
talk particularly about their problems

927
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
and thoughts on the world, like broader stuff.

928
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,660
Well, not that they don't matter,

929
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,660
but that they're gonna change not too long from now.

930
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,660
I know that for me,

931
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
graduating high school,

932
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,660
I considerably changed my mindset about the world,

933
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,660
because once you have freedom

934
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,660
to do whatever the fuck you want,

935
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
even if you just go to college,

936
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
as soon as you get that freedom,

937
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
it immediately starts changing the way you think about stuff,

938
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,660
because you just have such different concerns,

939
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,660
and it broadens your scope of what things matter to you.

940
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
As a teenager, politically,

941
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,660
you might be interested in a lot of social issues

942
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,660
and have no interest in economic issues, for instance.

943
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,660
Whereas once you're an adult,

944
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,660
economic issues immediately affect you.

945
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,660
And I think DeVu would agree

946
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,660
that he would love to hear more people concerned

947
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,660
about economic issues.

948
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,660
But I think as a teenager,

949
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,660
I hear them talk about stuff that's like,

950
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,660
I just don't understand why people act this way,

951
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,660
and I'm like, once you're out of high school,

952
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,660
nobody acts that way.

953
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
People are so phony, dude.

954
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,660
People are so phony all the time.

955
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
I'm the only one who's real.

956
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,660
I'm not bad that often,

957
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
but when people talk about their issues,

958
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,660
I'm like, there's so many problems that you can have

959
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,660
that you will just simply grow out of,

960
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,660
especially artistically.

961
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,660
People not knowing what they want to do artistically.

962
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,660
Once you turn 20,

963
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,660
and you've been out of school for a little while,

964
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,660
then it becomes a pressing issue.

965
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,660
I don't know. I think that may not be the case.

966
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,660
I know people who are 20-something

967
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,660
and still are stuck in that mindset.

968
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,660
Dude, when I was 22,

969
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,660
I had no idea what I wanted to do.

970
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,660
It wasn't a matter of your development

971
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,660
as much as a situation that arose

972
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,660
or just certain things that happened to you.

973
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,660
What was the band that did that song?

974
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
High school never ends.

975
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,660
The whole point of that song is actually,

976
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,660
I can't wait to be out of these problems

977
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,660
and these stupid issues and these stupid people,

978
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,660
but then I graduate high school and everything's still the same.

979
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,660
So I guess it's bullshit.

980
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,660
It really depends on what stuff you're referring to.

981
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,660
Because I have a friend who's in the military

982
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,660
and he's always like, this is just high school all over again.

983
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,660
Yeah, the people might be like high school

984
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,660
and I remind you of that,

985
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,660
but your concerns are not the same.

986
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,660
Your monetary concerns,

987
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,660
when you're in the military,

988
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,660
are not the same as high school.

989
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
You're not thinking about,

990
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
let's say you get really emotional

991
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
because a girl dumped you.

992
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,660
In high school,

993
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,660
that's the most important thing going on in your life

994
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,660
because everything else is just happening automatically.

995
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
When you're in high school,

996
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,660
unless you're really bad at school

997
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,660
and you do lots of extra stuff to even make it through,

998
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,660
or if you're really someone who takes school so seriously

999
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,660
and you're getting the straight A's

1000
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,660
and doing all the extracurricular stuff

1001
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
and then you're kind of an overachiever,

1002
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,660
for most people high school is autopilot

1003
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,660
because the next day will always come

1004
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
and you'll always know what you have to do.

1005
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,660
You always go in,

1006
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
you're always there for seven hours,

1007
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,660
for most people they have a home to come back to.

1008
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,660
So the things that matter the most to you

1009
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,660
are the things outside of everyday life upkeep.

1010
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,660
Whereas as soon as you're out of high school

1011
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,660
that's the most important thing

1012
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,660
is how the fuck am I going to make enough money

1013
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,660
to pay my rent this month

1014
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,660
and everything else is secondary.

1015
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
Getting broken up with a girl,

1016
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,660
it sucks but it's not nearly as important

1017
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,660
as going to work.

1018
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
All that is true, I just want to clarify

1019
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,660
that my point initially was just that

1020
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,660
their opinions on bigger ideas

1021
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,660
and when they think that those matter

1022
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,660
I think that this ties into it because

1023
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,660
they're educated.

1024
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,660
Because once you're an adult and you have

1025
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,660
this grounded worldview

1026
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,660
then that means a little bit.

1027
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,660
I think the meme that needs to die is anyone

1028
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,660
thinking that their opinion matters

1029
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,660
or that they should give a shit.

1030
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,660
Anyone who hasn't lived

1031
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
my exact amazing life

1032
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
is a fucking moron

1033
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,660
and should go away.

1034
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,660
If you want to see an example,

1035
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,660
just go watch Manshild Marsh.

1036
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,660
If you're not actually me

1037
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,660
then you have no real experience

1038
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660
with anything.

1039
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Oh.

1040
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,660
Oh.

1041
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
I'm sorry.

1042
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,660
I love giving disappointment.

1043
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,660
Oh, oh no.

1044
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,660
Hi Hippo, you got another meme.

1045
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,660
I'm not Jesse.

1046
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,660
Hey everybody, I'm interrupting the podcast again

1047
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,660
because I was thinking about what I said

1048
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,660
that last time I interrupted the podcast

1049
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,660
with my little rant about neutrality demonization

1050
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,660
and I realized maybe I was a bit too hard

1051
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,660
on the DeVoo.

1052
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,660
I mean, we're all friends here,

1053
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,660
there's no reason for me to speak so harshly

1054
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,660
and so I decided to bring the DeVoo

1055
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,660
on here for a special

1056
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,660
one-on-one segment

1057
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,660
wherein he will

1058
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
explain more about what he means by neutrality

1059
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,660
worship.

1060
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,660
Of course it was nobody's fault that the recording stopped

1061
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,660
and the world did not get

1062
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,660
to hear our exciting debate the first time

1063
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,660
but no matter because I feel it's better

1064
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,660
to present these kinds of nuanced issues

1065
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,660
one at a time anyways.

1066
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,660
It's a much better forum than

1067
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,660
having five or six of us all yelling over each other

1068
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,660
at once so hello DeVoo

1069
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,660
and welcome to the

1070
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,660
special interrupting the podcast

1071
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,660
podcast.

1072
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Hello.

1073
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,660
I am the DeVoo.

1074
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,660
Let me tell you

1075
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,660
about roller coasters

1076
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,660
and

1077
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,660
Ted Cruz.

1078
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,660
I actually heard that Ted Cruz

1079
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,660
dropped out of the presidential race

1080
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,660
recently.

1081
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,660
What are your thoughts on that?

1082
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,660
Yes.

1083
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,660
Ted Cruz was weak.

1084
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,660
He was

1085
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,660
incompetent.

1086
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,660
A dullard.

1087
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,660
He could not have won the election

1088
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,660
on his own.

1089
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,660
And so I devoured him

1090
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,660
to gain his powers

1091
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,660
and now

1092
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,660
we

1093
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,660
are Ted Cruz.

1094
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,660
We

1095
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,660
are Venom.

1096
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,660
Interesting choice of words there

1097
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,660
referring to yourself as Venom. Are you saying

1098
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,660
that you are an alien symbiote?

1099
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,660
Yes.

1100
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,660
I am

1101
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,660
black

1102
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,660
goo

1103
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,660
black

1104
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,660
sentient goo

1105
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,660
with teeth.

1106
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,660
DeVoo

1107
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,660
is goo

1108
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,660
goo draw.

1109
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,660
Well that's all the time we have

1110
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,660
for in today's edition of the

1111
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,660
interrupting the podcast podcast.

1112
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,660
Thank you to my guest DeVoo

1113
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,660
for taking the time out of his day to be here

1114
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,660
but wait I did not get to

1115
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,660
talk about neutrality

1116
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,660
warship.

1117
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,660
That's okay DeVoo neutrality warship was

1118
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,660
a stupid thing to bring in in the first place.

1119
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,660
It's not a real thing it doesn't make sense

1120
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,660
nobody actually worships neutrality

1121
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,660
you're complete retard

1122
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,660
and the mean that I brought in

1123
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,660
neutrality demonization

1124
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,660
is actually a

1125
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,660
much bigger issue facing society today.

1126
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,660
As opposed to neutrality warship

1127
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,660
which is not an issue at all

1128
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,660
and does not actually even exist.

1129
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,660
Yes

1130
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,660
when you put it that way

1131
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,660
I can see the wisdom in your

1132
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,660
words

1133
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,660
how could I have been so blind

1134
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,660
I return now

1135
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,660
to the stars

1136
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,660
goodbye

1137
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,660
okay that's how I would feel too

1138
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,660
alright let's move on

1139
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,660
I want one

1140
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,660
alright

1141
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,660
so

1142
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,660
the word cringe worthy

1143
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,660
oh yes that was on mine

1144
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,660
fucking burns

1145
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,660
in the depths of hell

1146
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,660
the word cringe in general

1147
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,660
is just not good

1148
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,660
I have to fucking

1149
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,660
this guy's being happy let's get on him

1150
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,660
okay cringe

1151
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,660
is like

1152
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,660
an empathetic thing

1153
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,660
if you see someone

1154
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,660
doing something awkward

1155
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,660
who has no self awareness about it

1156
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,660
you feel

1157
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,660
embarrassment for that person

1158
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,660
that's what people mean when they say cringe

1159
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,660
but the key word there is no self awareness

1160
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,660
if somebody is doing an act

1161
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,660
or doing something and knows what they're fucking doing

1162
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,660
it's not fucking cringe

1163
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,660
you idiots stop

1164
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,660
you nailed it

1165
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,660
if you fucking

1166
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,660
if you go on

1167
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,660
I enjoy cringe worthy stuff

1168
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,660
but only when it's actually cringy

1169
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,660
it's just like

1170
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,660
it's so annoying

1171
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,660
cringe now

1172
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,660
here's an example

1173
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,660
there used to be a famous comedian

1174
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,660
called Gallagher

1175
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,660
and Gallagher was this dorky looking bald guy

1176
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,660
with a mustache and bright suspenders

1177
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,660
and he came out on stage and he would smash fruit

1178
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,660
with a giant hammer

1179
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,660
and people would go to his shows

1180
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,660
and they'd wear big plastic sheets

1181
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,660
if they were in the splash zone

1182
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,660
and everyone loved Gallagher

1183
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,660
if Gallagher was just starting out today

1184
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,660
he would be on our cringe

1185
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,660
look at this goofy idiot in suspenders

1186
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,660
smashing fruit isn't he an idiot

1187
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,660
no motherfuckers it's his act

1188
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,660
he knows what the fuck he's doing

1189
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,660
he knows it's silly, he knows it's ridiculous

1190
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,660
yeah that's actually the number one mean it needs to die

1191
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,660
it's lack of empathy

1192
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,660
and lack of understanding other people

1193
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,660
or attempting to understand other people

1194
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,660
yeah I see a lot of these

1195
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,660
like cringe compilations

1196
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,660
because my friends will get together

1197
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,660
everyone gets bored and we just watch like

1198
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,660
fail videos and cringe compilations

1199
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,660
and there's always like

1200
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,660
some stuff in there

1201
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,660
like you said what makes it cringe

1202
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,660
is that you feel bad for them

1203
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,660
at least for me

1204
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,660
I'm like oh man this guy has no idea

1205
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,660
what a fucking idiot he's being

1206
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,660
but then there's ones in there always

1207
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,660
that are like just really fun videos

1208
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,660
it's just people having a good time

1209
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,660
it's just people dressing up

1210
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,660
in funny costumes and doing something fun

1211
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,660
and wanting to share it with other people

1212
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,660
and sometimes I'm like

1213
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,660
this guy clearly knew

1214
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,660
this was a goofy thing to do

1215
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,660
there's this one video

1216
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,660
this guy paint

1217
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,660
it's like a sonic video

1218
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,660
and this guy is painted blue

1219
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,660
like sonic

1220
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,660
and he's like running through this insane looking backdrop

1221
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,660
and it clearly is supposed to be funny

1222
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,660
and like

1223
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,660
it's hilarious

1224
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
it's not cringy at all

1225
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,660
it's a joke, it's a fully formulated joke

1226
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,660
about running around as sonic

1227
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,660
with a couple of this compilation

1228
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
with like 12 year old screaming

1229
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,660
leave sonic alone

1230
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,660
like that's cringe

1231
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,660
the biggest meaning to die is

1232
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,660
there's a lack of empathy for other people

1233
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,660
and lack of thinking about what someone really does

1234
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,660
and thinks and is

1235
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,660
and just making passive judgments without knowing

1236
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,660
so you hate autistic people

1237
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,660
is that what you're saying

1238
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,660
they all need to die huh

1239
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,660
should we reopen the first one

1240
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,660
that actually brings up a point

1241
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,660
it brings up another point

1242
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,660
autistic is another buzz word

1243
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,660
that needs to fucking die

1244
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,660
because people have ruined it

1245
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,660
autism

1246
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,660
describes like a specific set of behaviors

1247
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,660
and people use it just like cringe

1248
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
oh this is autistic

1249
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,660
if they just mean that they didn't like something

1250
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,660
no motherfucker you sound like a stupid jackass

1251
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,660
go on Wikipedia for 5 minutes

1252
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,660
look up the actual symptoms and behaviors

1253
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,660
that define autism

1254
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,660
and use the fucking word directly

1255
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,660
you could use that for like

1256
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,660
that complaint with like so many things

1257
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
like retarded

1258
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,660
people using

1259
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,660
buzz words and using words incorrectly

1260
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,660
is a mean that needs to die

1261
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,660
it drives me crazy

1262
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,660
it makes me mad and I don't like it

1263
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,660
but jesse language is an objective

1264
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,660
it means whatever we want it to mean

1265
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,660
I got something

1266
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,660
it means that needs to die based on what you're saying

1267
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
ok you need to shut the fuck up for just one fucking second

1268
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,660
alright

1269
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,660
listen buddy

1270
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,660
why does this 15 year old

1271
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,660
think that his opinion matters

1272
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,660
listen buddy

1273
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,660
he's got an old soul

1274
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,660
listen buddy

1275
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,660
that video I sent you

1276
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,660
Nate earlier

1277
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,660
oh yeah

1278
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,660
listen buddy

1279
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,660
listen buddy

1280
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,660
listen buddy

1281
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,660
listen buddy

1282
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,660
listen buddy

1283
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,660
listen buddy

1284
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,660
is a Chinese language

1285
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,660
a Chinese language

1286
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,660
a Chinese language

1287
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,660
I got something

1288
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,660
tell me do you

1289
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,660
know what this is

1290
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
like in your mind

1291
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,660
this is the one

1292
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,660
this is the one

1293
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
this is the one

1294
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,660
this is the one

1295
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,660
this is the one

1296
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,660
this is the one

1297
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,660
this is

1298
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,660
this is the one

1299
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,660
listen

1300
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,660
there we get a knife

1301
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
we have

1302
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,660
a true blue American give and take

1303
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,660
this is the one

1304
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,660
this is the one

1305
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,660
this is the one

1306
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,660
this is the one

1307
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:13,840
Utilizer

1308
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:34,880
This podcast is SPARED!

1309
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,660
Yeah, so going to my name, which is a super set of this.

1310
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,660
Wait, I was going to go next before you.

1311
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,660
Who didn't finish it?

1312
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,660
When you're on the internet and people...

1313
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,660
This whole fucking podcast is a meme that needs to die.

1314
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,660
And they'll post a thing like,

1315
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,660
oh, look at this thing happening over here in this place.

1316
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,660
Look at those people. They are such and such adjective.

1317
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,660
And people are like, yeah, this, yeah, this.

1318
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,660
Like being in the video game community on the internet.

1319
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,660
They'll post some link and be like, hey, look at this.

1320
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,660
Those people are, you know, I come on,

1321
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
I get on to the internet like in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

1322
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,660
People are like, oh, look at that. That thing is racist.

1323
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,660
That thing is sexist. That thing is racist.

1324
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,660
I'm like, that's not racist. That's not sexist.

1325
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,660
You guys are seeing it out of context.

1326
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,660
Then 2012 rolls around,

1327
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,660
and a bunch of feminists go,

1328
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,660
oh, you gamers are racist and sexist.

1329
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,660
And they're all like, you're presenting us wrong.

1330
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,660
And I'm like, ah, you deserve it.

1331
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,660
You idiots.

1332
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,660
That's how I felt about the whole situation.

1333
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,660
Gamers are doing things to die.

1334
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,660
Hey, that's, that's misogynistic.

1335
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,660
That is pretty annoying.

1336
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,660
The whole standard label.

1337
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,660
I won't stand to have my female brothers and sisters slandered.

1338
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,660
I wanted to say, I think it's funny,

1339
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,660
that like up until Jesse joined this call,

1340
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,660
we were like, this was like a really, really peaceful

1341
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,660
memes that need to die.

1342
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,660
And then Jesse came in and he got really contentious.

1343
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,660
But then Jesse's also the one who's most annoyed by it.

1344
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,660
And like, it's like, I need to go back to bed.

1345
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,660
I just think that's hilarious.

1346
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,660
But um...

1347
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,660
But anyway...

1348
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,660
The problem is you, Jesse.

1349
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,660
No!

1350
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,660
You isolated the X factor.

1351
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,660
To extend on what Jesse was saying

1352
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,660
about words being used wrong and stuff,

1353
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,660
some memes that I think need to die

1354
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,660
are, um,

1355
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,660
pretentious.

1356
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,660
Oh, yeah.

1357
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,660
Forced drama.

1358
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,660
This is a new one. Have you guys heard this?

1359
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,660
Forced drama?

1360
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
I've heard it.

1361
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,660
It's a meme that's gotten big on 4chan.

1362
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,660
Oh, so you know it's intelligent.

1363
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,660
Basically, any time there's any drama,

1364
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,660
it is now forced drama.

1365
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,660
Because there's no such thing...

1366
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,660
Because I didn't like it.

1367
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,660
Right, there's no such thing anymore of just like,

1368
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,660
you know, like,

1369
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,660
characters might get upset about something.

1370
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,660
No, it's all forced drama now.

1371
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,660
Well, the artist did choose to

1372
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,660
have them react the way normal humans would,

1373
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,660
and that was an artistic choice they made,

1374
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,660
so obviously they're forcing that upon the situation.

1375
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,660
There's no way

1376
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
to justify this word,

1377
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,660
because you're writing a story.

1378
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,660
Everything is forced.

1379
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,660
You're writing it. You're making it happen.

1380
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,660
So, like,

1381
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,660
where is the line where drama

1382
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,660
becomes forced drama?

1383
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,660
It's totally arbitrary.

1384
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,660
Are you talking about fiction? I thought you were talking about YouTube drama.

1385
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,660
No, I'm talking about fiction.

1386
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,660
Yeah, that's also a meme that needs to die.

1387
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
Yeah, YouTube drama is a meme that needs to die.

1388
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,660
And the fact that so many people are, like,

1389
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,660
getting big off of the back of that guy,

1390
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,660
it pisses me off, but whatever.

1391
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,660
My meme that needs to die

1392
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
is people blaming me for the contentiousness

1393
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,660
of this podcast.

1394
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,660
If you go back and listen to it,

1395
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,660
you'll see that as soon as I joined the call,

1396
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,660
DeVu started talking about politics.

1397
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,660
That's what fucking did it. Not me.

1398
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,660
It wasn't a political thing, by the way.

1399
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,660
It was a societal thing about...

1400
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,660
It was a completely non-partisan thing

1401
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,660
about how people interpret politics.

1402
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,660
Go ahead.

1403
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,660
Lay it all on me.

1404
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Blame me for all your fucking trouble.

1405
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,660
Blame me for your people's inability to communicate properly.

1406
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,660
I just think it's really funny,

1407
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,660
because right up until, like,

1408
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,660
our first memes were, like,

1409
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,660
Pizza Hut not tasting good.

1410
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,660
I'll be your fucking martyr.

1411
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,660
Everyone fucking put me up on the cross

1412
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,660
for ruining the...

1413
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,660
You know, you're just like that guy the other day.

1414
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,660
The podcast was worse because you made it contentious.

1415
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,660
You know what?

1416
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,660
I just thought it was funny because you said...

1417
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,660
I wanted to give a shout out to that guy

1418
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,660
who said that I should be kicked off the podcast.

1419
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,660
You know, it's funny.

1420
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,660
I was actually considering quitting the podcast

1421
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,660
and retiring from it entirely,

1422
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,660
but now I'm going to stay on forever

1423
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,660
just to piss that guy off.

1424
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,660
That one guy I'll never miss another...

1425
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,660
I was in bed and I got up to come

1426
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,660
and join this because I thought about that guy

1427
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,660
and how much it would ruin his day

1428
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,660
and everyone fight and working my satanic magic

1429
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,660
and just bringing chaos into this conversation,

1430
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,660
just for that motherfucker

1431
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,660
and I hope he's listening and I hope he jokes on it.

1432
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,660
I love that you brought that guy up

1433
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,660
because we were talking about him before you came on

1434
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,660
and how he's probably the only person

1435
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,660
we've actually banned for the podcast comments.

1436
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
But anyway, I wasn't saying

1437
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,660
that you were making the podcast worse.

1438
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,660
I just thought it was funny because you were the one going,

1439
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,660
I should go back to bed.

1440
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,660
This podcast needs to die.

1441
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,660
It was so peaceful up until you showed up.

1442
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,660
Not necessarily that it's your fault.

1443
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,660
I got a real one.

1444
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,660
I got a real meme that needs to die.

1445
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,660
People bitching about movies.

1446
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,660
It's a cultural fucking cancer.

1447
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,660
It's choking America.

1448
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,660
It's choking all of modern society.

1449
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,660
People are cynical.

1450
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,660
You just did that for like two hours, though.

1451
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,660
No, no, no, no.

1452
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,660
I knew that someone would say that.

1453
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
But guess what, motherfucker?

1454
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,660
If you actually watched my Batman v Superman review,

1455
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,660
that was a positive review.

1456
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,660
Yes, I approached my audience.

1457
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,660
I analyzed that movie from every possible angle.

1458
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,660
And that's why it's the best review.

1459
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,660
I said all the positive things.

1460
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,660
I said all the negatives.

1461
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,660
And I recommended that movie.

1462
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
I recommended it to everyone.

1463
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,660
I said, everyone needs to see this movie.

1464
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,660
And ultimately, Jesse, you weren't doing all the things

1465
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,660
I hate about people bitching about.

1466
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,660
All the things I hate about it, you didn't do.

1467
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,660
You weren't being like a little twerp about it.

1468
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,660
Like, I've always had a problem.

1469
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,660
When I was like a teenager, especially,

1470
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,660
I was a little bit more...

1471
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,660
If anyone got mad at something,

1472
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,660
if I just noticed that everyone hated something,

1473
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,660
I would be like, you know what, fuck society.

1474
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,660
I'm going to try my hardest to like it.

1475
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Because people just came in,

1476
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,660
took some jabs,

1477
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,660
and didn't really elaborate.

1478
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,660
It's just, ha, ha, ha.

1479
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,660
Wow, I've had a really bad day.

1480
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,660
Almost as bad as Transformers 2.

1481
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,660
Stuff like that.

1482
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,660
Every joke will be...

1483
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,660
Well, you know what it's from.

1484
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,660
I want to see that review.

1485
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,660
Who would do anything around that does that?

1486
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,660
It coincides with the rise of

1487
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,660
like, humorous criticism

1488
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,660
or like the review as like a funny thing.

1489
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,660
Yeah, I was going to say.

1490
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,660
Because everyone wants to be...

1491
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,660
Everyone is so wrapped up in their witty little

1492
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,660
sarcastic, sardonic little cynicism

1493
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,660
that they end up missing the forest

1494
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,660
for the trees.

1495
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,660
And it's like Star Wars, The Force Awakens.

1496
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,660
It's, you know,

1497
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,660
oh, it's too much like the original

1498
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
Star Wars.

1499
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,660
Why is Rey so good in The Force?

1500
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,660
When the fact is, here's the real thing

1501
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,660
that they're missing.

1502
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,660
That fucking Chewie scene when Han dies

1503
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,660
and Chewie goes ape shit.

1504
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,660
That was the greatest fucking thing ever.

1505
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,660
All those fucking scenes with Kylo when he was

1506
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,660
like, throwing fits. That was fucking awesome.

1507
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,660
Okay, here's a quick meme that needs to die.

1508
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,660
The fact that that movie was good.

1509
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,660
Just going to...

1510
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,660
It was a 10.

1511
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,660
It was fine.

1512
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,660
It was a fucking fantastic movie.

1513
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,660
That's my point.

1514
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,660
It was a fucking, you know, it's a miracle

1515
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,660
that that movie was as good as it was.

1516
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,660
Star Wars was a ruined franchise, Nate.

1517
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,660
It was ruined.

1518
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,660
Those three prequel movies ruined the entire

1519
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,660
fucking franchise forever.

1520
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,660
And miraculously...

1521
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,660
They made a good movie.

1522
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,660
They made a great fucking movie.

1523
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,660
They made a perfect Star Wars film.

1524
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,660
People can't see the forest for the trees.

1525
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,660
Mine only picks. And these meta fucking issues.

1526
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,660
Like, why were there no B-wings?

1527
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,660
Why was it so much like the old ones?

1528
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,660
It has nothing to do with the actual story told in the movie.

1529
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,660
No one cares about the B-wings.

1530
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,660
You always say that, but I've never heard anyone...

1531
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,660
I mean, tons of people complaining about B-wings.

1532
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,660
Why the fuck would they complain about

1533
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
there being no B-wings?

1534
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,660
That made sense. It's not a real complaint.

1535
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,660
Oh, but...

1536
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,660
I feel the same way about Star Wars 7 that I do about it.

1537
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,660
That is a real complaint.

1538
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,660
It's not a real complaint. You can't just mind control people instantly.

1539
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,660
It takes training.

1540
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,660
Look, couldn't do shit.

1541
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,660
She's had training!

1542
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,660
She had a flashback that she clearly showed

1543
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,660
that she's had some fucking training.

1544
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,660
What, when she was like three before she could do anything?

1545
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,660
No, it's retired. No.

1546
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,660
It's not true. Who trained her?

1547
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,660
Did Luke train her? Did Luke teach her how to mic?

1548
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,660
Maybe.

1549
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,660
It was pretty fucking...

1550
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,660
Alright, please.

1551
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,660
Someone else. Munchy. Beams.

1552
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,660
My big old butt.

1553
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,660
Anyone who fucking complains about

1554
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,660
any movie sounds very deep and needs to die.

1555
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,660
I can't tell who apart from Munchy sometimes.

1556
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,660
Yeah.

1557
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,660
Who's got another meme to lay on the table?

1558
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,660
Oh, I've got one.

1559
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,660
Okay.

1560
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,660
People who think that fart is funny are stupid

1561
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,660
when poo is literally like way better.

1562
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,660
Poop is the fucking funniest thing ever.

1563
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,660
Farts aren't funny at all.

1564
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,660
Dude, I'm so with you.

1565
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,660
They're fucking unclean and they're terrible.

1566
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,660
What is a fart?

1567
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,660
But just the smell of poo.

1568
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,660
You know?

1569
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,660
You just remind me of a meme.

1570
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,660
I don't know.

1571
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,660
I think farts are pretty funny,

1572
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,660
but only in person and when there's a victim

1573
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,660
and when that victim is not me.

1574
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,660
Those are the requirements.

1575
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,660
I fart on people all the time

1576
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,660
and I find it pretty funny.

1577
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,660
They usually don't fart.

1578
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,660
I despise poop.

1579
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,660
I hate everything involving an asshole.

1580
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,660
It's all wrong.

1581
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,660
Jesse, we just made like four songs

1582
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,660
about assholes.

1583
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,660
Yeah, you're a bit...

1584
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,660
They were all hilarious and awesome.

1585
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,660
That definitely needs to be killed

1586
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,660
and raped and molested and embarrassed.

1587
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,660
It's being offended by anything ever.

1588
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,660
Yeah, what's that?

1589
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,660
Especially being offended

1590
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,660
by like toilet humor or bad language.

1591
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,660
Those are the ones that annoy me the most.

1592
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,660
Yeah, I'm pretty offended by that though.

1593
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,660
I can't deal with it.

1594
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,660
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,660
Mostly it's the tone of

1596
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,660
this bad language is bad

1597
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,660
and you should feel bad

1598
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,660
and I'm all superior.

1599
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,660
Can we...

1600
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,660
Both with Jesse's

1601
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,660
movie bitchy thing and with your

1602
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,660
offense thing,

1603
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,660
I think it's really more sanctimonious

1604
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,660
attitudes about those things

1605
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,660
that bother me.

1606
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,660
Bitching about movies can be fun

1607
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,660
and you can present it in a fun way,

1608
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,660
but it's when you're like

1609
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,660
in a movie as though

1610
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
you are above that movie,

1611
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,660
that's when it's annoying.

1612
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,660
When movie Bob writes his fucking

1613
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,660
negative reviews where he makes it out

1614
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,660
like this movie somehow killed his family

1615
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,660
or like it's ruined cinema forever

1616
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,660
or like he had...

1617
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,660
It was so problematic that he had to

1618
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,660
watch it.

1619
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,660
His Batman V Superman video, he said,

1620
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,660
I was literally twitching.

1621
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,660
I was literally spazzing out when watching it.

1622
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,660
Dude, is he serious?

1623
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,660
Is he in the theater?

1624
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,660
Dude, call the fuck down.

1625
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,660
Dude, you have actual problems.

1626
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,660
Tourettes or something.

1627
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,660
If I'm watching a movie knowing that I'm

1628
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,660
going to write a review of it

1629
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,660
and that that review is going to make me

1630
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,660
probably hundreds if not

1631
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,660
thousands of dollars, then I'd be sitting there

1632
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,660
like, huh, this movie's not very good.

1633
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,660
Awesome. That means I get to write

1634
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,660
this kind of video and it'll be a fun time.

1635
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
Let me just picture yourself.

1636
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,660
Hang on Deville, picture yourself.

1637
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,660
In this movie theater, there's a giant fat man

1638
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,660
sitting there watching a movie twitching

1639
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,660
spazzing out like little words.

1640
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,660
I can't believe it. I'm going to write a review about this.

1641
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,660
I hate this movie. Just picture that.

1642
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,660
This is a rancid future file of shit.

1643
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,660
You know?

1644
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,660
The problem is with you, my friend.

1645
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,660
It's so obvious that he can actually get offended

1646
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,660
by bad language because I can see him

1647
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,660
like he thinks he's supposed to be

1648
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,660
and I can watch him

1649
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,660
decide his level of offense

1650
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,660
and it's all about what words are said,

1651
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,660
partially they're said, and what speed they come.

1652
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,660
Like someone can go, ah, fuck,

1653
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,660
shit ass, and you'll see like his

1654
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,660
offense start to go up. His

1655
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,660
offense towards bad language is like the

1656
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,660
stamina bar in a souls game. It's very complicated

1657
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,660
in advance, and I can

1658
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,660
calculate it like someone goes, sure.

1659
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,660
I showed him like a video and he was

1660
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,660
like, ah, Jesus, God.

1661
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,660
And then I was like, okay, if he says fuck and then

1662
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,660
God, one more time he'll stop watching

1663
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,660
the video. So I hope he says like shit

1664
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,660
and ass instead. That'll be better.

1665
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,660
It's so arbitrary and I hate it.

1666
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
I tried to show them the resist series,

1667
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,660
resist bro, because I knew they'd agree

1668
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,660
with like most of the points, but

1669
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,660
they denied it of themselves because he said

1670
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,660
fuck twice and shit once and he

1671
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,660
shouted it so that they're not allowed to watch it.

1672
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,660
I was so mad about that. I was

1673
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,660
so mad, like it was

1674
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,660
so stupid, but you know, I can respect

1675
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,660
my dad's opinions

1676
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,660
towards other things, right, because like he doesn't

1677
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,660
want to watch things that are like really disturbing

1678
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,660
or like... Oh, DeVoo, you were so right.

1679
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,660
You were so right about this point. I'm so

1680
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,660
with you. Listen, there's nothing

1681
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,660
wrong with not wanting to engage

1682
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,660
with something. Right, I don't know if

1683
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,660
my dad has the same sort of

1684
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,660
same attitude towards other things, but

1685
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,660
I remember when Daybreakers came out

1686
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,660
and I'm like, oh sweet, let's watch that movie. My dad was like,

1687
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,660
I don't want to watch stuff with vampires in it.

1688
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,660
I'm like, why? And he's like, they're

1689
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,660
disturbing to me. Okay, I'm just asked, does this man

1690
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,660
think that vampires are real? Is that the issue?

1691
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,660
No, but he just seems like

1692
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,660
they bug him and also that movie

1693
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,660
buried. I wanted to watch that and he's like, I'm

1694
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,660
not going to watch a movie about a guy getting

1695
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,660
buried. And my dad had a

1696
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,660
really intense upbringing.

1697
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,660
He's not like a guy who's been

1698
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,660
privileged or anything. I mean, like

1699
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,660
Jesse, never you described

1700
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,660
like your life in a

1701
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,660
drug crack. He's actually a train.

1702
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,660
Poverty, bullcrap,

1703
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,660
drugs stuff. My dad had that kind

1704
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,660
of upbringing, although worse because it was the

1705
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,660
60s and there was no internet to distract yourself

1706
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,660
from all the misery. So he has earned

1707
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,660
being able to

1708
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,660
Well, you know, dads are really...

1709
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,660
The reason why I brought that up is because I want to

1710
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,660
say, like, there are things you can be disturbing.

1711
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,660
No, dads are a great thing. If anything, the world

1712
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,660
needs more dads. I love dads. I want to make

1713
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,660
a quick, quick shout out to all dads.

1714
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,660
I love dads. I want to be a dad someday.

1715
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,660
I want to give an anti-shout out to all dads.

1716
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,660
Dads are cool.

1717
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,660
There's nothing cooler than a cool dad.

1718
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,660
I love cool dads.

1719
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,660
I also have a friend.

1720
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,660
Munchie would make a strangely cool dad.

1721
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,660
I want to kill all the dads

1722
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,660
and I want to keep the dad of all the guys.

1723
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
I have a friend who gets offended by things easily

1724
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,660
but she doesn't have this attitude of her being

1725
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,660
right about it. Or, like, you know, it's her

1726
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,660
objective truth. Or at least she hides it

1727
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,660
really well. She's very, very respectful

1728
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,660
about it and I don't mind that. I just mind

1729
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,660
the arbitrariness.

1730
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,660
And that's my meme.

1731
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,660
I agree. Though I kind of

1732
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,660
hate people with bad reasons for doing

1733
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,660
whatever they do. So I don't think

1734
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,660
being offended by swears is a cool thing

1735
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,660
at all, but whatever. Let's move on.

1736
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,660
Resist, bro. So that reminds me

1737
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,660
of a meme that needs to die.

1738
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,660
Veganism. And veganism.

1739
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,660
Veganism, yeah.

1740
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,660
These fucking morons who think that cows

1741
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,660
contain the matter.

1742
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,660
I know. I know. Who gives a shit when an animal

1743
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,660
thinks it's just shooting in the head to devour

1744
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,660
its meat? It's delicious meat that was put

1745
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,660
on this earth by Jesus and God for us to

1746
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,660
consume. So, you know, frankly,

1747
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,660
we're just doing what we want to do.

1748
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,660
I'm so sorry that I have these

1749
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,660
things in my mouth called

1750
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,660
canines, these incisors

1751
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,660
that I look in the mirror and it tells me

1752
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,660
that I was created to eat meat.

1753
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,660
You know, I'm so sorry that we take dumb

1754
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,660
stupid, brainless,

1755
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,660
zombie animal at cows.

1756
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,660
Resist, bro.

1757
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,660
Stand around and chew cut all day.

1758
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:54,660
The meme at the core

1759
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,660
of the issue is the meme that animal

1760
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,660
killings matter and they don't.

1761
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,660
They absolutely don't. I don't care.

1762
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,660
Cows are particularly stupid animals.

1763
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,660
They don't do anything. They don't even know

1764
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,660
that alive.

1765
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,660
We showed the clip of the cow getting its

1766
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,660
throat slit and the blood coming out.

1767
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,660
I was just like, I didn't even

1768
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,660
eat that. I didn't eat that.

1769
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,660
I don't know. Maybe it depends

1770
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,660
on whether or not you've grown up

1771
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,660
around cows sometimes.

1772
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,660
I've spent a fair share

1773
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,660
of...

1774
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,660
I was grossed out by that.

1775
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,660
I was grossed out by that, but on the level of...

1776
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,660
Can we, by the way,

1777
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,660
establish, because

1778
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,660
if you were to look for Resist, bro,

1779
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,660
you will find nothing.

1780
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
We're talking about the Resist Capitalism

1781
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,660
videos by Anthony Fankano

1782
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
on his channel, That Is The Plan.

1783
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,660
He created this character

1784
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,660
Yeah, we created this.

1785
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,660
He created this character who was in response to

1786
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,660
the Resist Capitalism thing going around

1787
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,660
on Twitter and he's just this weird...

1788
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,660
until I stopped agreeing with this.

1789
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,660
It was really great until he

1790
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,660
decided to make his character into

1791
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,660
like this...

1792
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,660
He did this whole thing commenting on veganism

1793
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,660
and basically trying to paint anybody who's not a vegan

1794
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,660
as a lazy idiot.

1795
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,660
He fucked up.

1796
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,660
I can respect the veganism position.

1797
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,660
I understand your feelings and I know that Paul McCartney's

1798
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,660
line was

1799
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,660
if slaughterhouses had glass walls,

1800
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,660
everyone would be a vegetarian.

1801
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,660
My rebuttal is

1802
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,660
everyone had a cow in their backyard.

1803
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,660
Everyone would not give a shit anymore.

1804
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,660
Everyone would not give a shit anymore.

1805
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,660
I listened to Africa for a couple of months

1806
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,660
when I was like a kid and

1807
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,660
we had a cow in their backyard.

1808
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,660
When you spend a lot of time around a cow,

1809
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,660
you realize something.

1810
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,660
You just want to eat that motherfucker.

1811
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,660
They don't leave any more of an impression on you

1812
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,660
than a tree.

1813
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,660
That's the fact.

1814
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,660
I don't know, I think cows are cute.

1815
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,660
Gibbs got a descending opinion.

1816
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,660
In the 1876 anime series

1817
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,660
Nobody's Boy Remy,

1818
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,660
the main character's only friend was a cow

1819
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,660
and they had to sell it off because they got poor

1820
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,660
and it was sad.

1821
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,660
Vegans, I know that you won't have this movement.

1822
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:02,660
Not for the person, not for the cow.

1823
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,660
Vegans, I know you want to have this movement.

1824
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,660
Vegans is just a third elitist and that's really the ultimate

1825
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,660
meat that needs to die is fucking elitism.

1826
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,660
I know you want to bring society in a direction that you wanted

1827
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,660
but it's over now.

1828
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,660
Drink your big black cow and get out of here.

1829
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,660
Animals are tools

1830
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,660
to be used by humans.

1831
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,660
They can be cute, they can be funny

1832
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,660
but they only matter to us.

1833
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,660
The moment we want to kill them we should be able to

1834
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,660
because we're the dominant species on the planet.

1835
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:28,660
I agree.

1836
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,660
I think we worked all this.

1837
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,660
I think that our species worked so hard

1838
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:34,660
to get here.

1839
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,660
Not so that we could just go back

1840
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,660
on everything we've accomplished

1841
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,660
and fucking, and then

1842
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,660
assume just because we don't

1843
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,660
understand plants that well

1844
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,660
does not feel anything

1845
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,660
and that killing them is totally okay.

1846
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,660
It doesn't fucking matter.

1847
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,660
That kind of shoots our whole argument

1848
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,660
when you start talking about plants having souls.

1849
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,660
You guys are over thinking this.

1850
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:58,660
Vegans are just annoying fucking elitists.

1851
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,660
Elitism is a mean that needs to die.

1852
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,660
It's the ultimate mean that needs to die.

1853
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,660
It's really what it all comes down to.

1854
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,660
Anyone who thinks that your stupid little belief

1855
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,660
or your stupid little agenda

1856
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,660
or what you like

1857
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,660
or what someone else likes makes you better

1858
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,660
get off my planet.

1859
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,660
I'll give you one thing real quick though

1860
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,660
and it's just that if we could just have

1861
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,660
all the things that we have now

1862
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,660
and also let the animals live

1863
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,660
then okay sure they can live.

1864
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,660
Since we can't I'm totally fine with eating them.

1865
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,660
My meme that needs to die is

1866
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,660
give us something.

1867
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,660
What are you saying?

1868
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,660
Okay.

1869
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,660
I was just going to say I disagree

1870
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,660
with the idea that

1871
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,660
farm animals are inherently less interesting

1872
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,660
than household pets.

1873
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,660
It completely depends on

1874
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,660
because they're just animals.

1875
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,660
If you live with them they can be cool.

1876
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,660
They can play.

1877
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,660
Are you claiming that household pets are interesting?

1878
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,660
I like my dog.

1879
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,660
I like my pet.

1880
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,660
Dog haters like Digi that's a mean thing.

1881
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,660
I'm just saying.

1882
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,660
I hate all animals.

1883
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,660
Animals are cool.

1884
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,660
I have three dogs

1885
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,660
but if I wanted to eat

1886
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,660
a dog burger I would totally

1887
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,660
fucking break out my hammer

1888
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,660
and I would smash that shit

1889
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,660
and I would fucking eat it.

1890
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,660
I just hate chickens and cows and shit

1891
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,660
because they're fucking stupid and they don't do anything.

1892
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,660
Chickens and cows are cool as shit.

1893
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,660
They're cool as shit and they could be your friends.

1894
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,660
Right?

1895
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,660
Chickens are my friends.

1896
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,660
I would hug a chicken.

1897
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,660
I would have a chicken on my shoulder.

1898
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,660
I'd be the pirate chicken.

1899
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,660
I would never eat a raven or crow.

1900
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,660
Because I've never been wrong about anything.

1901
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,660
Oh, well done.

1902
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,660
Give us another meme.

1903
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,660
Munchy, you gotta have more, right?

1904
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,660
Yeah.

1905
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,660
I have a ton.

1906
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,660
The meme that Sonic 2 is bad

1907
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,660
and all 2D Sonics are bad.

1908
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,660
Sonic 1 is worse.

1909
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,660
The first Sonic 2 or the Sonic Adventure 2.

1910
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,660
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a 10 out of 10 game.

1911
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,660
Hang on.

1912
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,660
I thought the consensus with the Sonic 1

1913
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,660
was kind of the weakest in the whole series.

1914
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,660
Sonic 1 either, but I still think it's a good game.

1915
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,660
In the whole series, that's kind of...

1916
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,660
I'm not saying any of them are bad.

1917
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,660
I'm just saying that I thought people actually like Sonic 2.

1918
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,660
I haven't heard this argument that...

1919
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,660
I've heard the argument that all the old

1920
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,660
Sonics are bad, but I think

1921
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,660
where that really comes from.

1922
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,660
I don't like any of the Sonic games,

1923
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,660
but I don't think Sonic 2 is a bad game.

1924
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,660
Play Sonic Advance.

1925
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,660
What you'll realize is that

1926
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,660
the people who are saying that, they've played all the new games,

1927
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,660
which all suck.

1928
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,660
I'm going to try out the old ones.

1929
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,660
And then they play Sonic 1, and they go,

1930
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,660
well, all the old ones are like Sonic 1,

1931
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,660
and Sonic 1's not fun, so fuck old Sonic.

1932
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,660
When really, Sonic 2 is

1933
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,660
way better than Sonic 1.

1934
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,660
So I think that there's...

1935
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,660
I think that people who say all the old Sonic suck

1936
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,660
have probably only played Sonic 1

1937
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,660
and don't realize that 2 and 3

1938
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,660
are much improved.

1939
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,660
Not to say that I think they're great...

1940
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,660
Okay, I'm not going to say they're not great games.

1941
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,660
I just don't like them.

1942
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,660
When I played Sonic 2 on the Blue Glow,

1943
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,660
I was like, I appreciate what's good,

1944
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,660
why this game is fun.

1945
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,660
Sonic 1 is tedious

1946
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,660
and has too many levels,

1947
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,660
but Sonic 2 is like, yeah,

1948
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,660
this looks like it's a tight, fun experience.

1949
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,660
If you'd played it enough as a kid

1950
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,660
to know how to play it,

1951
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,660
then it would be extremely satisfying.

1952
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,660
It's got great music and great visuals.

1953
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:24,660
It's a solid game.

1954
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,660
I'm going to go watch my video.

1955
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,660
We've got to talk about wisdom teeth.

1956
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,660
They're a meme that needs to die.

1957
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,660
I'm sick and tired of these fucking things.

1958
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,660
You should get them out too.

1959
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,660
No, because my second meme was dentist.

1960
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:38,660
I can't get them out because I don't want to

1961
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,660
look at one of those motherfuckers

1962
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,660
who want to go in your mouth.

1963
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,660
They're expensive too.

1964
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,660
I have 30 fillings in my mouth,

1965
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,660
so the dentist

1966
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,660
is like a second home to me.

1967
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,660
I actually have 3 wisdom teeth

1968
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,660
grown in, but they haven't bothered me enough

1969
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,660
to want to take them out.

1970
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:58,660
That's fine.

1971
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,660
The meme that needs to die

1972
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,660
is the idea that

1973
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,660
English people have bad teeth and Americans don't.

1974
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,660
No, that one's true.

1975
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,660
I'm going to confirm that one right now.

1976
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,660
I'm already cracking it.

1977
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,660
They don't have the best...

1978
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,660
Let's hear Gibb out on this one.

1979
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,660
Go ahead. Convince us.

1980
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,660
I don't know how to convince you.

1981
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,660
I can just say fuck you.

1982
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,660
It's not true.

1983
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,660
I will say that when I...

1984
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,660
I don't think it's that Americans have

1985
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,660
better teeth. I think it's that we

1986
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,660
put better teeth on television.

1987
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,660
I actually want to disagree because

1988
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,660
when I was in Japan, I distinctly noticed

1989
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,660
a ton of fucked up teeth.

1990
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,660
You can see that on Japanese TV.

1991
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,660
I feel most at home.

1992
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,660
Because the Japanese are just genetically inferior.

1993
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,660
Let's be honest.

1994
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,660
I think we need to take out the Japanese braces.

1995
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,660
I need to speak as a man.

1996
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,660
Speaking as a man with awful teeth.

1997
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,660
We can treat the Japanese like cows and chickens.

1998
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,660
You've all seen my teeth.

1999
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,660
You all know that I've got the most...

2000
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,660
God damn it!

2001
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,660
Let me finish my fucking sentence.

2002
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,660
Everyone knows I got the most...

2003
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,660
When I watch

2004
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,660
British and Japanese shows,

2005
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,660
I feel much more comfortable

2006
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,660
and less self-conscious about myself

2007
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,660
because I realize that the stigma...

2008
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,660
Because people make fun of my teeth

2009
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,660
offline all the time.

2010
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,660
My friends give me shit about it.

2011
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:24,660
My mom's like 50 and she's got braces.

2012
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,660
Because her teeth...

2013
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,660
Genetically, I got my fucked up teeth

2014
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,660
from my mom.

2015
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,660
But she's embarrassed about them and wants to fix it.

2016
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,660
I'm like, I don't give a fuck.

2017
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,660
The fact that they're in disarray

2018
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,660
doesn't really change anything.

2019
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,660
It doesn't really matter.

2020
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,660
It's just a weird aesthetic thing that people are obsessed with.

2021
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,660
And only really in the US.

2022
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,660
When I watch shows from other countries, they clearly don't care.

2023
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:48,660
They've got pop stars with fucking teeth.

2024
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,660
I was watching baby metal videos yesterday

2025
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,660
to prepare for

2026
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:54,660
my podcast with the Needle Drop.

2027
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,660
The lead singer girl has pretty fucked up teeth.

2028
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,660
And I was like,

2029
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,660
they're internationally successful band

2030
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,660
known for how adorable the girls are

2031
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,660
and the girls got fucked up teeth like me.

2032
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,660
So, you know,

2033
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,660
I am asking for more fucked up teeth representation.

2034
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,660
I had a hard time talking.

2035
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,660
You can go listen to my videos from 2008

2036
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,660
and try not to keep your eyes from watering.

2037
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,660
So that raises

2038
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,660
that straight into my teeth.

2039
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:20,660
Although the day I got my braces off,

2040
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,660
I was like, great, a retainer.

2041
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,660
Awesome. I put that on.

2042
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,660
How long do I have to have this retainer on?

2043
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:28,660
The rest of your life. The rest of your life.

2044
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,660
You put it on when you go to sleep permanently.

2045
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,660
Every night. I'm like, uh, no.

2046
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,660
I'm still doing that, dude. I'm still doing that.

2047
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,660
As soon as I found out about that, I was like,

2048
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,660
I would never get pregnant.

2049
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,660
After your whole orthodontist shit's done,

2050
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,660
you're given a retainer and said

2051
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:44,660
use this for the rest of your life.

2052
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,660
That's awful.

2053
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,660
When I heard that, I would flip my shit.

2054
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,660
With you, Jesse, this whole thing needs to go.

2055
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,660
This whole thing needs to go.

2056
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,660
So, like, only a week ago,

2057
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,660
I'm like, alright, I'm not putting this thing on anymore.

2058
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,660
I would rather have a good life and slightly messed up teeth.

2059
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,660
Hopefully they won't.

2060
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,660
Teeth shaming is a meme that needs to die.

2061
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,660
Big problem. Go vote it up.

2062
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:06,660
You know what?

2063
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,660
Star Wars is a meme that needs to die.

2064
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,660
I fucking...

2065
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,660
That's what you like to...

2066
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,660
No, no.

2067
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,660
Okay, I guess I have a complicated stance

2068
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:18,660
on this issue.

2069
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,660
The Force Awakens

2070
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,660
is by far the best Star Wars movie.

2071
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,660
But I fucking hate Star Wars,

2072
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:26,660
and it needs to go away forever.

2073
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,660
I agree there.

2074
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,660
I don't like what Star Wars does to people.

2075
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,660
I don't like what it does to my country.

2076
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,660
I don't like the obsession that everyone

2077
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,660
in the fucking world has with Star Wars.

2078
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,660
Star Wars isn't that special.

2079
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,660
Whenever anyone is a super fan of Star Wars,

2080
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,660
and I just think about how these people

2081
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,660
could have been watching Star Trek this whole time

2082
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,660
they've been wasting their lives.

2083
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,660
Now that this is pretty much just turned

2084
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,660
into the biggest problem in the universe,

2085
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,660
I'm going to say franchise worship

2086
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,660
is a meme that needs to die.

2087
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,660
I think it's really cool.

2088
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,660
That one is a serious problem that causes people to be stupid.

2089
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,660
Yeah, I think that it's really cool

2090
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,660
when we have a continuing story

2091
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,660
or a continuing narrative that can go on for like...

2092
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,660
Star Trek is a great franchise

2093
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,660
because it makes sense

2094
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,660
why they keep doing more.

2095
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,660
They're always like a sequel to the last one,

2096
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,660
except for those new movies

2097
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,660
which just tried to reboot the original characters,

2098
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,660
which doesn't make any sense

2099
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,660
because Star Trek should just be always new people.

2100
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,660
It should always be updated

2101
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,660
to match the current technology.

2102
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,660
So the Star Trek TV shows have always made sense.

2103
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,660
Even if there's one that's not good,

2104
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,660
it doesn't really affect the overall nature

2105
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,660
of the franchise because that's the kind of show it is.

2106
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,660
It's something that should come back every 10 years.

2107
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,660
Right, and like in Star Wars,

2108
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,660
that's what makes the next generation worse.

2109
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,660
Right, and Star Wars reflected

2110
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,660
where our culture was back in the 70s

2111
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,660
in regards to storytelling

2112
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,660
and it reflected upon the hero's journey.

2113
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,660
More than that, it's been a progressive version

2114
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,660
of that day in time.

2115
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,660
Just having that black chick on Star Trek

2116
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,660
back in the day was like...

2117
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,660
Everyone was like, oh damn, Martin Luther King

2118
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,660
called her up at one point and was like,

2119
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,660
hey, just want to let you know, you're making us proud.

2120
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,660
You're just being a black face on TV

2121
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,660
and that's just helping our cause.

2122
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,660
It evolved that way because like I said,

2123
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,660
it reflected the hero's journey stuff

2124
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,660
and it reflected the way that the world

2125
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:12,660
saw warfare and evil empires after World War II

2126
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,660
and all that stuff.

2127
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,660
That's why I ultimately didn't like

2128
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,660
Episode 7 that much because it was

2129
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,660
still the same stuff.

2130
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,660
I feel like the logical evolution would be

2131
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,660
to tell a story that's all about

2132
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,660
the way that storytelling is today

2133
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,660
and reflected stuff like...

2134
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,660
Star Wars has never been an intellectual series

2135
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,660
from the beginning.

2136
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,660
To be intellectualism, I just think that

2137
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,660
Star Wars was fine being what it was

2138
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,660
and it didn't need to be...

2139
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,660
If you want to make another movie like Star Wars...

2140
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,660
Just make a new sci-fi franchise.

2141
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,660
To this day, you'll still see

2142
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,660
New Star Wars merchandise and the commercial

2143
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,660
on TV will show up and you'll get the music.

2144
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,660
I'm like, dude, this was like

2145
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,660
three movies and then three shitty movies

2146
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,660
and I guess we're going to have more, but

2147
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,660
why are we still on about this one franchise?

2148
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,660
There's other ones that have better character designs,

2149
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,660
better ship designs, more interesting stuff going on.

2150
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,660
I don't want any of it repeated.

2151
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,660
Right now we've got all the

2152
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,660
superhero movies coming out and everything

2153
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,660
and I think it's cool

2154
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,660
for a little bit, but then when we get these

2155
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,660
we've got to this point

2156
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,660
where stuff will succeed

2157
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,660
just because it's in a franchise and that

2158
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,660
makes it so all anyone cares about

2159
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:22,660
is franchises anymore.

2160
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,660
What I was going to say is

2161
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,660
it's not just franchise

2162
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,660
worship, but franchise enabling

2163
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,660
with people who don't like the franchise

2164
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:32,660
but they will still buy it like Final Fantasy.

2165
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:34,660
People like you, Jesse and Nate

2166
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,660
you're going to buy Final Fantasy 15.

2167
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,660
I'm only going to buy it to show the world

2168
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,660
how fucked up it is.

2169
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,660
And you're going to hate it.

2170
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,660
That brings me to an even better point.

2171
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,660
Just generally enabling

2172
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,660
there's so many fucking

2173
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,660
reviews out there that are like

2174
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,660
why do people keep buying

2175
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,660
these games from the perspective of

2176
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,660
someone who bought the game

2177
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,660
so they could review it.

2178
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,660
You're a part of the problem.

2179
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:02,660
Or exempt from this because they do it

2180
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,660
they actually make something out of it.

2181
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
But that's the thing, everyone's doing it now.

2182
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,660
Not to buy the game, they're making a difference.

2183
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,660
You can fucking, you can make a game

2184
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,660
and you can like

2185
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,660
probably make like back

2186
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,660
like if it's a relatively cheap game you can probably

2187
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,660
make back your money just on the number of reviewers

2188
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:20,660
buying the thing so they can bitch about it.

2189
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,660
That's not true. No it is true.

2190
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:24,660
Because think about it, there's hundreds of

2191
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,660
YouTube reviewers and I'm not just talking about big people

2192
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,660
I'm talking about everyone on Twitter

2193
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,660
who wants to fucking buy a game

2194
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,660
so they can tell everybody else not to buy the game

2195
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:34,660
even though their opinion doesn't matter and nobody listens to them.

2196
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,660
You only, like, if you think

2197
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,660
something looks, like, if you're mad

2198
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,660
at the bad business decisions that a company

2199
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,660
is making then tell people

2200
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,660
I'm not buying this game and you shouldn't either

2201
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,660
because I'm upset by their business decision.

2202
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,660
That's why I parroted everything. I'm not a part of the problem.

2203
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,660
I parroted millions of lives. I don't think that would happen.

2204
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,660
Well Digi you have warped and perverted

2205
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,660
to the point about Star Wars.

2206
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:56,660
No this is a different thing.

2207
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,660
This is nothing to do with Star Wars.

2208
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,660
Because Hippo changed it and I

2209
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,660
wanted to leap off of that into a different

2210
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,660
meme which is people

2211
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:06,660
enabling bad business decisions

2212
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,660
for the sake

2213
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,660
of, like, criticizing them

2214
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,660
by way of supporting them

2215
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,660
which doesn't make any sense.

2216
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,660
I don't know how much that would make.

2217
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,660
I might make like $2,000, $3,000

2218
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,660
from that sort of stuff.

2219
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:22,660
I agree there's some

2220
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:24,660
Digi must be talking about

2221
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:26,660
the larger environment we're in now

2222
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,660
where people want to talk about the new topical thing

2223
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,660
because they know there's going to be a desire for it.

2224
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:32,660
Digi that whole scenario you said

2225
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,660
about how the reviewers are the ones

2226
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,660
enabling it because just them would be enough

2227
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:38,660
to make sales for something low budget.

2228
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,660
Well let's say there's a franchise that needs to die.

2229
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,660
Episode, you know,

2230
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,660
the first movie comes out in the franchise

2231
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,660
everyone sees it and it sucks.

2232
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,660
The second one comes out and it sucks harder

2233
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,660
like stop watching it.

2234
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,660
You're describing Final Fantasy XIII right now.

2235
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,660
And then no one

2236
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,660
watches the third one except for the reviewers

2237
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:58,660
but apparently the reviewers watching it

2238
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,660
allows it to make his money back.

2239
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,660
People say don't watch it and then the audience says

2240
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,660
oh we didn't and so then the reviewers are like

2241
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,660
that doesn't happen though, that will never happen

2242
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,660
because when the reviewers see it

2243
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,660
they say oh guys

2244
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,660
this movie's terrible

2245
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,660
you should not see it and then everyone's going to go

2246
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:16,660
oh well now I got to know how my opinion

2247
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:18,660
is going to be a review and then they're going to go see it

2248
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,660
because people are reviewing it.

2249
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,660
I'm saying that we should

2250
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,660
if you think a movie is going to be terrible

2251
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,660
and you don't want people to see it

2252
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,660
don't add to the hype, don't make it

2253
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,660
there's so many things.

2254
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:32,660
I'm wondering if our negative review

2255
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,660
is inherently counterproductive

2256
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,660
like because you made your asterisk war thing

2257
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,660
that probably got more people to watch it

2258
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,660
than who already would have.

2259
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:42,660
Is it a destructive force to do something like that?

2260
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,660
That's a good point and in fact criticism

2261
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,660
is a meme that needs to die.

2262
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,660
I hate reviews, I hate reviewers

2263
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,660
it serves no functional purpose in the world

2264
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,660
we have to separate down

2265
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,660
it's only destructive

2266
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,660
there's no such thing as constructive criticism

2267
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,660
nothing good can ever come from a bunch of cynical idiots

2268
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,660
patting themselves in the back

2269
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:02,660
about how cleverly they can dismantle something

2270
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,660
and try to shit on someone else's art

2271
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,660
all criticism needs to be abolished

2272
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:08,660
it's all a fucking disease

2273
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,660
I disagree with that because my asterisk war series

2274
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,660
is perfect and

2275
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,660
everyone should watch it and give me 100 million dollars

2276
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,660
and anyone who

2277
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,660
doesn't think it's perfect is objectively wrong

2278
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,660
but the point of it

2279
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,660
Reviewers and critics can also make videos

2280
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,660
like what is the appeal of anime

2281
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,660
where it's all about go buy

2282
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:28,660
spend money at all this stuff because it has

2283
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,660
really interesting and diverse stories

2284
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,660
we're talking about the negative review itself right now

2285
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,660
however much

2286
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,660
Digi is able to empower the asterisk war

2287
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,660
by making his video about it

2288
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:40,660
he also makes videos saying hey everyone

2289
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,660
anime is really interesting

2290
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,660
so go watch it

2291
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:46,660
the whole point of the asterisk war thing was

2292
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:48,660
to just use that show as an example

2293
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:50,660
that's a meme that needs to die

2294
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,660
the point of the asterisk war series

2295
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:54,660
was not about

2296
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,660
the asterisk war itself

2297
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,660
and while I do in the end say

2298
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,660
I wish people wouldn't watch this show

2299
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,660
even though I did in fact incentivize

2300
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:04,660
tons of people to watch it

2301
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,660
it wasn't so much about this one show

2302
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,660
it was about this genre

2303
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,660
that I haven't covered any other shows

2304
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,660
in that genre since

2305
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,660
and I don't intend to because people keep asking me

2306
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,660
are you going to talk about asterisk war season 2

2307
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,660
and I'm like no because

2308
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,660
that defeats the point

2309
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:22,660
here's this type of show don't watch it

2310
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,660
the reason that I don't consider

2311
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,660
your asterisk review

2312
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,660
in line with what I'm talking about

2313
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,660
is because you kind of approached it

2314
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,660
with a purpose and it was more analytical

2315
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,660
a lot of people would make that case

2316
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,660
my problem with

2317
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:40,660
with the world and with criticism

2318
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,660
popular criticism nowadays

2319
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:44,660
and it goes back to Star Wars

2320
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,660
goes back to everything I'm talking about it's all connected baby

2321
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:48,660
my problem is that people nowadays

2322
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,660
are more in love

2323
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:52,660
with having the funniest negative review

2324
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,660
than they are with actually understanding

2325
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:56,660
the art in front of them

2326
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,660
I think we're all really just mad at movie bob

2327
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,660
can we all just like is that really what's happening

2328
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,660
is that we all just really hate what movie bob

2329
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,660
is doing

2330
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,660
talking about every fucking smarmy

2331
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:08,660
wise ass on the internet

2332
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,660
well I don't watch a lot of those

2333
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,660
so like I don't know the guys you're talking about

2334
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,660
that's when that started with me as transformers

2335
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,660
too because people would go

2336
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:18,660
I didn't think it was a good movie

2337
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,660
I just thought it was mildly entertaining whatever

2338
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:22,660
but people were like oh it's so terrible

2339
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,660
it sucks so much

2340
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,660
no I think it's the worst movie ever

2341
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,660
oh man you know oh jeez

2342
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:30,660
this pizza slice was really terrible

2343
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:32,660
it's almost as bad as transformers too

2344
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:34,660
it's so annoyed me because

2345
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,660
and even the star wars prequel stuff

2346
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,660
before I saw the plinket reviews

2347
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,660
I was very annoyed by those people

2348
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,660
because they would always just be like oh man

2349
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,660
I just got a freaking gallstone

2350
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,660
and it hurt like hell

2351
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,660
it was almost as bad as jar jar binks

2352
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,660
but those movies really aren't that bad

2353
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,660
I hated those people so bad

2354
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,660
I hated that so much it made me want to like the prequels

2355
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,660
because I hated those people about it

2356
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,660
because they weren't being constructed

2357
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,660
I felt similar

2358
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,660
the plinket reviews are analytical

2359
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,660
and have something to say

2360
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,660
so you're making a decision

2361
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:08,660
so you're making a decision

2362
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,660
between substantive critiques

2363
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,660
and just shitting on something

2364
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
although you did say

2365
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,660
constructive criticism doesn't exist

2366
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,660
like five minutes ago

2367
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,660
yeah well that was a lie

2368
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,660
no wait wait wait

2369
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,660
that doesn't mean it needs to die

2370
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,660
everybody shut up I have to go back

2371
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:28,660
it wasn't a lie I was right then

2372
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,660
I actually agree

2373
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,660
I agree that constructive criticism is the truth

2374
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:34,660
even when he lies

2375
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,660
because as I said in a previous podcast

2376
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:38,660
it's only really constructive

2377
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,660
if you know what the person intends

2378
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,660
so like you know me ragging on Astros for

2379
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:44,660
has nothing to do with whether the author

2380
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:46,660
did what he intended to do

2381
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,660
it has to do with me wanting people to stop

2382
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,660
gratifying the author

2383
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,660
I don't know dude maybe his intention was to make the worst thing of all times

2384
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,660
that people would realize that he should be supporting these particular

2385
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,660
yeah he succeeded

2386
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,660
yeah like a meme that needs to die

2387
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,660
is saying that you need to

2388
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,660
make your criticism constructive

2389
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,660
even if really what they mean

2390
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,660
is just don't use exclamation marks

2391
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,660
well this is getting too close to our

2392
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,660
comment or rules and reviewer rules

2393
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,660
so Munchy give us another meme to go

2394
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,660
yeah Munchy go

2395
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,660
new pokemon aren't cool

2396
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,660
the fucking ice cream pokemon is

2397
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,660
fucking amazing he's so cool

2398
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,660
I'm not joking he's awesome

2399
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,660
he's literally very cool

2400
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,660
one of them is a ring of keys

2401
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,660
he's the ring of keys dude

2402
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,660
I know it's awesome

2403
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,660
yeah but have you played Kingdom Hearts

2404
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,660
Kingdom Hearts has keys in it

2405
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,660
Kingdom Hearts uh no it doesn't

2406
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,660
who's the keys in Kingdom Hearts there's no keys

2407
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,660
the key blade you fucking idiot

2408
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:42,660
it's not a ring of keys it's one key

2409
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,660
I know that big pokemon are inherently cool

2410
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,660
cause you put them in the lock and you go

2411
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,660
yeah but this guy you just give him your keys

2412
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,660
those keys don't come with him you use him

2413
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,660
as your key holding device

2414
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,660
he is a pokemon that is

2415
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,660
literally a key blade monster

2416
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,660
enough about the damn keys

2417
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,660
so about these pokemon

2418
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:02,660
a lot of people rag on

2419
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,660
like uh

2420
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,660
a garbodor and the uh

2421
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,660
what's the one that calls into garbodor

2422
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,660
it's fucking garbage

2423
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:12,660
I appreciate that complaint

2424
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,660
and garbodor

2425
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:16,660
and jesse's video is fucking hilarious

2426
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:18,660
with that part cause it's literal garbage

2427
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,660
but if you

2428
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,660
I'm feeling

2429
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,660
god damn it

2430
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:26,660
I had this song in my head all day the other day because of you

2431
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,660
you son of a bitch

2432
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,660
let me finish my point

2433
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,660
you might break my heart

2434
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:34,660
oh why'd you do anything so easy

2435
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,660
ever be so hard to do

2436
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,660
I wanna tell you

2437
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,660
how I'm feeling and to say

2438
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,660
I love you

2439
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,660
yeah look

2440
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,660
continue my point

2441
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,660
do not try to co-op the fact that chaos happened

2442
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,660
to interrupt the point I was barely into

2443
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,660
god damn it

2444
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:58,660
so back in generation one

2445
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:00,660
there was this pokemon called

2446
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,660
grimer that evolved into muck

2447
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,660
and if you read the description of grimer

2448
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,660
which is literally just a purple puddle

2449
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,660
the darkness of warnings the future doesn't

2450
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,660
scare me at all

2451
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,660
nothing's like before

2452
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,660
nothing's like before

2453
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,660
if you read the description

2454
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:18,660
for grimer and muck they are literally

2455
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:20,660
sewage

2456
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,660
it actually says

2457
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:24,660
literally sewage in the description of muck

2458
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,660
muck is well known to be made out of cum

2459
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,660
so the idea

2460
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:30,660
of a pokemon that are just a blob of garbage

2461
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,660
has always been a thing

2462
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,660
and generation one had

2463
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:36,660
volt orb that evolved into

2464
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:38,660
electrum

2465
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,660
muck is like

2466
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,660
garbador is just this fucking

2467
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,660
snaggletooth gay fag

2468
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,660
I agree that garbador looks like shit

2469
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,660
eggs? that one is pretty stupid isn't it

2470
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,660
execute rules

2471
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,660
execute rules are awesome

2472
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,660
execute tour

2473
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,660
I just think that

2474
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,660
I don't think that garbador is

2475
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:02,660
conceptually bad

2476
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,660
the meme that

2477
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,660
executor is not the best pokemon

2478
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,660
is it's gotta die

2479
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:10,660
I think

2480
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,660
stop! tofu I'm not done

2481
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:14,660
taking this point

2482
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,660
why do you keep trying to come up to the chaos

2483
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,660
to cut me off goddammit

2484
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:20,660
anyways

2485
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:22,660
the latest generation of pokemon

2486
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,660
when x and y came out

2487
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,660
I looked at all the pokemon from all the generations

2488
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:28,660
and I tried to give them all

2489
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,660
ratings

2490
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,660
and I actually thought x and y had

2491
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,660
by density

2492
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,660
the coolest pokemon

2493
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,660
there's a ton of really awesome ones

2494
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,660
how lucha

2495
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:42,660
dore bird it looks amazing

2496
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,660
you've got

2497
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,660
the whole sligeun slugdra family

2498
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,660
that was one of my favorites

2499
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,660
fucking

2500
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,660
gujra

2501
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,660
gujra should be an all female

2502
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,660
should be an all female

2503
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,660
gujra turns me on

2504
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,660
gujra is like my main for that game

2505
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:02,660
there's

2506
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,660
the fucking one that's like a ghost sword

2507
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:06,660
that one's pretty cool

2508
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,660
I like ghost slag

2509
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,660
there's a ton of awesome pokemon

2510
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,660
and I'll say that

2511
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,660
there are some shitty ones in there

2512
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,660
that one that's like a barnacle

2513
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,660
attached to a rock that one looks fucking terrible

2514
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:20,660
that one sucks, that one's horrible

2515
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,660
somebody just said that gujra turns you on

2516
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,660
so I looked up

2517
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:26,660
gujra to see what it looks like

2518
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,660
and what the fuck is wrong with you

2519
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,660
it's a goo monster

2520
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,660
it's adorable

2521
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,660
this thing is a filthy

2522
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,660
fucking

2523
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,660
it's an abomination

2524
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:40,660
it's a big pink goo

2525
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,660
that's what it is

2526
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,660
it looks like it's got a mucusy chin

2527
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,660
it's covered in jizz

2528
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,660
it's covered in jizz, it's gross

2529
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,660
aren't you not into like slime girls

2530
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,660
and stuff

2531
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,660
I mean I like slime girls but this dude's just covered in jizz

2532
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,660
I don't want to touch that guy

2533
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,660
he's pink and goo, I like it

2534
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,660
he's pink and goo

2535
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,660
I like it

2536
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:04,660
let's say no slime girls

2537
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,660
are you telling your thingamajig?

2538
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,660
yes I'm done with my story

2539
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:10,660
I actually had a very similar thingamajig

2540
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,660
but a friend of mine

2541
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,660
had gotten to pokemon a number of years ago

2542
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:16,660
and she wanted to do a pokemon mystery dungeon

2543
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,660
story with me

2544
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,660
where we would each write our characters

2545
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,660
sort of like a roleplay but not in order

2546
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,660
and so we'd do a run of mystery dungeon

2547
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,660
or we'd just tell a story

2548
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,660
we'd just write a story

2549
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:30,660
we never did it but we spent weeks preparing it

2550
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:32,660
so in that time I had to decide what pokemon I was going to be

2551
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,660
I thought that the entire list

2552
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,660
and I concluded that by density

2553
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,660
X and Y had the most consistently good designs

2554
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:40,660
I had the exact same conclusion

2555
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:42,660
and then when Digi came out with his pokemon X and Y videos

2556
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,660
and said that this generation has the most

2557
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:46,660
consistently excellent designs

2558
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,660
I was like yeah, that one had the least amount

2559
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,660
of unique pokemon

2560
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,660
quality over quantity

2561
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,660
I ultimately decided to be litwick

2562
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,660
I believe that's a gen X and Y roleplay

2563
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,660
well I like gen 3 because it's

2564
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,660
if I had to be a pokemon

2565
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,660
I'd be a litwick, that'd be pretty awesome

2566
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:04,660
Shandalura is my favorite pokemon ever

2567
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,660
yeah that's right but munchie was right

2568
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,660
that wasn't X and Y, that was before

2569
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:10,660
I think me and munchie can both agree

2570
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:12,660
that munchlax is possibly

2571
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,660
the greatest pokemon ever

2572
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:16,660
not possibly, are you joking?

2573
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,660
gen 3 or 4 right?

2574
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:20,660
gen 3 I think

2575
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,660
gen 4 is the best pokemon generation

2576
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,660
if you think so you're literally fucking retarded

2577
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,660
I think this whole thing about pokemon

2578
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,660
designs happened with

2579
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,660
all the best evolutions for the prior pokemon

2580
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,660
all the best items, all the hottest

2581
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,660
pokemon girls

2582
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,660
munchlax, alright sucks

2583
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:38,660
I believe the whole meme about pokemon generations

2584
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:40,660
thinking that pokemon, the new generations

2585
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,660
are good just because he wasn't

2586
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,660
with it in the real old days

2587
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:46,660
he doesn't understand the real pokemon

2588
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:48,660
he doesn't know

2589
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,660
I wasn't there in the real old days

2590
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,660
Misty isn't even cool dude

2591
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:54,660
Misty isn't good

2592
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:56,660
wait what are you saying

2593
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:58,660
I don't know

2594
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,660
I don't know

2595
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,660
I didn't hear

2596
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,660
I didn't hear what he said

2597
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,660
should I be out of breath

2598
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:08,660
he said misty is not cool

2599
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,660
oh well

2600
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,660
alright new meme

2601
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:14,660
that's somebody new meme

2602
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,660
munchie go, next one

2603
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:18,660
4chan

2604
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,660
everyone who goes on 4chan, I want to fucking strangle

2605
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:22,660
it's not cool

2606
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,660
get the fuck out of here

2607
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,660
he's got it figured out

2608
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,660
you guys are a bunch of babies

2609
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:30,660
you guys are a bunch of babies

2610
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,660
you can't handle the man's game

2611
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,660
4chan is a force ultimately for good

2612
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,660
I love 4chan because all I do

2613
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:38,660
is look at the pictures

2614
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:40,660
and I don't read anything

2615
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:42,660
I don't like 4chan because I can't understand

2616
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,660
the least terrible

2617
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,660
message board on the internet

2618
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:48,660
that I've ever seen

2619
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,660
you haven't been on MLP board

2620
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:52,660
that one is easily the most terrible

2621
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,660
oh it's fine

2622
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,660
that's not how we got into 4chan at first

2623
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:58,660
I'm very shitty now

2624
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:00,660
but at the time it was like

2625
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:02,660
every third thread

2626
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:04,660
has a post that makes me laugh

2627
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,660
wow way better than anywhere else

2628
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,660
on the internet because I'm on the internet

2629
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:10,660
and I hear about how 4chan is this terrible awful place

2630
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,660
where everything just sucks

2631
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,660
all the time daily constantly

2632
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:16,660
I go there and it just seems like people are

2633
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,660
consistently more funny than anywhere else

2634
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:20,660
and they're more real than anywhere else

2635
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:22,660
4chaners who are proud

2636
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,660
to be 4chaners

2637
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,660
4chan pride

2638
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,660
because I'm a little proud

2639
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:30,660
I identify as a 4chan guy

2640
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,660
I think being proud to be a 4chaner is antipathical to 4chan

2641
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:34,660
culture

2642
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,660
4chan is good

2643
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:38,660
it breeds this 4chan pride attitude of

2644
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,660
we're in a secret club and us 4chaners

2645
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,660
we're cool we know what's really real and what's going on

2646
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:44,660
I do hate elitism

2647
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:46,660
you know what really annoys me is when there's

2648
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,660
a war between tumblr and 4chan

2649
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:50,660
I'm reddit and I'm like

2650
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:52,660
I go to waller sites they're fine

2651
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:54,660
who cares

2652
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,660
I don't really post on 4chan much

2653
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,660
because I just am not good at writing in their personality

2654
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,660
when I make a post it just sounds like

2655
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:02,660
people always go go fuck back to reddit

2656
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,660
anytime I post on 4chan

2657
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,660
that's the real problem with 4chan

2658
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,660
and for most group think it's just another fucking

2659
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,660
who's fucking Skype is going off

2660
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,660
is that me I'll kill me

2661
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:14,660
who the fuck is doing it

2662
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,660
what is that noise

2663
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,660
it's fine

2664
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:20,660
best guy ever you are

2665
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:22,660
you're an amalgamation of all the

2666
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,660
worst traits of humans

2667
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,660
I'm an amalgamation of all the best traits of 4chan

2668
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,660
is what I am I took it all

2669
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,660
which means you're the worst of all humans

2670
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:32,660
is exactly what I just said

2671
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:34,660
what's the next meme munchie

2672
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:36,660
okay this is the big one

2673
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:38,660
well I need to go last

2674
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,660
I'll come up with another one

2675
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,660
okay water bottles literally just

2676
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,660
like fucking tap water

2677
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,660
I bought it in an outrageous price

2678
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,660
I don't want to pay like one dollar

2679
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,660
for a bottle of water when I could just drink it

2680
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,660
on my tap

2681
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:54,660
hey munchie

2682
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,660
every comedian from the year

2683
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:58,660
2000 called

2684
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,660
shit

2685
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:02,660
but it's true

2686
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,660
their message didn't seem to have an impact

2687
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,660
it is a little sad that people are still

2688
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:08,660
drinking it after so many comedians

2689
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:10,660
made the point that they

2690
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:12,660
I didn't even know that anyone else thought about it

2691
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:14,660
oh man you clearly don't watch it

2692
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,660
up comedy

2693
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,660
or even biggest problem in the universe

2694
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,660
what's going on

2695
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,660
I've been using

2696
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:24,660
the same water bottle for about a year

2697
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:26,660
I've just been refilling it

2698
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,660
wow

2699
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,660
you're getting a little bit of the plastic shit

2700
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,660
in your body if you keep using that

2701
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:34,660
I know I'm probably going to die

2702
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,660
but it's pretty good

2703
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,660
I'm just saying if you're using one water bottle

2704
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,660
do what I do and just get a really big one

2705
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,660
I don't drink water

2706
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,660
I hate the meme that foldable chairs

2707
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:46,660
are not comfortable

2708
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,660
I'm seeing a foldable chart now

2709
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:50,660
literally the most comfortable I've ever been in my entire fucking life

2710
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,660
you just remind me of a meme

2711
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:54,660
I don't know how to feel about it

2712
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:56,660
it's the meme that whenever I listen to stand up comedy

2713
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:58,660
or listen to cultural criticism stuff

2714
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:00,660
all the things I do make me a poor

2715
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:02,660
fat midwestern American

2716
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,660
going to Walmart, I used to eat at McDonald's

2717
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:06,660
everything about my lifestyle

2718
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:08,660
I'm with you on that

2719
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,660
but then when I have an opinion

2720
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,660
about some societal issue

2721
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:14,660
I'm a privileged elitist

2722
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:16,660
coddled, silver spoon, born

2723
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:18,660
person who's never known anything about struggles

2724
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:20,660
or not having tons of money

2725
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:22,660
I don't know

2726
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,660
and this has been the airing of grievances

2727
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,660
by the DeVoo

2728
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,660
we'll see you next week for more

2729
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:30,660
I agree

2730
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,660
I'm a little annoyed when people

2731
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,660
make it out like

2732
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:36,660
Walmart, middle America

2733
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,660
literally everyone goes to Walmart

2734
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:40,660
there are things that you can only

2735
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:42,660
get at Walmart

2736
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,660
where Walmart's the only convenient place to go

2737
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,660
it's like

2738
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:48,660
you go on the internet and you hear about how

2739
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:50,660
we're

2740
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,660
regular people and there's all these rich fat cats

2741
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:54,660
and they look down on people and then you can go to

2742
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:56,660
peopleofwalmart.com

2743
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:58,660
look at how poor they are

2744
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:00,660
I'm like, oh come on people

2745
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:02,660
well, the joke with people of Walmart isn't better

2746
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,660
it's just a joke

2747
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,660
it's just offended by that joke

2748
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:08,660
as you feel like you need to

2749
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,660
oh man, that doesn't mean it needs to die

2750
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,660
if a joke offends you, that means it's true

2751
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,660
my rebuttal to that is always

2752
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:16,660
I'll say, hey you know

2753
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,660
I went up to some black people at a diner last week

2754
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:20,660
and said, you being black means you have

2755
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,660
less intellectual fortitude

2756
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,660
but that's true

2757
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,660
it's like, you know

2758
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,660
no, you're doing it wrong

2759
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:30,660
so that's a stupid thing

2760
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,660
by the way, plenty of things can piss you off

2761
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,660
even if they're completely not true

2762
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,660
like, accusing, um, you know

2763
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,660
nerd culture or whatever of being sexist

2764
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,660
oh, it pisses them off, they're being defensive

2765
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:42,660
that's because, you know, it's been a big

2766
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,660
controversial issue that people have

2767
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:46,660
obviously it's not always true

2768
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,660
hey everybody, you destroy all nerds

2769
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:50,660
get out!

2770
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:52,660
Ben, are you recording?

2771
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,660
you're a whole hour and twenty minutes into this

2772
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:56,660
we already did that

2773
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,660
I am recording and I'm ready to go, let's continue

2774
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:00,660
don't mind me

2775
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:02,660
hey Ben, since you're here, we're doing memes

2776
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,660
that need to die, do you have a meme that needs

2777
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,660
to die?

2778
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,660
nope

2779
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,660
okay, moving on

2780
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:12,660
amazing contribution you've made

2781
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:14,660
I'm glad I came

2782
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,660
Munchy?

2783
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,660
I have the biggest one

2784
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,660
okay, I have this written down

2785
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,660
memes are fucking funny

2786
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:24,660
stop talking about them all the fucking time

2787
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:26,660
ironically slash dank meme lovers

2788
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:28,660
I hate you, memes are fucking great

2789
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:30,660
yeah, I like memes

2790
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:32,660
so the idea of memes being overused

2791
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,660
I'm with you on this side too

2792
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,660
I had the problem with the word memes

2793
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:38,660
I love how as soon as Ben came back to this podcast

2794
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,660
we went back to the original

2795
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,660
topic

2796
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,660
when Jesse got here, it all went crazy

2797
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,660
when Ben gets here

2798
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,660
I'm here to enforce the rules

2799
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,660
of this podcast

2800
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:52,660
Ben is a stern authoritarian

2801
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:54,660
nobody talk over each other, nobody interrupt

2802
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,660
each other, given

2803
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,660
we need that bell

2804
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:00,660
you know what Ben, rules

2805
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,660
are a meme that needs to die

2806
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,660
I had it with your rules

2807
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,660
Jesse Wood is a meme that needs to die

2808
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,660
okay

2809
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:10,660
these memes need to kill each other

2810
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,660
my meme is a meme that needs to die

2811
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,660
I'm with Munchy's meme that

2812
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,660
people who haven't seen Highlander

2813
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:18,660
is a meme that needs to die

2814
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,660
Highlander is the most important meme

2815
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:22,660
in American cinema history

2816
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:24,660
anyway

2817
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,660
I think memes can be pretty funny

2818
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:28,660
I still think Dam Daniel

2819
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:30,660
is pretty fucking funny

2820
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,660
someone said Dam Daniel to me

2821
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,660
someone said Dam Daniel to me the other day

2822
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,660
and I didn't know what it meant

2823
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,660
it was a funny phrase

2824
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,660
this guy made a ton of vines

2825
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,660
of him observing his friend

2826
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,660
Dam Daniel

2827
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,660
back at it again with the white vans

2828
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,660
it's pretty funny

2829
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:50,660
you said that

2830
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,660
reminded me of a meme that needs to die

2831
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,660
a youtube channel called I hate everything

2832
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,660
is a meme that needs to die

2833
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:58,660
this fucking guy is not funny

2834
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:00,660
he's not funny

2835
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,660
he's not interesting

2836
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,660
he never says anything remotely original or unique

2837
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,660
he just jumps on every fucking bandwagon he can

2838
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,660
all of his videos are monotonous

2839
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:10,660
droning bullshit

2840
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:12,660
he fucking hops on fucking e-drum of bandwagons

2841
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,660
he hops on meme bandwagons

2842
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,660
every fucking video he does gets up

2843
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:18,660
forward to the front of Reddit because

2844
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,660
oh man it's a channel and he rants and he hates things

2845
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,660
he's not even fucking funny

2846
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:24,660
that guy is fucking trash

2847
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,660
he's

2848
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:28,660
his whole career is built on e-drama

2849
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:30,660
and on the fact that he has a funny face

2850
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,660
and everyone wants to draw his cartoon avatar

2851
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:34,660
everyone wants to suck his stupid dick

2852
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:36,660
the thing I hate about I hate everything

2853
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:38,660
oh and if anyone's wondering

2854
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,660
the thing I hate most

2855
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:42,660
that guy had a video about hating Dam Daniel

2856
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:44,660
by the way

2857
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:46,660
just want to throw this out there

2858
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:48,660
my series fuck everything

2859
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,660
by about two years

2860
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:52,660
and is much better

2861
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:54,660
the thing I hate about I hate everything

2862
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:56,660
is that his name is very generic

2863
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,660
so every time I think to myself

2864
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:00,660
oh I'm feeling really bad

2865
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:02,660
I hate everything I think of his channel

2866
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,660
and I don't want to

2867
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:06,660
he has ruined the phrase

2868
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,660
I hate everything

2869
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:10,660
he's made it unfun to say

2870
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,660
I say we just ignore him

2871
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:14,660
because hopefully he can become less

2872
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,660
that's a meme that needs to die

2873
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,660
actually is people thinking that

2874
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,660
not commenting on something will make it go away

2875
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:22,660
I don't think that usually works most of the time

2876
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:24,660
no I think it will

2877
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,660
it reminds me of another meme

2878
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,660
of like

2879
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,660
if someone is criticizing you about something

2880
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,660
and you go well if I just don't acknowledge it

2881
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:34,660
then it will go away I think a lot of times

2882
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,660
that just doesn't work because I remember at one point

2883
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,660
the irate gamer coming out with a video

2884
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,660
saying that I was always fully aware

2885
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:42,660
of the fact that

2886
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,660
it's a much more complicated situation

2887
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:46,660
ripping off AVGN

2888
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:48,660
for context the irate gamer was a guy who came out in 2007

2889
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:50,660
who obviously ripped off AVGN

2890
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:52,660
oh no he was an irate gamer dude

2891
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:54,660
oh I bet there's plenty of people who don't

2892
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,660
because lots of people haven't been on that one

2893
01:49:56,660 --> 01:49:58,660
I have no idea who the irate gamer is

2894
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,660
he has 157,000 subscribers

2895
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:02,660
which is, you know, marginal

2896
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,660
anyway the point is he came out with a video saying

2897
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:06,660
I never wanted to comment on the fact that

2898
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:08,660
my videos were so similar to AVGN

2899
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:10,660
I never really wanted to stand up for myself

2900
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:12,660
and then he had this 30 minute video

2901
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:14,660
you know, if you had said all that

2902
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:16,660
when it happened you probably would have

2903
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,660
defused a lot of the video

2904
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,660
and it does sort of help you see his side of it

2905
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:22,660
but I don't know if it

2906
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,660
defends him from the fact that he's not funny

2907
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,660
and has like shitty wooden acting

2908
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,660
and a terrible show

2909
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,660
the whole point was that he was

2910
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:32,660
not creative enough to make it seem

2911
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,660
like he wasn't ripping him off

2912
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,660
ripping off AVGN

2913
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,660
so earlier on someone said I'm glad you came

2914
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,660
and that reminded me of a meme

2915
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,660
I realized, the lack of boy bands

2916
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,660
there need to be boy bands because they're funny

2917
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:46,660
to have in our culture, you know

2918
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,660
they say so much in our culture

2919
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:50,660
I've been listening to some Beatles

2920
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:52,660
I listened to the first Beatles out of the way

2921
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,660
Are you considering the Beatles a boy band?

2922
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:56,660
I mean they didn't

2923
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:58,660
DeVoo

2924
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,660
come to America

2925
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:02,660
DeVoo, a traditional boy band

2926
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,660
We are going to try to classify

2927
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,660
the type of thing we do

2928
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,660
we just do what we like

2929
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,660
yeah, that's the thing

2930
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,660
cause those boy bands do

2931
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,660
just worry about trust

2932
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,660
cause imma give mine a baby can't you see

2933
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,660
it doesn't matter

2934
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:20,660
Backstreet Boys are infinitely superior

2935
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:22,660
to NSYNC, I'll just throw that one out there

2936
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,660
right now so everyone knows

2937
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:26,660
that's a whole other podcast

2938
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:28,660
no strings attached

2939
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:30,660
I know the Beatles became more interesting

2940
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,660
and I am much more interested in that stuff

2941
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:34,660
but their first album especially kinda sucks

2942
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:36,660
it's 100%

2943
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,660
because one direction is today

2944
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:40,660
like one direction is amazing

2945
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,660
one direction fucking rules

2946
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,660
because of

2947
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,660
I've never had

2948
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:50,660
the Beatles were really

2949
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:52,660
artistically influence

2950
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,660
make an analysis that explains

2951
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,660
why

2952
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,660
let me tell you right now

2953
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,660
why the Beatles are a terrible example

2954
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:02,660
of a boy band, it's because

2955
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:04,660
they made their own music the entire time

2956
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:06,660
they evolved through that process

2957
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:08,660
they weren't figure heads the way the typical boy bands are these days

2958
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:10,660
I don't care

2959
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,660
all my definition of boy bands is a bunch of guys

2960
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:14,660
who make songs about how they're all gonna

2961
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:16,660
well that's their shitty definition but okay fine

2962
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:18,660
because I like it because it represents

2963
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:20,660
where our culture is at that time

2964
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:22,660
and it's really funny that

2965
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,660
it's a nice thing to be able to gently make fun of

2966
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,660
it's so cheesy haha

2967
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:28,660
we got one direction I guess

2968
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:30,660
there was this sudden wave of boy bands

2969
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,660
or at least there was supposed to be one

2970
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:34,660
boy band who did the song I'm glad you came

2971
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,660
that song which has double entendre

2972
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,660
in the lyric that I love

2973
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,660
but then one direction was the only one that stuck

2974
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,660
around

2975
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:44,660
it kind of sucks because the whole point

2976
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:46,660
is to have lots of them

2977
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,660
the whole point is to have lots of them

2978
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,660
because they can all compete

2979
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:52,660
like we had back in the 60's

2980
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,660
like we had in the 90's

2981
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,660
but now we have a boy band monopoly

2982
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:58,660
today and that's just not nearly

2983
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,660
as interesting

2984
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,660
when you said I'm glad you came

2985
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:04,660
and all that it reminded me of a meme

2986
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:06,660
that I think maybe needs to die

2987
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:08,660
which is the meme that women

2988
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:10,660
are like really hard to please

2989
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,660
sexually and men just

2990
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:14,660
get off constantly at all times

2991
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:16,660
there's like this huge disparity

2992
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,660
in the way that women and men

2993
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,660
have sex and everything

2994
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,660
I think it's like way

2995
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,660
blown out of proportion by like comedians

2996
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:26,660
like you know where it

2997
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:28,660
it can be funny but I think it's

2998
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:30,660
affected the way people actually think about

2999
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:32,660
these things where like

3000
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,660
I think women are just as sexually

3001
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:36,660
open and like into weird shit

3002
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,660
and able to like be stimulated

3003
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:40,660
as men are

3004
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:42,660
that's a meme that women care about sex

3005
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,660
or want at all they don't I can confirm that

3006
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:46,660
they're not interested at all

3007
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,660
most of the women I've talked to are pretty

3008
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,660
fucking promiscuous

3009
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,660
they say that but they're just trying to impress you

3010
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:54,660
it's all a big fugazi

3011
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:56,660
it's not real don't be fooled

3012
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,660
when I had sex with my ex

3013
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,660
girlfriend she was coming all the time

3014
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,660
and I was coming rarely so I felt like

3015
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,660
it was a reversal of everything

3016
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,660
have you considered that she might have been a man originally

3017
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:08,660
there's this girl who I've talked to for a long time

3018
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,660
on the internet and

3019
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,660
she shares a lot of the stuff I'm into

3020
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:14,660
she's more intensely into

3021
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,660
those things but I am

3022
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,660
into other things that are also more

3023
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,660
intense than she is into

3024
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:22,660
so I don't know I think it's kind of a mixed

3025
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,660
my point is that there's no

3026
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,660
there's this idea that

3027
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:28,660
all women are harder to please

3028
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:30,660
and that is not the case

3029
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,660
it's highly independent on the person

3030
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:34,660
that's fair

3031
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,660
yeah whatever

3032
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,660
let me bring it back

3033
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,660
a second let me talk about an actual

3034
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:42,660
thing relating to memes that need to die

3035
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,660
here's what I hate

3036
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:46,660
okay

3037
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,660
the whole modern

3038
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:50,660
slash poll alt-right movement

3039
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:52,660
the political spectrum there

3040
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:54,660
it all couches itself in fucking memes

3041
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:56,660
and makes itself like funny

3042
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:58,660
and approachable

3043
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:00,660
as part of its like marketing

3044
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,660
like Hitler was right and shit

3045
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,660
and I hate it yes the whole

3046
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:06,660
every meme that comes out of poll

3047
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,660
is nothing but like a funny sort of

3048
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,660
packaging method for these terrible

3049
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:12,660
alt-right ideas about how we need to create

3050
01:55:12,660 --> 01:55:14,660
a fucking ethno-state

3051
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:16,660
and it drives me up the fucking wall

3052
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,660
wow Ben you know a fucking white

3053
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:20,660
thanks for ruining this hilarious podcast

3054
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,660
with that deeply insightful fucking social

3055
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:24,660
commentary

3056
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:26,660
you're welcome

3057
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,660
I have to realize

3058
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:30,660
that most of those people are just being ironic

3059
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,660
shit posters and they aren't funny and I still hate them

3060
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:34,660
no that's how it starts

3061
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,660
they start by ironically shit posting

3062
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:38,660
that Hitler was right

3063
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:40,660
at this point there is no way

3064
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:42,660
to tell the difference between the people who made it

3065
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,660
sincerely and the people who were joking

3066
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:46,660
it's kinda like the

3067
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,660
gamergate thing people start out agreeing

3068
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,660
with like the funny meme part of it

3069
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:52,660
but then they kinda get something

3070
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:54,660
I got in the poll

3071
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:56,660
and I was like wow finally

3072
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:58,660
a place on the internet where people agree with me

3073
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,660
on something

3074
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,660
but then as I continued to be on it

3075
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,660
I could no longer tell

3076
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,660
if the anti-semitism was a joke or not

3077
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,660
it's like gamergate

3078
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:10,660
some of them are serious

3079
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,660
I saw this big graphic that was like

3080
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:14,660
here's all the things that Auschwitz really was

3081
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:16,660
exactly it was like what

3082
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:18,660
you hate neutrality worship so much

3083
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,660
but you know what you get when you don't have neutrality

3084
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:22,660
worship you get poll and gamergate

3085
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:24,660
and you get fucking channels like

3086
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:26,660
something out of a car that do nothing but keep saying

3087
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:28,660
don't get involved people

3088
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:30,660
we're in a bad place

3089
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,660
we're gonna be here

3090
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:34,660
let's get out

3091
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,660
over and over again

3092
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,660
that's what you get when you don't appreciate

3093
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:40,660
and respect neutrality

3094
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,660
neutrality is to be expected

3095
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,660
I don't want to be appreciated

3096
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:46,660
there's a bunch of fucking ideologues

3097
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:48,660
pushing their agenda

3098
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,660
two teams of monkeys

3099
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:52,660
oh god

3100
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:54,660
oh god this is the worst

3101
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:56,660
there's no man left in the middle

3102
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:58,660
you have no neutrality

3103
01:56:58,660 --> 01:57:00,660
these cacophonies are in the neutrality

3104
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,660
podcast

3105
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:04,660
okay okay okay everybody

3106
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:06,660
shut the fuck up

3107
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:08,660
here's my meme that needs to die

3108
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:10,660
is the idea that people aren't going to take

3109
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:12,660
everything to its logical extreme

3110
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:14,660
if it proposes something to be done in society

3111
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:16,660
people will go well

3112
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:18,660
we're gonna do that today but in 50 years

3113
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:20,660
it's gonna be like the super extreme version

3114
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,660
you're like what no it's not

3115
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:24,660
and I go yeah probably is

3116
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:26,660
every single thing that humans ever do is extreme

3117
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:28,660
I believe completely in the slippery slope

3118
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,660
and that's my meme that needs to think

3119
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:32,660
is the idea that the slippery slope is a fallacy

3120
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:34,660
I think it's a 100% real thing

3121
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:36,660
I think fallacies are a meme that needs to die

3122
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:38,660
thanks for bringing that up

3123
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:40,660
anytime some stupid asshole brings up like debate fallacies

3124
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:42,660
and like in like a conversation

3125
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:44,660
I'm with you here

3126
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:46,660
holy shit that's annoying

3127
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:48,660
you insulted me so that means you're wrong

3128
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:50,660
you know Jesse I gotta say

3129
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:52,660
I don't get people saying that

3130
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,660
accusing me of fallacies but

3131
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,660
I will say that while I think your style

3132
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:58,660
of arguing makes people think you are

3133
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,660
committing fallacies when you aren't

3134
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,660
I was arguing with a commenter the other day

3135
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,660
and he said

3136
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,660
you're not responding to my questions

3137
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,660
you're just using adhamanim

3138
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,660
you're insulting me

3139
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,660
listen up motherfucker

3140
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,660
this is not a debate

3141
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:16,660
debate fallacies do not apply

3142
01:58:16,660 --> 01:58:18,660
outside of a debate when you come to me

3143
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:20,660
and try to insult me

3144
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,660
I don't have to play friendly by the rules

3145
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:24,660
of fucking courteous debate with you

3146
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,660
I can call you a stupid asshole

3147
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:28,660
if you're acting like a stupid asshole

3148
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,660
it's not a fallacy it's the truth

3149
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:32,660
the whole reason that adhamanim is a fallacy

3150
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,660
is because an adhamanim is when you think

3151
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,660
that attacking someone is

3152
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:38,660
for your ideas

3153
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:40,660
but usually you're just trying to make

3154
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:42,660
the point is you suck ass in your dipshit

3155
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,660
if the point you're trying to argue

3156
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,660
is that someone is an asshole

3157
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:48,660
calling them an asshole is very much

3158
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:50,660
in service of that and is not a fallacy

3159
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:52,660
I want to extend this a little bit

3160
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:54,660
out to just copy paste arguments

3161
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:56,660
in general which are all memes

3162
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:58,660
if you're copying and pasting

3163
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,660
some argument that is like

3164
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,660
the rhetoric that everyone else is using

3165
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:04,660
because like it's just

3166
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:06,660
it's very much with all the fallacies

3167
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:08,660
and everything

3168
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:10,660
I think the point of knowing the fallacies

3169
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,660
is understanding them

3170
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:14,660
it's not winning an argument by going

3171
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:16,660
you did adhamanim you lose

3172
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,660
it's like if you understand

3173
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:20,660
that kind of fallacy

3174
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,660
then maybe you can make an argument

3175
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:24,660
from the perspective of knowing that

3176
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:26,660
that's three times you said fallacy instead of fallacy

3177
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,660
I don't give a fuck

3178
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:30,660
I think fallacy sounds cooler

3179
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,660
let it go the first two times with the third one

3180
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:34,660
okay let's move on

3181
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:36,660
my point is that you don't need to

3182
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:38,660
just copy it

3183
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:40,660
I think probably one of the worst things

3184
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,660
that ever happened

3185
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:44,660
now that I'm thinking about it

3186
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:46,660
was Idea Channel made these little videos

3187
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,660
explaining fallacies

3188
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:50,660
and they encouraged people

3189
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:52,660
to take those and when someone

3190
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:54,660
makes that fallacy to link them to video

3191
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:56,660
and that is the

3192
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:58,660
total opposite of what you should be doing

3193
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,660
because every conversation is its own scenario

3194
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:02,660
knowing those things

3195
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:04,660
can help you to argue

3196
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:06,660
but in each individual scenario

3197
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,660
you don't go you broke the

3198
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:10,660
code of conduct

3199
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:12,660
there's a reason that rules are supposed to be flexible

3200
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:14,660
to that situation

3201
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:16,660
on the internet

3202
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:18,660
people are smarter than they are

3203
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:20,660
in your life

3204
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:22,660
comparatively speaking

3205
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,660
in terms of arguing

3206
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,660
people

3207
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:28,660
offline or at least around where I live

3208
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:30,660
people do ad hominems

3209
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:32,660
and red herrings all that kind of stuff

3210
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:34,660
it's because when you're doing it in a text medium

3211
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:36,660
you have time to think about your responses

3212
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:38,660
that's exactly what I mean

3213
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,660
I've almost never seen an ad hominem

3214
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:42,660
I see your point of view

3215
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:44,660
but I have the exact opposite conclusion

3216
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:46,660
people are smarter

3217
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,660
in real life when it comes to arguing

3218
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,660
because in real life they fight

3219
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:52,660
and they punch each other

3220
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:54,660
which I respect way more

3221
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:56,660
you know I might respect that more

3222
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,660
cherry picking

3223
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:00,660
debate fallacies out of a list that he found somewhere

3224
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:02,660
I respect

3225
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:04,660
cherry picking is a fallacy

3226
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:06,660
are you accusing him of a cherry picking fallacy

3227
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:08,660
I'm just going to bring up

3228
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:10,660
I'm accusing him of being dumb dipshits

3229
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,660
I'm going to bring up briefly

3230
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:14,660
ad hominem

3231
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:16,660
I don't want to focus on this too much

3232
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,660
but this whole copy paste argument thing

3233
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,660
I think this is exactly

3234
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:22,660
if I were to try to get to the heart

3235
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,660
of what bothers me about SJW

3236
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:26,660
what I think it actually is

3237
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:28,660
when it's a problem

3238
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:30,660
is when it's this

3239
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,660
it's when it's people who have read

3240
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,660
an argument on tumblr

3241
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:36,660
and they've decided it's true

3242
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:38,660
and they just keep repeating it all the time

3243
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:40,660
to every situation

3244
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:42,660
without actually

3245
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:44,660
the proliferation of toxic and problematic

3246
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:46,660
because those are the words

3247
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:48,660
if one of us makes a rape joke

3248
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:50,660
in this video and then someone comes in

3249
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:52,660
and they're not making an argument

3250
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:54,660
they're just pasting an argument for why it's wrong

3251
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:56,660
in all contexts that they got from tumblr

3252
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:58,660
and they'll copy paste their response

3253
02:01:58,660 --> 02:02:00,660
right in there

3254
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:02,660
I've seen so many times where it's like word for word

3255
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:04,660
something someone read somewhere

3256
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:06,660
and they've had that idea

3257
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:08,660
like when we talked about

3258
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:10,660
like Tom just the other day

3259
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:12,660
got some shit for saying rape in the video

3260
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:14,660
even though rape is defined

3261
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:16,660
in the way that he was intending to use it

3262
02:02:16,660 --> 02:02:18,660
so it's completely wrong

3263
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:20,660
and that's what happens when you're following

3264
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,660
the use of different words instead of actually

3265
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:24,660
looking into it

3266
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:26,660
the idea channel thing about link to anyone

3267
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:28,660
if they use a straw man or an ad hominem

3268
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:30,660
it's like I almost never see ad hominems

3269
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:32,660
I never see it online anyway

3270
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:34,660
so I don't know what the point of that video is

3271
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:36,660
you never see anyone call someone a fucking idiot online

3272
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:38,660
I just never see it used as a substitute

3273
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:40,660
for an actual argument except in the procrastinator's chat

3274
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:44,660
not even there really

3275
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:46,660
really not even there to be honest

3276
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:48,660
but what I see as fallacies

3277
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:50,660
it's a whole lot of really advanced versions

3278
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:52,660
of straw man

3279
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:54,660
or red herrings

3280
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:56,660
it's way more advanced stuff

3281
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,660
what the fuck is red herring

3282
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:00,660
a literary device

3283
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:02,660
no red herring was the bully on a pup named

3284
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:04,660
scooby-doo

3285
02:03:04,660 --> 02:03:06,660
they always talk about it

3286
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:08,660
it's usually like more

3287
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:10,660
specific more detailed fallacies

3288
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:12,660
that are more complicated

3289
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:14,660
you're being a real red herring right now

3290
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:16,660
this name was for red herring

3291
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:18,660
and fucking freddy

3292
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:20,660
freddy always thought it was red herring

3293
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:22,660
because he was a bully

3294
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:24,660
but then velma would always prove him wrong

3295
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:26,660
I've never heard of red herring

3296
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:28,660
you know really fred was the bully

3297
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:30,660
because red herring never did anything

3298
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:32,660
yeah

3299
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:34,660
yeah that's true

3300
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:36,660
I've also never seen a pup named scooby-doo

3301
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:38,660
munchie give us another meme that needs to die

3302
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:40,660
I'm not a fucking endless well of these things

3303
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:42,660
I ran out

3304
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:44,660
you said that you had like a hundred at the start

3305
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:46,660
you said you had a notebook

3306
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:48,660
no backlights

3307
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:50,660
on your fucking nintendo

3308
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:52,660
systems this happened like a

3309
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:54,660
million years ago but it's still relevant

3310
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:56,660
because I bought a gameboy sp and the backlight

3311
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:58,660
still isn't even good the best backlight

3312
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:00,660
is on the nintendo ds in fact the nintendo ds

3313
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:02,660
is the best gaming console ever

3314
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:04,660
well munchie handheld consoles

3315
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:06,660
in general are a meme that needs to die

3316
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:08,660
because it's gonna be worthless

3317
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:10,660
no no no

3318
02:04:10,660 --> 02:04:12,660
please let's not have this argument again

3319
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:14,660
we have like 20 minutes on this last part

3320
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,660
for no reason

3321
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:18,660
I just want to say that coming into this

3322
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,660
chat late I just

3323
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:22,660
I don't know if I love or hate that memes that

3324
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:24,660
need to die is basically just things we don't

3325
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:26,660
like

3326
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,660
it's not so much

3327
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:30,660
things we don't like as cultural

3328
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:32,660
ideas we don't like like things that a lot

3329
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:34,660
of people seem to believe in

3330
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:36,660
tomato tamada

3331
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:38,660
that's what memes are

3332
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:40,660
isn't there a whole part

3333
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:42,660
in metalgear solid about how like they hate memes

3334
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:44,660
because it's changing like wasn't that

3335
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,660
what metalgear 2 is about

3336
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:48,660
and then in rising they're all like we need to increase the memes

3337
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:50,660
which I wholeheartedly support

3338
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:52,660
wait what

3339
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,660
the plot of metalgear solid is

3340
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:56,660
the plot of metalgear solid is that memes will

3341
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:58,660
overtake everyone's minds

3342
02:04:58,660 --> 02:05:00,660
it's very comfortable nobody has individual thought

3343
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,660
it's amazing because it's slow

3344
02:05:02,660 --> 02:05:04,660
the Kirby games aren't supposed to be fast

3345
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:06,660
it's supposed to be enjoyable experience

3346
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:08,660
that's why Kirby 64 is the best game ever

3347
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:10,660
that I'm gonna come to your house and rip your balls off

3348
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:12,660
and have the best power the power combined thing is

3349
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,660
the meme that needs to come back to Kirby

3350
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:16,660
the meme that Kirby 64 doesn't rule

3351
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:18,660
I don't like that meme

3352
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:20,660
is that a meme who says that Kirby 64 is amazing

3353
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:22,660
everyone says it's too slow

3354
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:24,660
it's too slow

3355
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:26,660
it is too slow

3356
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,660
it's too much like the old ones

3357
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:30,660
when

3358
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,660
all you gotta do is click

3359
02:05:32,660 --> 02:05:34,660
harder on your stick and you'll run faster

3360
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:36,660
you can dash

3361
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:38,660
or you can just be a pro

3362
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:40,660
and just get firepower and use it for max speed

3363
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:42,660
harder on your stick

3364
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,660
how about the meme

3365
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:46,660
the meme that needs to die

3366
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:48,660
is the meme that Nintendo has never brought back

3367
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:50,660
the power combining from Kirby 64

3368
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:52,660
that's what Guy just said

3369
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:54,660
it's totally right

3370
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:56,660
it's a nightmare that they haven't

3371
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:58,660
and it's sheer laziness

3372
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:00,660
what I do like is that they make up new powers

3373
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:02,660
but the combining was the best thing ever

3374
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:04,660
that ever happened in my life

3375
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:06,660
Kirby game I played

3376
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:08,660
and every game that I play that doesn't have it

3377
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:10,660
it feels incomplete

3378
02:06:10,660 --> 02:06:12,660
in the one with the mice

3379
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:14,660
they had a thing

3380
02:06:14,660 --> 02:06:16,660
where you could combine powers

3381
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:18,660
but they didn't become new powers

3382
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:20,660
there were like four unique powers

3383
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:22,660
one was like fire sword or something

3384
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,660
but that's so weak

3385
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:26,660
it's super weak

3386
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:28,660
what they all need to do is make a new one

3387
02:06:28,660 --> 02:06:30,660
first Kirby game too and I was also disappointed

3388
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:32,660
is somebody now playing Kirby 64

3389
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:34,660
sounds like it

3390
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:36,660
what? oh sorry

3391
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:38,660
well guys

3392
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:40,660
I think we should move on to the

3393
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:42,660
what I know for a fact you will all agree

3394
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:44,660
let's move on to our final

3395
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,660
we need to have the final place

3396
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:48,660
which is the fact that we don't all have

3397
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,660
7 million subscribers

3398
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:52,660
each

3399
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:54,660
that's just the general idea

3400
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,660
and they have to be different subscribers

3401
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,660
that's a huge meme so everyone go to all of my patron

3402
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:00,660
go to patreon.com

3403
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:02,660
you'll find it on my page

3404
02:07:02,660 --> 02:07:04,660
give me all your money

3405
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:06,660
make me do shit because people

3406
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:08,660
one day we can all work together

3407
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:10,660
and make projects together

3408
02:07:10,660 --> 02:07:12,660
imagine how great that will be folks

3409
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,660
and I'll be the professional advertiser

3410
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:16,660
it hasn't heard the term that we use

3411
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:18,660
analysis HQ

3412
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:20,660
that's what we're going to call it

3413
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:22,660
it's going to be analysis HQ

3414
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:24,660
it's going to be where we're all teamed together

3415
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:26,660
okay fine

3416
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:28,660
that is the working title

3417
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:30,660
I want to call it the best buddies bungalow

3418
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:32,660
I like that

3419
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:34,660
the BBB

3420
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:36,660
the BBB I like it

3421
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:38,660
it'll be like the BBC

3422
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:40,660
I'm telling you guys if this ever happens

3423
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:42,660
over our office I'm going to make a wooden plaque

3424
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:44,660
and get mounted over the front door

3425
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:46,660
what about the procrastinator's pro tier

3426
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:48,660
paradise

3427
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:50,660
DCPTP

3428
02:07:50,660 --> 02:07:52,660
that could work

3429
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:54,660
I want you all to move

3430
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:56,660
into my house in Medford, Massachusetts

3431
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:58,660
I want you all to kill my

3432
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,660
downstairs neighbors

3433
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:02,660
and move into their apartment

3434
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:04,660
and I'll have the best time

3435
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:06,660
I'm serious everyone come live with me

3436
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:08,660
I know that DG is like pretty attached to his current lifestyle

3437
02:08:08,660 --> 02:08:10,660
I'm not

3438
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:12,660
and then I'm going to live with Victor and you guys have to come into Victor's house

3439
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:14,660
like um

3440
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:16,660
I don't know I don't think most people know this

3441
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:18,660
but my internet really sucks because I live in a rural neighborhood

3442
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:20,660
so I can only upload youtube videos

3443
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:22,660
like in the middle of the night

3444
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:24,660
it sucks I can't

3445
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,660
it's a shame that DG has a family

3446
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:28,660
and I don't

3447
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:30,660
but you have a family

3448
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:32,660
Jesus

3449
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:34,660
my family is a disappointment

3450
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:36,660
your family exists though

3451
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:38,660
you don't not have a family

3452
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:40,660
they just aren't very great

3453
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:42,660
well

3454
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:44,660
I think it's only fair

3455
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:46,660
to make it fair that we make DG's family

3456
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:48,660
as shitty as Jesse's is

3457
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:50,660
to equal everybody out

3458
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:52,660
it's the only way to be fair

3459
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:54,660
let's put fluoride

3460
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:56,660
in Vic's drinking water

3461
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:58,660
hey my family is awesome

3462
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:00,660
they just can't deal with bad words

3463
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:02,660
that's the only reason I need to get out of here

3464
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:04,660
fair enough that's a fair reason

3465
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:06,660
I just can't

3466
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:08,660
man I can't deal with this slow internet bullshit

3467
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:10,660
it's bad I can't deal with it

3468
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,660
I gotta move I'll live in a freaking bunker

3469
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:14,660
in like a triple bunk bed

3470
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,660
with nine people on it if I have to

3471
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,660
whatever it takes

3472
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:20,660
to have a new life

3473
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:22,660
I'm with you dude

3474
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:24,660
so everyone shake things up man

3475
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:26,660
shake it off like Taylor Swift

3476
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:28,660
okay that's gonna do it

3477
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:30,660
no no no no no

3478
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:32,660
it's a me

3479
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:34,660
alright munchie go

3480
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:36,660
one final meme to rule them all

3481
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:38,660
oh no that's the game that she'll not be mentioned

3482
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:40,660
the worst meme ever

3483
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:42,660
Undertale

3484
02:09:42,660 --> 02:09:44,660
it's the best game ever

3485
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:46,660
and the worst meme ever

3486
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:48,660
that's true and if you want to prove it

3487
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:50,660
watch the new video that I just came out with the other day

3488
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:52,660
it is the by far the best Undertale video ever made

3489
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:54,660
and I hope you'll watch it

3490
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:56,660
and see that I am the best

3491
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:58,660
give me all your money

3492
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:00,660
okay we've covered that point

3493
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:02,660
we've covered that point thoroughly previously

3494
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,660
so now we are officially done

3495
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:06,660
we're wrapping it up okay

3496
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:08,660

3497
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:10,660

3544
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:08,660

3545
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:10,660
