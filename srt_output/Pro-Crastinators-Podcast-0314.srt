1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It went from cold enough that I have to put on pants over my shorts to walk around outside

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to it's hot and I need to install my air conditioner soon.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I don't like that.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, how does that happen?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The planets flying through space and then all of a sudden it's like completely different.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're really in like one damn.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's just like just a little bit closer and suddenly it's much hotter.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And now it's gonna be 80 degrees for the next two weeks or whatever.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Something, air currents, equator, sun rays, blah, that's how it works.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, you see the sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Brilliant, dazzling.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Really fucking fat and should lose some weight.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You ever see, you know, what do they call it when the sun shoots out fucking photons?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Plasma jets and then they get trapped at the north and south pole.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The Aurora Borealis in this part of the country and this time of year.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, at Astro Camp we would show videos about space to children and some of them showed, you know, the sun emitting,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I forget what it's called when the sun gives like a gust of like plasma out into space.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Solar flare?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't think it's a-

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Coronal mass ejection, CME?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, I think that's it.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, not a flare, not a flare.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The mass ejection.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And we would show a video of like a 3D simulation of it like, ooh, the mass ejection is going through space.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, but what's this?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Earth's magnetic field traps it at the north and south poles.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How majestic.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And sometimes if the counselors are from like a religious school, they would say like,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you see kids, that weird magic thing that just happened, that was probably God.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That was probably God protecting the Earth, the magnetic fields.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Protecting the Earth from the gaze, that's right.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right, first from the magnetic, first from the coronal mass ejection and then-

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Wait, this is great, I'm a genius.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He's protecting Earth from the L, Bs, Ts, Qs and the Cs, M, Es.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All of the letters.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's great, I'm great.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's really cool seeing those videos showing like, because I don't think the Earth's been hit directly by a CME since like for about a, maybe not a hundred years or about that much.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I would imagine it's pretty rare.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, fucked up the Earth's magnetic field enough that like it started a few like fires and like electrical, not even electrical like stuff,

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but like if you had like metal, like if you were holding a metal fork, you'd get like a little, little zap from it sort of thing.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Good fuck up computers, pretty bad.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If it happened now, which people think, people are like really worried, it would be like apocalyptic level if that happened,

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but like, like, you know, all the electricity grids going out, but honestly, it'd be fine.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Because we have pretty good monitoring on the sun and like, I've looked into it and most places like, yeah, we'd have like a couple days warning.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We could, we'd just have to temporarily shut some, shut some stuff down and we'd be fine sort of deal.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hmm.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So five whole seconds the internet didn't work the whole way around the world.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And that was it.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And see the YouTube video talking about it already.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All the nukes launch simultaneously.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, as, as, you know, the classic technology of needing electricity to not shoot the nukes as soon as the electricity fails, off they go.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Cause it's all, it's all linked, it's all hooked up to Facebook now.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, it all works on the app.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So it's a, instead of like two keys that like the president and the vice president have to insert in a big like desk and turn in at the same time,

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
they both just have to open up the app on their, on their, on their dang mobile phones and hit the okay button at the same time.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it's just screws it all up.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a big mistake.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's both butt dialed at the same time.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Cause they were doing a butt bounce and they had their phones in their pockets as they do.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Like you do.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Classic presidential butt bounce parties.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Those are very normal.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Welcome to the procrastinators podcast.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Welcome to the procrastinators podcast.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We're live and we're alive.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And what a time to be alive.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, did you, did any, either of you watch the Eurovision song contest?

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I doubt it, but maybe, maybe it's a big thing elsewhere.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not sure.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Not for me.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's a, if you don't know, it's a contest that held across Europe where each country in Europe and also Australia for some reason puts forth a song,

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
dance number, and they compete to see who's the best one.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nice.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And it's often very political.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And for the last like 10 years, the UK has consistently been in like the last few spots during Brexit or just around that time.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We got zero points, which is like, they have like a two tiered points giving system where every country votes.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They give like the judges from each country.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They have like a delegation and they also have the public vote from that country.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And we got zero in one year.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think it was last year.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, nothing.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was crazy, but completely expected because nobody likes us.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But this year, this year, first of all, Russia was banned because of obvious reasons.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And Ukraine got a big voter turnout.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Everyone was voting for Ukraine.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They had a pretty good song as well.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And that won.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But second place was the UK, which is completely insane.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, you got robbed.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You got robbed by those dang Ukrainians just because they had a war or something.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, it's funny.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think the reason we got second place was because we were like helping.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Really?

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think there's definitely politics involved.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Man, it used to be about the music, man.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, it never was.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was never about the music.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, maybe it was at some point back in peacetime where people just like ABBA came from Eurovision.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That was like Sweden, I think.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They became big.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And that's like, oh, ABBA, you know them?

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They're pretty big.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't remember any others that came from Eurovision.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't remember it always being political, but it's often got a lot of politics in it.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But the English song, Sam Ryder, I think, he had a good song and he was really fun and energetic

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and people seemed to enjoy his presence.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then also politics.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So it was just sort of like, it worked out.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And now I'm a nationalist now.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I love the UK because we won a competition basically.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We got so many points, the number went up so high.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And now I feel proud to have been born in some arbitrary location.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And it feels great.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Finally, something had to do it.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You know who felt proud to be born in a location?

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's that guy who shot all those people on Saturday.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Did you hear about that?

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I heard about it.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I haven't looked into it yet.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's pretty bad.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's pretty bad.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's about as bad as it gets.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Guys literally just like black people's existence in America is an act of violence against the white race

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and they must die.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And that's it.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Supposedly.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I mean, I don't have this confirmed, but my friend told me about the shooting yesterday,

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
less than an hour after.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He livestreamed it on Twitch.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Supposedly this is the guy's Twitter account.

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I mean, I don't have a source, but would be crazy if true.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No! No!

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's so true that...

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's that image?

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Like the big brony in 2012 or whatever.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And there's like the two parts.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
One is the nice castle, one is the evil castle.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
On the left, it's like become trans on the right.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's become white supremacist and there's no in between.

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's literally true.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There's no way.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's no way.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It can't be true.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Ben, being a fence sitter once again, gotta pick one.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It can't.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Gotta pick Ben.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Possibly.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Never.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You look good with big titties, Ben.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That artist knew.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Damn good stuff.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, I know.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I know.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I might join in.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I might draw the both of you with big old boobas at some point.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Please.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That would be...

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That would be harassment, but maybe I like it.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's harassment.

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think I'm gonna take it though.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's not like I can do anything about it.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Ben, there's a subway sandwich confirmed.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Domino's Peach Subway Sandwich.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Fucking brands and sexual things combined.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm looking at this guy's Twitter banner.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh god.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Nice.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm over it.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
All right.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Damn.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We were talking about space earlier.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know if that's...

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That was like before the intro, so I don't know if that's staying in or not, but...

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sure.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
One of my topics is space related.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't remember if I've discussed this on the show before, maybe I have.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Big, funny fucking telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope is pretty cool.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's the sequel to the Hubble Space Telescope.

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh yeah.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sure.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Crazy, crazy fucking piece of engineering.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I read about it on Wikipedia in like 2015 and even back then.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wait, wait, wait.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Keep talking, but do a Tom Scott voice.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Tom Scott?

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I've...

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've...

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've...

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I can't fucking...

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No, it's not too bad.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's pretty close.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't know.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's just this crazy fucking gigantic piece of shit in space that's really cool.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I like it.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And it started...

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm in space and this crazy gigantic fucking piece of shit telescope.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's so cool.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I saw a...

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I saw a...

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I saw a supercut of like Tom Scott saying like, I'm in blank location.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah.

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it was...

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And it was like...

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The caption was like, this is like the level progression of a Kirby game.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And it's like, I'm here.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like, I'm here in the rolling hills of Ireland.

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm down here in the bowels of the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm about to get shot with a gun.

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm about to cross a street.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm here with John.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Say hi, John.

227
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, I found it.

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, the Kirby level with John.

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, so we need Tom Scott.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm in space.

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm about to fucking die.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't breathe.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But look at this funny fucking camera on this funny telescope.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
All right, I'm curious.

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This telescope looks like something that I saw...

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Was it called again?

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The James Webb Space Telescope.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So...

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It looks like something I saw being talked about in a Smarter Every Day video.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But it might not be.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It was a...

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Look at this honeycomb looking ass.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Destin from Smarter Every Day.

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
His dad worked on the telescope, which is really, really fucking cool.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because this telescope's been in development for 20 years,

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
cost $20 billion or some shit to develop.

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When I was reading the Wikipedia page for it in 2015,

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
when I first learned about it,

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was seeing all this shit about,

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
have I had to invent entire new camera technology

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that was completely different from stuff that we had used before,

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and then reinventing it again when they realized they could do it better.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is the most fucked up looking device I've ever seen.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It has to look that way so that one,

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
they can fold it up and fit it inside of a rocket

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because it's fucking gigantic.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I think the...

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, the thing was like...

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The things they need for it to be

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
is extremely lightweight and portable and compactable.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
When you think of science fiction fantasy ships,

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
they're always a rigid structure.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
People in science fiction are like,

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
well, in the future, you just take off and keep going

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and gravity's not even really a big deal.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But in reality, things look so much weirder and more alien.

268
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's just really expensive to get something out of Earth's gravity well

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and into orbit just because it just takes a lot of energy to do that.

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, this isn't even in orbit.

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is at the Ville Grange point.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I think it's like a million miles away from Earth.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's orbiting an empty patch of space

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
where the Earth's gravity and the Sun's gravity cancel out or something.

275
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's a weird thing,

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but that giant metal diamond shape is a sun shield.

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think that's the thing that Destin, from Smarter Every Day,

278
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
his dad worked on the sun shield,

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
which is this huge complicated, unfolding sail that has five layers.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The gaps in between the layers have to be shaped perfectly

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
so that any radiation that is generated inside

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
will be directed outwards

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
so that way the telescope can be cold

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
because it has to be a couple degrees above absolute zero in order to work.

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because it's an infrared telescope

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and if it has any heat, it'll start radiating itself

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and it'll create noise.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Makes sense, yeah.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, so this launched in December.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was fucking so hyped for it, everything went good,

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and they've been setting it up,

292
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
unfolding it, unpacking it, aligning the mirrors.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And the first few images have started coming through

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and they're fucking so good.

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm going to post one of them here in a second.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is actually a comparison

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
of an older radio telescope compared to this one,

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
so that's a little comparison video I made this morning.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The resolution on that is...

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Dude, that res-

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Pretty fucking crazy.

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can put that on the front cover of a video game about space.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, good.

304
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And the video doesn't even...

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When I made that video, I think the video was 1080p,

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
but I had to zoom the image out to only one third of a size

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to even fit on 1080p.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's very high resolution.

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And you can see all these galaxies and stuff.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's an extreme lens flare.

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's an interesting pattern.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, it's hexagonal, due to the shape of the mirrors.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's why there's six.

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then the two smaller spokes are due to the arms holding up the mirror, I think.

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Or something like that.

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So that was from March.

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then more recently, there was another image I'm posting, a comparison.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's just crazy how good the fucking camera on this is.

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That looks so cool.

320
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We're going to see so much fucking space.

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We're going to be able to see galaxies we've never seen before,

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
because it's infrared.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It can see all the really far away early galaxies that have been redshifted.

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's just going to be really cool.

325
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And I can't wait for them to start doing science with it,

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
because I'm a big fucking space head and a nerd and a piece of shit.

327
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I love this stuff.

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I guess I didn't really know that about you until fairly recently.

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What a nerd.

330
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm a big space nerd.

331
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You like large celestial bodies and large women.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Large celestial bodies.

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Cool.

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Funny voicemails last week.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, with the Celestia, with fucking Ben St.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, that was great.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right, yeah.

338
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Perhaps the saga will continue.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Celestia's hot, though.

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Phantom horn, I think so.

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I agree with Phantom horn.

342
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Phantom horn would be hotter if

343
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
he had big fucking tits though, let's be honest.

344
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Sure, I mean, absolutely.

345
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No argument here.

346
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No arguments.

347
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Speaking of large things,

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
was that image of the black hole that came not so long ago?

349
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Was that from this, or is it from something else?

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, that was from...

351
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I forget what the telescope's called.

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The telescope is an amalgamation of the entire Earth being used as a telescope.

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So yeah.

354
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That was a picture of the black telescopes.

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That was a picture of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, right?

356
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I feel like a couple years ago, I saw a very similar picture.

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So there's two black hole images, the one from a couple years ago

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and the one from a few days ago.

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The first one I posted is from the Milky Way.

361
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That black hole is about a thousand times smaller

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
than the one from a few years ago, but it's also a thousand times closer.

363
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So they look about the same size.

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I see.

365
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But because it's smaller, the stuff orbiting it is moving way faster

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
relative to what we're looking at, which is why it looks blurrier.

367
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hmm.

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But yeah.

369
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Those three little things are moving around.

370
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, those blobs.

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's the accretion disk that everyone's always talking about.

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah.

373
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, and due to the gravitational distortion,

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
it pretty much always looks like a ring no matter what angle you look at it from,

375
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
which is wild.

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But yeah, so the way that works is they have a bunch of radio telescopes

377
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
all over the world at different locations,

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and they basically have all the telescopes look at the same patch at the same time.

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
As the Earth is like rotating over a period of like maybe six hours.

380
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So basically each telescope across the world kind of traces a line through the sky

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
as the Earth rotates, and they kind of combine all of that information

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to create the final image at the end.

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So is that because if you look at a black hole, you'll see nothing?

384
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Because it's a black hole?

385
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, the reason they do take the image that way

386
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
is to get the resolution required, because it's so far away

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that you need a telescope the size of the Earth in order to be able to see it.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Could the James Webb one take a picture like this?

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The James Webb, I mean, earlier posted an image of the size of the mirror.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The mirror's not big enough to resolve something like that.

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, you mean like all of the telescopes on the surface of the Earth

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
like making up like together they like create a telescope

393
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
sort of that is the same like size as the Earth,

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and that's like a big circle now using that?

395
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, basically.

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It is a really good Veritasium video recently that explained it.

397
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This is our B-hole?

398
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
B-hole, exactly.

399
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Very mature. Let's try to be serious about this, shall we?

400
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hmm, this is just like Spore.

401
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You're just like Spore.

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We have the greatest game ever made.

403
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't believe Ben St was a Spore creation that got out of the machine.

404
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's fucked up that I did that.

405
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It is fucked up.

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What the fuck?

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
At 10 minutes 30 seconds you can see like each telescope for reasons can only really see like a band of lines on its own,

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but when you combine the constructive interference of all those things together,

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
it like creates the image,

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and at 1030 there's like a good visualization of that.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is it just because like it's so faint that like a single telescope can't pick it up,

412
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
or is it that it's too small?

413
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's that it's like the angular size of it on the sky is like really tiny.

414
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah.

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In terms of like how many like degrees and arc milliseconds and shit.

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Gotcha.

417
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Space.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Guys, the limit and space is the place.

419
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh, yeah.

420
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is not exactly related, but I can pretend it is.

421
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I saw that movie yesterday.

422
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Everything everywhere all at once.

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, yeah.

424
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I guess it was pretty good.

425
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I liked it.

426
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What is that?

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I think I've heard one other person mention the word and I was like,

428
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Haha, you saw everything?

429
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Like what do you mean?

430
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How to explain it without, it's about like,

431
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
it's about a woman who starts basically she gets in contact with like other versions

432
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
of like herself and like her husband from like other universes where like different.

433
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, so it's like home stuff where different possibilities happened.

434
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's like, it's like every, every different like way that her life could have gone.

435
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
All started like home stuck.

436
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes, it's just like home stuck.

437
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
All right, I'll go.

438
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Whoa, a picture of a black hole.

439
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's like home stuck.

440
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah.

441
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
A big mirror in space.

442
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's just like home stuck.

443
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

444
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I remember.

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh yeah, I remember.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's pretty good.

447
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Little green man turns into a big green man.

448
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I've now seen like home stuck, but no, it's the Hulk.

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I've now seen two movies this year, which is a lot for me.

450
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So that's pretty good.

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm proud of you, Ben.

452
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Thanks.

453
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm getting cultured.

454
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm getting in.

455
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No, wait, three because I also watched a fucking watch that one liberal movie.

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't look up.

457
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I watched.

458
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't look up.

459
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Don't look up on things.

460
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That one was all right.

461
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I guess.

462
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, I see.

463
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's three movies.

464
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's crazy.

465
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It never happens.

466
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The last movie I saw was episode five of Better Call Saul season six.

467
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I think you're going to say Star Wars.

468
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
No.

469
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's funny.

470
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Like almost all of my best friends have never seen Star Wars.

471
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Like any of them at all.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, like just most of the people who become my friends are people who just haven't seen

473
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Star Wars.

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And it's just a coincidence, I guess.

475
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
When I was a kid, it was pretty ubiquitous.

476
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Like I just saw Star Wars because like someone put it on somewhere.

477
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, yeah.

478
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I basically had no choice.

479
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I couldn't avoid it.

480
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Growing up, everyone had seen Star Wars.

481
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's just all the friends that I have now haven't.

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And I don't know how that happened.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That is odd.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Kai hasn't seen it.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Foras hasn't seen it.

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Maid hasn't seen it.

487
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I was never a big, huge fan.

488
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I always thought that was fine.

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
C.T.O.L. had never seen it.

490
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Wow.

491
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Maybe it's creative people.

492
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Maybe creative people don't see Star Wars.

493
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Maybe there's a connection there.

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I was cursed.

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I was cursed by having seen Star Wars and I can never make anything good.

496
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That explains it.

497
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

498
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh.

499
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I only make good things because I work so hard despite having seen Star Wars.

500
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You've got to break through the conditioning.

501
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It would be so much easier if only it had never happened but alas.

502
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh, I'm looking at Bitcoin.

503
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, no.

504
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's fallen.

505
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, we know that.

506
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Let it fall forever.

507
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's doing real bad lately and I think that's pretty funny.

508
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Let all those billions disappear.

509
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah.

510
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Let everyone cry.

511
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's up.

512
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I mean, it's up a bit from like two days ago but like overall it's way down.

513
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So that's great.

514
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I have like, I think I have like maybe $50 worth of Bitcoin in still in my wallet.

515
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So, oops, whatever.

516
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Whoops.

517
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah.

518
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I guess it'll just stay there and dissolve, boil away like alcohol on a Bunsen burner.

519
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Or alcohol.

520
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And bringing it back in my stomach.

521
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I drank some Everclear the other night and boy, was that a mistake.

522
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What's Everclear?

523
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Everclear is like, it's like pure grain alcohol.

524
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Like nothing to it just entirely like ethanol.

525
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You're just downing.

526
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes.

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Like 190 proof.

528
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I mixed it really, really thin with seltzer water.

529
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And I just tried sipping it and it's still, I had a terrible hangover the next day.

530
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Why would you do this?

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't know.

532
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I don't know.

533
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I just had some, I had some for cooking reasons, for candy reasons.

534
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I was like, what if I drank it?

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Well, now I know.

536
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I shouldn't have.

537
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's less than learned.

538
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Less than learned.

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
All this talk is making me thirsty.

540
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm gonna drink some water.

541
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm gonna drink some Everclear.

542
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No, Ben, you instantly forgot your lesson.

543
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So tasty.

544
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Gonna get all drunk like the Simsies friends who called in last episode.

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I would hate to make a fool of myself like they did.

546
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Making a voicemail for the progress in his podcast.

547
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I mean, could you imagine?

548
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Dude, terrible.

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I would never do that.

550
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
All right, so I wrote this down.

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yesterday when I listened to that episode, I wanted to be caught up.

552
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Someone mentioned something about Simsies penis being mentioned on the show or something.

553
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't remember exactly what the context was, but I fucking swear.

554
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I have to confirm with someone else unless I'm hallucinating this memory.

555
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Didn't Simsie post his dick on Twitter at some point?

556
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Huh?

557
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I mean, that's in my recollection.

558
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I fucking swear he did.

559
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I fucking swear I've seen Simsies penis on Twitter.

560
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have such a clear memory of this.

561
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And if I'm wrong, that's really concerning.

562
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I mean, the only funny one of those happenings I can think of is Mike Mate.

563
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But I don't think it was his penis in the end.

564
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I just remember the penis, the head of the dick was as bald as Simsie's head.

565
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's what I remember.

566
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, maybe it was just Simsie's head.

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Maybe you saw Simsie and you thought that that was the penis.

568
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I just saw his dick and I'm like, wow, it looks so much like your face.

569
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't know what to say.

570
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It feels like a dream.

571
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It feels like this didn't happen.

572
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But I can't, I remember.

573
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, I'm fine to think that you hallucinated this.

574
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I swear.

575
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Simsie and Simsie's like, yeah, I posted my dick on Twitter.

576
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I want to see it.

577
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm like, sure.

578
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And he sent me a Twitter link.

579
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah.

580
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I mean, maybe hallucinated the whole thing.

581
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I guess everyone attacks Simsie.

582
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I mean, I could message him, but no, I can't do that.

583
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Well, now it's live on the podcast.

584
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Now it's libel.

585
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Now it's libel.

586
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah.

587
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Wait, I have an image of Simsie that looks like a penis.

588
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Why?

589
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Because it looked funny and I saved it.

590
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
God, where is it?

591
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay.

592
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There it is.

593
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I cut out his head.

594
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But yeah, he posted that somewhere and I thought, ha, ha, you know.

595
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
At least I put that in the corner and keep it there the whole episode.

596
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It looks like, oh, it looks like that when you fight that boss in Lisa the Painful, the

597
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,500
one that's just a sticky, but he's like a big like phallic, like a like pole, like sticking

598
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
out of the ground.

599
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
He's just huge.

600
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,000
I do not remember everything from Lisa, but that does sound legally familiar.

601
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
In like a dream sequence, you fight basically sticky, sticky, sticky's head.

602
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,500
Not his, not the dad.

603
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,240
You fight like either that one of the dad's friends, the one that he thinks has like kidnapped

604
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:51,940
and molested Lisa, or not Lisa, a buddy, yeah, his like huge head and it's a big spherical

605
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:59,240
cylindrical round on the top thing and that's, that's why that's right.

606
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Amazing.

607
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,740
I'm downloading the voicemails, by the way, just so you know, I'm working on it.

608
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Nice.

609
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,240
I've had some bullshit to deal with regarding getting to America.

610
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Yeah.

611
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Getting to America COVID thing.

612
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Yeah.

613
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,840
You still have to have, like I said last time, I didn't know exactly, but it was indeed that

614
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:36,480
I have to like take a video call with a professional who watches me or directs me to use a specific

615
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,060
test, which I have to buy myself and have it sent to me, which I've done.

616
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
I have it.

617
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,700
I have to take the test no more than one day before the flight.

618
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,620
And so I had to, I had to book a consultation with the thing.

619
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,900
And then I, that they're going to call me on my phone or whatever.

620
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,900
I don't know how this is going to work.

621
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,340
I think they have a link that so I can do on my, on my computer and I think I have my

622
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,680
webcam, so it should all be fine.

623
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:15,880
But I had to pay money to do this test and have the consultation have them say, yes,

624
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,760
you took the test correctly.

625
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,560
Now please give us the results that you find on the test, give us a screenshot.

626
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:29,320
We'll verify it by comparing the screenshot evidence with the fact that you were with

627
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,060
the consultation and then we'll send you a thing that says you are guaranteed, have

628
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,820
taken a test.

629
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:47,020
And then I have to bring that along with a verify app thing, like an app thing.

630
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,740
I have to download, I need to download an app and then register so that that is verified

631
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,180
so I can just go up to them and say, okay, here's my passport, here's my ticket, here's

632
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,800
my verify app and also here's my fucking other thing and there we go.

633
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,720
And then they say, get on the ground and kill me anyway.

634
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,640
Get on the ground, because you're British, like, wait a minute, you're British, die.

635
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,280
You don't need any more of your kind, America.

636
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,280
We don't serve your kind, yeah.

637
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,680
Why do they have a British accent when they're doing that?

638
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
He's a trader.

639
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
No.

640
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,180
We don't serve my kind.

641
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
He puts a gun to his head.

642
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,680
That sounds like it sucks.

643
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:45,680
It was, honestly, as long as the video call isn't annoying, it'll be smooth enough.

644
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:53,580
But the websites, like the British Airways and the government website for the US and

645
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,080
the government website for the UK where I'm like, what do I need to do?

646
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,080
I Google it, I look like, please tell me what to do and they just don't really tell me.

647
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,080
So I had to go to a random YouTube video where a guy is just saying like a human person in

648
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,580
a way I can understand.

649
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,580
You need to book a thing with a third party company.

650
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,080
Obviously in a government website, for some reason they just can't say that.

651
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,580
They just say you need to have proof of this type of a test, no more than one day before

652
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
the flight.

653
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,580
They don't tell you, they don't give you any indication that there's like companies for

654
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,580
that.

655
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,580
I didn't know how to do it until I found a guy and he just said, use this service.

656
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
And I did.

657
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,580
And I assume because of how complicated it is, I assume that when I get to the airport,

658
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,380
there's going to be like the vast majority of people getting ready to fly are going to

659
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:54,080
be like blindsided by this because it's so obtuse, like they're going to be like, what?

660
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
What do I need?

661
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,280
I didn't know I needed that.

662
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,180
And then there's going to be like a very, very expensive in airport version of the thing

663
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,480
I did where they're going to be grumbling and being paying like a load of money for

664
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,040
this thing.

665
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,480
And then they take the test and then it gets verified and they're like, fucking stupid,

666
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
bullshit, COVID.

667
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
I hate everything.

668
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,080
And then they're going to be grumbling through the flight.

669
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,480
I feel like that's definitely going to happen.

670
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,780
So hopefully this is the least trouble version of the things that could have happened.

671
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,480
Oh, yeah, that's that's COVID.

672
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,980
Hopefully hopefully COVID goes away soon.

673
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:42,880
I yeah, you know, I'm looking at the numbers and they're going up and I don't like it.

674
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,180
I don't like it at all.

675
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,680
That makes me upset, but I don't know what to do about it.

676
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,580
You got to get the mask gun.

677
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,980
You got to shoot masks onto people's faces when they're not wearing them.

678
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Hold on.

679
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,220
Like a slingshot, like a sling, like you swing it around your head and then you throw it

680
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,980
and it's like the force of its spinning motion and it whaps onto their head and it ties itself

681
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,740
around the back of their head.

682
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,080
And then they're like, oh, I can't breathe and they die.

683
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,480
Other cases in the US are going up, not as dramatic.

684
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,080
They're going up more dramatically in Massachusetts specifically.

685
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,280
I think in New York as well.

686
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
That's bad.

687
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Pretty bad.

688
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,680
I mean, is the vaccination rate high?

689
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Yeah.

690
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,980
So it's just just one of those things.

691
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,480
Just one of those things.

692
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Yeah.

693
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,480
The vaccination rate is quite high in Massachusetts.

694
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:51,360
Well, if the worst-case scenario happens, I mean, the worst-case scenario is I get COVID

695
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,360
before I fly and I can't even see anyone.

696
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,080
But other than that, if I land and then I catch COVID, at least I won't die.

697
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,980
I'm pretty happy to know that I'm just going to have a bit of a sniffle for a while and

698
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,820
that's about it.

699
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,820
Most likely.

700
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
I mean, you'll feel bad.

701
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,540
Yeah, it's going to hurt.

702
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:18,500
It's not unlike a fever, it's not unlike a terrible annoyance, and I'm going to feel

703
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,060
like shit.

704
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:30,100
But the threat of death being mostly gone, very, very much gone from catching COVID, is

705
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,700
alleviated a lot of fears I would have had.

706
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,940
If I catch it, eh, I'll just try to keep to myself.

707
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,100
And make sure no one else does.

708
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,980
My parents got the second booster.

709
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,300
I want the second booster, but I guess they're not, it's not available to just anyone yet.

710
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
So.

711
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Ah.

712
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Oh well.

713
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
What can I do?

714
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,860
You just got to boost jump into the hospital and steal it.

715
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Oh.

716
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,860
Okay.

717
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,620
You got to clip through the wall.

718
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:08,300
I guess I will, then.

719
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Thanks.

720
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,800
No problem.

721
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,300
It's my advice show.

722
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Yeah.

723
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Fucking.

724
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,900
On the topic of that, since I caught it the last time, my voice, I realized yesterday

725
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,300
that my voice is a little bit fucked.

726
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,300
You think?

727
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,180
I can't do high-pitched sounds anymore.

728
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,860
I noticed that when I was sick, I couldn't do the VemSnakes voice while I was on the

729
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,620
PCP for that big reveal episode.

730
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,660
I couldn't do the voice.

731
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,420
And I can do it again, but anything higher than VemSnakes, I can't do anymore.

732
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,300
And it sucks.

733
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,300
I notice sometimes I find myself not able to do a high-pitched noise that I feel like

734
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,740
I used to be able to do.

735
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,060
But I'll try it right now.

736
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
I'm doing it.

737
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,620
And now I can do it pretty fine.

738
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,620
That's pretty good.

739
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,580
Oh, that's completely not getting picked up by your mic.

740
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
You can't hear.

741
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,100
Oh, I heard the beginning of it.

742
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
That's the best I could do.

743
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Oh, that's the best I could do.

744
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,300
And you drowned out.

745
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,780
It must be the noise.

746
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,860
It's probably getting picked up by the microphone.

747
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,700
It's just discord noise filter.

748
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Maybe.

749
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Funny.

750
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,140
This cord is pretty high.

751
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,300
It's discriminatory against people with squeaky voice.

752
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Yes, die.

753
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,980
People discriminatory against TH versus F sounds, apparently, too.

754
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,580
Oh, yeah.

755
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,620
That one was Smailer who called me cute.

756
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
How dare they do that?

757
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,980
Did they call you cute at the same time?

758
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,540
This is making fun of your dialect.

759
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,540
My dialect?

760
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
I don't know.

761
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,740
It's not because of where I'm from, because people in New Zealand, once or twice, I had

762
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,740
a friend who would make fun of me.

763
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:04,220
They'd be like, oh, say thick, and I'm like, thick, and I'd say some word of letter F and

764
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
I'd say it.

765
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,220
And they'd be like, haha, what the fuck?

766
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,220
You say it wrong.

767
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
And I'm like, OK, how do you say it?

768
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,300
And then they make the same sound twice.

769
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,700
And I don't get it.

770
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,100
I know there's a difference between TH and F.

771
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,820
That's like when you sound the same when people try to correct me.

772
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,980
When someone tries to explain how to correctly pronounce Chinese and I literally can't hear

773
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,900
the difference between the two things, because Chinese just has sounds in it that I just

774
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,740
don't recognize as phonemes that a person can make when speaking.

775
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,060
I always felt like the TH is F thing was like a British thing.

776
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:52,020
If I say 43 instead of 43, I'd say 43.

777
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,340
I guess I do the E thing as well.

778
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,540
I'd leave out the T. 43 quid.

779
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,140
43 quid.

780
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,180
As I understand it, the difference, TH just has slightly more emphasis.

781
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:12,340
When I pronounce the sound, I kind of push my teeth a little closer together, maybe.

782
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,060
But the end result kind of sounds the same.

783
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,620
I just, TH is more slurred for me, at least.

784
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
Thrush.

785
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:24,500
I feel like it's interchangeable depending on, yeah, I feel like it's interchangeable

786
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,140
depending on how much emphasis I want to use.

787
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:33,060
If I'm calling someone fat, I'm going to really draw out that F sound and then maybe it sounds

788
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,580
more like a TH, I don't know.

789
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,580
Say thick fighters.

790
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:46,260
Thick fighters, thick fighters, thick fighters.

791
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,500
I have to deliberately press my teeth together if I'm trying to announce it correctly, but

792
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,940
if I'm just talking normally, I don't give a fuck.

793
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,940
I don't give a fuck.

794
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,940
I don't give a fuck.

795
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,020
I don't give a fuck about fat.

796
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:09,500
Yeah, now you're using the PH levels are high.

797
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:16,220
The PH levels are high, that reminds me of gummy worms and about pectin.

798
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,180
And everything I learned about pectin.

799
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,300
Did I talk last week about that?

800
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,780
You talked about gummies, I don't remember exactly.

801
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,140
You talked about gummies last week.

802
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,140
You talked about...

803
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,980
Did I talk about that YouTube channel, The Modernist Pantry?

804
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,140
No, I don't think so.

805
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:35,340
Well, I found a YouTube channel that is about...

806
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,740
There's a brand of ingredients you can buy on Amazon.

807
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,740
I see them all the time.

808
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,380
They're kind of expensive, but they're also the only people that sell certain things.

809
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,940
They're called The Modernist Pantry, and they have a YouTube channel that I found a video

810
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:54,620
on there that's like everything to do with gummies, and they talk about gelatin, they

811
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,820
talk about pectin.

812
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,620
They have other videos that are like specifically going into the details of different kinds

813
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:06,660
of pectin, and why some need sugar and acid, and others need calcium, and stuff like that.

814
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,540
And it's like this is exactly what I wanted to know.

815
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,140
And these videos are like new.

816
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,980
They were made like a couple months ago.

817
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:20,300
This information didn't exist online like two years ago when I was like first starting

818
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,460
my gummy journey.

819
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,780
Anyway, I have...

820
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
I keep...

821
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,140
Man, I tried to duplicate a recipe.

822
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,300
I made a batch a while ago, and I was like, that recipe came out good.

823
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,020
I'm going to make it again.

824
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,420
And I was like, okay, I'm going to do that exact same thing.

825
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,740
And I made that exact same recipe, and it came out different.

826
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,980
With different consistency.

827
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,660
And I'm so confused sometimes.

828
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,100
Sometimes I just don't know what's going on.

829
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,500
There's so many variables.

830
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:59,460
You've got to perfectly make the exact same things, the exact...

831
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,260
You've got to have like the room temperature the same.

832
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,180
So many variables, including like how long do I cook it for?

833
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,500
How hot do I let it get?

834
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,620
Like how much do I stir it and stuff?

835
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,140
It's like that.

836
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,340
Those are things that affect.

837
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,740
How toxic is your mind in that day?

838
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,740
How many VTubers have you yelled out to expel the toxins?

839
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,900
It was full of toxicity.

840
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,140
It seeped into my into the finished product.

841
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,700
By the way, I thought of a fun tongue twister.

842
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,380
Okay.

843
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,820
Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.

844
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,580
Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.

845
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,900
Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.

846
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,700
Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.

847
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,940
Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.

848
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,260
Thick fighters, thoroughfuckers.

849
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:58,020
I like it. I like it. There's a little new endless war. Yeah. Oops, we made another one.

850
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:04,500
It's a big boo-boo-boo Maui milkers. It's the branch that is obsessed with like fies

851
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:11,620
and just for technique. Sex. One is obsessed with fighting with their thighs and the other

852
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:24,740
one just fucks a lot. Yeah, they're both pure evil. Chaotic evil, sex. In the alignment

853
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:37,020
chart of like things. Sex is chaotic evil and then education is lawful evil. The opposite

854
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:45,500
of sex is education. Yeah, okay. What else could go on there? True neutral zoning out

855
00:45:45,500 --> 00:46:00,820
getting high. Why not? I'm never educated. I don't want to be having sex. No. I should

856
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:06,900
I should I should have stayed in academia. I should have stayed a physics guy. I would

857
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:15,100
know things now. Now I don't know anything. Now I'm useless. Maybe I could have been on

858
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,820
that space telescope. Maybe I could have been launched into space. Wouldn't that and wouldn't

859
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:26,460
that be something? I don't know. I don't know. I feel like they say what's the cost-benefit

860
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,940
analysis of throwing Ben St. into space. I could have I could have made that so much

861
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:38,700
fuel. So much fuel I did. Yeah, I'll waste some fuel. Yeah, I'll waste some fuel for

862
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:53,580
NASA. What of it? It seems he's in chat right now and blue and four is hounding them. Yeah,

863
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,980
we got we got to know about that. I am on the side of it was a dream. It was a hallucination.

864
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:05,980
I think it was I think it was wishful thinking. I think it's gaslighting. You're trying to

865
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,660
convince Simzi that he already posted his dick. So he'll say, Oh, well, might as well

866
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:16,900
post it again. I guess. It's just for temper. It was another one of my friends. I don't

867
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:26,220
know. Simzi just looks the most like a dick and looks the most like a penis. That's a

868
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:36,220
compliment. I suppose. Do you think Simzi is a thick fighter or a thorough fucker? Oh,

869
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:45,340
geez. He's pretty large. So maybe he's a thick fighter. I don't know. And I've never seen him

870
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:51,020
fuck. So do I know that he'd be thorough? I can only I can only guess.

871
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,220
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

872
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,620
That's right.

873
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:05,820
Hmm. Hey, what else do I do this week? Nothing.

874
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:12,500
You guys seen that creator clash thing? Oh, I only just heard about it.

875
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,980
But I heard about it yesterday and I saw a video of was it the guy from like epic mealtime punching

876
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:28,740
ego raptor? Yeah, from Game Grumps, as well as a bunch of other YouTubers who are mostly

877
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:35,260
I don't care about them. But I dobs organized a fighting match because he wanted to fight

878
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,260
rice gum and rice gum chickened out because of course he would. I don't know who rice

879
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,940
gum is. I've rice gum. Thank God, you don't know. He did a content cop on him. I dobs did.

880
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:53,700
Okay, he's an annoying guy, but sure. He wanted to make it like an actual event with like boxing

881
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:01,460
coaches and to train for like months. And when rice gum didn't do it, he was like, OK,

882
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,820
well, I'm looking for other YouTube creators, other people. And then he just organized a

883
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:12,780
big old thing. And before you know it, there's a bunch of YouTubers gonna fight each other

884
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:19,620
to the death. And it was funny to see killed live on stream. It was funny to see ego raptor

885
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:26,420
getting punched. But the more I thought about it, the less surprising it was. I was like,

886
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,860
yeah, this is something he'd do. It does make this makes this makes a lot of sense for everyone

887
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:39,500
involved, actually. YouTubers boxing has become a thing. So I guess this was inevitable. Yeah,

888
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:46,700
although I dubs. I dubs really tried hard. I he made a video and I watched that I watched him

889
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:52,500
where he talks about like the pros and cons of like influencer boxing matches. And like how

890
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:00,500
things like Jake Paul, like he likes the mystery is the thing you said he likes the mystery of if

891
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,220
you go to see a boxing match, you know that the boxer is a boxer and they're gonna go be good

892
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,940
at boxing is just whether they're gonna win or not. Yeah, Jake Paul is an influencer boxer,

893
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,180
but he's done more than one boxing match. So the mystery is gone. You know that he can box

894
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,140
because he's already done it. And it's like less interesting. So the whole thing with this is

895
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:26,540
like, all of these weirdos, you have no idea if they even know what if they even know what

896
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,340
they're doing. Yeah. Yeah. And I dubs was I watched I dubs this match. And he was actually very

897
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:40,820
good. He trained very hard. It was impressive. It was a crazy event. I just, what do you know, huh?

898
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:48,420
My first reaction is to go and roll my eyes. But like, I guess there's no nothing wrong with it.

899
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:58,260
Like, why not? Why not box each other? It's fine. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

900
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,660
I didn't watch many of the other matches because I didn't know most of the other people.

901
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:10,740
I think I recognize Keith Apecari as like dad, who is like a character, you know,

902
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:17,860
Keith Apecari, the the balding like nerd looking guy. No, he does like, he does like a character

903
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:25,460
where he's like, oh, I'm a nerd and I will and he does like crazy pretfalls. He was on an angry

904
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,980
video game nerd episode where they were smashing through walls and stuff. And he's done some other

905
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:38,660
things. He's like a nutcase, I feel like, not like a real nutcase, but he could, he could, I feel like

906
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,660
he's dangerous. He's a dangerous guy. He's dangerous. Oh God. He's got he's got a dangerous,

907
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:50,180
he's got a dangerous aura to him. I want to watch that fight next. It's all finished though.

908
00:51:50,180 --> 00:52:01,940
Yeah. Well, I probably won't watch any. I think that one clip of ego raptor getting punched

909
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,700
was plenty. Yeah, I doubt it's going to get any better than that. I only saw a clip of

910
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:14,260
iDubbbz with blood running down his face. iDubbbz took it so seriously. It was cool. It was actually

911
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:23,380
cool. Yeah, I maybe I'll look into it. I when I I enjoyed iDubbbz for a time back in 2016 2017,

912
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:28,980
but the more like removed we are from that era of YouTube, the more I don't want to look back on it.

913
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,420
I have I have never watched any iDubbbz. I mean, I know who he is more or less.

914
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,900
It was just a very sour time for YouTube.

915
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,380
If I had to like pick a word. Why? Because it was a lot of like

916
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,780
bickering and infighting and yeah, calling each other. I don't know what they called each other

917
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:56,820
back then cringe. So we still do that. Yeah.

918
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:02,420
I don't know. They were the kind of creators who were like prominent back then or just

919
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,900
I don't know just kind of unpleasant was is the general vibe, I feel. I mean, I feel like

920
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:16,740
most people are still around. I feel like iDubbbz is he's not. He's kind of like a like a, I don't

921
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:25,940
know, chaotic good. I'd fucking alignment shit. Like he's a good guy. And he has done edgy stuff

922
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:31,780
before. But like, I like him. I think he does. I mean, this event was like all of the proceeds

923
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:38,100
went to charity, which is a nice thing. And like everybody involved was like volunteered to be part

924
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:44,340
of it. And they enjoyed the he got like coaches for everyone. He seemed like a really like a serious

925
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:51,380
like mature like event thing, rather than just like, dude, let's get so fucking cranked up and punch

926
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:57,060
each other. And it's like a big YouTuber thing. Like it didn't feel like that. Yeah. I mean,

927
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:03,460
you kind of have to take it seriously. If you're like, planning it, even if even if the idea is

928
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:08,820
stupid, it's like, well, yeah, sure. But we got to like, if we actually want to make it happen,

929
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:15,860
we have to treat the concept with seriousness. So I guess, I guess it just

930
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:21,860
it makes sense that he was the one to organize it if he was the one taking it the most seriously.

931
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:28,980
Yeah. Yeah. His opponent was like a is like a doctor who boxes and has boxed for 10 years.

932
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:38,980
And he's like, like a very, very good boxer. So it was not like, I feel like if the rice

933
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:45,700
gun thing had happened, he would have killed him. Like rice is nothing. And he's like a real

934
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:52,660
he's a real Weasley type. And he probably wouldn't put any effort into actually training. So if he

935
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,820
did actually, he would have been like, he just knocked him out instantly. I feel like this was

936
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:03,220
going he went up against someone who was definitely better than him. And he held his own. It was great.

937
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,060
I wish I wish someone I wish someone would beat the shit out of Mr. Girl. That would be really

938
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:14,020
funny. But I'm also glad that Mr. Girl is too small time to go to something like this. So actually,

939
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:19,220
that would be bad if that happens. Who the fuck? Who the hell? You know what? Don't worry about it.

940
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,300
You know what? I'm glad you don't know. I'm glad you don't know.

941
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:30,020
Some fucking some some some some transphobe psychopath who are the dick show people really

942
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:36,340
like. Well, anyway, what do you think about the PCP boxing match? You want to fight Ben? You want

943
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:45,460
to fight when I throw down? Yes. Yes. I'll kill you. We'll do the same thing, but we'll use weapons

944
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:53,140
like in Dark Souls. It'll be an Elden Ring like in the ring. Cyber Shell tweeted he had a genius

945
00:55:53,140 --> 00:56:00,340
idea. Elden Octagon. A creator clash but with guns. Yes, I saw that. That's why I thought like we get

946
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:09,540
Cyber Shell there. We got all the PCP guests and we'll kill each other. I think I think I think

947
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:15,220
Simsie might be the biggest guest we've had. He's very tall. I've heard. I don't know if it's

948
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:20,980
Cyber Shell tall. I have no idea. Cyber Shell is a sonic character. So quite short, I think.

949
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:29,620
How tall is Simsie again? Like eight foot, like nine, ten. I think he's he's got to be like six.

950
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,260
I think he's I mean, he's over six feet. I think he's like maybe like six six or something. I don't

951
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,980
know. I just six. I feel like I've heard that he's very tall. I don't actually know how tall.

952
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,780
I mean, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he was like six around six two or six three.

953
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:51,940
Yeah, maybe. I'm six one and a half ish. I don't consider myself that tall. But when I go out in

954
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:57,060
public, everyone's shorter than me and it's just weird. Why do I have to be tall? I mean,

955
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:02,500
I'm taller than all the women. That sucks. Does it get fucked a little bit?

956
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:11,300
Hmm. Actually, I'm sorry. Actually, there's a voice actress I'm in contact with who might

957
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,180
be voicing my character and some things and she's six four. So that's pretty cool.

958
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:26,020
I think you mentioned her. You you mentioned some voice actress for Falia at some point.

959
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,700
Maybe it's the same person. Might be. I mean, this is someone I met more recently.

960
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I had. Wait, hang on. Hold that thought. Falia. Phallic.

961
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:43,380
Yes, that's how I only just got that. That's how I thought of the name. Wow.

962
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,860
Oh, I can eat it. I need a name. What phallic phallia? Oh, that works. It's

963
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:58,580
perfect. Five seconds. Oh, God. I just sorry. I just looked at

964
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:06,820
no, I just looked at the Twitter trending tab and I would know what are you seeing, Ben? What are

965
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:17,700
you? The buffalo shooting, grooming, replacement theory, white supremacy, Ukraine. Okay, Ukraine

966
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,900
drives back Russian forces. I guess that's not so bad. That's not so bad. That one's all right,

967
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,500
I guess. My Twitter feed is Japanese, so I don't have to worry about anything.

968
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,740
I was I never have a Twitter feed. They'll like if you if you want to go and eat the

969
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:40,180
slop in the trough, then have a feed, but you don't do want that. No, you don't need it.

970
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,660
You don't need that slop, Ben. I was just clicking through. I was just idly clicking

971
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:51,700
around artists just now, actually, just in case I found anyone who draws how I want.

972
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,500
And all the ones, they're all Japanese. I can't ask them. They don't speak English.

973
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:03,540
Some of them might, I guess. Did you really ask her? I don't know how to pronounce her

974
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,380
fucking name. Did you really just say I have a business inquiry and leave it at that?

975
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,540
Well, I said I said send me a DM because I couldn't send them one because their DMs were closed and

976
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:19,780
you should have waived the budget in front of them. So they're like money, maybe.

977
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,700
Really? You think I should? I mean, I guess I could do. I mean, I don't know. Like,

978
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,500
if I got a tweet saying I have a business inquiry, I'm just going to read that and be like,

979
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:32,100
you would the fuck? Okay. That's vague and ominous.

980
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:38,500
Didn't mean to be vague and ominous. I don't know. I just didn't think I should give all the details

981
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:43,300
right out in public. But yeah, I mean, true. If you mentioned like, I have this much money to

982
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:50,580
throw around, people might be like, um, um, what about me? Hot? Yeah. That all come busting in.

983
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:56,180
And I mean, would that be such a bad thing? Some of them might be good. It could happen.

984
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,580
Maybe, maybe. Yeah. Sure.

985
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:08,420
Uh, yeah, I guess it's worth another try because I didn't get, I didn't get an answer.

986
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:15,620
Um, yeah. And then you'll be known forever as Ben St. V. Annoying Pestering Man.

987
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:23,700
Yep. Well, I already am. Can't, can't be worse than what I've, I'm already known for on Twitter,

988
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:31,220
so only you can only, things can only improve. Okay. Okay. Well, I didn't do anything else this week.

989
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,220
I was going to go to Trader Joe's today, but I don't think I'm going. I don't need anything.

990
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:47,220
I have been animating a fat fucking pussy, um, this week, and I'm doing it right now

991
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,820
as I am in this podcast, moving lines back and forth.

992
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:58,980
How could you? I studied the blade. I know how to make a pussy look really fat.

993
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:05,620
I see. I see. Yeah, because the pen is mightier than the sword, so you studied the blade,

994
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,660
and you threw it out, and then I studied the pen. It was better.

995
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:18,420
Yeah, basically. Um, I guess I have some, some news that's good. Uh, Kai's top surgery is funded.

996
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:24,420
Based. Oh, good. Thanks to the, I think I mentioned last time I was on that we would be

997
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:30,980
able to afford it, and yeah, we did. We have a date scheduled for the surgery. Uh, six, nine,

998
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:41,940
Lamau. Lamau. Pretty good. Hmm. Um, what's the, what's the Japanese way to say congratulations?

999
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:52,820
Congratulations. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like an Ava. Hmm. That wasn't a dub. That's just how it was.

1000
01:01:52,820 --> 01:02:01,380
It's not itadakimasu. It's not gomennasai. It's ohayou gozaimasu. It's uh, sure. Probably.

1001
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:11,380
It's a fukka. It's kawaii. Yes, yes. All these are ringing a lot of bells in my mind. Uh, got it.

1002
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:19,940
Um, yeah, yeah. Well, that's pretty sick. Uh, good, good luck. It's probably gonna,

1003
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:26,740
it's probably gonna hurt. It's probably gonna hurt a lot. That sucks. But uh, it'll be good,

1004
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:32,900
I suppose. Uh, it'll be good. Pretty excited about that. Yeah. I'm excited. You go to the

1005
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:40,500
top surgery and you have samurais there. He does like the iaii. Slice some right off. Hmm. Honestly.

1006
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,540
I know, I know a lot of, I have a lot of people who are like donate the boobs to me and I'm like,

1007
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:52,500
yeah, if only it worked that way. If only. Okay, so you're saying is it, it doesn't work that way?

1008
01:02:52,500 --> 01:03:01,620
No, it doesn't. Um, not legally. But if you want it to be criminal, have like illegal tits.

1009
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:08,660
I mean, okay, I'm, I'm assume, if you can't do that, then I'm assuming it wouldn't work.

1010
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,780
Because otherwise I feel like people genuinely would do that.

1011
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:21,380
I guarantee it's possible to have a hormone that would just make boob go into overdrive.

1012
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:28,580
Because I've seen it happen. Wow. I've seen it happen. There's a. You've seen it? What,

1013
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:36,420
what have you seen happen? There's a woman who I found her through Twitter. Um, she goes by

1014
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:46,420
Vatheverbeck. She has unbelievable gigantic natural boobage. Um, that just came out of nowhere,

1015
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:55,300
like in her firties. Um, after she had. Vatheverbeck. Yeah, Vatheverbeck. She is a very well-chested

1016
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:04,420
woman. Well-chested? Yes. Oh, I might have seen her. I mean, there's a, I mean, I know there's

1017
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:12,340
a condition called Gigantomastia that makes that happen. Like usually, though, like most stories

1018
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:18,980
I hear about with Vatheverbeck, like when it happens in, um, like, you know, I guess something

1019
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,660
just went wrong during puberty or whatever, like they just kept growing and kept growing and kept

1020
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:28,820
growing, so to deal. But like, she had like, like medium titties her whole life. And then

1021
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:36,580
after miscarriage, they just went boom, uh, over. After a miscarriage. Yeah. So I guess something

1022
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:44,980
hormonal must have gotten fucked up and triggered it. Um, so I don't know. It's, it's probably

1023
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:53,380
possible to figure out if, if, if, if it weren't for ethics, uh, that could be figured out for

1024
01:04:53,380 --> 01:05:01,380
people. But I don't know, unlikely to happen. It's, yeah. I mean, it's, there's not a lot of

1025
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:07,860
science annoyingly. There's not a lot of science on like that specifically. I've, I've seen the papers.

1026
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:16,020
I've seen many papers because, you know, obviously I'm trying to grow my own. And a lot of it just

1027
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:22,420
doesn't seem like there's enough evidence for, to say too much one way or the other.

1028
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,020
It's just sort of like, yeah, some people just, it just happens. And then not a lot,

1029
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:34,100
not a lot of people are really understand it. And the impetus, the, the, the, the, the, what would

1030
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:39,140
you call it? The motivation? What do you call it when it's the, there's a thing to do something?

1031
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:45,460
Is impetus the right word? Maybe. The impetus to like research it and figure it out. Isn't there?

1032
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:53,460
Because it is cosmetic. It's not like medicinal. You don't need to have huge tits. Oh, well,

1033
01:05:53,460 --> 01:06:01,220
that's what they'd like you to think. I, I just, if it were, if it were possible to do,

1034
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:06,900
to, to donate the breast tissue to someone else, I don't see why people wouldn't do it.

1035
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:12,580
I mean, I know that it wouldn't, I know that just wouldn't fucking work because it would get rejected

1036
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:18,900
and the body would just. I mean, science could improve, but right now it's not a thing, I don't

1037
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:24,500
think. But, but I mean, they do that with other body parts. They just put it in and it doesn't,

1038
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:34,100
you guess, they do. I mean, I mean, it's just like fat mostly, right? I guess so.

1039
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:39,940
It's the memory glands, I think, is the, the strange part. Like, they need to connect to

1040
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:46,500
something. And I don't know if the technology exists because there's no like, like, why would you

1041
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:51,300
put money into like researching that? There's no technology doesn't exist to like connect

1042
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:59,860
the memory glands of a foreign body onto your own such that they'll like, like the body will

1043
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:06,580
accept it. It could be doable. I just, I don't think anyone would, which is annoying.

1044
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:14,580
But you have memory glands already, so you just have like an extra pair of memory glands on top

1045
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,060
of the old memory glands and that would just be. Well, that's the thing. Maybe you'd have to like

1046
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:22,740
scoop out the ones that already exist. It's like weird. Put the bigger ones in.

1047
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:32,100
I mean, they figured the shit out for cows to make them mega. Yeah, it's a lot less scary

1048
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,380
and more epic to just take a bunch of funny pills and they'll explode

1049
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:46,900
all on their own. Do they, do they, do they transplant utter material onto cows? No, no,

1050
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:52,420
no with cows, it's just hormones. Oh, yeah. They found the mega milk hormones.

1051
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:59,140
Yeah, but the, I mean, that's, I mean, milk, milk production and, and like

1052
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:03,140
utter size or not. It's the same. I don't know.

1053
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,020
Seem there some are related. Probably.

1054
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,260
Well, I've learned that we don't know anything. We don't know enough.

1055
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:21,060
Really, they're just, we just need to take all the money, all the money and put it into research

1056
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,140
so that we can finally figure this out so that future generations can just say

1057
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:31,780
huge tits please and they can have them. We don't have to worry about like it being impossible.

1058
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:40,100
We need that money for, for border security. No, open them borders and give me some big fat

1059
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:46,420
old titties please. It'll never, it might pass in the house, but it'll never pass the

1060
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:53,300
Senate, the resolution. I'm sorry. The dream dies here. I'll run for prime minister and that'll

1061
01:08:53,300 --> 01:09:00,180
be my thing. Tits, that's what I'll say. I'll say tits, I'll say breasts. Tits or GTFO is

1062
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:09,380
your fucking running slogan. The big booby mommy milker party. I mean, why not?

1063
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:18,980
These days, they'll let anyone run. Yes, they will. That's what's called living in

1064
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,900
some sort of a system. I know, I can hate it. It's nonsense.

1065
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,580
Well, I mean, what do you think about voicemails around this time?

1066
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:40,740
Well, are we too early for those? I have another little thing to say. Oh, sure. Yeah.

1067
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:56,820
So I booted up Shia from, this is an MMO from years ago. Really bad. Shia. S-H-I, S-H-A-I-Y-A.

1068
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:05,140
I've never heard of it. You wouldn't know. It's very obscure, but it was the sort of thing I saw

1069
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:10,980
in the sidebar and it's like, MMO, but for free? You don't have to pay for World of Warcraft

1070
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,140
subscription. You could just play this one. I'm like, oh my god, for free? I don't have a credit

1071
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:20,900
card yet. So I played it. This looks like one of those things that you'd see with like, it's like,

1072
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,100
if you are over 40 and have a computer, you must play this game.

1073
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,660
I don't know what that means. That's an ad I see all the time. And there's a picture of a tree.

1074
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:39,220
It's a picture. What are you looking at? I don't know. I've just seen an ad that says that.

1075
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:47,940
Just on sites that have ads. Oh, yeah. It does look like one of those. I saw

1076
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:54,980
a video of someone who played one of those like, you'll come in two seconds like games.

1077
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:58,340
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, the sexy. It turned out it was just like,

1078
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,980
it was like a whole just MMO that was just really shitty.

1079
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:08,820
You see the thing? They'd come in two seconds. Yes. I mean, I came, but I didn't come every two

1080
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:16,500
seconds. No, this, I remember that they had the advertising of like, there's the good elf goddess

1081
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:21,460
who's sexy and the evil elf goddess who's also sexy and choose which one you follow.

1082
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:27,220
So difficult. That did entice me when I was 13 or however old I was,

1083
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:33,620
but I actually do remember playing the game a lot and the game was bad and it sucked,

1084
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:37,940
but it was fine and it was good, but it was really bad and worse than World of Warcraft,

1085
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:42,100
but I love it. And so I downloaded it the other day just to, you know,

1086
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:51,940
fill time because I'm a loser. I don't do anything. And I realized that I really miss,

1087
01:11:52,660 --> 01:12:00,500
I made a tweet about this, I really miss polygonal, bad graphics with no dynamic lighting and

1088
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:10,340
shadows and like shitty animations and terrible everything, but it's just got the right aesthetic.

1089
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:17,540
I like it. I like being in like completely obviously fake locations that are charmingly

1090
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,420
outdated with really blurry bad textures that are like

1091
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:30,500
competent at like presenting a video game experience where you just walk around and you

1092
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:38,980
kill things and you grab loot and yeah, it was good. I love, I love old stuff. I like old good,

1093
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:48,900
new bad and I just really, I really just, I pine for a game that embraces like shit art direction,

1094
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:54,660
well not art direction, but shit art like capabilities, technological capabilities

1095
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,860
because it does have art direction. It's actually quite nice, some of the places,

1096
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:05,780
but they just like, you can look into the distance and it's got like fog and you can see

1097
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:12,900
things popping in, but like the hills have like three polygons. It's not smooth at all

1098
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:19,140
and you walk up it like there's no change in your animation, like your feet don't change.

1099
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,300
It's very static and there's like shitty particle effects.

1100
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,540
No reverse kinematics on the character model's legs?

1101
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:36,820
None, not even one reverse kinematic and it's just like, oh my god, I love that for them.

1102
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:45,700
I see. And I don't know, I was just, I was pining for the fjords, those specific fjords.

1103
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:55,780
I just, I like it and I don't like how every single game ever since like the invention of

1104
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:08,180
fast and easy, no brain cells necessary lighting engine where like shadows and bloom and directional

1105
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:13,860
light and stuff is like commonplace to the point of everything looking exactly the same

1106
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:19,700
and it's soft and it's all the edges are anti-aliased and you can, and it's all like,

1107
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:24,820
like made a play-doh and like it's a Pixar movie, every Pixar movie is exactly the same movie with

1108
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:29,940
exactly the same character designs, exactly the same face and it's all exactly the same.

1109
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:37,460
Where's my edge, where's my alias fucking cube with a shitty texture wrapped around it?

1110
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:44,340
There's, they don't exist anymore. I have to go back. If I want something that looks like shit,

1111
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,020
I can't find it anymore. It's not up, it's just unacceptable.

1112
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,940
That's my, that's my video game brand.

1113
01:14:52,900 --> 01:15:01,060
Their art style for some of their recent movies and people Pixar, Pixar did have like a same

1114
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:07,380
face sort of like approach for a while. Pixar has gotten better about it, but it's just sort of like,

1115
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,980
like for a long time the Incredibles was like the only movie where like the humans like

1116
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,700
like had like interesting designs and they like only started recently changing that up again.

1117
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:24,420
Um, everyone complained, everyone complained, ew, Cal Arts and that.

1118
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,420
Look at this fucking, hang on, sorry.

1119
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:33,540
Oh my god, that boy's so sharp. He looks like he's friends with Genesis Valentine.

1120
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:39,940
Look at this fucking font. The guard isn't even capitalized. It's so good. I love this font.

1121
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,740
I mean,

1122
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:51,460
I've had it with these fucking anti-aliasing overlords and their their claw grip on the

1123
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,860
video game industry. They've got, they've got away, they've gotten away with too much.

1124
01:15:56,580 --> 01:16:01,860
It's, uh, it's very, uh, it's very angular. Important is what it is. It's very crisp.

1125
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:13,940
It's, uh, it's, I mean, it makes me feel, it makes me feel like I'm playing with toys. It's

1126
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:21,380
like it's just a cool epic action figure. Nowadays, I feel like I'm, I don't know, playing with a

1127
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:27,300
shit action figure that's not a toy that's too real. I see, I see like a,

1128
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:32,340
uh, a thing and I don't like it.

1129
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,780
Oh, you know what it is? I also see a thing and don't like it.

1130
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:44,660
You know when, like, I maybe don't, but like, there's, uh, I got, sometimes I go on my mobile

1131
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:50,100
phone. I'm like, I want to have a game on here that I want to play. I feel like that's not too

1132
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:56,260
much to ask. So I go on there and I look for something that's like, uh, medieval castle maybe,

1133
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,820
some sort of a medieval castle game. I don't know, a tower defense. Maybe it's clash of

1134
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:06,020
clowns even good. I look at it. I look at these sorts of things. They're like, I'll try one.

1135
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:12,020
They're not that good and they're obviously very predatory with their microtransaction stuff,

1136
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:18,980
but aside from all that, the graphics are way too cutesy. They're not edgy. They're not hard.

1137
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:24,820
They don't look like castles. They look like, like duplo for plasticine babies. They're made of,

1138
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:33,860
they're made of breast milk. They're nothing. They're like, if you pick up a little one of

1139
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:38,340
these castles, if they're like a real thing, if they, you 3D print the video game art assets and

1140
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:43,140
you have them, you wouldn't be able to choke on them. They'd be baby safe. They'd be, you wouldn't

1141
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:48,260
be able to cut yourself with them. Where's the toys that if I grab them, it'd hurt and it cut me

1142
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:54,020
and it'll draw blood. That's what I want. I want things that would hurt. I want to feel pain.

1143
01:17:54,020 --> 01:18:00,660
I want to feel anything. I don't know how to explain this feeling. I hope somebody in the

1144
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:08,420
audience understands. I know what you mean. I want, I want literal edges on everything that I can slice

1145
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:20,660
myself with. Edgy? Question mark? Edgehog? True. Need more edged weapons. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

1146
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:26,260
It's a strange, it just overwhelmed me as I was playing it. I was like, oh my god,

1147
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:35,860
I love this, but it's objectively unappealing in a lot of ways. Why do I want this? I don't know

1148
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:46,180
why really. My rant is half observed and half off the cuff rambling nonsense, but I just,

1149
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:51,940
yeah, you ever feel that? You ever get a big nostalgia hit and you're like, the good old days,

1150
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,060
you just like scream it from the rooftops. You don't even know what you're doing.

1151
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:04,340
You're just like, oh, the good old days. Stamp your fist. Sure. All the time. Ben,

1152
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:14,980
you seem unconvinced. I'm convinced. I feel what you're saying a lot.

1153
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:23,620
For me, okay, so like Age of Empires got this crazy flashy remake. They remade

1154
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:27,380
all the first free games, I think, for Age of Empires.

1155
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:32,820
Like the definitive edition or like a different version? I think it was definitive, wasn't it?

1156
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:38,820
Actually, maybe it's definitive edition. It was like a year or two ago. Oh, 2018. Okay,

1157
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:43,380
I guess more than a couple of years ago. But yeah, like they basically rebuilt the games

1158
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:47,140
from the ground up and they work exactly the same, but the graphics are all shiny and whatever.

1159
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:53,380
And like, I don't mind the graphical changes. I miss like the more pixely graphics of Age of

1160
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:57,780
Empires one. But the thing that upsets me is that they changed for voices. They changed for

1161
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:03,460
voices. They re-recorded them and they sound stupid now. And by stupid, I mean, they don't

1162
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:08,420
sound stupid anymore. In the original Age of Empires one, if you click on a guy and tell

1163
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:15,140
him to walk around, there's this funny fucking voice, but it's like, Rogan, Diploma, Sunks,

1164
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:22,500
Irvine. Yeah, that's exactly it. He says some stupid shit and I love it. But in the new one,

1165
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:28,580
they have like, it sounds like they grab like some guy out of like a magazine for like a hotel

1166
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,740
resort. You know, you know, you see like the pictures of the guy like smiling by the pool,

1167
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:37,460
looking at you. And you don't know what ethnicity he is because his skin's like

1168
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:44,660
some weird like middle shade and he's Greek. Is he from Europe? Is he brown? I don't know what's

1169
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:50,980
going on. It just sounds like, like, I don't know. The voices just sound like really friendly. Like,

1170
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:56,900
it's like some infomercial for clean drinking water in Africa. Like, I don't know. It's,

1171
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:02,660
they ruined it. Get these friendly voices away. Bring me back my Rogan. I need that.

1172
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:12,100
Guy. I miss him. You remember the Joe Rogan experience? Rogan? Rogan?

1173
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:20,740
They're asking where the new episode is. I remember chopper. That was my favorite one

1174
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:26,020
from Average Urban Empires 2. When you click on a female villager and you send her to go chop wood,

1175
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:30,500
so she'll say chopper if she's like British. She'll say other things if she's like

1176
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:40,420
Spanish. They think they have like vaguely like true to some of the country's like language,

1177
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:46,900
but not real language. It feels like Simlish almost. But like the Britons, you can always

1178
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:52,980
understand vaguely what they're saying. Oh my god, I found it. Harbour Darkers. I remember

1179
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:58,500
Habitacus. It's my favorite one. You're talking about, you're talking about Age of Empires, right?

1180
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,260
You're talking about Age of Empires. I found the Voicelands. I just love this. I just miss this.

1181
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:15,300
It's cool. It's janky. Duprema? Duprema? You're dying. It's just funny gibberish is good. Oh,

1182
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,580
another thing that this conversation reminds me of is like sound effects in video games as well.

1183
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:26,900
Like, so we played the Spyro Reignited trilogy a few years ago when it came out. I played through

1184
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:32,020
most of it because I knew the game really well and Kai wasn't familiar with it, so I helped him with a

1185
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:38,900
lot of sections. And like, the Reignited trilogy is really good. It's really solid. I think they

1186
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:44,260
did a great job for the most part. There's a few things that look weird, but for the most part,

1187
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:48,100
everything looks really great. But one of the things I missed that was common in old video games

1188
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:53,220
that they don't do anymore is spamming the same like super like loud sound effect over and over

1189
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:58,740
where it's like the exact same sound effect, like no change in pitch or whatever. Like,

1190
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:05,940
if an enemy is like shooting a laser going, it's like the same like super just in-your-face sound.

1191
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:10,820
But like in the remake, they'll have like six slightly different sound effects that are all

1192
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:19,300
like not quite as loud. And I'm like, no, bring me back the spamming the same like wave font over

1193
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:24,660
and over. I like that. It's like hard to like legitimately advocate for this sort of stuff.

1194
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:31,620
But because it's like, what do you mean you want less quality? That doesn't make any sense. This

1195
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:36,820
is the future. We can have more than one sound effect because we have more space to do it. You

1196
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:42,420
know, technological limitations no longer a limit. And we can do whatever we want. And it's like,

1197
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:50,980
yeah, but I don't like, I liked it when it sucked. Why is it good? It's hard to be that person,

1198
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:55,460
but it's so true so often. I don't like things when they're good.

1199
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:02,100
I mean, I feel when you had just one really like strong sound effect, but you just spam a bunch

1200
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:10,260
of times, it's really impactful and memorable versus oh cool. Now it like it serves a purpose,

1201
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,940
but it doesn't stick in my brain. It doesn't make me go, whoa, it doesn't give me chills like it did

1202
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:19,780
when I was a fucking child, I guess. It's hard to know because you're dealing with

1203
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:27,540
very specific types of memories with nostalgia. And it's like how accurately, how objectively can

1204
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:35,060
you really analyze what you're looking at here? So I tend to just throw like the presumption of

1205
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:40,500
knowing what I'm talking about out of the window and just be like, yeah, I agree that it's an

1206
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:49,460
improvement, but I hate it. And you can't argue with that. Why is it? A lot of these things.

1207
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,820
Maybe you could make an argument for some things like, well, it was better before and maybe I

1208
01:24:54,820 --> 01:25:00,820
would be right, but I don't know. I mean, there are definitely times where like the old thing is

1209
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:06,180
better when it comes to like Apes Odyssey versus New and Tasty. New and Tasty did

1210
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:13,300
genuinely just fuck up a lot of things. Yeah, it often happens. Yeah. It's not always just like

1211
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:21,060
me liking the crappiness of things because it's charming and it's nice and makes me happy sometimes.

1212
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:26,980
It's hard to talk about like that sort of thing where like

1213
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:32,980
without discounting people's genuine experiences with it as their first version of a thing,

1214
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:44,740
like people may have genuine connection to the later versions of a given product

1215
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:50,420
and then not feel as good when they go to the other version. And in that situation,

1216
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:56,820
you could say that the changes do not significantly impact the experience to a point

1217
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:03,140
where it's so much worse one way or the other. It's just actually just a little different and

1218
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:08,500
it's personal preference and there's not actually that much to talk about. But then it could be

1219
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,260
like a legitimately big factor in like the enjoyment level. And if I feel like when

1220
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,140
that's the case, it's quite obvious because a lot of people find it to be like worse.

1221
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,820
I feel like when there's a large amount of people,

1222
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:29,300
it's more likely that it's like, what am I talking about? I don't know what I'm saying.

1223
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,500
I'm not a video game analyzer. I've never done this before.

1224
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,660
No, never. Virgin Territory for sure.

1225
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,860
The Virgin Territory versus the Chad.

1226
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,260
Principality.

1227
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,740
Prince. Yes. Region.

1228
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:52,500
You know, one remake that was so terrible for one of my favorite games growing up

1229
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:57,060
and it's getting another remake now, which is good, which actually looks a lot better.

1230
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:01,780
But Clanoa, I fucking love Clanoa. It was like.

1231
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:04,820
I'm vaguely familiar with Clanoa.

1232
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,340
Clanoa is a really, really good game.

1233
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:09,380
Is that Sonic Zero?

1234
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:10,740
No.

1235
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,260
What is that?

1236
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,100
I'll get it. Hold on. Let me.

1237
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,620
Oh, no. I'm thinking of that flying around thing.

1238
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:23,140
That's Clanoa with tits. I mean, based, but not what I'm looking for.

1239
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,700
Like the thing I was thinking of was the thing made by Sega.

1240
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,580
There was like a purple magician flying around.

1241
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,580
What's that called?

1242
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,340
I know. It's this game.

1243
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:36,100
Yeah.

1244
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,940
So Clanoa was a game I grew up with.

1245
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:43,780
The original game holds up really well, but simple graphics and everything still look really good.

1246
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,100
They're very, very bright and very colorful.

1247
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:54,100
And it got a remake that just the game ended up looking so much worse,

1248
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:59,620
particularly in terms of like the color space.

1249
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,140
There's a comparison somewhere.

1250
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:10,340
I'm sure I can pull it up where you'll be able to like see just where is it?

1251
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:11,620
Oh, yeah.

1252
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,020
Okay. Okay. I found a comparison.

1253
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:17,700
So like they increased like the polygons and everything,

1254
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:21,460
but the colors are like super like muted and like washed out now.

1255
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,780
Oh, wow. That's the downgrade.

1256
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:25,460
Yeah.

1257
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,620
That's that's that's art direction.

1258
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,340
Oh, no.

1259
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,380
Oh, sad.

1260
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,940
So that's like one aspect.

1261
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:38,900
But also the characters used to speak in gibberish

1262
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,500
and each character sort of had like their own like gibberish language they spoke,

1263
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,860
which was really cool.

1264
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,660
And then for the remake, they gave English voice acting and they made

1265
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:52,740
Clanoa who had this like cutesy like sort of high-pitched sort of cute voice.

1266
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,660
They made them sound like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.

1267
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,260
Far out.

1268
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,500
Grabbing crystals.

1269
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,060
The villain.

1270
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:05,700
The villain, Gaudius, who is this really tall, spooky looking bird guy in a cloak.

1271
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,260
His voice in the original game is like this super like low-pitched distorted like

1272
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,460
kind of like thing that's really cool.

1273
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:18,580
And then in the remake, they made him be like, yes, I am British.

1274
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:21,780
Look at that.

1275
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:29,140
Yeah, they gave him the fucking Leviosa voice and they also made him look fucking stupid.

1276
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,220
They fucking ruined his face.

1277
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,380
Let me see this.

1278
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,500
Oh, I'll show you a comparison.

1279
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,780
He looks so terrible.

1280
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,140
Oh, I don't know.

1281
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:43,940
Oh, I can see that that's like a mental hat now.

1282
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,780
They gave him like HD.

1283
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:48,980
Yeah.

1284
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,460
The old, they made his eye like completely gone.

1285
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,020
What is that?

1286
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,140
It looks like a chess piece.

1287
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:57,620
I know.

1288
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:03,300
Like he looks more like a bird like in the original.

1289
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,820
Like the front part of his face kind of hooks down like a beak.

1290
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:12,100
And now it's like just a straight shot weird fucking thing.

1291
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:13,940
I don't know.

1292
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:15,300
The Wii remake was bad.

1293
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,020
It was awful.

1294
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:17,060
They ruined everything.

1295
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:20,660
But it's getting another remake for the Switch that looks better.

1296
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,980
And they're keeping the old voices.

1297
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:27,380
You can still hear like the low fidelity-ness of them.

1298
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,180
And it's good.

1299
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,460
And I'm glad they're doing that.

1300
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,900
And he doesn't look as stupid anymore.

1301
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:42,260
There's something to be said for like, you know, you have a game.

1302
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:45,060
It's on old hardware and the hardware is dying out.

1303
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:47,460
You need to put it on new hardware.

1304
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:51,060
Emulation works most of the time.

1305
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,020
Sometimes it's hard.

1306
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:57,860
So like remaking it, future-proofing it for like PC.

1307
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,100
It's like, it's a smart thing to do.

1308
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,300
It's good for money getting.

1309
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:06,500
But like they always tend to like think, well,

1310
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:10,980
since we're putting it on a thing and we have to remake some of the assets,

1311
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:12,100
why not make them different?

1312
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:17,380
And I feel like when you start doing that, it's very, very dangerous.

1313
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:22,020
You're always, you're likely to ruin things.

1314
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:29,540
I want things to be like preserved in a way that is just the same, usually.

1315
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:35,300
Because like, maybe you could make an improvement here or there.

1316
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,820
But like, it's, it's, it worked the first time.

1317
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:42,420
If you make exactly the same, but it just is future-proofed.

1318
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,020
That's good.

1319
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:45,700
That can't go wrong.

1320
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:47,620
Who would complain?

1321
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,060
Unless you could.

1322
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:52,740
You could.

1323
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,100
There's no need for rebirth.

1324
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,940
I shall imprison you in darkness and.

1325
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:04,420
And then there's a Switch version, which is like somewhere in between,

1326
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:07,780
but it's better because VI actually looks like it's part of his face again.

1327
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,540
He's a very silly looking man.

1328
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:13,780
His voice is fucking cool though.

1329
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:17,620
He speaks distorted, like deep gibberish.

1330
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:22,180
And he says a lot and it's good.

1331
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,300
This is pretty good.

1332
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,820
It's funny in the first one, their eye looks like it's too far forward.

1333
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:31,060
In a way, like their chin is there and their eye is right above their lip.

1334
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:36,420
Maybe it's, maybe it's just an angle thing, but the last one looks like it makes more sense.

1335
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,300
Or at least the camera angle makes it look like it makes more sense.

1336
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:45,300
Yeah, I saw it was like some gripes with it, but they're not as bad as like the middle one.

1337
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:48,020
Oh, fucking, but do you see the problem?

1338
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,500
The inherent problem with every three-dimensional thing ever made

1339
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:59,140
post like 1992 or whatever is that there's bloom.

1340
01:32:59,140 --> 01:32:59,940
Look at that bloom.

1341
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,020
It's bleeding into the, it's bleeding.

1342
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,700
I like the flat color of the first one.

1343
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:11,460
That deep black that is like, it's the blackest they could ever possibly be on screen.

1344
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,900
No pixels.

1345
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,580
The pixels are all gone.

1346
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:21,220
They're turned off and the other one, it's gray because of like light bouncing off it.

1347
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:23,620
I know.

1348
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:26,100
I agree.

1349
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:33,620
It's, it's, it's just, it's nice, you know, I can't complain too much

1350
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:40,580
and it's hard to be like the anti-bloom advocate because like nobody really hates bloom,

1351
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:41,140
except me.

1352
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,300
Maybe, maybe, maybe more people hate bloom.

1353
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:50,260
Bloom is fine in moderation, but people just, they just can't fucking help themselves.

1354
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:51,060
It's just that it's-

1355
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,900
They have to turn it up to 11 every time.

1356
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:56,260
What annoys me the most is that it's a given.

1357
01:33:56,260 --> 01:34:01,940
Like there's no discussion about whether to include bloom for realism purposes

1358
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:03,380
because that's how light works.

1359
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:12,020
You just always have it because it's harder to not have bloom in current game systems.

1360
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:19,300
You can turn it down, you can turn it off, but like I think it's just sort of taken as like

1361
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:26,420
normal that yes, if a game can render anything, it has to have bloom in it and it doesn't.

1362
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:31,380
Yeah, because before you would just have to pick the right color values.

1363
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,180
So that they would always look good because the computer is not going to calculate it for you.

1364
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:40,900
You have to like pick, the sky is this shade of blue and it's always going to be this exact

1365
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,460
brightness because there's no weird calculations going on.

1366
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:49,700
It just looks at the fucking P and G or whatever and just reads the color value directly from

1367
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,700
there and you have to like pick your colors carefully.

1368
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:56,980
Now it's like, oh just get close enough and we have all this lighting and blurring and

1369
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:59,540
shit that's going to change everything and make it too saturated and

1370
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:04,180
bleh. I don't like it.

1371
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:10,580
It's not ideal. I understand that it's like, it's fine.

1372
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:17,460
It works for most things like Mario games. Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean whatever.

1373
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:24,180
I just, I just, I want, I want, I want more people to take an artistic design stance

1374
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:28,740
where they actually make a decision to include it or not,

1375
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:34,100
which is what I'm doing with Pumpkin Alley. There is no bloom in that game, I think.

1376
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:39,780
I will not be, I will design the textures to look a certain way.

1377
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:44,420
They will look that way whether they like it or not.

1378
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:50,420
Like the only time bloom is necessary is for things that are like extremely bright that

1379
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:56,420
would overwhelm the camera sensor. Like if you had like a fucking lighthouse,

1380
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:00,420
you would probably have like a little bit of bloom around like where the light is being

1381
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:05,620
emitted from or if you had like a bright fire, like you'd have some bloom around the fire,

1382
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:10,660
but like pretty subtle and you wouldn't have it like obscuring like half a screen.

1383
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:14,740
In Pumpkin Alley, the fire, I wanted it to, that was one of the first things. I was like,

1384
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:19,380
I don't want it to be like a particle effect. I want it to be like a squishy looking 3D model

1385
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:27,060
of a fire, the warps and wobbles. And then it like, and we made it work. It's like two objects

1386
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:34,100
whippling and wobbling that responds to your movement and then swish left and right. And

1387
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:39,220
it's like, yeah, that's a unique looking fucking thing. Nobody breathes fire like punk.

1388
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:47,300
I still need to find the H Blizzard. Oh my god. You gotta do it. Your gamer crit is on the line.

1389
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:54,020
I still haven't found it. Oh my god. You know, I recently became a gamer and I'm gonna have to

1390
01:36:54,020 --> 01:37:00,980
give it all up. I'm gonna have to. Yeah, sorry. You had your chance and you didn't pass. I'm sorry.

1391
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:07,860
Oh no. Yeah, seven out of eight is just not gonna cut it. Our donors, our sponsors won't accept it.

1392
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:16,740
Our sponsors, our donors, who are they? Going back to, you better get back to grinding a smooth

1393
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:23,860
love potions and axes infinity. You get it back on the grind. What is that? You can graduate.

1394
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:29,940
It's like crypto game. It's that crypto game that people from the Philippines were making money at

1395
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:35,460
for a while and then it crashed. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that was on the line go up video. He did

1396
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:39,300
mention it in the line. I've seen it mentioned other places too, but he talked about it. It was

1397
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:45,380
like the most. I can't remember it. That's where I've heard of it. It's little creatures and you

1398
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:52,500
battle them and you make crypto, I don't know. Oh, is it one of those like the player base

1399
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:58,340
can earn money by playing? Yes, it's play to earn, play to earn stuff.

1400
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:07,460
Voluntary indentured servitude. No, it's you make money because you it's like it's raising people

1401
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:14,900
out of poverty. It's like having a job but much worse pay for much longer hours, but it's fun.

1402
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:21,300
So it's fine. It's a video. It's just a video game. They're professional gamers. They go into

1403
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:25,380
the office and they have to just play the video game and they get whipped. They get whipped into

1404
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:30,340
shape with those little things battle. They love it. And then on the taxes, they can write

1405
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:37,380
the occupation gamer like my roommate, Sean. Does your roommate Sean say occupation gamer?

1406
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:44,900
He has like he does like video editing for a let's play channel at EA games. Yeah. And he's

1407
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:51,300
like, I'm a video editor and the tax guy was like, you're a gamer. Just write that down. Really?

1408
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:56,980
That's what I recommend. I always look like a career type as like being in arts and entertainment.

1409
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:04,420
Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Oh, creative freelance work. It's usually

1410
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:13,940
where I go. Creative. I bet you're trying to create new ways to dodge paying your taxes.

1411
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:22,260
Yes, I am crafting the perfect potion to dazzle and confuse the tax man.

1412
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:28,660
They'll come to my door, you know, like they do. They come to the door, say, Texas, please.

1413
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:33,540
And I throw the potion at their feet and the gas goes into their nostrils and they forget all about

1414
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:40,020
it and they leave. And then they I don't have a record of taxes and I still get in trouble.

1415
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:48,180
I have my I have not been I have not been audited yet. Part of a plot of everything

1416
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:54,660
everywhere is that she the ladies getting audited by the tax by the IRS. And it made me very nervous.

1417
01:39:54,660 --> 01:40:00,740
It's like, oh man, that doesn't happen to me. I don't have I don't have a good documentation

1418
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:08,020
of anything. I couldn't I couldn't prove like that I bought such and such thing and such and such year.

1419
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:17,940
Jesus. I mean, I don't even like would not like the the purchase history of your Amazon account

1420
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:24,020
or whatever not count. Well, maybe. Yeah, maybe some things I would have an electronic record of.

1421
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:32,820
I definitely don't list enough things. I definitely like undersell myself in terms of like business

1422
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:40,580
expenses. A lot of this stuff is like, I didn't list like specific items, I kind of just like put a

1423
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:48,900
general amount under like things like supplies and like, you know, postage and stuff. And I just

1424
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:54,660
kind of had to like ballpark a number. I didn't really go through and be like, hmm, okay, I bought

1425
01:40:54,660 --> 01:41:00,500
this this pack of stamps for sending these letters. And I bought these envelopes. And I bought like

1426
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:06,740
list list items one by one. I do actually do that. I don't write it all down. But I do check

1427
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:13,620
like in a temporary. This is why I'm nervous. This is where I go. This plus this plus this plus

1428
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:20,020
this plus this. And then it's the big money number. I kind of like doing that. I wish I was

1429
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:29,860
chat enough. I wish I was chat enough to like, be like, hey, yeah, so like, all this NSFW art that

1430
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:34,260
I like got off these people's patrons that I pledged to and saved to my reference folder to

1431
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:39,860
reference for my art. That's a business expense, right? I wish I was VAT chat, but I'm not. I'm

1432
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:49,700
a coward. I mean, like, the worry of like, claiming things that are like iffy is that somebody will

1433
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:57,940
come and look at it and be like, um, explain. But like, when will they do that? Why would they do

1434
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:02,820
that? That's like workouts that they had, they would have to spend, they would need a reason to

1435
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:03,540
start doing that.

1436
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:11,380
I just don't take risks. Like the only like things that like I'm certain I can be like

1437
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:17,700
certain about are like, if I'm buying computer parts, because that's literally like, I cannot

1438
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:21,060
do my work without computer parts, that's the only thing I can be like certain of.

1439
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:21,300
Yeah.

1440
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:27,940
Everything else is like, I mean, like it's there's a lot of things that sort of count. And I'm like,

1441
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:35,780
I'm just not kind of, I'll just pay a little more taxes. Fuck it. I don't want to be a sneaky

1442
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:42,100
boy. I think there's a there's a Simpsons episode with taxes where Ned is doing his taxes and he's

1443
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:49,540
like, he has the joke is that he has legitimate excuses for like claiming things on his tax return

1444
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:58,180
or whatever. And he's like, too, like nice. And he's like, Oh, but I can't do that. That would be,

1445
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:04,100
you know, like he's making up reasons why he can't claim anything. And then what Meanwhile,

1446
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:10,980
Homer is like trying to claim that like he has like 17 children and and all these other like

1447
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:18,340
lies. Yeah, if the government asks Bart, you're a veteran, Lisa, you're a you're a nurse,

1448
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:25,380
Maggie, you're a you're a you were wounded in a in a chemical accident. Yeah, stuff like that.

1449
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:32,500
Yeah. It's chemical. So it turned you into a fucking baby on the job on the job worksite

1450
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:38,420
accident. You're on a workman's comp. You returned to a baby by chemicals. Yeah. Sure, whatever.

1451
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:43,700
So watching the Ned Flanders thing, I was like, Okay, I shouldn't be Ned. I certainly

1452
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:48,740
shouldn't be Homer, but at least I know I shouldn't be that frugal, unfrugal. What's the opposite

1453
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:58,660
of I don't know what part it is. A prodig prodigal. Or you're too giveable, you're too generous.

1454
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:09,780
That's in in Dante's Inferno, the two twin the two twin sins in the greed circle of purgatory

1455
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:17,380
are prodigality and parsimony. And parsimony is when you're like miserly, stingy, don't spend

1456
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:24,180
enough money. prodigality is when you are, you know, too free with your money, spend recklessly.

1457
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:32,100
Hence, the Bible story about the prodigal son is the the son that uses his dad's fortune and

1458
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:37,140
goes off and runs off and spends everything and has to come back and be like, I fucked up dad.

1459
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:43,460
I fucked it all. I fucked it all up. I was too poetical. And now I now my soul

1460
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:50,420
burn my soul in hell. My soul will burn on the no, not in hell. No, not in hell. Oh,

1461
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:58,980
prodigality and parsimony are the deadly in heaven. They're not they're not they're not so

1462
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:05,140
bad that you go to hell for them, but they do have to be purged from you on Mount Mount Mount

1463
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:15,220
whatever on your way. Yes, I think that's right. So now you know, now you know some new words.

1464
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:21,700
You're welcome. What what if the Greek gods are like the Boomer gods and the Christian gods are

1465
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:26,420
in there as like we're the new gods now. And the Greek gods are like, yeah, whatever kid.

1466
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:30,580
So they're like, oh, nobody cares about Mount Olympus anymore.

1467
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:39,620
Gods were just the HD remake. I think in I think in in Hades, you have the

1468
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:46,980
there's the the the gun, there's the one gun, the form of the rail gun you have is like Lucifer's

1469
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:53,780
gun. And I think they well, no, they imply that it happened that Lucifer was from the past.

1470
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:59,860
But I mean, I guess that would have been like, pre like Christianity emerging, but like that's

1471
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:04,020
like like the dawn of time or whatever, right? Like the creation of man. So I guess, of course,

1472
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,980
that would be in the past. Never mind. That's not a that's not a valid historical record

1473
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:14,260
that I'm citing there. There's no tax return for the beginning of time.

1474
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:18,020
No, I don't think so. You can't audit it.

1475
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:28,020
That's cool. Sure is a cool gun, though. That would be a cool book title. I audited God.

1476
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:38,580
Yeah. And he was sweating. And it's just some sort of a some sort of a tax anime.

1477
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:46,500
Okay, figure it out. That's the premise is the the the prompt for your book.

1478
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:58,660
I'm looking at I'm looking at the Joe Rogan subreddit because I saw boy that this Joe Rogan

1479
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:04,980
subreddit is mad at him because he basically called them all pussies or something for being mad

1480
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:14,580
about Roe v. Wade being overturned. Pretty cool. Classic smooth move. Pretty smooth move, Joe.

1481
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:20,340
They're all going Rogan. Wait, like question mark. How could you

1482
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:25,380
do? Betrayal. Betrayed me.

1483
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,580
Habadishery.

1484
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:40,020
Okay. What's going on? What are we talking about?

1485
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:49,460
I think I think that whatever we were saying is over. What do we think about voicemails?

1486
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:57,460
Well, I don't really have a topic. Just a comment. I think I definitely have ADHD and I'm going to

1487
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:04,980
look into going to a doctor and saying, can you just say that I have it? Can you just say it?

1488
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:08,900
And then they'll say it maybe. What makes you think that?

1489
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:15,540
Um, it's just been on my mind. A lot of things line up by watching some videos. I'm like, yep,

1490
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:21,460
yep, yep. That's all true. That's all exactly the case. And it wasn't like YouTubers talking about

1491
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:28,420
it. It was like they're like, um, well, it was a YouTube video, but it was like a psychologist

1492
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:35,540
talking about ADHD and the things, the way you feel and why you end up feeling this way and how

1493
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:40,980
it affects your self-esteem. And, you know, all these things are like, I feel these are normal,

1494
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:46,980
or at least normal to me. And they say they're specifically ADHD related and they talk about

1495
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:51,780
the frontal lobe. And I'm like, that seems sort of credible. I at least want to look into it a

1496
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:57,620
little more because it's been on my mind for a while. I probably just do have it. I don't know

1497
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:01,060
what will change if I know, but at least I won't be lying if I say I do have it.

1498
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:09,060
I've seen ADHD Twitter make long threads about like the memory issues that come with ADHD.

1499
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:16,900
Like in very, very precisely, lining up with issues I have with memory,

1500
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:22,420
where like Kai will come out to the living room, have a whole conversation with me about like

1501
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:27,860
what we're doing for dinner or going to the store or something. And I'll like respond to everything.

1502
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:32,580
And then later, like, I don't remember the conversation and I have no recollection of it.

1503
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:36,900
But like he and my roommates will be able to corroborate that it happened and I just don't

1504
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:41,780
fucking have any memory of it because at the time I was like animating or something and

1505
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:46,740
I guess somehow on autopilot, I managed to do a conversation without

1506
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:52,500
remembering. And this sort of thing happens a lot. It happens way too fucking frequently and

1507
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:58,340
it's scary, but a lot of people on ADHD Twitter were like describing similar experiences they had

1508
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:02,740
and like that that's like part of it. And so I don't know. I mean, I don't have a diagnosis.

1509
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:09,220
Sometimes when I am on a big ADHD moment, I think this people send me pictures of their penis

1510
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:19,700
and they didn't do it. Oh my god. It's all coming together. This was the video. It's like Dr.

1511
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:26,260
Tracy Marks Three Ways ADHD Makes You Think About Yourself. And I was like, oh, very,

1512
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:31,380
very exactly the same as me. Self-esteem. I have good self-esteem though.

1513
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:38,340
Yeah. Yeah. One, you rub it in. Oh, yeah. Rub my penis in. I'll do that too.

1514
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:48,100
That's sexual harassment. That's too far. Jail time. No one, no one. Damn.

1515
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:54,820
Voices. No, no, no, no. You're going to jail. It's a playground voice. I'm a cop. I'm a cop.

1516
01:50:54,820 --> 01:51:00,180
I'm a big old cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop. And you go into jail. It's my favorite.

1517
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,500
My favorite donkey. That is my favorite.

1518
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:10,820
voicemail, voicemail. Yeah, voicemail, voicemail, voicemail, voicemail, voicemail,

1519
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:22,660
trans rights, trans rights. What? What about them? Yeah, what about trans wrongs?

1520
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:29,460
Nothing. Two trans wrongs makes a trans right. Oh. So as long as I keep making mistakes.

1521
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:37,460
All right. Trans right angle triangle. Whenever you make a mistake, just do it again. Just do

1522
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:47,060
the second time. Don't learn. Okay, first one is called PCP recommendations. Three, two, one, go.

1523
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:56,260
Hello, Ben and Gibb and whoever else. I am listening to a lot of the PCP. I'm going back.

1524
01:51:56,260 --> 01:52:00,420
I'm listening to all sorts of episodes and you know, I'm just kind of picking them at random.

1525
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:04,740
I'm going to go, I'll go and I'll click on them. Be like, oh, that one looks funny. So I'll click

1526
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:08,660
on it and I'll listen to it. Or sometimes I'll look up a host that I like. I'll be like, oh,

1527
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:14,660
what's an episode that monkey was on? What's an episode that Jeff did motherfucking somebody

1528
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:19,060
else was on? I don't fucking know. I don't know why monkeys the only guy I could think of right now.

1529
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:27,780
Anyway, you guys, you, Ben and Gibb and whomever should just help me shout out

1530
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:33,860
episodes that you remember being good. There's too many of the PCP so I can go and listen to them.

1531
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:38,100
The one where that's what you should do. The one help me

1532
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:42,900
episodes. I prefer old stuff just because I like bigger casts. But

1533
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:46,900
if there's anything in the new era that you remember being good and funny,

1534
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:50,180
oh my God, I'm open to it because I'm still listening to current episodes.

1535
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:58,740
Yeah, please. Okay, my recommendation. I don't remember what it's called, but the one with the

1536
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:08,100
them snakes rap. Oh, that episode I can find our number. Jesse edited it. The image was everyone

1537
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:16,020
as angels in the sky or some shit. Yeah, it sounds familiar. Wasn't there a

1538
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:22,980
like a tier list, not a tier list, but like an image, I think tectonic improv did it?

1539
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:32,180
Of like the top PCP episodes. I mean, I don't know if I would have would share his tastes

1540
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:37,060
entirely, but I neither do I. I can't remember the things that happened. I just remember when

1541
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:41,860
people say, Hey, remember when you said life is a cage and death is the key? And it's like,

1542
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:46,340
Yeah, I guess that was a good line. I forget what one that was in though. I can't remember.

1543
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:48,820
I don't. Yeah, I don't remember which episode was which like at all.

1544
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:54,100
No, everyone quotes life is a cage and death is the key because I put that in

1545
01:53:54,980 --> 01:54:00,980
the come zone and people like just on rule 34, people will just quote them any image of my

1546
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:09,380
character. I've not seen that before. I've seen it. I see it around. The Vemsnakes wrap episode,

1547
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:14,740
I'm trying to find it the episode where Vemsnakes actually appeared like as a guest at the very end.

1548
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:22,020
I believe that was episode 151. Isn't it the same one that I drew them snakes and put them in

1549
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:30,820
there? That was the one with the wrap, right? Yeah. Yeah, so that was episode 151 of the PCP was

1550
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:37,780
that one. What's it called? The wrap was a few episodes before that. That was episode 148.

1551
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:46,100
Okay. Ben's Kidney Stone. My favorite episodes of the PCP are mostly,

1552
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:53,460
most of them are in like the first hundred or so. I really liked memes that need to die was good.

1553
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:59,460
I really liked the virginity episode. That was a very funny one. I've really listened to it a

1554
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:05,220
bunch. I've shown that to my friends a bunch as well. I mean, everyone knows for yellow episode.

1555
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:11,860
Is the yellow episode just called yellow? Things we can't get into. Things we can't get into.

1556
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:18,020
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And do crazy to think about for years, that was the longest episode.

1557
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:24,980
What's it like three hours? Three hours, 43 minutes. Yeah. Recently, there's been a bunch

1558
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:32,900
that have been longer than that. Yeah. The more the cast contracts, the more the episodes expand.

1559
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:40,740
It's equal and opposite. It seems to mostly happen when there's a guest. Yeah. Like the last four

1560
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:45,540
hour one, nearly five hour one was the last time I was on, then the last four hour one was when Simsie

1561
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:53,060
was on. I guess that's, yeah. I think the, as far as I can remember, the ones where there's loads

1562
01:55:53,060 --> 01:56:01,220
of people is the energy level is so high and people like try so hard to get heard over the

1563
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:07,380
cacophony that we all get tired out before we can really go for that long. And that's why they end

1564
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:13,940
so much quicker than just chilling out and relaxed and talking outside the school about

1565
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:22,500
like whatever. It's easier to go on longer when you have space to think and to make pauses in

1566
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:31,060
between your own sentences and breaths. Probably also me only coming on every few weeks recently.

1567
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:36,980
I have more to talk about because I don't come on every week. Yeah. So I tend to drag things out

1568
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:43,140
probably. If I had, if I, if I were not on every week, I would have, you know, I'd have two weeks

1569
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:52,100
worth of nonsense to complain about. There's also no Nate best man whipping everyone to stay on

1570
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:57,540
topic and only talk about one thing so that you exhaust everything you have to say about it and

1571
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:04,740
then the episode's over. Nate's like weird, Nate's weird insistence on like on topic discussion

1572
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:12,180
baffles me to this day. I will never, I've never understood it and I never will.

1573
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:19,460
I can't even remember what it feels like to have Nate on a progress in his podcast.

1574
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:29,780
I've forgotten what our pussy feels like. Next voicemail is called death note fun fact

1575
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:37,380
number one three two one go. Hey everybody, it's me the death note fun fact guy. Here's the death

1576
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:45,300
note fun fact. Did you know that in episode two of death note light is using a PC and L is using

1577
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:52,980
a Mac and that's a fun little Easter egg that shows how opposites they are? No. Yeah, that's the fun

1578
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:57,540
fact. Tune in next week for another death note fun fact. That's a little bit more. That's a little

1579
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:03,700
bit fun. I enjoyed it. I remember death note. Did you watch death note? Death note L using an

1580
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:11,060
Apple and Apple Shinigami's love apples. It's all connected and light and L is eating an orange

1581
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:17,380
in every scene. That's light saying I am eating your computer. Your data is mine. You'll never catch

1582
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:26,260
me. It just means really makes you think and think and think until you can't think no more.

1583
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:33,140
Okay. The next voicemail there's a note that says this dude is just a voicemail character.

1584
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:47,220
Okay. Three, two, one, go. She makes me poop and I make her pee. Why? Because we're flipping

1585
01:58:47,220 --> 01:59:01,300
cycles. Finally, a good YouTube video. I'm just smiling because he's having fun. Yeah,

1586
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:11,620
his enthusiasm is infectious. That was a good laugh. Great. Great stuff. Next one is called

1587
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:19,540
Hello. It's short. Three, two, one, go. Do an impression of a former PCP member.

1588
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:30,980
Hey, everybody, it's me, Monkey Jones here. Homie, did you eat all the eat the marshmallows

1589
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:39,540
out of my s'mores, homie? You bitch. What do you think? That was pretty good. Thank you.

1590
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:48,820
That's my Monkey Jones. What do people sound like? My impression of Trixie the Golden Witch is

1591
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:54,020
I like to watch little girls getting fucked. Just say it matter of factly like that with no voice

1592
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:59,300
at all. Just say it over and over again. That was my given impression. Oh, wait, you're still here.

1593
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:07,380
No. Damn it. Wait, what? I can't do an impression of a former PCP member.

1594
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:14,420
We're floundering. Let's go to voicemails. That's Nate. That was, we're floundering.

1595
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:19,700
Hey, Nate. It's Nate. Welcome back. The difference now is that when we flounder,

1596
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:25,140
we just keep floundering. Yeah. The flounder 100% completion rate.

1597
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:31,460
I can do a pretty good mage impression, actually. Yeah. Oh, I get it. You're not talking.

1598
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:39,860
Just, I mean, yeah, you just draw in instead of talking during the podcast. You basically

1599
02:00:39,860 --> 02:00:45,940
are the new mage. I kind of am. I'm animating yet somehow make the episodes long. I don't know.

1600
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:52,980
The next one I think is just a text question. It asks, what do you think of the new Mary

1601
02:00:52,980 --> 02:01:00,260
Weather logo? And I do not know the Mary Weather logo. I have no opinion about it.

1602
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:06,740
I saw discourse about Mary Weather last night on Twitter randomly and I don't follow Mary

1603
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:15,780
Weather. I think I saw that discourse as well. It was something like they had a comic that was like,

1604
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:24,500
I'm 14 and this is deep, sort of a message to it. It's like, how do you know you exist? Oh my

1605
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:32,100
God, I don't know. And it's an anime girl saying, you know, presenting the idea. Oh, I know the one

1606
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:37,380
you're talking about. It's like, eh, yeah. I mean, sure. In the comic, the guy says, well,

1607
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:43,540
this person's weird, which kind of seems to be the message to me. Look at this weird girl. I don't

1608
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:50,500
know. I don't really get dumb stuff. I don't really get what the point, I don't really get what the

1609
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:57,860
joke is, but like, I don't know. It doesn't seem like there's no way to say that. Wouldn't it be

1610
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:04,660
sexy if a hot anime girl was like having edgy 14 year old brain urizamas? That's probably...

1611
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:11,140
Is that the point? I don't know what the point is. I'm looking at Mary Weather's Twitter. They've

1612
02:02:11,140 --> 02:02:15,700
made a follow up to this. They say, clearly I must have made a mistake while writing this because

1613
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:20,980
everyone thinks it's about nihilism. It's just a strange girl talking about consciousness and

1614
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:26,420
the point of view character thinks she's a weirdo. I'm not a nihilist and the girl isn't meant to be

1615
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:36,740
either. All right. Okay. All right. I don't get it though. I think the interpretation I saw is

1616
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:42,740
yeah, sometimes in the subway, you just meet fucking weird people who just talk at you too much

1617
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:48,180
and say weird shit, but what if it was a hot anime woman this time? That seemed to be the

1618
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:53,780
vibe that I... Wouldn't that be crazy? It would. I think it's just the fact that it comes across

1619
02:02:53,780 --> 02:03:00,500
totally sincere. I don't even see the punchline if there is one. Yeah. I don't...

1620
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:05,540
If somebody actually thought this, they would draw this comic exactly the same.

1621
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,420
Or they would write this comic exactly the same.

1622
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:18,420
I just said there's no real punchline. I don't really know what I'm supposed to take away from it,

1623
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:25,380
so I'm just kind of left shrugging. I don't know. I know. What do I think of the new...

1624
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:33,220
I think you should... Oh, sorry. I was going to say the way you should make it more obvious

1625
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:36,260
is have the guy say, what the fuck? And that'd be the last thing that said,

1626
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:39,620
like, thinking his head. I still wouldn't get it.

1627
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:46,660
Like, there's one little box where he says this girl is weird in his head.

1628
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:51,940
I mean, he says, dot, dot, dot, okay. I mean, that's pretty much like, what the fuck?

1629
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,140
But it's not like punchy enough. Gotta have a punch in a punchline.

1630
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:03,860
I don't know if that would fix, would change anything. I don't know. It just has no punchline.

1631
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:06,660
What the comic needs is a punchline, and it doesn't have one.

1632
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:11,860
The punchline is very getting fucked. That's the problem for me.

1633
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:16,260
If she was getting fucked while saying all this stuff, that would be really funny.

1634
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:22,820
Getting groped on the subway by some... What's the word for...

1635
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:27,940
How can you really tell if this person is real roping me? Am I really being groped?

1636
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:30,100
Then it would be like, whole different.

1637
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:36,180
I forget what the Japanese word is for the kind of pervert that gropes women on the subway.

1638
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:40,100
There's a specific word for it. Chikon. Chikon. Yes.

1639
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:41,460
Pikachu.

1640
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:48,420
Is this Chikon really experiencing my supple breasts as he gropes me in the dark subway?

1641
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:51,620
Or is he only a meat puppet?

1642
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:55,460
I feel like that would push it over the edge and to be like, this is absurd.

1643
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:59,700
What the fuck? This girl is crazy. Then it would be a punchline. It would also be

1644
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:06,340
not suitable for work, as they say.

1645
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:09,460
I mean, a lot of Maryweather stuff is a little itchy.

1646
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:11,540
Maybe not on the main account.

1647
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:17,060
I just realized, what we're describing is the character of Uwu Lilia,

1648
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:24,580
C-Toll's, a bimbo character who gains brain cells the more it come she is in contact with.

1649
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:30,500
I see. Gains brain cells? No thanks.

1650
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:32,180
Uwu Lilia.

1651
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:37,060
Yeah, the only way to make her smart is to fill her with coon, Dan Knight.

1652
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:43,460
By the way, about the logo. I mean, I guess the new logo is just a new anime girl,

1653
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:49,940
because I guess he used to use the Internet Explorer girl, but I guess they spun that off

1654
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:57,380
into its own account. Now he made a new girl for Maryweather, and I don't care.

1655
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:59,540
I don't care that that happened.

1656
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:04,820
That's not a logo though. It's just a profile picture of a logo. You can see both of them in

1657
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:10,180
this little video on his Twitter. That's the first one, and then there's a lightning bolt,

1658
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:16,020
and then it turns into this one. There you go.

1659
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:16,580
The logo.

1660
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:19,540
So that's the logo update, those two images.

1661
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:23,860
Oh yeah, that looks like a legit thing.

1662
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:28,900
What does it remind me of? It reminds me of something very specific, and I don't know what it is.

1663
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:34,980
It reminds me of Lion Webtoon. It also has a square speech bubble as its logo.

1664
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:40,500
It's a little like Twitter, I guess. I don't know. I have no opinion about it.

1665
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,100
It reminds me of the Sims 4.

1666
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,140
Yeah.

1667
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:46,580
Oh, shit.

1668
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:51,140
I fucking, there's a fucking giant gash on the other side of my foot, and I just

1669
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:53,220
foot, and I just scratched it by accident.

1670
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:54,980
Oh no, the demon came out.

1671
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:57,140
I don't know how I got there. I just noticed it was very last night.

1672
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:00,020
That was fucking touch sorts.

1673
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:05,300
Sorry, that happened. Or happy for you.

1674
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:08,100
This sword will fucking slice a baby in half.

1675
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:18,580
Next voicemail is called, what is it? It is called, it's a search.

1676
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:21,060
Here, it's this link.

1677
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:22,420
Yu-Gi-Oh card.

1678
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:25,380
Is it like a Yu-Gi-Oh card database?

1679
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:29,220
Uh-huh. I'm going to search whatever it is.

1680
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:31,060
Is there not a thing to go with it?

1681
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:34,740
No result. No relevant data found. Ben, you're irrelevant.

1682
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:37,300
To Yu-Gi-Oh? True.

1683
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:43,860
The next one is a YouTube link with no elaboration, so I won't acknowledge it.

1684
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:51,380
The next one is called, Bridge Burning Diatribe.

1685
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:54,020
Oh, I can't wait.

1686
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:57,300
It's a minute long. This should be good.

1687
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:02,100
You're just not, you're just not looking hard enough.

1688
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:03,140
Ben-Sane, no.

1689
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:05,860
No.

1690
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:13,220
I will forever douse my bridges in water. You'll never burn them. They'll be soaked.

1691
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:17,380
All right, let's give this a lesson. Three, two, one, go.

1692
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:21,540
During episode 312, in reference to Econ, Ben-Sane said,

1693
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:24,820
I'm not burning this bridge. He's burning the bridge by making me annoyed,

1694
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:27,780
which makes me wonder, how do you treat relationships in general?

1695
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:31,540
Friends should be able to accidentally annoy friends without that turning the relationship

1696
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:36,980
permanently hostile and salt in any attempts to make amends and working towards any middle ground.

1697
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:40,820
For my parasocial relationship of consuming your content, I don't think you

1698
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:46,020
go through most friendships in that way, so I don't know what's different about this case.

1699
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,980
Is there some weird behind-the-scenes stuff we're missing?

1700
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:52,020
But if there isn't, it really seems like you're burning a bridge.

1701
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:56,180
You didn't seem open to reconciliation. A colleague just annoyed you and you

1702
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:59,380
responded aggressively and started shit-talking them on the podcast,

1703
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:01,380
after they tried making things up in the end.

1704
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:02,100
You are an idiot.

1705
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,820
At least bridge burning stuff does happen like this.

1706
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:08,980
It isn't out of nowhere for no reason deciding to just unperson someone.

1707
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:13,940
It's you to one or both parties being hard-headed and aggressive over some minor issue that crops up.

1708
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:15,300
You are such a cringy lord. You are such a hand-ringing.

1709
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:19,460
That's like sticking to their guns over their association, which ends up ending a friendship.

1710
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:24,980
I feel like I know that you talked about this on the podcast, but this comes across as like,

1711
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:29,460
I want to say this is none of your business, like what?

1712
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:30,260
So scoldy.

1713
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:35,540
So tell me what to do with my- Econ does nothing but annoy me, okay?

1714
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:38,740
It's not that he annoyed me one time. It's that he does nothing but annoy me.

1715
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:40,100
Yeah, I guess that's the simplest it is.

1716
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:40,340
And I don't like it.

1717
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:41,700
Yeah.

1718
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,220
It's just the way this guy is approaching this.

1719
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:47,300
Like I'm trying to psychoanalyze you.

1720
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:49,300
Could you please like give me some more information?

1721
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:52,100
Like that's annoying in itself.

1722
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,620
Why does it matter to you?

1723
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,180
Just seems like Ben is so irrational.

1724
02:09:58,180 --> 02:10:02,260
Just seems like Ben just cuts people off for absolutely no reason,

1725
02:10:02,260 --> 02:10:04,500
even though he explains that he doesn't do that.

1726
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:07,060
Even though the whole point of what Ben said was that he doesn't do that.

1727
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:09,300
Like I just kind of think that's what he's doing.

1728
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:10,260
What's the deal?

1729
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,620
Like a normal thing to do.

1730
02:10:11,620 --> 02:10:13,780
It definitely seems that way.

1731
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:19,940
It's just to assume that, yes, there's information that you're missing

1732
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:23,380
and why would you just ask about it?

1733
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:27,620
That's just, I don't know, strange.

1734
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:30,980
The perception is that Ben blows up at people and then when they're like,

1735
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:32,500
wow, Ben, I'm done with your shit.

1736
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:37,540
They're like, ah, see you burned it, even though I attacked you.

1737
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:40,900
That's the perception of how it comes across.

1738
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:43,140
But I don't know enough about the situations,

1739
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:46,660
because I only like half pay attention to this shit when it goes on.

1740
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:48,020
I don't know what shit they say to you.

1741
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:51,300
I can appreciate that it might look like that,

1742
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:54,660
but like the whole point of what I was saying last episode

1743
02:10:54,660 --> 02:10:58,020
or whatever episode it was in was that I don't blow up for no reason.

1744
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:00,260
I do it for a reason.

1745
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:03,620
I do it after I have been pushed to the brink.

1746
02:11:04,580 --> 02:11:05,300
Yeah.

1747
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:09,780
The one time you definitely burned a bridge was with,

1748
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:13,540
what's it even called, the fucking,

1749
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:18,500
oh god, Team Fortress 2, Brony Analysis Anarchy.

1750
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,500
TF2 Analysis Anarchy.

1751
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:21,060
Yeah, yeah.

1752
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:23,940
That's, I mean, that was the one.

1753
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:25,300
It was still really a bridge.

1754
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:26,580
It was just sort of like.

1755
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,260
Wait, that was what?

1756
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:31,300
That was so long ago.

1757
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:34,100
I remember there being a section about that,

1758
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:36,660
I think was it in a horseshoe finale or something,

1759
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:39,460
where you told them to get fucked and it was epic.

1760
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:43,940
I don't know if it was in a horseshoe finale.

1761
02:11:43,940 --> 02:11:44,420
I don't know.

1762
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,940
It was so weird.

1763
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:47,780
I just really didn't like those people.

1764
02:11:47,780 --> 02:11:55,940
They just were so, I remember I got pissed at them

1765
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:59,700
and then like Josh Scorcher called me on Skype

1766
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:01,300
and tried to like talk shit out with me.

1767
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:03,780
And he was like so condescending.

1768
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,700
And I was like, this guy sucks.

1769
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:08,340
Like why do I even want to work things out?

1770
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:11,220
I don't care that like he's like, I don't know,

1771
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:13,540
relative to me or whatever he was like popular.

1772
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:14,340
He had a bigger following.

1773
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,460
Like I just, I don't like him.

1774
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:16,500
I don't like Dr. Wolf.

1775
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,420
I don't, I don't like this community.

1776
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,940
I don't like their attitude.

1777
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:22,580
I don't care that I got mad and upset them.

1778
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:23,220
Like good.

1779
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:27,220
Was it the Frog Fractions thing?

1780
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,460
We did talk about it.

1781
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:30,820
That was like additional.

1782
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:32,980
There was definitely a Jesse video where

1783
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:37,940
Jesse summarized like how he wall broke away from MLP.

1784
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:41,060
And I swear, I swear it was horseshoe.

1785
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:44,340
Was it in one of the footwear reviews

1786
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,300
or whatever they were called?

1787
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:46,260
The horseshoe reviews?

1788
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:51,460
I mean, maybe like it.

1789
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:55,940
Was it the time you did the moment with Dr. Horseshoes?

1790
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:57,780
It was after.

1791
02:12:58,740 --> 02:12:59,300
Yeah, yeah.

1792
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,700
It was around then because that was after

1793
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:06,340
things had broken down between me and those other guys.

1794
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:08,340
And I think it was like a parody we did later.

1795
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,660
We got that same guy to animate it.

1796
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:11,300
That was great.

1797
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:16,660
I vaguely recall like, I know the people were in

1798
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:19,940
like the Brony Analysis Skype group because,

1799
02:13:20,580 --> 02:13:23,220
you know, that was just the hip hopping place to be

1800
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:24,580
for that sort of stuff.

1801
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:27,140
But everyone left because it was sucked.

1802
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,460
And I was in there still.

1803
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,980
And I think you were in there for a bit.

1804
02:13:30,980 --> 02:13:32,500
And Nate was in there for a bit.

1805
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:34,180
Jesse was in there for a bit.

1806
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:35,700
Rift Cafe.

1807
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,660
Yeah, that's what it was.

1808
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:41,300
God, but like, did it happen in there?

1809
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,700
Do you remember if you like had a like a,

1810
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:44,740
all right, fuck everyone.

1811
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:45,460
And then you left.

1812
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:49,940
I think I made, you know, I think I made a post

1813
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:53,540
on like a, I think I made like a YouTube comment

1814
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:56,660
on one of the videos in the series,

1815
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:58,580
on one of the TF2 analysis anarchists,

1816
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:01,460
it's basically complaining about how weird it is

1817
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:06,420
that like the plot of the, of the, of the series is

1818
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:09,620
about Josh Scorcher and Ink Rose falling in love

1819
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:13,540
when Josh Scorcher is like 26 and Ink Rose is like 16.

1820
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:14,660
Yeah.

1821
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,900
And I think that was what like,

1822
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:21,700
finally it was like the last straw and they were like,

1823
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:24,340
we want to, we don't like you,

1824
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:26,900
but also we want to like talk to you and like,

1825
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,740
and we haven't had Josh Scorcher be like,

1826
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:31,060
hey buddy, like what's, what's, what's going,

1827
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:32,500
what's going, what's going on with you, man?

1828
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:34,500
Like, why are you, why are you burning this bridge?

1829
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,620
Why are you burning this bridge, man?

1830
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:38,180
Why are you being so, why are you being so irrational, huh?

1831
02:14:38,180 --> 02:14:40,020
Why, what are you going to just cut us out of it

1832
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:42,580
as friends because we're just annoyed you just one time?

1833
02:14:42,580 --> 02:14:43,220
That's so weird.

1834
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:44,020
Why would you do that?

1835
02:14:44,020 --> 02:14:44,980
It doesn't make any sense.

1836
02:14:47,140 --> 02:14:48,660
You only really happens.

1837
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:51,620
I mean, those people do mostly suck.

1838
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:53,940
So it's, it's fine.

1839
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:54,180
I think so.

1840
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:56,260
In hindsight, I don't, yeah.

1841
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:58,820
It's, it's being, being away from that is good actually.

1842
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:01,140
Yeah.

1843
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:01,780
In my opinion.

1844
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:04,020
I think that was my sense at the time

1845
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:06,980
and I feel like it is born fruit.

1846
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:09,220
I have been vindicated.

1847
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:13,060
Is this from Horseshoe finale?

1848
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:14,500
Yeah, that is from Horseshoe finale.

1849
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:14,660
Yeah.

1850
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:16,020
That's, that's why I forgot about that.

1851
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:16,180
Yeah.

1852
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:17,060
That's where I heard about it.

1853
02:15:17,140 --> 02:15:19,860
I mean, obviously it's very vague, but uh.

1854
02:15:20,900 --> 02:15:22,980
I think I, I was already kind of,

1855
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:25,460
I was already kind of on the outs with them because,

1856
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:28,980
and this is funny, I would argue with a guy called Brony Buck

1857
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:30,020
who just was a homophobe.

1858
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:31,300
Oh, fuck that guy.

1859
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:31,700
I know that.

1860
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,700
Brony Buck just was like a homophobe

1861
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:35,140
and I would get pissed at him about it

1862
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:37,300
and I would argue and people would get mad at me

1863
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:40,100
for being like mean, for being argumentative.

1864
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:43,300
That's, that's definitely the whole thing in the Rift Cafe

1865
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:46,180
was somebody has a terrible shitty opinion

1866
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:50,260
and somebody gets mad and people get mad.

1867
02:15:50,260 --> 02:15:51,940
But getting, but getting mad is the crime.

1868
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:55,300
But getting, getting into an argument is such a heinous crime.

1869
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:58,020
We're Bronies, we have to love and tolerate each other.

1870
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:59,140
We can't tolerate, we can't fight.

1871
02:15:59,140 --> 02:16:01,140
Love and tolerate this bigot, please.

1872
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:04,180
It's just like they, they couldn't look beyond the fact

1873
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:06,500
that there was a disagreement happening.

1874
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:10,900
And so they, they just started shaking and shitting

1875
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:11,940
and crying and coming.

1876
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:17,140
That, that was, that was what like led to my relationship

1877
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:18,660
with that group souring.

1878
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:20,980
And then the, the final straw I think was me

1879
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:23,300
leaving that comment about like the age gap

1880
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,700
with the Incros and Jeff.

1881
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:27,780
And I was not the first person to point that out.

1882
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:29,060
Other people were talking about it,

1883
02:16:29,060 --> 02:16:32,500
but I, I echoed the sentiment in the, in the comments.

1884
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,780
Well, we're offended.

1885
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:37,540
We're a sour pus and we don't like sours here.

1886
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:40,260
I was being a big, I was being a big sour pus.

1887
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:42,980
That's not all cops of that much for sure.

1888
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:46,180
Really souring this bridge.

1889
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:48,740
Now it doesn't taste very good.

1890
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:52,660
You know, I mixed some gummies yesterday and I put,

1891
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:55,620
and they came out really sour and I don't know why

1892
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:57,780
because I didn't even add any, any acid.

1893
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:00,740
All the acid that I added to them was from the Shergel.

1894
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:02,260
And yet they came out sour anyway.

1895
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:03,540
And I was like, so confused.

1896
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:04,580
Was it good?

1897
02:17:04,580 --> 02:17:05,620
What the fuck was going?

1898
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:07,940
No, it was a little too sour.

1899
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:09,860
It was a little sourer than I wanted.

1900
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:11,940
And I was baffled.

1901
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:12,980
Maybe something went off.

1902
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:14,900
I don't know.

1903
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:16,820
All right.

1904
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:19,300
I knew, I knew, I knew this would go back to gummies.

1905
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:21,380
As soon as I said sour pus, I, I planned for it.

1906
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:23,220
He fell right into my lap.

1907
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:28,500
That was a good, that was a good fun trip down memory lane.

1908
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:32,820
Next one is called, what is a GNU slash Linux?

1909
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:35,300
Right there.

1910
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:36,020
Wait, it's loading.

1911
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:37,540
All right.

1912
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:39,060
Three, two, one, go.

1913
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:43,300
In episode 306, Skip described Linux as a pair down version of Windows,

1914
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:45,220
which is just really wrong.

1915
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:47,140
Linux is its own thing created from scratch.

1916
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:50,580
That's been like a public community project for decades.

1917
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,900
Fundamentally, it's a bit more similar to macOS,

1918
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:57,220
but it's different enough to pretty much be considered its own thing.

1919
02:17:57,220 --> 02:18:02,100
That's why you need to target it separately for games and shit.

1920
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:05,300
I don't remember saying it was Windows.

1921
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:10,820
I maybe used it as a, like likened it to Windows, but without like,

1922
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:14,260
well, that's the way my brother, because my brother knows how to do Linux stuff.

1923
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:19,540
And he explained it as, imagine if Windows wasn't like,

1924
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:22,420
it didn't take an hour to load everything.

1925
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:27,460
I mean, I mean, it is similar to Windows in that it is an operating system.

1926
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:27,780
Yeah.

1927
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,940
I mean, we don't have Mac, so that's how he described it.

1928
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:30,980
It is similar to Windows.

1929
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:33,380
I'm sorry to have made a technical error.

1930
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:34,900
Yeah.

1931
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:37,620
It's similar to Windows in that like, people who,

1932
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:42,900
like the sort of crowd who uses Linux is more similar to like,

1933
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:45,060
the crowds of people who do coding shit on Windows.

1934
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:47,700
Like they're similar, like demographics.

1935
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:48,900
Yeah.

1936
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:50,980
I mean, I don't know the code in the back.

1937
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:53,860
It's just sort of like, Linux is for nerds.

1938
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:55,140
Yeah.

1939
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:57,460
And Windows is for people.

1940
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:59,620
It's for the real tech heads.

1941
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:03,140
And Windows is for nerds in training, and Mac is for different.

1942
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:04,420
It's for normies.

1943
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:08,020
Mac is for normies or like, artists who are like,

1944
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:10,260
not technically minded, I guess.

1945
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:10,580
Yeah.

1946
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,540
Macs are good for music.

1947
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:15,300
I think I've learned that at some point.

1948
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:16,340
I have like, I've heard that.

1949
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:16,980
I have never.

1950
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:19,460
I've heard people who've switched to Mac who've said it's good.

1951
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,100
And I'm like,

1952
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:23,460
The only Macs I ever used were like the iMacs at my school,

1953
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:25,380
like computer lab in high school.

1954
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:28,340
Windows is starting to get so bad,

1955
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,780
but I might have to consider another operating system in a few years.

1956
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:34,100
Because I really don't like the look of Windows 11,

1957
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:36,420
but Windows 10 isn't going to be supported forever.

1958
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:41,300
I mean, I use a, yeah, I use like,

1959
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:42,500
I think I use Windows 10,

1960
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:46,100
but with like a shell that makes it look like Windows 7.

1961
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:47,620
Oh, yeah.

1962
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:50,820
I mean, I like the look of Windows 10.

1963
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:54,500
I'm just worried about the security updates eventually running out,

1964
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:58,420
and then it being a security risk for me to keep using it after a certain point.

1965
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:01,140
Yeah, that's, that's fair.

1966
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:03,620
That's more forward thinking than I am.

1967
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:04,100
Yeah.

1968
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:05,300
My friends who switched to it,

1969
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:09,620
I mean, aside from the tracking shit being even more annoying to disable,

1970
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:11,140
it's also just slow.

1971
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:13,940
It's just slow and buggy and bad is what I hear.

1972
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:17,060
How do you make an,

1973
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:18,260
how do you just make it worse?

1974
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:19,060
I don't understand.

1975
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:21,940
You hire people to do a job,

1976
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:23,300
and then they just have to do something.

1977
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:25,140
So I fuck it up for, for a while.

1978
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:27,540
They just add code that fucks it up.

1979
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:29,140
Good for them.

1980
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:30,660
Glad I'm glad they're working.

1981
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:35,140
Or YouTube's new like video description layout looking fucking terrible.

1982
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:39,380
The views and the date and the first line of the description are all next to each other,

1983
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:39,780
and it just fucks up my brain.

1984
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:41,620
I can't see the date anymore.

1985
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:44,420
Whenever I try to see when a video, a YouTube video was posted,

1986
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:46,020
I find myself like, I can't find it.

1987
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:47,940
The date is there, it's next to the view count,

1988
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:50,340
and the same bold font with not enough,

1989
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:53,700
with no like real differentiator between them.

1990
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:54,500
You can see it on the screen.

1991
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:58,660
Am I seeing an old thing then?

1992
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:00,980
My YouTube has not changed recently.

1993
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:03,380
Yeah, it updates for different people at different times.

1994
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:06,340
It depends on when your cookies decide they want to refresh.

1995
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:08,180
Mine changed like two days ago,

1996
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:09,220
and I'm so fucking mad.

1997
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:10,420
I can't fucking read anything.

1998
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:13,860
And I don't even have dyslexia,

1999
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:15,300
and this is like fucking up my eyeballs,

2000
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:17,700
trying to like find the date, find the view count.

2001
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:18,660
It's so hard now.

2002
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:21,060
It was perfectly fine.

2003
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:22,580
Why did they do this?

2004
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:24,580
Yeah, I'm looking at this Brony screenshot,

2005
02:21:24,580 --> 02:21:26,900
and I don't know, mine doesn't look like that.

2006
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:29,300
Yeah, it will soon.

2007
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:31,300
No.

2008
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:32,340
Oh, is that so?

2009
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:36,580
It goes views, date, description, immediately.

2010
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:39,540
No differentiation, no blinds.

2011
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:40,180
It's ugly.

2012
02:21:40,180 --> 02:21:43,140
And also the button to click on the channel

2013
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:44,820
is now at the bottom of the description.

2014
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:47,620
So if you open the description,

2015
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:50,100
I'll take a screenshot on this episode of the PCP.

2016
02:21:50,820 --> 02:21:53,540
The channel icon's at the bottom by the comments.

2017
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:54,500
It's weird.

2018
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:57,060
And also the font is different.

2019
02:21:57,060 --> 02:21:59,460
Like the font for the title of the video

2020
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:00,980
is also different and harder to read.

2021
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:04,020
I don't, I don't get it.

2022
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:07,460
I could imagine it's for mobile stuff,

2023
02:22:07,460 --> 02:22:09,220
like you're scrolling down past the description.

2024
02:22:09,220 --> 02:22:09,620
I'm not.

2025
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:11,140
By the way, would you like to subscribe?

2026
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:14,740
I'm not on a fucking mobile phone.

2027
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:19,060
Well, get with the program.

2028
02:22:19,060 --> 02:22:21,860
There's never ever going to be a desktop anymore.

2029
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:23,940
It's all going to be in the palm of your hand.

2030
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:27,940
Shorts, you can't rewind or like, you know,

2031
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:30,740
find your way, click to a middle of a video.

2032
02:22:30,740 --> 02:22:31,780
You can only play.

2033
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:33,300
It is no way to rewind or anything.

2034
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:33,940
It's annoying.

2035
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:39,940
Shorts are kind of unbearable to like use it,

2036
02:22:39,940 --> 02:22:41,460
like with the user interface.

2037
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:44,180
I click on one, I'm like, oh, it moves.

2038
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:48,580
It's clicked onto the next one in like the algorithm queue.

2039
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:52,020
So I go back and then just replays the new one

2040
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:53,780
that I was just trying to get away from.

2041
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:55,940
And then I try to go back further than that.

2042
02:22:55,940 --> 02:23:00,420
And it's just, I just, I have to turn off the whole thing.

2043
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:02,260
I close the entire tab out of frustration.

2044
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:07,220
I can't believe how annoying YouTube shorts are on desktop.

2045
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:09,140
I don't know why I would watch them on desktop.

2046
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:11,940
I don't think I've ever clicked on a short and I never will.

2047
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:15,940
They just sometimes appear where it's like, here's a video.

2048
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:16,420
Here's a video.

2049
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:17,620
Here's a YouTube short.

2050
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:18,340
Click on this one.

2051
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:20,740
And I sometimes do.

2052
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:21,140
I know.

2053
02:23:21,140 --> 02:23:22,740
And then you're locked into like the shorts.

2054
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:24,260
And then like, I try to like scroll.

2055
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:26,180
And then it's like, oh, you're locked vertical.

2056
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:28,820
And there's just a vertical strip of videos with all this empty space.

2057
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:33,140
That part of it, the scrolling is so, because it's like they have the short

2058
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:38,820
playing and then like underneath it is the short that's coming up.

2059
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:41,300
And if you scroll, you skip to the second one.

2060
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:46,180
I usually scroll when I click on a video to see the comments to see the description,

2061
02:23:46,180 --> 02:23:48,100
but there is none for YouTube shorts.

2062
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:53,380
And simply by scrolling, the next video starts playing and the audio disappears.

2063
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:54,420
And it's like, fuck off.

2064
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:56,340
You're ruining my day.

2065
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:59,700
It's like, what if we did it bad?

2066
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:00,900
That's YouTube.

2067
02:24:00,900 --> 02:24:02,660
That's YouTube in a nutshell.

2068
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:03,780
What if we did it bad?

2069
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:07,140
You know, we had like a good like six years where like,

2070
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:11,140
like the only complaints about YouTube were about like internal stuff.

2071
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:13,620
So like the UI and layout was fine.

2072
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:16,580
Because we remember like background like 2010 to 2014,

2073
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:20,500
YouTube would update their layout every like year or two and everyone would be mad.

2074
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:23,140
Like they kept it pretty good for a while and now they're fucking it again.

2075
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:27,220
Yeah, they got to pay people to do nothing.

2076
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:33,140
Did you see, okay, I'm sorry to change the subject, but I remembered something.

2077
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:38,820
Did you see by any chance the latest stupid Peter Coffin take on Twitter?

2078
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:40,100
Do you know who that is?

2079
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:40,980
I don't follow it.

2080
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:43,060
Peter Coffin walks out of his grave.

2081
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:44,580
Get it back in there.

2082
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:47,380
Peter, all right.

2083
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:52,020
I won't explain who he is, but the point is he made a tweet about like,

2084
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:55,220
he was like annoyed that people were like,

2085
02:24:55,220 --> 02:25:00,100
somebody wore a fursuit to like a pro unionized Starbucks thing.

2086
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:00,660
Yes, I saw that.

2087
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:03,380
And he's like, he said it was unserious.

2088
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:07,860
And like, I mean, look, look, look at this.

2089
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:08,580
Look at this guy.

2090
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:19,380
A real, a real serious academic rooted in materialist dialectical theory.

2091
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:23,300
What does he, what does he, what?

2092
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:28,820
That's a, that's a good Papa Smurf beard, actually.

2093
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:30,020
It's a very blue beard.

2094
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:31,540
Sure.

2095
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:32,500
Yeah, it looks all right.

2096
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:35,140
It looks all right if that's what he's going for.

2097
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:38,420
Is he's going for the Papa Smurf American?

2098
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:46,020
Anyway, just, just, just scrolled by that and remembered that it gave me a chuckle.

2099
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:50,740
A chuckle and a heckle.

2100
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:53,460
The next one.

2101
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:53,700
Okay.

2102
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:54,100
Next one.

2103
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,860
I posted it up a little while ago.

2104
02:25:56,580 --> 02:25:59,940
It's called Michael Jackson trans race.

2105
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:01,700
Three, two, one, go.

2106
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:06,340
In episode 307, you guys were talking about transracialism and ended up saying that like

2107
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:10,980
Michael Jackson is transracial or maybe an example of being transracial,

2108
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:13,540
which as far as I can tell, isn't true.

2109
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:17,780
It seems like he just had a skin condition which turned parts of his skin white,

2110
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:20,100
which was initially covering up with gloves and shit.

2111
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:24,420
But eventually it got so bad that he decided to just bleach his entire body so that it

2112
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:27,780
would all have a uniform color instead of having some blotches everywhere.

2113
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:30,420
So it wasn't really done out of a change in racial identity,

2114
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:32,180
but because of the skin condition.

2115
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:35,940
Well, sounds like you, sounds like you know more about it than I do.

2116
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:38,740
I know all about Ben's skin condition.

2117
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:42,500
What does that mean?

2118
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:44,900
My skin, I'm turning, I'm turning black.

2119
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:49,860
Joe Biden sucked out, he said, you ain't black if you don't vote for me.

2120
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:54,340
And he sucked out all the blackness from people and then he's giving it to me slowly.

2121
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:55,140
Just to you.

2122
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:57,460
We worked, we worked out a deal.

2123
02:26:57,460 --> 02:26:57,860
Yeah.

2124
02:26:58,100 --> 02:27:06,980
The next one is, okay, the next one is will the Switch 2 come soon and then the Nintendo

2125
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:10,020
and then Switch 2 and then that's what I'm talking about.

2126
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:10,820
I hope it does.

2127
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:11,860
I'm hyped for it.

2128
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:14,340
I don't know.

2129
02:27:15,220 --> 02:27:16,820
No, why would they make a Switch 2?

2130
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:17,780
Everybody loves the Switch.

2131
02:27:22,420 --> 02:27:27,060
Didn't they already make like a version of the Switch that was like OLED?

2132
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:29,380
Did they make like a light version or something?

2133
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:32,500
Yeah, or like a version that doesn't have the disconnected controllers,

2134
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:34,180
it's like entirely portable.

2135
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:38,020
Yeah, I think that sounds familiar.

2136
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:41,620
They probably did and good for them.

2137
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:44,820
They call it the stationary because you don't change it.

2138
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,220
You don't switch it.

2139
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:49,140
I don't see why, I don't see why they would make a Switch replacement

2140
02:27:50,180 --> 02:27:52,420
while the Switch is still dominating.

2141
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:55,140
So probably not anytime soon.

2142
02:27:57,060 --> 02:27:59,780
What would they even put on the Switch 2?

2143
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:02,100
What would they do with a Switch 2 that they couldn't do with a Switch?

2144
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:07,620
They could put it as a VR headset as well.

2145
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:14,660
Now that, honestly, yeah, why wouldn't Nintendo make a VR console?

2146
02:28:16,180 --> 02:28:19,540
It's kind of, the technology has come a long way and it sort of works.

2147
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,420
Yeah, it's strange.

2148
02:28:20,740 --> 02:28:27,140
Nintendo is, oh no, I think they have done something VR related

2149
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:29,380
with like the cardboard thing.

2150
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:30,020
What was that?

2151
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:31,860
The Nintendo Labo?

2152
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:37,540
I feel like there was like a VR, a cardboard thing that you put on your head

2153
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:38,980
and like some of the games are in that.

2154
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,140
Or maybe I'm just misremembering.

2155
02:28:41,140 --> 02:28:42,340
That sounds familiar.

2156
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:44,020
I didn't know if it was a Nintendo thing.

2157
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:47,860
No, no, no, you just put your phone,

2158
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:49,700
you just put your phone into the little cardboard thing.

2159
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:51,300
That's that thing.

2160
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:56,500
No, the Nintendo Labo thing, I saw German make it and it's like a gun

2161
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:59,780
or some sort of like shooty thing and it's like a visor.

2162
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:02,660
And you put the Nintendo Switch screen and you put it up to your face

2163
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:09,380
and then it's like you're shooting in VR kind of with the, I don't fucking remember.

2164
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:13,620
Okay, sounds interesting.

2165
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:16,020
It sounds like a Nintendo gimmick.

2166
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:17,860
I feel like they would have, they should have,

2167
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:21,140
not that they should have, but they would have done more with VR.

2168
02:29:21,140 --> 02:29:23,140
Seems like they're sort of wheelhouse.

2169
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:25,620
I feel like they could do a VR console.

2170
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:28,660
Yeah, maybe they're gun shy since the virtual boy.

2171
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:34,420
They got to come back, they got to come back with the virtual

2172
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:36,900
man.

2173
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:39,140
The virtual non-binary.

2174
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:43,140
The virtual baby.

2175
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:44,580
Yeah.

2176
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:50,580
Next one is called Notability, the downfall of Wikipedia.

2177
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:52,420
Three, two, one, go.

2178
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:56,900
In episode 312, y'all talked about an article getting removed from Wikipedia

2179
02:29:56,900 --> 02:30:00,340
for not being notable as if that meant it got too few page visits or something

2180
02:30:00,340 --> 02:30:04,020
and started saying stuff like, oh no, will this article get deleted

2181
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:06,020
if no one looks at it 10 years from now?

2182
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:08,100
But that's just not what notable means.

2183
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:11,940
On Wikipedia, notable just means multiple news organizations,

2184
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:14,900
published articles about this place person or thing.

2185
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:18,500
So no, this isn't some slippery slope that'll destroy Wikipedia.

2186
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:21,540
It's a policy that they've heard consistently for over a decade.

2187
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:25,140
Okay, so maybe I didn't understand what the word

2188
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:26,820
Notability meant in that context.

2189
02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:29,380
However, I remember we were talking about David Firth,

2190
02:30:29,380 --> 02:30:32,660
and David Firth is most definitely a notable animator

2191
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:35,300
who should be, who should have a Wikipedia article.

2192
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:40,340
So by that, if that's the standard, then it's a bad standard.

2193
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:46,900
Like, yeah, he hasn't been published in a lot of major outlets or anything,

2194
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:47,700
but that's fine.

2195
02:30:48,580 --> 02:30:49,380
He shouldn't have to be.

2196
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:50,500
Yeah.

2197
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,460
He's notable, dammit.

2198
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:53,860
Like, I don't know.

2199
02:30:54,580 --> 02:30:56,020
I don't like the tone of this guy.

2200
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:58,260
He's a little nitpicker.

2201
02:30:58,260 --> 02:31:01,940
He's going around trying to pick us with nits.

2202
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:03,940
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

2203
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:11,620
Like, isn't it clear from our discussion that it's these small technical foibles

2204
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:15,300
and things are not the meat of the conversation clearly,

2205
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:18,420
that the point is that David Firth, having his Wikipedia removed,

2206
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:23,060
shouldn't have happened, and that's why we're talking about it in that way?

2207
02:31:23,780 --> 02:31:28,900
Like, you floated the idea of page visits, and then the conversation stared into you talking

2208
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:31,860
about published media articles and stuff.

2209
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:34,020
You did get to the correct conclusion eventually.

2210
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:35,540
I remember, I listened to it yesterday.

2211
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:37,540
Well, fuck.

2212
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:39,060
So I don't get ways correcting you.

2213
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:39,780
What does this guy want?

2214
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:41,940
When you already said the correct thing afterwards.

2215
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:46,180
I think this guy might have broken rule one and not listened to the whole episode

2216
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:47,780
before he made his voicemails.

2217
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:51,860
Maybe, like, I think it's a shame David Firth's thing got deleted,

2218
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:53,700
because he is a very notable person.

2219
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:56,740
And I'm sure this fucking article is mentioning salad fingers.

2220
02:31:56,740 --> 02:32:00,580
I swear, like, whoa, look at this creepy cartoon.

2221
02:32:00,580 --> 02:32:02,420
Like, that's probably happened.

2222
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:04,500
Like, everybody knows salad fingers.

2223
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:04,820
Yeah.

2224
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:07,700
Um, it's ridiculous.

2225
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:13,860
Like, the reason to complain is that, like, the definition of notable is flawed,

2226
02:32:13,860 --> 02:32:16,980
because there are plenty of things that are important that aren't necessarily mentioned

2227
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:17,940
by mainstream media.

2228
02:32:19,220 --> 02:32:19,700
Exactly.

2229
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:20,580
That are significant.

2230
02:32:20,580 --> 02:32:22,180
That's kind of the point.

2231
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:22,660
Yeah.

2232
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:25,860
Which, again, was discussed last week, so I don't get this voicemail.

2233
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,620
I feel like there's something.

2234
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:28,580
He's nitpicking.

2235
02:32:28,580 --> 02:32:30,100
If he's going to pit more nicks.

2236
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:33,540
I'm the nitpick nerd.

2237
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:37,140
You better have a good argument next time.

2238
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:42,980
He's the, he's a new, new, new, new Nate fucker called the Nate Picker.

2239
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:43,700
He's Nate.

2240
02:32:43,700 --> 02:32:50,500
He, he, he picks every episode, see if Nate's in it.

2241
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:58,900
Next one is called, um, Tom upload the podcasts to Apple podcasts.

2242
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:02,660
I, right, I have a feeling I know what this one's going to be about, but three, two, one, go.

2243
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:09,300
Hey, Ben, you know, remember, uh, behind the bastards, uh, Robert Evans podcast from like a

2244
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:09,860
year or so ago?

2245
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:10,340
Yeah.

2246
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:11,380
So anyway, I never listened to it.

2247
02:33:11,380 --> 02:33:15,940
He didn't, he did an episode or a two part episode on Christine Weston Chandler.

2248
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:19,860
And I thought that you would find it interesting and funny and sad and shit.

2249
02:33:19,860 --> 02:33:19,940
Perhaps.

2250
02:33:19,940 --> 02:33:22,340
And yeah, now you and all the listeners know about it.

2251
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:23,780
Bye.

2252
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:24,100
Okay.

2253
02:33:24,980 --> 02:33:26,100
That's kind of funny.

2254
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:29,060
I thought he did about like historical figures.

2255
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:29,700
It's kind of funny.

2256
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:31,780
He would do a Chris Chan episode.

2257
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:32,340
Hey, who?

2258
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:37,220
The, this, this podcast is about, uh, this behind, behind the bastards.

2259
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:40,020
It's like telling the story of like villains from history.

2260
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:41,460
I think that's what it's all about.

2261
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:43,780
Dictate, like dictators and stuff.

2262
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:46,580
Classic, classic villain of history.

2263
02:33:46,580 --> 02:33:49,620
Some idiot that got trolled online.

2264
02:33:51,300 --> 02:33:55,060
Dude, she like, I, she like curse you homie hard like so many people.

2265
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:57,940
She did do some serious.

2266
02:33:57,940 --> 02:33:58,820
Did Hitler do that?

2267
02:33:58,820 --> 02:33:59,540
Don't think so.

2268
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:00,820
Her kid.

2269
02:34:00,820 --> 02:34:01,220
Look at him.

2270
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:02,980
Kersi, how me, huh?

2271
02:34:02,980 --> 02:34:03,940
Even a single.

2272
02:34:03,940 --> 02:34:07,300
If they, they better mention the bicarbonate rain holocaust.

2273
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:08,740
Oh my God.

2274
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:10,020
Honestly, many worlds.

2275
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:14,820
She did carry out a Holocaust that she felt was a legitimate act of, you know,

2276
02:34:15,380 --> 02:34:18,820
but by her definition would be a legitimate act of genocide.

2277
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:19,780
She did do that.

2278
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,020
She believes she did it.

2279
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:25,860
Yeah.

2280
02:34:25,860 --> 02:34:28,900
She believes that these characters are real people

2281
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:35,380
and that she eliminated 70,000 of them with a artificial weather event.

2282
02:34:35,940 --> 02:34:36,980
With chemical weapons.

2283
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:38,900
Chemical weapons, yes.

2284
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:41,460
In violation of the Geneva Convention.

2285
02:34:46,100 --> 02:34:51,380
To quote, to quote Goose Goose from that, that half life commentary video.

2286
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:56,500
I do not believe that Christian Western Chandler even read the Geneva

2287
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:58,660
conventions much less ratified them.

2288
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:01,620
Or Quickville, I guess I should say.

2289
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:02,660
Ratified them.

2290
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:05,540
Yeah, you have to rat, you have to vote, you have to ratify them.

2291
02:35:06,580 --> 02:35:07,780
Turn them into a rat.

2292
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:09,220
In NATO or something like that.

2293
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:10,340
To the king of the rats.

2294
02:35:12,740 --> 02:35:15,940
Next one is called, will Ben ever pay his taxes?

2295
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:17,460
Three, two, one, go.

2296
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:19,380
No, absolutely not.

2297
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:24,020
I did pay my tax.

2298
02:35:24,020 --> 02:35:24,820
I already paid them.

2299
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:27,060
Yeah, that's a good clip.

2300
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:29,060
That's a good clip to use.

2301
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:30,260
Absolutely not.

2302
02:35:30,260 --> 02:35:31,140
Laugh some a night.

2303
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,700
I'm going to download that one.

2304
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:36,580
That's pretty good.

2305
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:41,380
All right, next one is a tweet from Drinking Moth.

2306
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:45,540
So reincarnated Samurai Sama wasn't Mages but Maze, huh?

2307
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:47,460
Okay, I'll draw American one too then.

2308
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:48,980
Alexa, play Kill la Kill.

2309
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:51,140
Opening two.

2310
02:35:52,180 --> 02:35:53,060
Oh, we've got a whole.

2311
02:35:53,060 --> 02:35:54,180
Look out those are the snakes.

2312
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:55,940
In the fire.

2313
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:58,900
Oh, they are Kawasaki clan of greatness.

2314
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:03,220
Once protectors of voice jail were wiped out in one sentence by the traitor Tommy J.

2315
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:07,700
He unleashed them snakes the serpent thousand times or Ruchi's worse.

2316
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:09,620
Oh, it's a it's a poem.

2317
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:10,420
Save the scroll.

2318
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,300
Don't be ignorant.

2319
02:36:11,300 --> 02:36:12,980
Flew young boy full of remorse.

2320
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:14,660
Even then Ben St.

2321
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:20,100
What villain stole the Kawasaki scroll with no spirit or somebody Samurai Sama.

2322
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:22,100
Samusama died all alone.

2323
02:36:22,100 --> 02:36:26,020
But the rage of Kawasaki yet still burns like flame them snakes.

2324
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:29,860
His soul split like teriyaki to a tone for past mistake.

2325
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:35,860
America was always a country of cowards.

2326
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:38,900
Nobody is ready to take up arms and fight against oppression.

2327
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:42,260
Latvia was never anything special in the grand scheme of things.

2328
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:46,180
There's no one daring to make a statement of their existence.

2329
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:51,300
I don't know what's what's that in the guitar like foam?

2330
02:36:52,260 --> 02:36:54,100
Yeah, it looks like styrofoam.

2331
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:56,580
I will change it with the power of the Kawasaki scroll.

2332
02:36:57,700 --> 02:36:59,140
Do they mean Lithuania?

2333
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:00,820
Because mage is from Lithuania.

2334
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:03,300
I think they I think they mean to say Lithuania.

2335
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:03,860
Oh, no.

2336
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:05,300
Also, why is she missing an arm?

2337
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:08,980
Oh, she's she's getting ready to cosplay.

2338
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:11,140
A zooming.

2339
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:12,900
Yeah, exactly.

2340
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:18,180
One soul, two bodies, two dreams, one target.

2341
02:37:19,380 --> 02:37:20,180
Oh my god.

2342
02:37:20,740 --> 02:37:21,700
Wow.

2343
02:37:21,780 --> 02:37:25,780
Remind me to commission drinking moth for.

2344
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:29,700
Yeah, I need some art when I do the League of Nightfuckers

2345
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:33,620
compilation video.

2346
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:38,180
I had I had had some art in my mind for like a year that I'm too tired to draw.

2347
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:40,500
But drinking moth got the goods.

2348
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:43,620
This is very this is very funny.

2349
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:49,060
This is bowling ball on a club nun chuck.

2350
02:37:49,380 --> 02:37:50,500
I guess.

2351
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:52,500
So I guess this is Ethan Ralph's daughter.

2352
02:37:53,060 --> 02:37:59,300
So Ethan Ralph's daughter, mage's daughter fighting over the Kawasaki scroll

2353
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:04,260
for their own ends and fighting over it.

2354
02:38:05,460 --> 02:38:06,260
It was.

2355
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:07,460
Yeah, I mean.

2356
02:38:07,460 --> 02:38:09,380
Why does she have a bowling ball on a chain?

2357
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:10,340
Simple as could be.

2358
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:11,140
I don't.

2359
02:38:11,140 --> 02:38:13,540
Oh, because she was born at or she was.

2360
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:16,340
No, her parents were married at a bowling alley.

2361
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:17,700
Oh my god.

2362
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:19,620
Maybe she was also born in one as well.

2363
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:20,180
I don't know.

2364
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:20,500
Yeah.

2365
02:38:23,860 --> 02:38:24,180
Wait.

2366
02:38:24,820 --> 02:38:30,420
Born in a bowling alley, like in the alley, like with the bowling balls flying past drinking.

2367
02:38:30,420 --> 02:38:34,020
Drinking moth gave the the sword is based on the Latvian flag.

2368
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:36,100
It's the wrong country.

2369
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:37,300
No, it's okay.

2370
02:38:37,300 --> 02:38:38,580
But it looks so good, though.

2371
02:38:39,460 --> 02:38:39,700
Yeah.

2372
02:38:41,140 --> 02:38:41,940
It looks really good.

2373
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:44,580
Thank thank you.

2374
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:46,820
Thank you for these very.

2375
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:48,740
I'm very I'm very chuck.

2376
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:49,300
Chuckled.

2377
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:50,740
I'm chuffed.

2378
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:51,460
Chuffed was the word.

2379
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:52,420
Chuffled.

2380
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:57,140
Uh, next, next one is a Vokeru link.

2381
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:58,340
I'll put it right here.

2382
02:38:59,300 --> 02:39:02,580
Okay, uh, in three, two, one, go.

2383
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:04,900
Hi, this is drinking moth again.

2384
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:07,140
Him, Twilight, can you switch my voice?

2385
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:08,420
Sure.

2386
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:09,700
I believe this is the button.

2387
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:12,580
One, one, one, two, three.

2388
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:14,820
Hmm, this isn't quite ideal yet.

2389
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:19,060
So, see, you need to press twice and then rotate.

2390
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:25,940
So, as you might have already guessed, I am the creator of Twilight Sparkle Saga.

2391
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:28,900
Sorry for sending some red herring shittier voicemails.

2392
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:33,620
Hey, if you have any questions about the whole thing, feel free to ask.

2393
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:36,260
Now that narrative is over, I will answer them clearly.

2394
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:40,660
Also, as a long time listener, I must say my thanks.

2395
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:44,180
Ben, you were the reason I started making comics.

2396
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:47,300
I just caught you once drawing vapors on stream.

2397
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:49,940
Gib, your baby jail.

2398
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:51,140
Jail babe.

2399
02:39:51,140 --> 02:39:52,180
Whatever.

2400
02:39:52,180 --> 02:39:55,860
Shown me that you don't need to have super pretty hyper realistic art

2401
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:57,940
to tell an engaging story.

2402
02:39:57,940 --> 02:40:01,540
Oblivionfall, thanks for showing me voicemeter.

2403
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:05,700
None of this would have happened if I had to register at every SFX site,

2404
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:10,900
download every YouTube video and pay for every text to speech or deep fake server.

2405
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:15,220
And of course, thanks to every guest and audience of PCP for listening.

2406
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:17,540
Good night, space cowboy.

2407
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:20,420
Aren't you forgetting something?

2408
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:21,940
Ah, right.

2409
02:40:21,940 --> 02:40:23,220
I will fuck Nate.

2410
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:23,780
Yes!

2411
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:24,980
I will fuck Nate.

2412
02:40:24,980 --> 02:40:26,260
I will fuck Nate.

2413
02:40:26,260 --> 02:40:28,180
I will fuck Nate.

2414
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:29,460
I will fuck Nate.

2415
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,820
I will fuck Nate.

2416
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:32,020
I'll fuck Nate.

2417
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:33,780
Even I have you fuck Nate.

2418
02:40:34,820 --> 02:40:35,700
Oh yeah.

2419
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:39,860
Fakayuri no sento sama and sayonara.

2420
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:43,620
Thank you, drinking mom.

2421
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,740
That was great.

2422
02:40:44,740 --> 02:40:45,540
Hell yeah.

2423
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:49,140
You know, and right after I already was ready to commission them for some Nate fucker,

2424
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:50,740
they just come out here with this.

2425
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:53,860
Oh, perfect, perfect for the job.

2426
02:40:53,860 --> 02:40:57,540
I'll hit you up and maybe like a week or two and I'm ready to edit that.

2427
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:03,060
I'll sketch up an image and if you're open, I'll give you money.

2428
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:04,980
I'm sorry.

2429
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:08,660
I'm sorry I tricked you into drawing comics like a fool.

2430
02:41:08,660 --> 02:41:09,220
I'm sorry.

2431
02:41:09,220 --> 02:41:10,500
I spread the curse.

2432
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:13,940
The art's generally good.

2433
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:15,380
I love how the snakes look.

2434
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:17,540
The snakes are amazing.

2435
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:19,060
I really love that.

2436
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:20,500
Yeah, it looks really good.

2437
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:24,660
But the pose for the Lithuanian girl, like the way like her like the like the line of action,

2438
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:26,500
how her body is like slanted, leaning back.

2439
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:29,460
Very, very nice pose.

2440
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:29,940
Very nice.

2441
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:31,540
It's very good stuff.

2442
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:33,780
Yeah, yeah.

2443
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:36,020
What can I say?

2444
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:36,660
It's just great.

2445
02:41:37,300 --> 02:41:37,940
Shout outs.

2446
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:39,300
Shout outs to Drinking Moth.

2447
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:39,700
Shout out.

2448
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:40,660
Thanks for everything.

2449
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:43,540
Let's.

2450
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:44,100
All right.

2451
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:47,940
Next one is the, it's an image or link.

2452
02:41:47,940 --> 02:41:48,900
Let's see what we got.

2453
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:51,620
Oh.

2454
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:56,340
Oh, okay.

2455
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:58,020
Okay, I'm glad you enjoyed the ride.

2456
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:58,900
I see.

2457
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:00,980
Oh, it's, it's, yes, I get it.

2458
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:02,020
I think.

2459
02:42:03,220 --> 02:42:05,380
They're all, they're all ready to fuck Nate.

2460
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:12,020
That, that Twilight Sparkle does want to fuck Ben.

2461
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:12,500
It's true.

2462
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:15,060
We're Celestia to save you.

2463
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:19,140
Why is Yahtzee?

2464
02:42:19,140 --> 02:42:22,180
I think Yahtzee was, was one of the voices right at the end.

2465
02:42:22,180 --> 02:42:22,980
Yeah, one of the Texas.

2466
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:27,780
Oh, I'm not sure who some of these are.

2467
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:29,060
Is that Linkara?

2468
02:42:29,060 --> 02:42:29,620
Linkara.

2469
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:32,500
I don't know who that guy is between Yahtzee and Linkara.

2470
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:33,460
That must be the grandpa.

2471
02:42:33,460 --> 02:42:34,660
That must be Twilight's grandpa.

2472
02:42:34,660 --> 02:42:36,820
Oh, they said to us for questions.

2473
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:38,100
I have one question.

2474
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:45,460
Could you put your voicemails in like a video in like order

2475
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:46,820
so we can experience the whole thing?

2476
02:42:47,380 --> 02:42:47,620
Yeah.

2477
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:50,420
In one big like, ah, go.

2478
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:51,380
Oh, that would be nice.

2479
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:51,860
That'd be nice.

2480
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:52,420
Yeah.

2481
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:53,460
So we can go back to it.

2482
02:42:55,540 --> 02:42:58,900
Is that, is it them snakes holding that green thing?

2483
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:02,260
It looks too fuzzy to be them snakes.

2484
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:04,260
It's got like hands and like wings.

2485
02:43:05,220 --> 02:43:08,020
Some kind of demon, some kind of shadow demon.

2486
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:10,180
There was, there was some kind of like spooky shadowy voice

2487
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:13,220
and one of the voicemails from them, so.

2488
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:15,940
No, Nate.

2489
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:19,060
Is that drinking moth in the middle?

2490
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:19,780
Is that them?

2491
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:22,500
I possibly.

2492
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:23,940
With the sans eye?

2493
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:26,100
I don't know who else it could be.

2494
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:28,180
Yeah, it must, it must be.

2495
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:30,660
I don't know who the woman on the front of the face,

2496
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:32,740
but she sure is far left.

2497
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,340
She's cute.

2498
02:43:35,140 --> 02:43:35,540
Yeah.

2499
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:39,700
She's a, she's a, I don't know who, I don't know who it is either.

2500
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:40,980
She's one of the good blondes.

2501
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:45,380
Yes.

2502
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:49,300
Next, next one, next voicemail is called.

2503
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:54,500
Wait, I don't think I, yeah, I did.

2504
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:55,460
Okay, here it's called.

2505
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:58,260
Three, two, one, go.

2506
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:00,660
Okay.

2507
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:01,700
Yep, I agree.

2508
02:44:01,700 --> 02:44:02,340
Good voicemail.

2509
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:09,140
Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder Play Delta Room Chapter Two.

2510
02:44:09,140 --> 02:44:10,820
Okay, next one is called,

2511
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:13,700
If Nobody Threw Any Bricks Through Any Windows, What's The Po?

2512
02:44:14,740 --> 02:44:15,220
I don't know.

2513
02:44:16,580 --> 02:44:18,980
The next one is called Your Bugs.

2514
02:44:20,660 --> 02:44:22,740
Here, there we go.

2515
02:44:23,220 --> 02:44:25,460
Three, three, two, one, go.

2516
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:29,140
And in a way, it's kind of a puzzle game, you know?

2517
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:34,580
You're just, you're trying to figure out how to render each bug snack catchable.

2518
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:36,580
And you can use anything at your disposal, you know?

2519
02:44:36,580 --> 02:44:42,340
You've got your tools and you can even like shoot different kinds of sauce all around to like,

2520
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:45,060
you know, lead a bug snack one way or the other.

2521
02:44:45,060 --> 02:44:46,020
They hate some things.

2522
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:47,300
They love some things.

2523
02:44:47,300 --> 02:44:51,380
You can use elements from the environment and you can even use other bug snacks,

2524
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:55,380
you know, make a fight, make a hit each other, set them on fire, all sorts of stuff.

2525
02:44:55,380 --> 02:44:56,420
And it is really fun.

2526
02:44:56,980 --> 02:44:57,940
I don't understand.

2527
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:00,820
What's the significance of the clip?

2528
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:04,740
I think it's just Arlo saying funny things about bugs.

2529
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:05,620
You're bugging me.

2530
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:07,220
It's a game called Bug Snacks.

2531
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:13,540
He's talking about where, where you like, it's like Pokemon Snap,

2532
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:15,860
but with bug things kind of.

2533
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:16,260
I don't know.

2534
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:17,460
Cool.

2535
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:20,180
Sounds good.

2536
02:45:20,180 --> 02:45:20,660
I don't know.

2537
02:45:21,620 --> 02:45:22,260
Whatever.

2538
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:22,580
Okay.

2539
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:27,700
Next voicemail is called your best and worst PCP episode ever or best and worst.

2540
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:28,500
It's just a question.

2541
02:45:29,140 --> 02:45:31,780
I already said the best one is the them snakes rap.

2542
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:37,300
Worst one is this one that you're listening to right now.

2543
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:38,980
I'd say the worst one is the last one.

2544
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:40,980
Oh, yeah.

2545
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:42,980
Because we're only going up.

2546
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:48,980
I don't have a favorite.

2547
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:51,380
We already got a question about like good voicemail,

2548
02:45:51,380 --> 02:45:53,140
voicemail episode recommendations.

2549
02:45:53,140 --> 02:45:57,380
The virginity episode is still one of my favorites of all time.

2550
02:45:57,380 --> 02:46:00,340
Just because it's so, I've really listened to it so many times.

2551
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:04,740
I do remember we all didn't, we all thought monsters was a terrible

2552
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:07,140
topic and we all agreed that it sucked.

2553
02:46:07,140 --> 02:46:10,020
I mean, I listened to it and I thought it was fine.

2554
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:13,860
And then afterwards when everyone hated it, I mean, like, I mean, it wasn't that bad.

2555
02:46:14,980 --> 02:46:16,820
It wasn't great, but it was just kind of.

2556
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:18,820
Was I not on that one?

2557
02:46:18,820 --> 02:46:20,500
I keep thinking that I wasn't on it.

2558
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:21,620
I'm not sure.

2559
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:25,460
You're on Monsters Free because you shut up with a voice changer and it was funny.

2560
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:26,980
Oh, yeah.

2561
02:46:26,980 --> 02:46:28,500
So I skipped the worst episode.

2562
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:34,260
I just remember us all like not having anything to say about monsters.

2563
02:46:34,260 --> 02:46:39,780
Yeah, from the grapevine, it seemed like it was a topic episode that literally

2564
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:41,780
nobody had any reason to talk about.

2565
02:46:42,660 --> 02:46:43,140
Mm-hmm.

2566
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:46,820
But the the topic must go on, I guess.

2567
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:49,460
Yeah, or something.

2568
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:53,700
Next one is stop with all the YouTube links, please.

2569
02:46:53,700 --> 02:46:55,940
Yeah, although there haven't been that many.

2570
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:56,980
There's been one.

2571
02:46:56,980 --> 02:47:00,980
I mean, if you explain what the video is, it's more likely to be included, right?

2572
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:02,340
Yeah, if you, yeah.

2573
02:47:03,700 --> 02:47:06,660
Next one is a social blade link.

2574
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:09,140
I don't know.

2575
02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:10,740
User is not found.

2576
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:11,620
So it didn't work.

2577
02:47:11,620 --> 02:47:12,340
Thanks.

2578
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:12,980
Thanks, dude.

2579
02:47:12,980 --> 02:47:13,780
Okay.

2580
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:18,180
Next one is speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail.

2581
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:22,340
And yes, that is where you can submit voicemail links.

2582
02:47:22,340 --> 02:47:23,220
Okay, good job.

2583
02:47:24,340 --> 02:47:25,060
Uh-huh.

2584
02:47:25,060 --> 02:47:28,020
Next one is called, okay, good advice.

2585
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:29,540
No, no, good luck.

2586
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:32,820
Thumbs up, adviceanimalsatreddit.com.

2587
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:35,300
Posting right now.

2588
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:35,940
Right.

2589
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:36,500
All right.

2590
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:37,700
Three, two, one, go.

2591
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:44,980
Probably unsolicited advice, but as a person who had to shave his head at 24 years old,

2592
02:47:44,980 --> 02:47:45,620
it sucks.

2593
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:50,980
It's fine when you do it like 30 onwards, but at 24 is the worst.

2594
02:47:51,860 --> 02:48:01,220
That being said, if you have hair that isn't like being obstructed, like destroyed by really,

2595
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:07,140
really ugly bald spots, I would say keep your hair style better.

2596
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:15,300
For example, there was like this Brazilian guy that like hosted a DND session at a public event

2597
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:16,020
that I went to.

2598
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:20,180
And he was like kind of an early looking guy.

2599
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:29,140
And only after like two or three or four hours of DNDing, I finally noticed he was coming over

2600
02:48:29,140 --> 02:48:30,340
a bald spot.

2601
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:32,020
But overall, he looked great.

2602
02:48:32,740 --> 02:48:35,300
So sorry for the long voicemail.

2603
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:41,940
But I would advise this mantra, you can do a lot more with hair than you can do without.

2604
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:48,980
Maybe, but like you did notice the bald spot at the end.

2605
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:55,060
The comb over is such a bad look in my eyes.

2606
02:48:55,060 --> 02:48:56,020
Bald is just better.

2607
02:48:57,620 --> 02:49:05,060
I wonder if this guy's just down on his own look in that way that one is a harsher judge of

2608
02:49:05,140 --> 02:49:06,500
oneself than of others.

2609
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:15,060
I did give myself a haircut and I decided afterwards that I was much happier with how

2610
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:16,260
my hair looks now.

2611
02:49:17,300 --> 02:49:20,900
I cut it short in the back and the sides and left it longer on top.

2612
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:23,700
And I think that's how I think that's how it looks best.

2613
02:49:23,700 --> 02:49:26,100
So I'm back to being like okay with it.

2614
02:49:28,100 --> 02:49:30,660
Yeah, so my crisis has been averted.

2615
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:41,860
I feel like if you have the confidence to pull off an exceptionally not acceptable

2616
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:49,060
weird hairstyle, like a fryer tuck where you're bald all over the top but you've got the end

2617
02:49:49,060 --> 02:49:57,300
of a bald cut all the way around, if you could pull that off, you would be so cool if you could

2618
02:49:57,300 --> 02:49:57,780
do it.

2619
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:59,380
You'd need a lot of confidence.

2620
02:49:59,460 --> 02:50:05,300
You'd need to go around in a brown robe and just be a fryer tuck character.

2621
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:09,380
So you're saying the coolest person you could imagine is just a monk.

2622
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:16,260
Well, what I'm saying is going bald happens to a lot of people and people get it.

2623
02:50:16,260 --> 02:50:19,140
Like when I see a bald-ing person, I'm not disgusted.

2624
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:21,540
It's just normal.

2625
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:25,300
It's just like lots of people look like that in various stages.

2626
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:38,100
But I feel like there's space to be having a bald spot or a bald-ing thing

2627
02:50:39,140 --> 02:50:42,660
and deliberately crafting it and making it look deliberate

2628
02:50:43,940 --> 02:50:47,940
with confidence that it could actually look cooler than if you just shaved it all off.

2629
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:49,700
I don't know.

2630
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:54,420
If you do a weird monk look or samurai shave the top of your head thing,

2631
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:58,500
you just look like you're, it just looks like a joke.

2632
02:50:58,500 --> 02:50:59,620
It just looks like you're in a costume.

2633
02:50:59,620 --> 02:51:01,380
I guess I think jokes are cool.

2634
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:05,300
I think joke people are like epic.

2635
02:51:06,980 --> 02:51:10,660
People should wear real clown makeup as normal clothing.

2636
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:16,100
I would look at that and I would say that this guy is like doing a bit.

2637
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:20,180
I wouldn't be like, damn, he's got the confidence to pull off an unconventional look.

2638
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:24,260
I would think he's filming a YouTube video and I'm supposed to be,

2639
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:25,620
and I'm going to be his next victim.

2640
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:31,380
I guess I keep remembering this one guy I met while I'd meet.

2641
02:51:31,380 --> 02:51:36,740
I just saw him on the train once and he had like a bright green, like neon green suit

2642
02:51:37,380 --> 02:51:40,900
and like a punk hairstyle and he looked like he was like 75.

2643
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:47,860
I'm like, dang, something about the way he's holding himself is like so cool.

2644
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:49,620
I guess he's like an old school punk.

2645
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:52,740
He was like trying to stay like on the edge.

2646
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:54,340
That's pretty cool.

2647
02:51:55,940 --> 02:52:00,020
Yeah, I appreciate the punk look.

2648
02:52:01,300 --> 02:52:02,420
It's like a true punk.

2649
02:52:02,420 --> 02:52:04,420
It's not an aesthetic in and of itself.

2650
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:08,100
I think lifestyle choice to be strange.

2651
02:52:08,900 --> 02:52:14,580
I think long hair is more punk, but I just don't think I look very good with my hair long.

2652
02:52:15,220 --> 02:52:17,620
So I don't know.

2653
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:29,460
You know, you can't necessarily just pull off any look you want to just because you believe

2654
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:31,620
in yourself hard enough.

2655
02:52:32,260 --> 02:52:33,060
Maybe that's not true.

2656
02:52:33,060 --> 02:52:34,180
Maybe that's just my doubt.

2657
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:35,860
Maybe that's just my own self-doubt talking.

2658
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:37,220
Yeah, I don't think I could do it.

2659
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:42,580
I feel like I would crumble under pressure and try to like fall into the background

2660
02:52:42,580 --> 02:52:43,700
so that people don't look at me.

2661
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:48,500
But I know it's possible because I've seen people do it and I am impressed.

2662
02:52:49,620 --> 02:52:54,100
But maybe I'm only impressed because I have shy tendencies.

2663
02:52:55,300 --> 02:52:55,780
Who knows?

2664
02:52:58,980 --> 02:53:05,140
I'm not particularly bothered by like looking weird in public.

2665
02:53:07,860 --> 02:53:10,180
I don't really get embarrassed about that sort of thing.

2666
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:15,140
So I maybe I could do it.

2667
02:53:18,500 --> 02:53:22,580
Next one is called, did I skip one?

2668
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:27,540
Yes, next one is called You Dumb Yank.

2669
02:53:28,820 --> 02:53:29,540
And there it is.

2670
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:31,460
Three, two, one, go.

2671
02:53:32,660 --> 02:53:34,340
Listen here, Ben Shribatsky.

2672
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:39,300
The reason why Shribatsky is the people united will never be defeated.

2673
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:45,300
It's because it's a translation from a Chilean song called El Pueblo Unido Jamacer A Vencido.

2674
02:53:45,300 --> 02:53:46,740
It's a literal translation.

2675
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:47,860
It's not a mistake.

2676
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:53,060
The only reason why it's like that is because English is a garbage language.

2677
02:53:53,060 --> 02:53:53,460
Sorry.

2678
02:53:54,340 --> 02:54:00,580
And the people united will never be divided makes no fucking sense because as Gip said,

2679
02:54:01,380 --> 02:54:04,180
it's already implied that they are fucking united.

2680
02:54:04,180 --> 02:54:05,540
It doesn't make fucking sense.

2681
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:07,220
Well, what the fuck?

2682
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:12,660
I'm going to defend my statement.

2683
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:17,060
I think that translation involves localization.

2684
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:20,900
And I think that preserving the rhyme would be important.

2685
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:27,380
And I think that no, it makes sense to say once they're united, they will not be divided

2686
02:54:27,380 --> 02:54:31,860
because if the goal is to unite, defeat and division are basically one and the same.

2687
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:32,900
Exactly.

2688
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:34,100
So it does make sense.

2689
02:54:34,100 --> 02:54:35,700
I think it, thank you.

2690
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:36,900
It makes perfect sense.

2691
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:39,860
You fucking Chilean bastard.

2692
02:54:39,860 --> 02:54:41,060
You South American.

2693
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:43,060
Did you say English?

2694
02:54:43,060 --> 02:54:43,700
English.

2695
02:54:44,260 --> 02:54:44,900
Damn.

2696
02:54:44,900 --> 02:54:46,340
I heard that slip.

2697
02:54:48,340 --> 02:54:51,380
The people divided will never be multiplied.

2698
02:54:52,100 --> 02:54:52,820
Multiplied.

2699
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:56,740
I still prefer Gibbs interpretation.

2700
02:54:56,740 --> 02:54:59,300
The people united will never be divided.

2701
02:55:00,260 --> 02:55:01,300
Will never be divided.

2702
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:06,580
People will be so scared that they'll just conventionally to every demand.

2703
02:55:07,620 --> 02:55:11,140
Next, there's a follow-up called you dumb Yankee part two.

2704
02:55:12,660 --> 02:55:13,220
Three.

2705
02:55:13,220 --> 02:55:14,900
Actually, there's a part three as well.

2706
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:16,180
This is part two.

2707
02:55:16,180 --> 02:55:17,380
Three, two, one, go.

2708
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:21,140
Okay, Ben Zelensky.

2709
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:21,940
I'm sorry, man.

2710
02:55:21,940 --> 02:55:27,380
I was a little bit violent just now because I just got my third booster shot.

2711
02:55:28,260 --> 02:55:31,940
And I'm fucking, I am in fucking pain right now.

2712
02:55:31,940 --> 02:55:34,340
And it's fucking awful.

2713
02:55:34,980 --> 02:55:37,940
But I guess it beats breathing through a tube.

2714
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:39,140
That's it.

2715
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:40,260
Get your booster shot.

2716
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:42,660
I did get my booster shot.

2717
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:43,460
Fuck you, Ben.

2718
02:55:43,460 --> 02:55:44,100
Yeah, of course.

2719
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:45,860
Yeah, fuck Ben.

2720
02:55:45,860 --> 02:55:47,220
We're really good Ben fuckers.

2721
02:55:47,220 --> 02:55:51,220
Yeah, I thought for a second he was being kind and that was too far.

2722
02:55:52,180 --> 02:55:52,500
I did get my booster shot.

2723
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:54,500
He had to say fuck Ben at the end to balance it out.

2724
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:56,260
I got it.

2725
02:55:56,260 --> 02:55:57,140
When did I get it?

2726
02:55:57,940 --> 02:56:02,820
Probably in like late January, I think, or something.

2727
02:56:02,820 --> 02:56:03,780
So it's been a while.

2728
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:07,140
I would like another one, please.

2729
02:56:08,020 --> 02:56:09,940
I'd like a boob or shot, please.

2730
02:56:09,940 --> 02:56:10,660
One in each.

2731
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:12,020
Nice.

2732
02:56:13,300 --> 02:56:14,180
Nice.

2733
02:56:14,180 --> 02:56:14,740
Very good.

2734
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:16,260
There's one.

2735
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:17,460
Okay, next one is part three.

2736
02:56:18,340 --> 02:56:19,700
Three, two, one, go.

2737
02:56:21,140 --> 02:56:24,180
Okay, I know this is the third voicemail I sent.

2738
02:56:24,180 --> 02:56:24,820
I am sorry.

2739
02:56:24,820 --> 02:56:25,620
At least they're short.

2740
02:56:25,620 --> 02:56:26,820
I'm not going to send any more.

2741
02:56:28,020 --> 02:56:32,660
But before I forget, I want to thank Gib because the package arrived.

2742
02:56:33,460 --> 02:56:37,140
And I've been laughing like a dumbass to read my comics.

2743
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:38,100
It's really funny.

2744
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:41,060
I have not yet read The Lord of Ghosts.

2745
02:56:41,060 --> 02:56:42,020
I'm going to read it.

2746
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:46,660
I have a lot of things to do first, but I will read it.

2747
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:48,900
So thank you for the doodle.

2748
02:56:48,900 --> 02:56:53,300
Thank you for what you sent me and that's it.

2749
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:53,860
That's it.

2750
02:56:53,860 --> 02:56:54,740
Have a good day.

2751
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:55,460
Well, thank you.

2752
02:56:55,460 --> 02:56:56,580
Thank you for buying it.

2753
02:56:57,300 --> 02:56:58,660
That guy went through an arc.

2754
02:56:58,660 --> 02:57:01,700
He started off a villain and he became a hero.

2755
02:57:01,940 --> 02:57:05,540
Based gigachat move reading the Red Man comic first.

2756
02:57:06,340 --> 02:57:07,060
That's true.

2757
02:57:07,060 --> 02:57:10,500
I suspect that my package from you did arrive.

2758
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:14,180
Something turned up at my mother-in-law's.

2759
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:16,020
We're heading there today to go.

2760
02:57:16,020 --> 02:57:16,580
Oh, good.

2761
02:57:17,300 --> 02:57:18,980
Oh, I don't think I'm...

2762
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:22,100
I don't know if I mentioned this on the last episode.

2763
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:23,620
I meant to say it.

2764
02:57:23,620 --> 02:57:25,140
Oh, this is actually really important.

2765
02:57:25,140 --> 02:57:27,860
I wanted to say that I went to my PO box

2766
02:57:27,860 --> 02:57:30,340
and I discovered that my PO box had expired.

2767
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:33,780
And so it's possible that some people

2768
02:57:33,780 --> 02:57:36,980
who I might have sent a package to and it did not arrive,

2769
02:57:36,980 --> 02:57:39,460
it might have been unable to be returned to me

2770
02:57:39,460 --> 02:57:40,980
and it was lost.

2771
02:57:40,980 --> 02:57:44,180
So I guess anyone listening,

2772
02:57:44,180 --> 02:57:46,180
if you have not gotten a package from me,

2773
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:50,180
you should let me know and I will just send you another one

2774
02:57:50,180 --> 02:57:52,580
because that's my fault for letting the PO box expire.

2775
02:57:53,220 --> 02:57:54,500
Actually, there were like four...

2776
02:57:54,500 --> 02:57:55,860
There were like four packages.

2777
02:57:55,860 --> 02:57:57,860
I think there were three pleb in the wee Blu-rays

2778
02:57:57,860 --> 02:58:00,500
and there was one copy of Road to Radcon.

2779
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,500
And these were like old copies.

2780
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:04,100
I had sent them in February.

2781
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:08,580
So anything after February that got returned is gone, I think.

2782
02:58:08,580 --> 02:58:09,860
So that's kind of sad.

2783
02:58:09,860 --> 02:58:11,220
Hopefully there's not that many.

2784
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:13,940
But I have like four that I have

2785
02:58:13,940 --> 02:58:16,020
that I have to contact those people and send them out.

2786
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:18,740
But there's probably some more that are missing.

2787
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:21,380
And I hate to think that anyone bought something from me

2788
02:58:21,380 --> 02:58:22,100
and didn't get it.

2789
02:58:23,460 --> 02:58:24,420
So I will like...

2790
02:58:25,140 --> 02:58:27,220
Those people whose envelopes I do have,

2791
02:58:27,220 --> 02:58:28,660
I will try and reach out to them

2792
02:58:28,660 --> 02:58:30,420
if I can figure out who they were.

2793
02:58:31,860 --> 02:58:35,700
Yeah, that was a bit of bad news that I found today.

2794
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:36,980
But I guess this does mean

2795
02:58:36,980 --> 02:58:39,860
that I can now get a new PO box closer to my house,

2796
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:42,100
which is convenient.

2797
02:58:42,740 --> 02:58:45,460
That old one was like the other side of town.

2798
02:58:45,460 --> 02:58:46,260
It was very annoying.

2799
02:58:47,780 --> 02:58:48,580
Oh, yeah.

2800
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:50,100
I guess I should mention briefly.

2801
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:53,780
If anybody's gotten their Lord of Ghost package

2802
02:58:53,780 --> 02:58:55,460
but hasn't let me know,

2803
02:58:56,340 --> 02:58:58,420
I can't tell when things have arrived

2804
02:58:58,420 --> 02:59:00,180
because I didn't have tracking on a lot of these

2805
02:59:00,900 --> 02:59:02,020
for money purposes.

2806
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:06,740
So I haven't received any returns.

2807
02:59:06,740 --> 02:59:09,940
So I assume most of them did arrive safely.

2808
02:59:10,820 --> 02:59:14,020
But if you have a Twitter account, tweet at me.

2809
02:59:14,980 --> 02:59:18,260
It's not just base and cool to see that you're enjoying it.

2810
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:19,780
But it's helpful.

2811
02:59:19,780 --> 02:59:22,420
So I can just go on my spreadsheet and say,

2812
02:59:22,420 --> 02:59:23,380
that one's arrived.

2813
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:24,420
Don't have to worry about that.

2814
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:29,300
And yeah, some of them might be very stuck

2815
02:59:30,020 --> 02:59:31,460
and still in transit.

2816
02:59:32,020 --> 02:59:33,860
But I can't know right now.

2817
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:38,020
Some of them end up, especially international packages,

2818
02:59:38,020 --> 02:59:40,740
sometimes end up getting stuck in shipping limbo

2819
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:44,500
for a disappointingly long amount of time.

2820
02:59:44,500 --> 02:59:45,780
So if it hasn't arrived yet

2821
02:59:46,660 --> 02:59:48,660
and I haven't received a return,

2822
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:51,620
it's probably on its way very, very slowly.

2823
02:59:52,580 --> 02:59:55,220
So that's that, I guess.

2824
02:59:55,780 --> 02:59:57,460
Just sorry.

2825
02:59:58,900 --> 03:00:01,220
Yeah, there's nothing you can really do about it.

2826
03:00:02,660 --> 03:00:05,700
The next voicemail is just a text question.

2827
03:00:05,700 --> 03:00:07,380
It says, is Tom still a member?

2828
03:00:09,220 --> 03:00:13,380
Yes, but he said he probably won't be on anytime soon.

2829
03:00:14,260 --> 03:00:18,980
He says he's busy with the channel

2830
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:22,580
Nintendo 64, what was it called?

2831
03:00:23,140 --> 03:00:23,780
Saber Spark.

2832
03:00:23,780 --> 03:00:25,460
Yeah, Saber Spark 65.

2833
03:00:25,460 --> 03:00:27,540
Yeah, he's working on it.

2834
03:00:27,540 --> 03:00:29,220
100,000 subscribers.

2835
03:00:29,220 --> 03:00:29,780
Good for him.

2836
03:00:31,220 --> 03:00:31,780
Huh?

2837
03:00:31,780 --> 03:00:33,620
100,000 subscribers on that.

2838
03:00:33,620 --> 03:00:34,180
Good for him.

2839
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:35,780
Good for him.

2840
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:36,660
Good for him.

2841
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:37,460
Good for them.

2842
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:38,900
Vam.

2843
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:39,380
Right.

2844
03:00:39,380 --> 03:00:40,180
Snakes.

2845
03:00:41,220 --> 03:00:41,540
No.

2846
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:42,100
Good for them.

2847
03:00:42,100 --> 03:00:42,660
Snakes.

2848
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:43,620
They've got us surpassed.

2849
03:00:43,620 --> 03:00:46,180
Soon enough they'll surpass Nate, just like I did.

2850
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:49,940
True.

2851
03:00:51,300 --> 03:00:52,180
Yeah, good for them.

2852
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:55,780
Tom said he's probably not going to be around anytime soon.

2853
03:00:55,780 --> 03:00:58,820
But he's not like officially quit or anything,

2854
03:00:58,820 --> 03:01:00,100
so that's what that's about.

2855
03:01:01,860 --> 03:01:04,580
Next one is called iPod Shuffle

2856
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:08,180
Better Than Any Modern Day Portable Technology.

2857
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:10,980
Let me post that.

2858
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:12,980
Three, two, one, go.

2859
03:01:12,980 --> 03:01:18,340
So I've bought an iPod, it's like the MP3 player,

2860
03:01:18,980 --> 03:01:22,100
and I wanted to listen to this podcast.

2861
03:01:23,460 --> 03:01:25,460
I went to the link in the description,

2862
03:01:25,460 --> 03:01:30,260
and the MP3s were very hard to download in bulk.

2863
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:32,340
I could download them individually,

2864
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:38,100
but they're like a massive folder of thousands of hours of content.

2865
03:01:38,660 --> 03:01:44,260
So I know maybe I'll put like a zip to each one of them,

2866
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:47,700
more money of like every single episode so far.

2867
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:52,180
That'll be a touchy-poo life.

2868
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:58,900
Okay, does this guy want to download all the PCP episodes?

2869
03:01:58,900 --> 03:01:59,940
At once, yeah.

2870
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:00,420
In a zip.

2871
03:02:01,380 --> 03:02:02,180
In a zip file?

2872
03:02:04,900 --> 03:02:05,940
Well, I mean, I guess,

2873
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:09,860
they're all hosted on Google Drive, right?

2874
03:02:11,540 --> 03:02:14,500
They're all downloadable from the PCP website.

2875
03:02:15,220 --> 03:02:16,500
Yeah, but not in bulk.

2876
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:19,380
Not in bulk, you would have to download them one at a time,

2877
03:02:19,380 --> 03:02:21,460
which is annoying for sure.

2878
03:02:23,940 --> 03:02:25,940
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's a fair request.

2879
03:02:25,940 --> 03:02:27,380
It would just take some doing.

2880
03:02:27,380 --> 03:02:30,020
I would just have to put that together.

2881
03:02:31,540 --> 03:02:32,100
I might.

2882
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:35,620
I mean, it's not a completely stupid idea.

2883
03:02:35,860 --> 03:02:36,340
Yeah.

2884
03:02:36,980 --> 03:02:38,260
Next one is called Happy Birth.

2885
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:39,300
No, wait, no, sorry.

2886
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:40,820
Sorry, I missed this one.

2887
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:44,020
This one is called B321GO.

2888
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:47,060
What kind of pornography do you like?

2889
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:48,260
Sexy.

2890
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:52,020
Yeah, I like it when it's sexy.

2891
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:52,980
Did they say it was B?

2892
03:02:54,900 --> 03:02:56,420
It's just it's just the letter B.

2893
03:02:56,420 --> 03:02:58,260
The letter B, okay.

2894
03:02:58,260 --> 03:02:59,380
I like B porn.

2895
03:03:01,540 --> 03:03:01,860
Yeah.

2896
03:03:01,860 --> 03:03:07,220
Do you ever see a B woman and she has a big fucking what's it called?

2897
03:03:07,220 --> 03:03:07,380
Stinger.

2898
03:03:08,260 --> 03:03:08,740
Not the Stinger.

2899
03:03:08,740 --> 03:03:10,340
The thorax or no abdomen.

2900
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:14,020
Yeah, the big or the big fuzz.

2901
03:03:16,180 --> 03:03:18,900
Wings and teni, mandibles.

2902
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:20,660
There's an artist.

2903
03:03:20,660 --> 03:03:25,380
I've seen BOCs or if I give them like the big B but and I don't know what it is,

2904
03:03:25,380 --> 03:03:28,420
but it does something for me and it's good.

2905
03:03:29,060 --> 03:03:30,020
It's the B dump.

2906
03:03:32,180 --> 03:03:36,180
I found some good images, but they're all two NSFW to post.

2907
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:45,140
Yeah, yeah, the abdomen is the big like the big bulgy part underneath the tiny little waist.

2908
03:03:46,180 --> 03:03:49,300
Like those giant ants in Elden Ring that I was saying.

2909
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:53,060
I'm sure I can crop this to where it would be safe enough.

2910
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:54,580
It's just two pixels.

2911
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:57,380
I don't think I don't think it's insectoid.

2912
03:03:57,940 --> 03:03:59,300
Women really do it for me.

2913
03:04:00,260 --> 03:04:04,260
I just want to fuck everything.

2914
03:04:06,420 --> 03:04:09,380
Okay, I see where this is going and I get it.

2915
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:13,540
There's a pretty large boob elsewhere on screen.

2916
03:04:13,540 --> 03:04:14,900
Obviously, you can't show that.

2917
03:04:14,900 --> 03:04:16,660
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

2918
03:04:16,660 --> 03:04:21,780
I don't know if I like the thorax or if I like the sticking out of her butt there.

2919
03:04:24,340 --> 03:04:25,460
Little weird.

2920
03:04:25,460 --> 03:04:29,860
You grab it and pull it up like a, like a, like a, well,

2921
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:33,300
psycho potatoes, what would it be like?

2922
03:04:33,300 --> 03:04:36,180
Like a giant bag of sand.

2923
03:04:36,180 --> 03:04:36,900
Like a thing.

2924
03:04:36,900 --> 03:04:40,660
Instead of a stinger, there's just another hole to put your penis in.

2925
03:04:40,660 --> 03:04:42,100
Ben is not bug fuck.

2926
03:04:42,100 --> 03:04:43,780
This is what we're learning today.

2927
03:04:43,780 --> 03:04:44,420
Ben is not bug fuck.

2928
03:04:44,420 --> 03:04:45,540
I don't think I am.

2929
03:04:45,540 --> 03:04:47,700
Yeah, I don't really think I'm much honest.

2930
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:48,420
I mean, when it comes to-

2931
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:50,100
Work's going to be so disappointed in you.

2932
03:04:51,220 --> 03:04:53,780
Yeah, she already is, don't worry.

2933
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:58,420
When it comes to art, like this, this is like only tangentially bug.

2934
03:04:59,380 --> 03:05:00,900
Like it's basically just a woman.

2935
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:04,100
I mean, yeah.

2936
03:05:04,100 --> 03:05:08,500
Yeah, Ben wouldn't, Ben wouldn't fuck tangentially just a woman.

2937
03:05:08,500 --> 03:05:08,980
Terrible.

2938
03:05:11,940 --> 03:05:13,940
Come on, she's tangentially a woman.

2939
03:05:13,940 --> 03:05:15,220
What's, what's the problem?

2940
03:05:17,060 --> 03:05:19,060
Next one is called happy birthday Ben.

2941
03:05:20,020 --> 03:05:20,580
Oh my God.

2942
03:05:20,580 --> 03:05:23,620
And then the next one is, you're not going to believe the next one is called

2943
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:24,980
you wouldn't fuck a bee?

2944
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:33,060
There's, okay, there's, there's an image and an audio.

2945
03:05:33,060 --> 03:05:35,060
So I guess let's listen to the audio first.

2946
03:05:35,060 --> 03:05:36,260
Three, two, one, go.

2947
03:05:36,980 --> 03:05:38,100
I am not a horse.

2948
03:05:38,100 --> 03:05:39,220
I am a bee.

2949
03:05:39,220 --> 03:05:40,580
I am a funny fucking bee.

2950
03:05:41,540 --> 03:05:43,300
Oh yes, I have a big stinger.

2951
03:05:44,660 --> 03:05:46,020
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

2952
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:48,980
Celestia, you're off your meds.

2953
03:05:49,460 --> 03:05:49,960
What?

2954
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:54,660
She's really going for it.

2955
03:05:54,660 --> 03:05:57,460
Uh, there, there, there she is.

2956
03:05:58,020 --> 03:05:58,820
You know what?

2957
03:05:58,820 --> 03:05:59,540
You know what?

2958
03:05:59,540 --> 03:06:00,260
I like this.

2959
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:00,740
You know what?

2960
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:01,620
This is better.

2961
03:06:01,620 --> 03:06:02,100
Okay, okay.

2962
03:06:02,100 --> 03:06:03,620
But she's a tangential woman.

2963
03:06:03,620 --> 03:06:04,900
She's not a real woman, Ben.

2964
03:06:05,460 --> 03:06:06,260
Yeah, she's a horse.

2965
03:06:06,260 --> 03:06:07,300
I guess I like mammals.

2966
03:06:07,300 --> 03:06:08,740
No, no, no abdomen.

2967
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:09,780
No chitin, please.

2968
03:06:11,060 --> 03:06:11,860
Mammal is good.

2969
03:06:13,220 --> 03:06:14,180
I'm very vanilla.

2970
03:06:14,180 --> 03:06:15,380
I only fuck mammals.

2971
03:06:17,060 --> 03:06:18,660
That is, uh.

2972
03:06:18,660 --> 03:06:20,900
No amphibians, no frog girls.

2973
03:06:20,900 --> 03:06:21,620
It's, it's like he knew.

2974
03:06:21,620 --> 03:06:24,580
It's like he knew that I would be upset

2975
03:06:24,580 --> 03:06:25,860
by his initial question.

2976
03:06:25,860 --> 03:06:27,460
And he anticipated my response.

2977
03:06:28,260 --> 03:06:30,420
But how did they know we were going to talk about bees?

2978
03:06:31,940 --> 03:06:32,660
I don't know.

2979
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:38,740
Next, next one is another Imgir link.

2980
03:06:38,740 --> 03:06:40,100
They primed us by putting the letter B

2981
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:41,140
in the voicemail, remember?

2982
03:06:42,820 --> 03:06:44,260
That's just a happy coincidence.

2983
03:06:45,380 --> 03:06:46,980
Um, okay.

2984
03:06:47,220 --> 03:06:50,340
Okay, so this is give Ben Saint.

2985
03:06:51,460 --> 03:06:52,340
Okay, it's this.

2986
03:06:53,220 --> 03:06:55,140
Yes, you, wait, is this an album?

2987
03:06:56,260 --> 03:06:57,860
Yeah, there's a bunch of, there's a bunch of images.

2988
03:06:57,860 --> 03:06:59,220
Oh, let me have a look at these.

2989
03:07:00,020 --> 03:07:02,260
Flights from England are now landing in Boston.

2990
03:07:03,060 --> 03:07:04,100
This is the truth.

2991
03:07:04,900 --> 03:07:06,020
This is, there I go.

2992
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:06,660
There I am.

2993
03:07:08,420 --> 03:07:09,860
They gave you such a bubble butt.

2994
03:07:11,860 --> 03:07:13,060
Oh yeah, a little bit.

2995
03:07:13,380 --> 03:07:17,060
But hey, hey guy, no smoking in the airport.

2996
03:07:17,060 --> 03:07:17,540
Who me?

2997
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:20,420
Yes, you with the, oh, it's a little cut off.

2998
03:07:21,140 --> 03:07:22,660
Yes, you with the smoke.

2999
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:24,900
It's vaping.

3000
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:25,540
It's vape.

3001
03:07:25,540 --> 03:07:26,500
I'm vaping, dude.

3002
03:07:27,140 --> 03:07:29,460
A man causing trouble just by standing in place,

3003
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:30,900
not doing anything.

3004
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:33,140
It must be none other than Ben Saint.

3005
03:07:34,340 --> 03:07:35,220
That's how I find you.

3006
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:35,620
Just vibing.

3007
03:07:36,900 --> 03:07:38,420
I like that you got your guitar.

3008
03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:39,220
That's nice.

3009
03:07:39,220 --> 03:07:40,100
That's a nice detail.

3010
03:07:41,540 --> 03:07:42,820
I probably won't bring my guitar.

3011
03:07:42,820 --> 03:07:44,260
You have two guitars.

3012
03:07:44,260 --> 03:07:45,780
Do I have two guitars?

3013
03:07:46,340 --> 03:07:48,580
Well, there's the one on the, you're holding one,

3014
03:07:48,580 --> 03:07:50,500
and then there's another one in the baggage claim.

3015
03:07:52,420 --> 03:07:54,020
Oh, yeah, why?

3016
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:54,580
What?

3017
03:07:54,580 --> 03:07:55,540
Am I dual wielding?

3018
03:07:58,500 --> 03:08:00,180
Maybe one's like a ukulele.

3019
03:08:00,980 --> 03:08:03,940
Maybe one, maybe it's the two guitars from the Rayman video,

3020
03:08:04,820 --> 03:08:07,060
or the hypocritical reviews, where like,

3021
03:08:07,940 --> 03:08:09,460
there was the one who talked,

3022
03:08:09,460 --> 03:08:12,020
and then there was the other guitar that the guitar played.

3023
03:08:13,460 --> 03:08:14,100
Remember that?

3024
03:08:14,100 --> 03:08:14,500
I like.

3025
03:08:15,380 --> 03:08:16,340
Yes, I do.

3026
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:18,580
I was thinking about that character recently.

3027
03:08:19,700 --> 03:08:23,780
I was thinking, wow, hypocrite was a good channel.

3028
03:08:24,900 --> 03:08:25,140
Thanks.

3029
03:08:27,380 --> 03:08:29,140
I like how they drew my face here.

3030
03:08:29,140 --> 03:08:30,260
I think I look very cool.

3031
03:08:32,020 --> 03:08:32,740
It's vape.

3032
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:34,020
I'm vaping, dude.

3033
03:08:35,060 --> 03:08:36,980
It's not even coming out of my mouth.

3034
03:08:36,980 --> 03:08:38,660
It's just seeping out of my skin.

3035
03:08:38,660 --> 03:08:41,460
Out of your pores, just like a mist.

3036
03:08:42,420 --> 03:08:44,100
Saturated with it.

3037
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:46,340
It's losing out of my, my cloak.

3038
03:08:46,340 --> 03:08:47,220
This guy's so pissed.

3039
03:08:48,500 --> 03:08:49,380
Oh, he's a cop.

3040
03:08:51,460 --> 03:08:52,900
So, you know, of course he's mad.

3041
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:54,660
He's going to go beat his wife.

3042
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:55,780
Lamau.

3043
03:08:58,420 --> 03:08:58,820
Thank you.

3044
03:08:58,820 --> 03:08:59,940
I love, I love that.

3045
03:08:59,940 --> 03:09:01,540
That's very delightful.

3046
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:04,100
Next one is called,

3047
03:09:04,100 --> 03:09:08,020
I, Ethan Ralph, am fixing what you did to him, Ben Saints.

3048
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:11,380
Uh, there it is.

3049
03:09:11,380 --> 03:09:11,700
Okay.

3050
03:09:11,700 --> 03:09:12,740
Three, two, one, go.

3051
03:09:14,100 --> 03:09:14,980
Hi, mate.

3052
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:20,580
Last week, I took the baby to the prayer gateway church camp.

3053
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:22,420
I went to when I was a kid.

3054
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:28,020
You know, I probably never told you, but I like dicks a lot.

3055
03:09:29,540 --> 03:09:31,300
But now I'm straight, mate.

3056
03:09:31,300 --> 03:09:32,740
And so will our baby be.

3057
03:09:33,300 --> 03:09:33,940
That's great.

3058
03:09:33,940 --> 03:09:36,580
When he's back, he'll be a completely different person.

3059
03:09:37,220 --> 03:09:40,500
Just like me, Ethan Ralph senior.

3060
03:09:41,220 --> 03:09:45,540
My son, Ethan Ralph junior will be a completely different person

3061
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:46,980
by the time he comes back.

3062
03:09:47,620 --> 03:09:48,420
Who we?

3063
03:09:49,700 --> 03:09:50,260
Oh, wow.

3064
03:09:50,260 --> 03:09:50,740
Who we?

3065
03:09:50,740 --> 03:09:51,220
Who we?

3066
03:09:51,220 --> 03:09:53,220
Who we?

3067
03:09:53,220 --> 03:09:54,900
Wow, wow.

3068
03:09:54,900 --> 03:09:55,540
Wow.

3069
03:09:55,540 --> 03:09:56,900
Wow, me too.

3070
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:58,020
That's some shit.

3071
03:09:59,060 --> 03:10:00,580
Thank God, Ethan Ralph isn't gay.

3072
03:10:00,580 --> 03:10:03,300
I couldn't bear to share a demographic with him.

3073
03:10:03,300 --> 03:10:03,700
I know.

3074
03:10:04,820 --> 03:10:06,180
I'm glad he sort.

3075
03:10:06,180 --> 03:10:10,660
He got that sorted out at a young age before it could cause problems.

3076
03:10:10,660 --> 03:10:11,460
Now I can.

3077
03:10:11,460 --> 03:10:13,940
I don't have to feel bad about shitting all over him.

3078
03:10:14,980 --> 03:10:17,140
Absolutely.

3079
03:10:19,940 --> 03:10:21,220
What command is that?

3080
03:10:21,220 --> 03:10:23,780
Nothing really, nothing really happened in that voicemail.

3081
03:10:24,420 --> 03:10:25,300
What happens?

3082
03:10:26,180 --> 03:10:29,540
I, setting up the next scene.

3083
03:10:32,740 --> 03:10:34,660
It's a, it's a, it's a slow burn.

3084
03:10:35,620 --> 03:10:36,180
Next one.

3085
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:38,420
Wow.

3086
03:10:38,420 --> 03:10:38,820
Pardon.

3087
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:41,220
Next one is called Hades.

3088
03:10:42,500 --> 03:10:43,140
There it is.

3089
03:10:43,140 --> 03:10:44,100
Three, two, one.

3090
03:10:44,100 --> 03:10:45,780
There's only two left, by the way.

3091
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:47,060
Three, two, one, go.

3092
03:10:48,340 --> 03:10:55,620
I started playing Hades, again, during my COVID adventure, which was hard

3093
03:10:55,620 --> 03:10:59,300
because the game makes you push a lot of buttons to do a lot of things.

3094
03:11:00,260 --> 03:11:06,100
But you, you, you talk to me into trying the gun.

3095
03:11:06,100 --> 03:11:07,220
I like the gun.

3096
03:11:10,580 --> 03:11:13,060
I think I'm bad though, but how do you pitch?

3097
03:11:16,420 --> 03:11:21,220
The gun, I had my first win with the rail, and I think I have the most wins with the rail.

3098
03:11:21,220 --> 03:11:22,100
It's not my favorite.

3099
03:11:22,100 --> 03:11:26,100
I think my favorite is actually, I really like the bow.

3100
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:27,300
I really like the shields.

3101
03:11:28,260 --> 03:11:29,060
I don't know.

3102
03:11:30,740 --> 03:11:35,220
The, you fish by, when you see the little sparkling thing in the water,

3103
03:11:35,220 --> 03:11:40,900
you just go over to it and press the action button, and then you just pull out your little rod

3104
03:11:40,900 --> 03:11:41,620
and you'll fish.

3105
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:47,140
And then when it flashes and makes a big blue sound, that's when you've got to reel it in.

3106
03:11:47,140 --> 03:11:50,820
I've never, I've never been too late on a fishing.

3107
03:11:50,820 --> 03:11:55,060
I've only ever failed fishing by like getting psyched out and hitting the, the, like,

3108
03:11:55,700 --> 03:11:57,140
reel it in button too early.

3109
03:11:59,780 --> 03:12:00,180
Damn.

3110
03:12:00,180 --> 03:12:00,660
That's it.

3111
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:04,980
I gotta, I'm like so close to like 100%ing.

3112
03:12:04,980 --> 03:12:08,420
Hey, I only have like two achievements left, but they're like really tedious.

3113
03:12:08,420 --> 03:12:16,900
And I just, I don't know if I have, I freed, I finished the quest line to set Achilles free

3114
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:19,700
and let him go back to see Patroclus.

3115
03:12:19,700 --> 03:12:23,620
But I have not played since then, so I have not visited Patroclus so I can see like,

3116
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:26,660
what are they talking about now?

3117
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:30,740
So that's, that's interesting.

3118
03:12:31,940 --> 03:12:37,780
Next one, and this might be the last one, unless someone gave us a last minute voicemail.

3119
03:12:37,780 --> 03:12:41,220
This one is called, Ben, I will release my manifesto saint.

3120
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:42,180
Oh boy.

3121
03:12:42,180 --> 03:12:43,940
Three, two, one, go.

3122
03:12:44,740 --> 03:12:46,180
You've got some explaining to do.

3123
03:12:47,060 --> 03:12:52,820
Last week, you said you were going to deliver your manifesto last night or yesterday or

3124
03:12:52,820 --> 03:12:53,620
something, I don't know.

3125
03:12:55,700 --> 03:13:04,900
A young man in New York shot up a black supermarket and released a 100 page manifesto.

3126
03:13:05,700 --> 03:13:06,100
Memes?

3127
03:13:06,820 --> 03:13:08,100
Was this you, Ben?

3128
03:13:08,100 --> 03:13:10,100
Was he acting under your influence?

3129
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:13,380
Jake, I know you didn't do it, baby.

3130
03:13:13,380 --> 03:13:17,300
Right, right, right, snake.

3131
03:13:18,340 --> 03:13:19,220
Did I say that?

3132
03:13:19,220 --> 03:13:21,620
Did I say I was going to release a manifesto?

3133
03:13:21,620 --> 03:13:22,500
I don't remember about.

3134
03:13:23,620 --> 03:13:24,740
I also don't remember.

3135
03:13:25,940 --> 03:13:27,300
I hope I didn't say that.

3136
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:28,100
That's too bad.

3137
03:13:29,540 --> 03:13:31,060
No, I didn't know that guy.

3138
03:13:31,060 --> 03:13:34,340
No, he, obviously we, obviously we,

3139
03:13:36,260 --> 03:13:39,700
no, I don't even want to joke that like we agree on something that's terrible.

3140
03:13:39,700 --> 03:13:40,740
No, I don't know.

3141
03:13:40,740 --> 03:13:41,220
Fuck that.

3142
03:13:41,940 --> 03:13:43,380
Sad, I'm sad thinking about it.

3143
03:13:46,900 --> 03:13:51,940
Oh, the guy was, did I, do you remember me last week saying I was going to release my manifesto?

3144
03:13:52,900 --> 03:13:56,660
No, I also don't think this guy's making shit up.

3145
03:13:56,660 --> 03:13:57,540
I don't think that happened.

3146
03:13:58,100 --> 03:14:00,260
I think this guy might be making some shit up.

3147
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:01,140
He was pulling a leg.

3148
03:14:02,340 --> 03:14:04,660
He's pulling my leg and I don't appreciate it.

3149
03:14:04,660 --> 03:14:08,660
I'm going to, I'm so annoyed that I'm going to burn my bridge with this guy and just call

3150
03:14:08,660 --> 03:14:10,260
him out and just say, what a piece of shit.

3151
03:14:10,260 --> 03:14:10,900
I hate him.

3152
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,940
Not my friend anymore.

3153
03:14:12,500 --> 03:14:15,300
Just because this one time that I got mildly angry.

3154
03:14:16,580 --> 03:14:17,300
That's what I do.

3155
03:14:18,660 --> 03:14:19,060
Yeah.

3156
03:14:19,060 --> 03:14:19,380
Damn.

3157
03:14:19,620 --> 03:14:21,140
That's it.

3158
03:14:21,140 --> 03:14:22,180
That's the last voicemail.

3159
03:14:22,740 --> 03:14:26,340
Well, good timing because I think I have to head to the store pretty soon.

3160
03:14:26,340 --> 03:14:29,620
So I guess we can wrap up maybe.

3161
03:14:30,580 --> 03:14:30,740
Yeah.

3162
03:14:30,740 --> 03:14:32,340
Yeah, let's, let's wrap it up.

3163
03:14:32,340 --> 03:14:32,900
What are we at?

3164
03:14:32,900 --> 03:14:37,140
Like four hours, three, okay, three, three hours and 15.

3165
03:14:37,140 --> 03:14:37,460
Okay.

3166
03:14:38,100 --> 03:14:38,900
It's respectable.

3167
03:14:41,300 --> 03:14:41,540
Yes.

3168
03:14:42,580 --> 03:14:47,140
Anyone who didn't get a thing that they ordered from me, let me know it might have

3169
03:14:47,140 --> 03:14:49,700
been lost in my canceled PO box.

3170
03:14:49,700 --> 03:14:54,500
Please, please let me give you stuff.

3171
03:14:56,980 --> 03:14:57,380
That's it.

3172
03:14:58,740 --> 03:15:02,980
I guess next week we'll be, I'll be in America.

3173
03:15:02,980 --> 03:15:05,860
So I guess we'll record a live PCP.

3174
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:06,260
I don't know.

3175
03:15:06,260 --> 03:15:09,380
I don't know if we're going to like film it with like a camera.

3176
03:15:09,380 --> 03:15:10,820
We will be in the same room though.

3177
03:15:11,620 --> 03:15:15,620
We'll, we'll, we'll do a PCP in the same room or something.

3178
03:15:15,620 --> 03:15:16,740
Do you want to do that?

3179
03:15:16,740 --> 03:15:19,140
I kind of thought we just maybe wouldn't do one that week.

3180
03:15:19,140 --> 03:15:20,100
I mean, we can if you want.

3181
03:15:20,980 --> 03:15:22,900
Um, figure, figure something out.

3182
03:15:23,860 --> 03:15:28,340
I mean, would it be that hard to like organize just sitting in a room for a couple hours?

3183
03:15:29,780 --> 03:15:31,860
No, probably not.

3184
03:15:34,340 --> 03:15:36,180
Sounds, sounds doable.

3185
03:15:36,180 --> 03:15:36,500
Yeah.

3186
03:15:37,540 --> 03:15:40,020
Uh, okay.

3187
03:15:40,020 --> 03:15:40,580
Sure.

3188
03:15:40,580 --> 03:15:41,140
Why not?

3189
03:15:41,140 --> 03:15:41,380
Okay.

3190
03:15:42,020 --> 03:15:42,340
Okay.

3191
03:15:42,340 --> 03:15:42,580
Okay.

3192
03:15:43,300 --> 03:15:45,300
Um, anything else before we

3193
03:15:45,540 --> 03:15:46,900
wrap?

3194
03:15:48,900 --> 03:15:50,740
Gentlemen, ladies.

3195
03:15:50,740 --> 03:15:51,220
Not much.

3196
03:15:51,860 --> 03:15:53,460
I am animating pussy.

3197
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:56,100
You'll probably have a time this episode's out.

3198
03:15:56,100 --> 03:15:57,860
It'll be done at patreon.com.

3199
03:15:57,860 --> 03:15:58,660
Slash of William Fall.

3200
03:15:58,660 --> 03:15:59,060
Hooray.

3201
03:15:59,860 --> 03:16:00,660
That's it.

3202
03:16:00,660 --> 03:16:00,900
Cool.

3203
03:16:02,340 --> 03:16:04,580
Um, all right.

3204
03:16:05,540 --> 03:16:06,740
End of the episode.

3205
03:16:06,740 --> 03:16:08,980
See you next week, everyone.

3206
03:16:08,980 --> 03:16:10,820
And also give in real life.

3207
03:16:10,820 --> 03:16:11,140
Yeah.

3208
03:16:12,980 --> 03:16:13,620
In real life.

3209
03:16:14,500 --> 03:16:15,380
The real life.

3210
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:16,580
Woo.

3211
03:16:16,580 --> 03:16:16,900
Bye.

3212
03:16:18,020 --> 03:16:20,660
I'm having like a lot of like right at the end.

3213
03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:20,900
Bye.

3214
03:16:21,860 --> 03:16:22,260
Okay.
