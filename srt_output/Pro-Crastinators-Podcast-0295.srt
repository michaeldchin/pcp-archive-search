1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,160
This is for PCP. They say it's the worst podcast on the internet. F-f-correct.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,560
Okay, it's another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's started. We just started hitting

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,320
the start button. We're going. We're live. Hi, everybody. Oh, my fucking god. It's me, Ben Saint.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm here. We've got guests. We've got more guests than hosts. It's fucked up.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,400
It's real fucked. Okay, we got Oblivionfall is back, of course.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,760
Yes, I'm here, and I'm editing this episode probably.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,040
And we've also got a C-Toll and Four Eyes are here. Do you want to introduce yourselves?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
No. I mean, hello.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:11,120
It's me. Four Eyes, you know me. I'll introduce C-Toll. I'll mansplain. A C-Toll runs the drawcast

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,360
with me, and we've had cool guests on, like Ben Saint and Gibbontake and Teleperte,

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:26,080
and we'll get Tom one day, too. The drawcast. The drawcast, your own original creation. Do

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:34,800
not steal a YouTube show where you draw. It's a podcast where you draw. It's like a portmanteau.

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,920
Yeah. It's a good show with good people and Ben Saint. Good people and Ben Saint.

14
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:53,040
It's a good show. It's a good show. Yeah. C-Toll, you gave me a gift.

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,360
You gave me a priceless gift that could never be replaced. And you know what? Okay, I'm going to

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,320
say it. It could say if it was not functioning. Right. This week, it's time. It's been long enough.

17
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
By the end of this week, by the time this episode comes out, I'm going to have announced it. I'm

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,160
putting the time limit on myself. So I'm just going to say what it is. You gave me the funny

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,440
a DVD, a Blu-ray burner. You gave me the Blu-ray burner for me to create the plebe and the wee

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,480
Blu-rays, which I have made and which do exist and which you can buy from me now. Oh, shit.

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,760
After Trixie stole everyone's money and didn't deliver on them. And then you gave Trixie the

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,080
Blu-ray burner. Yeah. And then she just took it and was like, okay, and didn't make them and didn't

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
give it back when you asked for it back. Yeah. LaMalle. She was like, she was like, if someone

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,960
got me the Blu-ray burner, I would make them. I have the Blu-rays. I have the cases, but I don't

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,560
have the burner. It's not, it's even worse. It's even worse. It wasn't like if someone, it's not

26
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,800
like, oh, well, if someone gets it for me, then I'll make them. Which like, there was the bit where

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,880
she said, where she said, like, what am I supposed to do? Just pick myself up on my bootstraps and

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,960
buy a Blu-ray burner. Yes. As though that isn't a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Right.

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,120
You said you were going to make Blu-rays, ma'am. You were supposed to make Blu-rays.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes. And people paid me, what am I supposed, with what money? The money people gave me to do exactly

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,880
that? What are you, stupid? Yes. That was, that was tricksy. Then I'm like, oh man. Yes. So anyway,

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,160
anyway, okay, I'll show a picture on screen because I have gone above and beyond. I have,

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,240
they have Blu-ray cases. They have the boxes. They have a cover art. They have a cover sleeve.

34
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:52,320
They have a back of the box. They have reviews, rave reviews of the, of the product. They have,

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,200
they're, they're the printed on disc. They have a disc design on them. They have DVD menus and stuff.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,560
Navigate them with your remote control and your Blu-ray player. They are a professional product

37
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,840
that I have spent months making just out of spite. Anyway, anyway. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of

38
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,840
you, Ben. Thank you. Thank you. Buy one. Everyone, if you think that's funny, if you, listener,

39
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,240
if you think it's funny, go to my Twitter, go to my Twitter or go into the description

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,960
and follow the instructions listed there and buy a copy because I did have to buy all the

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,040
raw materials for it. So it didn't cost me a little bit. Please don't let me come out at a loss

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,120
for this funny project, my funny secret project. You had to buy literally everything

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,960
Trixie already had except the Blu-ray burner. Right. I did. I did. Only, only it's better

44
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,200
because she was not going to make a, put them in a real, but she was going to put them in a shitty

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,440
jewel case and they were just going to have like a generic like no label disc. They were going to

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080
look blank. She was just going to mail them in the mail. She was not going to make a professional

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,720
looking product. I have done, I have done that. My version is way better than hers would have been.

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
For the low, low price of $30, which is what was listed on the,

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,120
which is what was listed on the, on the, the Kickstarter page said they would be $30.

50
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,480
If you backed the, believe in the weed Kickstarter, I don't have, I'm, I obviously,

51
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,120
I didn't get any money. So like, I didn't get any of the Blu-ray money that would have paid,

52
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,240
that you would have paid for the product if you pledged to that. But because I'm a nice guy,

53
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,280
if you did pledge to the Pleeve and the Weeb Kickstarter, I will give, I can't give, I can't

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,240
give them for free because I had to buy all the materials, but I will give, I will steeply discount

55
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,400
the product. I'll give you like $20 off if you can show me proof that you are a, a $40 Kickstarter

56
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,640
backer, which was the reward which entitled you to the, to the Blu-ray if you pledged it. So I

57
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,440
don't know. Get, let me know about that. Yeah, we'll get to figure it out. Okay. Well, that's

58
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,480
my big announcement for this week. What do you guys got going on? Oh boy. The second episode with

59
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,240
Cheesy will have come out by now, I think, or will be coming out soon. You mean of the draw cast?

60
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
Yeah. Well, the second episode of the draw cast with Cheesy will come out, but it was actually

61
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:31,600
the one that was recorded first. Yeah. Because Cetol, the genius Cetol deleted their recording.

62
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,360
The genius smart man. What happened? The recording got deleted. Yeah. So was it destroyed? Was it,

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,160
was it ruined? Yeah, my laptop, I work on a laptop and it has fuck all memory. And it was

64
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,920
standard of the year. And I was, we'd done like three comics jams, like basically in a row. And

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,880
my recordings were getting corrupted because I didn't have enough space on the computer. I'm

66
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,600
like, oh, that's kind of shit. Yeah, that's kind of shit. I should start deleting some of these old

67
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,280
comics jams because they're kind of old. And I deleted the one Cheesy was on. I deleted the

68
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,880
one Cheesy was on accidentally. So, so you had to rerecord it? Oh, no, no, we did something else.

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,960
We did something ridiculous. The episode will be out probably the day after people see this,

70
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,320
so I don't mind spoiling it a bit. We kept the episode, at least the free other people's

71
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:36,800
audios, we kept me, Cheesy, and Gibb. Yeah, we give was on it too. Yeah. Yes. Gibb was on it.

72
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay. And C.T.A.L. recorded commentary over the parts that were quiet during all the parts

73
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:51,200
where C.T.A.L. was talking. And I created a little pony vector like pack of C.T.A.L.

74
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,240
to do a little, a little brony analysis style commentary, you know, all the different faces.

75
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,000
And that's your answer. That's your answer to everything, Oblivion. Just make it. Why don't

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,880
you just make a pony vector about it? When all you've got, when all you've got is a pony vector,

77
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,560
everything looks like an analysis video. That's funny. He didn't make the vector for the video.

78
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,800
I paid him to make the vector because he lost his job. And so I wanted to never money. Then I'm

79
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
like, I don't know what I'm going to use this vector for. And then this happened. I'm like,

80
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,760
well now I know what I'm going to use this vector for. It's very silly. It's very good.

81
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,720
It's absolutely at least the quality of her brony analysis video. Yes. At least.

82
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,880
That amazing. Yeah. Can we, can we, can we clear that far? We did.

83
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,440
My horse moves. I think it's a bit too low. I don't think you can go lower than that. I don't

84
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,520
think you can really limbo that. My horse moves. Therefore, it's at least as good if not better

85
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:06,400
than some brony analysis videos. Four eyes. Yes. Why don't you explain what your deal is?

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Oh yeah. I've just kind of been here. I'm an artist. I draw things. Oblivion.

87
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,160
That's me. I'm oblivion. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at explaining myself.

88
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,320
All right. Four eyes has relevance. I met oblivion a while ago and I do pictures for him.

89
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah. I have some, I have some relevance. Me and four eyes met on one fateful 9 11.

90
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,400
When he has paid money to join my Patreon server and we got talking. He was crazy. He was just

91
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,200
a fucking cool guy. And then he found out all this funny stuff about him that was good and funny.

92
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,320
Excuse me. I'm sick. Several years later. And I drew women with big tits for him.

93
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,400
Yes. Oh no. Didn't you say that four eyes was the voice of some iconic voicemail characters?

94
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I wonder if you can recognize me. Well, that's what, well, I didn't know that,

95
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,840
but oblivion told me so and I believe him. Well, I mean, we can have a whole discussion of

96
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,000
about that after we go to the voicemail segment and we play the first voicemail,

97
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,560
which is a very spicy one. Oh, okay. There's a reason I'm here. I see.

98
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,720
Yeah. But like four eyes to regular PCP viewers. I mean, aside from designing my character for

99
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,600
the ComeZone videos, which I've talked about a few times before. You mean, you mean what's her

100
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,360
name? Thalia. Thalia. Yeah. The big booby demon girl. Yeah. Four eyes designed her. Yeah. We both

101
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,160
like worked together on the design and he did the art that was used in that video.

102
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,320
He gave me pointers and I did the design. The actual art that you see in the

103
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,680
ComeZone video is my art with his direction. Yeah. It's really good. And any old school

104
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:04,880
PCP fans who remember Roddy Fuckers, cop killers, frog fractions, all the drama with the analysis

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,680
and the big arc with Ms. Anfropony. I believe that Ms. Anfropony's icon that they were using

106
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,960
during all those videos was one drawn by four eyes. Back when I used to watch

107
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,480
Brony analysis videos as a wee teen, I was very absorbed into a lot of the pity stories that

108
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,240
a lot of people were bringing about. And I was like, oh, I feel bad for this guy. He has such a

109
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,280
oh man. I'm going to draw a picture of his pony. I gave it to him. Don't feel bad for Ms.

110
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,480
Anfropony. He's thriving. He is thriving. And he's not using it anymore. I've looked.

111
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,920
This image, I think. Let's see. Yeah, that's really old. The era of the pony avatar has

112
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,080
it's rare to see a pony avatar in the wild anymore. Yeah, he no longer uses this,

113
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,720
but he did for a long time. I was very surprised.

114
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,600
I love Ms. Anfropony. See him in the comments once in a while, which is nice.

115
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,440
He's around. Yeah, I see him around. He's around. Shout outs to Ms. Anfropony.

116
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:29,840
Okay. Yeah, good. Well, understandable. What else? I didn't do anything this week,

117
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:39,120
because I had coronavirus. I had coronavirus just long enough to ruin my Christmas and my New

118
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:51,600
Years. Because I was still. Me too. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks. I was sick on Christmas. I felt

119
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,680
sick. I had a fever and I felt awful. Just terrible. And I thought I was over. I haven't

120
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,360
had any symptoms since basically since the last PCP, so basically a week now. I've had no symptoms,

121
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,960
but I tested myself yesterday, or no, day before yesterday, thinking I was over it for New Years.

122
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:23,520
And no, I was still positive. Sad times. So I'm just like, I got to get another test and I'm just

123
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,120
waiting until, well, when will I be? When will I be negative? When can I return to society?

124
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,520
Yeah, I got sick with. So I haven't just been at home. Just been working on the game. Just been

125
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,880
working really hard every day, all day, 24 hours a day, adding totally frivolous features to

126
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,280
slime and punishment, Phantom's Revenge. How dare you, Ben. Completely pointless, huge waste of

127
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,920
time. But I mean, aren't video games just a big waste of time anyway? So that's probably good,

128
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,280
actually. That's how I know I'm ready to do it. How dare Ben saying, make progress on his game,

129
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,720
thus driving up his Patreon dollars further away from me? I wouldn't call it progress,

130
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:18,400
exactly. I would call it wheel spinning. I would call it, I'm adding, basically what it is, is I'm

131
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,000
adding a bunch of frivolous features to the game that I didn't need, but that I keep thinking,

132
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,960
oh, this would be funny. Oh, that would, oh, that would be cute. And then I'll spend three days

133
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,000
doing it. And then that's three days that I don't have to spend doing the boring work of

134
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,880
making the itch page or figuring out how to upload on new grounds or et cetera, et cetera.

135
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,320
What else can you do? He already dabs. He already plays for it. He already dabs. I won't say,

136
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,560
I won't say exactly, but I will say that it, I feel exactly, I'm adding stuff that you can do in

137
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,480
Endless War. I'm adding stuff, that stuff as commands in a fandom's revenge. And it feels

138
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,000
just like it did when I was making Endless War in the first place, because I remember thinking,

139
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,920
like, the, what if you could do this stupid thing, lol, okay. And then I spent like two days just

140
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,400
being like, um, take a, take a, take a, take a, put that. Okay, now it works. Only this time,

141
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,600
I don't have to send it off to crack. So he can be like, this doesn't work at all. Here,

142
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,520
I redid it. And now it works. Now it just, now it just works because I'm doing it in Game Maker.

143
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,000
So nice. Phantom Horn can fish and dig through garbage and grow crops.

144
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm speakable. Listen, stop spoiling it. Stop spoiling it.

145
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,960
It sounds like, it sounds like you're just remaking Stardew Valley, but with Phantom

146
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,360
Horn. I'm all for it. I'm not, I'm not going to say anything else.

147
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh, that's great. For as you've been doing some game making.

148
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,320
Me? Yeah, you have some game. Oh yeah, I have. Wait, what? I mean, yes. I've, that was like,

149
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,720
that was like the beginning of the year though. It is the beginning of the year.

150
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,240
Oh, you're right. It was the beginning of last year. I did it a year ago. Yeah, no. Jesus.

151
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,880
A long time ago, I was doing game development. I was helping a friend with an RPG maker game.

152
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,320
And it, it's like a niche of a niche thing. So it's, I don't think it's worth plugging too much.

153
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,320
You know, if you know, like any RPG maker games that got popular back in the early

154
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,160
2010s, then, then you know what kind of game it's like. It's a fangame all for a game like that.

155
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,200
I have been helping somebody else recently, but I'm not directly helping. They just want

156
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:47,520
artwork and I'm good at providing artwork. I, I would hope I am at least. Yeah, so.

157
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,600
Before you said you were, you tell me you were like learning how to like make a game engine or

158
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,080
something. Oh, oh, that's a whole side thing. That's like, I'm learning to, I'm learning to

159
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,120
program and I want to build my own game engine because fuck learning how to use something like

160
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,320
Unity or RPG maker. There's so many limitations with those engines that make me go, why can't I just

161
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,080
do that? And that's a whole thing. I barely even started. I think I've got like some logic.

162
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:21,040
And why couldn't you? I mean, for RPG maker, especially there's a huge restriction with

163
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,160
what you can do there. But it's like, it's one of the easiest engines to learn because it,

164
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,800
it uses a, I think it's called low coding, where instead of actually typing out code,

165
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,200
you just put in commands and it just plays them in a sequence. It's, it's just a bunch of presets

166
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,240
that you play off. I know that a game maker has its own, like dedicated programming language,

167
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,880
right? Probably. It does. Yeah, GML. Yeah. I've been told that's pretty good, but it has its own

168
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
restrictions as well that make people go, why can't I just have an actual programming language?

169
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,640
GML Gay Mer Life. Oh, no. I, you know, I was, I was originally, my initial

170
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,560
thought was I was going to make Phantom's Revenge in RPG maker. But I found I,

171
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm sure there would have been ways to do it, but it was, I was, I found it like impossible to do

172
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,800
like really basic things that I, like all, like I just wanted to rename the fucking health bar.

173
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,640
And I, I don't know. I couldn't figure out how to do it. I believe there is a way to do that,

174
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,760
but I think it only does it for certain things. I know in 2003, there's like a thing in the database

175
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,480
that lets you change a whole bunch of terms that the game uses. You can change like HP to

176
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,680
Googity Boogity and a new game to this closes the game, but secretly actually makes a new game.

177
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,840
There's just, I mean, those are like very basic restrictions that's like, why can't I just rename

178
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,280
it? Right? Yeah, because like, I don't know. I guess maybe if I had learned, what is it,

179
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,360
it runs on like Ruby, right? Is the scripting? Oh yeah, the old ones do. Anything, anything

180
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,760
before RPG maker MV uses Ruby. Once it reaches MV though, it uses, I think, I forget it's a Java

181
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,960
or JavaScript, but it's one of those two. Yeah. Well, I knew, I didn't know any Ruby. I knew,

182
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,120
I knew some GML. So I don't know. I was just, I was just like, I was struggling with that.

183
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,960
And then I was like, well, shit, if I can't, if I can't, I'm having, if I'm having so much

184
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,600
trouble figuring out something as basic as just changing the name of like a function in the game,

185
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,040
it's like, well, I feel like I'm going to be like struggling against this system the whole time.

186
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,240
And I should probably just like, yeah, that's the problem with the, I'm just going to use GML.

187
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,280
That's the problem with RPG maker, like development in general, when a lot of people go

188
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,160
into it because it's an easy engine to learn. It seems like it really, really is set up with the

189
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,360
idea that it is, it is to make it as easy as possible to make a like the most generic RPG.

190
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,160
Yeah. You can imagine. And, and like, you can deviate from that, but like,

191
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,600
you have to do a lot of juggling around. You have to like, you have to work for it. Yeah.

192
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,800
I, I fucking had to do so much shit in RP, or like in 2003 alone, it's actually the most versatile

193
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,120
one as far as I'm concerned, but that might just be because I'm very knowledgeable in it.

194
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,360
But like, if you ever want to do anything in a, in that engine, you have, you can't really

195
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,960
rely on the engine itself. So you want like a character to be like half a half a tile across,

196
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
like if you really want to have this very specific thing happen, then you can't actually

197
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,760
use them to walk half a tile, you need to have like, you need to make the illusion of someone

198
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,480
walking, AKA like put a picture on screen and have it move. And in that case, you're basically

199
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,800
just building an engine on top of RPG maker as you start building more and more things that you

200
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,920
don't want from the game. And that's the limitation that RPG maker developers really have. They want

201
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,760
to do something more. But the problem is the engine is optimized in such a way to only do

202
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,760
you know, this one thing. Yeah, it's a, you gotta work within the restrictions. And if

203
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,320
you're knowledgeable, maybe you can make something impressive. RPG maker seems like it's set up so

204
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:20,000
that like basically a child can like turn it on and make something that is technically an RPG.

205
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,520
Yes, that's pretty much it. Yeah, it's yeah, you just see so many of these. Oh yeah, cool. My guy

206
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,560
has HP and he's got a little bar and he can do spells and it's technically it's a video game.

207
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah, that's why you see so much, you know, just free, very trashy RPG maker games. It's why,

208
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,240
in fact, the RPG aspect of RPG maker is often so confusing for people that they don't even make it

209
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,960
for RPGs. The most popular RPG maker games come to think of it are all like top down survival

210
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,000
horror type things where you don't fight things, you just walk around and try to run away from

211
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,160
other creatures because it's easier to just deal with the overworld than it is the combat balance

212
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,320
because I've tried messing with it is so confusing. They do things in like, I guess if you understand

213
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,600
it, it makes sense. But like, you just think, why can't I have like a character do this action on

214
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,440
this turn? You can't tell what you can't force like anything to happen cinematically in a battle.

215
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,880
And it's really, it's really annoying. Yeah. Yeah. I know that didn't didn't

216
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,920
undertale start development and RPG maker and then get ported to a game maker at some point.

217
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,680
I think I read that somewhere. I don't remember that. But I do know that Delta Rune was originally

218
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,800
going to be done on a different engine. But eventually, Toby Fox was just like, yeah, no,

219
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,360
learning this new engine isn't really going to help. I've got like years of experience in

220
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,880
game maker already. So I'll just stick with that. Yeah, I feel like I've reached I feel like I've

221
00:22:50,880 --> 00:23:00,960
reached a point where I am just like, I just kind of like know how to do a thing. And I just am not

222
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,560
I'm no longer like, how do I do this? How do you know, because when I started out, you have to like

223
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,800
look shit up. Oh, yeah, tell you learn to code. You just fucking open up the wiki or whatever,

224
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,560
and you just open up like a guy and you got to look shit up. And now I'm kind of just like,

225
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,800
I mostly know. I mostly know what I'm doing. Yeah, I mean, it's just a matter of cranking out the

226
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,680
functions that I know and need to be in there. Programming does become a little bit easier when

227
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,840
you finally just kind of accept it as a combination of problem solving and abstract thinking,

228
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,320
because you're not really dealing with a cup being filled with water. Make an object,

229
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,320
make an object, set up, set a flag, you know, have one object, you know, turn its flat set state

230
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,000
to weight, you know, change sprite, speak in timer, set timer flags, object instance destroy,

231
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,440
you know, create a different object, literally just got to take all the information of like an

232
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,360
object and just put it into a bunch of numbers and booleans and other buzzwords that I hate.

233
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,480
Boolean. Boolean. That's right. That's right. Booleans, more Booleans, please.

234
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,480
Yeah. Maybe a child Boolean. Yeah. Fucked up that RPG maker doesn't actually like make a

235
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,440
differentiation. It doesn't really make a difference. Oh my god, differentiate the

236
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,920
the difference between a variable and a switch because technically there is none.

237
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,680
Because a switch is just a Boolean and a Boolean is a variable. Whereas a variable in RPG maker

238
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,800
is an integer and that it makes it so confusing when translating it to actual programming.

239
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:46,160
Oh god. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh my god. What the fuck. All to make it hip and sick for the people who

240
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:56,160
don't understand. Like me. I can follow well enough. I know you sat excited to be talking about it,

241
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,680
so that's good enough for me. I love it. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so that's what I've been

242
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,160
that's what I've been doing. I've been making video games and waiting until COVID goes away

243
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:17,200
so I can go take promo pictures of the Blu-rays. Bleeming the wee Blu-rays. They're real. I actually

244
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,160
made them for years. For years. People be where's the Blu-rays? Trixie, where's the Blu-rays?

245
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:32,480
I paid you money for the Blu-rays. I gave $40 so I could buy the Blu-ray. I did it. I did it. I

246
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
made them. I made them. I made them real. I brought them out of the void into reality.

247
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,560
I have a big box of them. Wouldn't it be kind of funny if Trixie bought them all from you to give

248
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,960
to the people who paid her money? No. That's stupid. She would never do such a thing.

249
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,320
She would never do such a thing. That's what she ought to do. She ought to pay me. She ought to pay

250
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:10,640
me for satisfying her demand. If she gave me the plebe and the weeb money, then I would give the

251
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,680
copies for free to the people that already paid for the Kickstarter. But since I don't have that

252
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,760
money, I can't do that. I can't honor those people's purchases, even though I would like to,

253
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,880
because it would put me at a net loss. That's just not acceptable. You can't operate a business

254
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
in the negatives. That's true. Unless you have a name in some Jeffrey Bezos.

255
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,520
Sure. Or any number of tech startup geniuses.

256
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,520
Uber runs at a loss. YouTube is still running at a loss. That's pretty crazy.

257
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,840
Hasn't YouTube always run at a loss? It has. Not even all the YouTube red

258
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,960
subscriptions and stuff could salvage it. But it just keeps going.

259
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,840
And it needs storage. And it always will.

260
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,560
For all the weird stuff people put on YouTube.

261
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,720
It needs to exist, so it must. It simply has to exist, no matter of the cost.

262
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,760
I have a story. I have a funny story from the My Little Pony days. I'm a horror story, if you

263
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,280
will. So in 2014, I used to be a part of a bunch of... Back when everyone had their Skype groups

264
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,080
that everyone was adding each other to for projects, like, oh, we're going to read a fan

265
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,720
fiction and we need voice actors. We're going to make a little My Little Pony fan animation,

266
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,040
whatever. And they just get your friends to make you join or whatever the fuck.

267
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,880
Like you do. Like you do.

268
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah. There was one project called Journey of the Spark that had a bit of traction.

269
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,440
These guys were like, hey, let's make an entire movie. An entire movie made by the fans.

270
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,600
And they had this trailer. And the animation was sort of half okay.

271
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,400
Have I heard about this?

272
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
Possibly. Journey of the Spark, maybe.

273
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200
Sounds familiar.

274
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,000
Journey of the Spark. It sort of rings a bell.

275
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,640
They got panels at conventions several times. I can post some of the posters and promo images.

276
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
Maybe you'll recognize one. Let's see. There's that one.

277
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,080
Oh, I do remember this. Let me see here. Oh, wow. Look at that background.

278
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,360
So this was a project I'd heard of for a while. I got invited onto it when

279
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,480
the director of the project auditioned for one of my projects I was running with my partner.

280
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,240
And them, sorry, they've transitioned since. So like all my memories are with male pronouns.

281
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,640
So I'm going to try my best to use female pronouns. I apologize in advance if I mess up.

282
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,280
She was talking to my partner. I guess my partner's also transitioned since then.

283
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,760
And like opposite directions. Whoa. Anyways.

284
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,400
Wait, somebody else did too?

285
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,560
All right. My partner was identified as female back then and is now male.

286
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,320
And for this person, it's the other way around. And I just find that funny.

287
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,760
It's the nature of my little party.

288
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,160
Wait, one of the producers?

289
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,080
Yeah. The person whose last name was right now or something.

290
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,800
So anyway, they were like the person.

291
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,080
What's their name now?

292
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,760
The name now is a spoiler. It's funny and you'll find out why later.

293
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,800
ContraPoints.

294
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,760
Natalie Win, producer of Journey of the Spark.

295
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,920
That would be fucking funny as fuck dude.

296
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,440
No.

297
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,560
So Journey of the Spark had, like I'd heard of it. I'd seen the trailers.

298
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,720
They got a lot of views. I knew they had panels at conventions.

299
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,720
And the director, the person in charge of the whole project,

300
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,680
auditioned for our projects. We spoke to them and they invited us on.

301
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,160
And when we joined the Skype group, immediately there's a red flag.

302
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,240
Because as we're joining, we're seeing like 20 people leave

303
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,040
and a couple of them are being like, hey, just warning you,

304
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,440
you're going to have a bad time. Get out where you can.

305
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,640
And then like dropping out of the chat.

306
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,960
Wow. So this is you like basically like asking, like,

307
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,800
can I be involved in this project? And a bunch of people involved in the project

308
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,760
are like, don't make the same mistake I did.

309
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,680
You're walking into a burning building.

310
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,160
Yeah. Like, and the second we got in the server,

311
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,200
like half the people were like in the process of leaving,

312
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,360
like within like that hour, pretty much.

313
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,920
And we didn't really find out what happened.

314
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,600
The old head of animation was a guy called Jan.

315
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,280
I don't know if it was Jan animations.

316
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,280
I was going to say as in Jan animations.

317
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
I mean, possibly I never got it confirmed.

318
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,800
Someone said that it was, but I don't know if they were correct.

319
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
Reena Chan, also Kara Buckland, was also involved in the project at a time.

320
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,880
Who's Reena Chan?

321
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,480
She was fat.

322
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,200
The voice actor, right?

323
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
She was a voice actor.

324
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,400
She voiced in a lot of old Newgrounds animations.

325
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,280
Did you say she was fat?

326
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,120
Is that the first thing that comes to mind?

327
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,960
She's not fat. I don't think I said that.

328
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,760
Sorry, my voice.

329
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,880
I am having a...

330
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
He said that I said PHH as in sick.

331
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,800
We swear.

332
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,160
I thought that was what you said, but I may have misheard.

333
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,680
I don't even know what I said.

334
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,160
I can't raise my voice because my voice like literally goes on mute like in a real life.

335
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
If I shout, my voice just goes...

336
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,320
But that's a voice actress, right?

337
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,680
Yeah, Reena Chan.

338
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,400
Oh, oh, oh, Reena Chan is Kara Buckland.

339
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,600
Is Kara Buckland, yeah.

340
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,280
She's popular now because she voiced to be in the English dub of Nier,

341
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,200
which is trash, play the game in Japanese.

342
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,360
But yeah, what was I saying?

343
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,600
So, you know, the project had some notable names in it.

344
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,160
Some of these people, like bigger names, hadn't left.

345
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,080
So we had some faith in the project.

346
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,760
And the director was very friendly with my partner.

347
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,800
And they had a lot of calls together.

348
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,360
And we quickly found out that the lead voice actress for Twilight Sparkle,

349
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,000
I believe her name was Meredith Sims.

350
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,040
I think she voiced some characters for Silly Philly Studios.

351
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,480
I think she was the voice of Snowdrop maybe in the Snowdrop animation.

352
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,920
I don't remember too clearly.

353
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,880
Who could forget Snowdrop?

354
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
Legendary, legendary short.

355
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,520
Snow Blind.

356
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,200
Snow, Snow Blind, yeah.

357
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,560
Oh, shit, what was I saying?

358
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,760
So apparently the director had been having some issues with Meredith's, I guess, acting ability.

359
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Because they were recording some lines for a trailer.

360
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,600
They wanted to debut at a convention.

361
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,760
And there were some scenes where Twilight had to be crying.

362
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,880
And just didn't feel the emotion was coming across.

363
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,600
She couldn't do it.

364
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,120
Like, obviously she could do it.

365
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
But just didn't think the emotions felt genuine enough, you know?

366
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,480
Which is always like the biggest thing the voice acting is.

367
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,640
Everyone thinks they can do a good impression.

368
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,680
I guess that's the director's job is to get the right performance out of their actors.

369
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,360
They brought my partner on to be the voice director specifically.

370
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,800
So they're like the head of project.

371
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,200
And my partner was going to be working with them as the voice director,

372
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,000
giving direction to the voice actors and working with them.

373
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,240
Oh.

374
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
So that was what my partner's job was going to be.

375
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
Was this a paid gig, by the way?

376
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,720
No.

377
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,840
Or was it just a fan?

378
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,880
Nothing, nothing.

379
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,560
It's cost, cost, okay, okay.

380
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,000
This was a pony community.

381
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
No one got paid for anything back then.

382
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,040
Okay, okay, I understand.

383
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,640
Which every time people make fun of KP for not paying people,

384
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,320
I'm like, dude, it's a fucking pony community.

385
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,440
No one gets paid ever.

386
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody got paid.

387
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,320
Yeah.

388
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,480
But anyway, so that's fair.

389
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,800
So yeah, the director was to my partner.

390
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,960
Oh, hey, why don't you record some sample lines for them to reference?

391
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
So my partner did.

392
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
And my partner also had a pretty decent Twilight Sparkle impression.

393
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
My partner was pretty decent at acting.

394
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
So they did that.

395
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:02,000
And the director was like, oh, oh my God, your Twilight voice is actually really good.

396
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,080
It's actually really good.

397
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,200
Like, ah.

398
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,600
Oh no.

399
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,680
You know, originally when we started the project, I got Meredith on board,

400
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,360
you know, back before I really had, before I really had a team.

401
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
She was just a friend I had.

402
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,280
And, you know, I brought her on board because, you know.

403
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,680
And now she's just, now she's just a dead weight anchor around my ankle,

404
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,440
weighing us down, dragging us down.

405
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,720
This project is done.

406
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,520
But now, now this project has scope and we're gonna make this.

407
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,320
And now that this project has scope and potential and, you know,

408
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,840
we can make this first fan animated movie, something that's never been achieved before.

409
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,960
You know, it was two hour feature length like Disney quality film that us unpaid

410
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,040
Bronies are totally going to be able to make.

411
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Totally.

412
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,880
It'll definitely happen.

413
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,440
That's right.

414
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,720
All it takes is grit and gumption and elbow grease and a lot of, and love of the, of the

415
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,920
source material.

416
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,200
You know, maybe exactly.

417
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,080
All it takes is passion.

418
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,280
Yeah.

419
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,480
Maybe it'll be worth like having you takeovers when you twilight,

420
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,120
you know, sparkle voice actor for this project.

421
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
And my partner's like, oh, me?

422
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,040
This is a, this is a, this is a what's not, not a, not a my fair lady moment.

423
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,400
It's like a, like a, like a, I don't know.

424
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
What's a movie where it's like a Cinderella moment.

425
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,200
Like, oh, the shoe fits, the shoe fits better.

426
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,720
Right.

427
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,720
So the, the funny undertone of this is like the surface reading is, oh,

428
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,000
they just thought the voice was better.

429
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,680
And they had also hinted a lot that they had a crush on the old Twilight voice actor at the time.

430
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,560
And they at some point confessed that they were crushing on my partner as well.

431
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,720
And like, they just have a thing for any, anyone who happens to be voicing Twilight.

432
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,360
That's the impression I get.

433
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,120
So like, it's, it's funny.

434
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,720
All right. So this is a very, I'm glad, I'm glad everyone's a professional in this.

435
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,920
I'm glad everyone's a professional.

436
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,720
Stupid scenario.

437
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,240
So it's like, they, they, they, they like confess a lot of things.

438
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
They, they told my partner about the inflation porn.

439
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
They're like, they really liked a blueberry inflation porn.

440
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,120
Um, that was like a big thing for them.

441
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,000
What is it?

442
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,600
What is it with these people and inflation?

443
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,920
You know, they just watched Willy Wonka and it just had an effect on them.

444
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,440
You know, they got, they got to have that blueberry inflation.

445
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
It's, it's, it's part of the balanced breakfast.

446
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,080
Everyone has a moment in their childhood where they see some weird shit that they really like.

447
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,520
And that was theirs, you know.

448
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,880
Wait, what the fuck?

449
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,920
There's a fucking blueberry inflation Funko Pop.

450
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,400
Hold on.

451
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,120
What?

452
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,680
Hold on.

453
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
What the fuck?

454
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,440
Oh no.

455
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,240
What the fuck?

456
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,560
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds about right.

457
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
That's fucking stupid.

458
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,040
That's hilarious.

459
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,520
Why is that?

460
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,720
What was that shit?

461
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,240
I, I, I am, hold on.

462
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,960
Hostessly.

463
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,160
It's slight distraction.

464
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
We got to see it.

465
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,760
There you go.

466
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,840
Oh my God.

467
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,680
Violet Beauregard.

468
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,560
Violet Beauregard.

469
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,360
Amazing.

470
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,240
Violet Beauregard.

471
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,200
It's how tragic that this is the Violet Beauregard Funko Pop.

472
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
Like this isn't what she normally looks like.

473
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
This is her with like a medical condition.

474
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
And it's, we caught a shiny, we caught a shiny variant.

475
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,440
Yeah.

476
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,760
Yeah.

477
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,080
Well.

478
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,320
Yeah.

479
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,720
Anyways, so this was going on.

480
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,320
And eventually the director went to Meredith and,

481
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,200
and told them that they wanted to replace her.

482
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,640
And when they did, they suddenly were like,

483
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,840
yeah, this new voice directors, they're really pushy

484
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,000
and they're manipulating me and they said they don't like you

485
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
and they want you off the project.

486
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
And I just have no choice.

487
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
Like they just made up all this bullshit

488
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,640
because they didn't want to hurt their friends feelings.

489
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,920
They wanted to shift blame.

490
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,880
And I know this is a case because they immediately messaged my partner and said,

491
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

492
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
I said all these things that weren't true.

493
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,000
If you're going to lie, if you're going to lie,

494
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,760
why not just stick to your fucking story?

495
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,400
Why not just lie then?

496
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
Just, I don't know.

497
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,920
And then Meredith, who had a lot of connections, told everyone,

498
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,240
oh, yeah, watch out for oblivion's partner,

499
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,600
very manipulator and all this shit.

500
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,440
And I had a bunch of like big people.

501
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,080
That's true.

502
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Including Rob Bob, who.

503
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,440
I heard, I heard from a guy that that's true.

504
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,240
Yeah, I had.

505
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I heard from the director.

506
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,280
The director of Journey of the Spark, the famous director.

507
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,560
My friend, my friend, E ride an hour.

508
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,680
Careful.

509
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,880
A.K.A. Natalie Wynn.

510
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,360
I was going to say, don't be dead naming now.

511
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,680
So anyway, I don't close enough, a dead initialing, maybe.

512
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,880
Their new name is not E.

513
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Actually, no, it was for a while.

514
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,400
They were Erica and then they changed to something else

515
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,040
that I'll get to.

516
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,720
So they said that and we were really upset.

517
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,680
Like, why are you doing this?

518
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,160
Like, now my partner's reputation is in trouble

519
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
and I had to try and do damage control.

520
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,560
The guy Rob Bob I mentioned was like,

521
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
he had huge industry connections.

522
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
He got Gray Delisle to voice in an animation project

523
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
that we were working on once.

524
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,400
Gray Delisle?

525
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,760
Gray Delisle.

526
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,040
She's voiced about as many or more characters

527
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,880
than Tara Strong, including like Frankie Foster

528
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,160
from Foster's Imaginary, whatever the fuck.

529
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
Azula from Avatar.

530
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,680
She's the voice of Azula.

531
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,360
Oh, wait.

532
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,680
Okay.

533
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,640
What's what's your name?

534
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:22,880
Okay.

535
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,520
Gray Delisle.

536
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,720
The Azula Jeth.

537
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:24,880
Yeah.

538
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,120
Great.

539
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,280
Yeah.

540
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,120
Gray Delisle is like super legit.

541
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,120
I'll just link her wiki page.

542
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh, sure.

543
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,640
Okay.

544
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,360
Okay.

545
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,480
But yeah, so the guy who had connections to like her

546
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,680
was even like caring about it.

547
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,400
And so that was like, that really bothered me.

548
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,600
I was really like, okay.

549
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,720
So I was having to do damage control on that level.

550
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,520
And so I was really pissed at the director at this point.

551
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,480
And then we realized that like we found out

552
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,320
from other people who left the project

553
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,240
that this is like a repeating cycle

554
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,960
and that that was actually the second way if you left.

555
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
There was one even before that.

556
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,960
And so we were like, oh, and then things were

557
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,280
really sour with the director from then on.

558
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,680
And after like a few weeks, I was supposed to help

559
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
with the trailer, but I was just like,

560
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I don't want to work for this person anymore.

561
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,400
I mean, my partner at a certain point

562
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,240
was just like, yeah, now we're leaving and we dropped out.

563
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,040
And then the project kept going.

564
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,800
Half the team dropped out with us.

565
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
And then a new team was brought on,

566
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,880
including a friend of mine, my friend Phoenix.

567
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
And then they kept going around to conventions

568
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,200
for about a year afterwards.

569
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
And at a certain point I was realizing like,

570
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,160
Hasbro's got to send them a cease and desist at some point.

571
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,520
For one, like after a year,

572
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,960
if I couldn't even get a trailer done,

573
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,680
they think they can get like an over two hour long like a movie.

574
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,920
Oh, that's bad.

575
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,800
That's bad.

576
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,520
Yeah.

577
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,680
And they think animators,

578
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
including people who I'm friends with,

579
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,920
I believe in this project and are throwing away their like labor

580
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,760
for someone who isn't paying them

581
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,440
for a project that'll never even come out.

582
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,000
Because it's guaranteed to never be finished.

583
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,320
Or I mean, if it gets close enough to being finished,

584
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,520
Hasbro's not going to let you make a fucking movie.

585
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,440
Jesus Christ.

586
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,920
Yeah.

587
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:13,520
So I was like, I am going to message Hasbro.

588
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,920
I still had access to all the drop boxes.

589
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,080
I still had access to all the information.

590
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,720
I downloaded a lot of it, checked over the script,

591
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,400
checked over some of the details.

592
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,440
And I sent Hasbro, I found their contact,

593
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
their legal contact.

594
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,320
And I sent them a message because in my mind,

595
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm like, this project is doomed anyway.

596
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,840
I am just freeing these animators early

597
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,520
so that they can actually focus on things

598
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
that'll actually come to fruition.

599
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm doing the right thing.

600
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,080
Yeah.

601
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,480
I'm the good guy.

602
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
I'm the oblivion full breaker of chains.

603
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,920
Breaker of chains.

604
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,680
Wait, what so what information?

605
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,480
What information did you have access to in the drop boxes?

606
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,040
Basically just like the script and storyboard,

607
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,440
basically certain plot details,

608
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,240
including like Celestia dying and stuff,

609
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,000
which I messaged Hasbro.

610
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,360
I said, hey, just letting you know

611
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,800
there's this project being worked on.

612
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,600
Here's like some conventions where they showed it off.

613
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,120
You're a whistleblower.

614
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,000
I was a whistleblower.

615
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,960
And I explained some of its plot details

616
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,560
and in the story like Celestia dies

617
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,600
and there's all this dark stuff.

618
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,440
And I don't think that'll fit with your brand image

619
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,000
and all this, this and that.

620
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,680
And I left like a few paragraphs

621
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,680
and I linked to some videos and some things

622
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,880
so that they could have evidence

623
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,120
that this project was legit

624
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,880
or at least it was taking itself pretty legit.

625
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,760
Who did you contact at Hasbro?

626
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,960
I just contacted, I just Googled Hasbro legal or something.

627
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
Like customer service?

628
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,520
Or customer service or something.

629
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,880
I don't remember what, this was like mid 2014 at this point.

630
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
So this was like seven years ago.

631
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,320
And I got an email back like that day

632
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,640
and I wish I still had it.

633
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,920
Oh my God, I wish I fucking had this email.

634
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,800
It was amazing.

635
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
If I can paraphrase, it was something to be effect of,

636
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,280
hi, thank you for giving us this information.

637
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,200
We take this very seriously.

638
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Intellectual property theft is no joke.

639
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,120
And we will take swift legal action at the appropriate time.

640
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,520
Have a smiley day.

641
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,680
So what you're saying is that the director

642
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,040
was absolutely correct.

643
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,240
You are a backstabber.

644
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,320
Yes, well, at this point, I mean they said I was in the back.

645
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,160
We're a back re-stabber.

646
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,120
We're just putting, we're just giving the knife actor

647
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,560
it's rightful owner.

648
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,360
Hey, it's like you stab my back.

649
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,800
I stab yours, buddy.

650
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,400
You know, we can help each other out.

651
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,600
We help each other to die.

652
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,400
Yes.

653
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Two weeks later on their Tumblr.

654
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,600
Hey guys, we got a cease and desist,

655
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,440
but we're not giving up hope.

656
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,800
And I'm like, okay, okay.

657
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,360
Oh boy.

658
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,160
But the project basically never had legs after that ever again.

659
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,800
And the animator friends I had on there did leave

660
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,920
and did go on to better things and good for them.

661
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,840
How much, so how much was, okay, how long had it been going on

662
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,000
and how much was done by that point?

663
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,720
I think like, from what they told us,

664
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,240
they had started working on it like early 2012,

665
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,600
like maybe like in the scripting stage,

666
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,760
like very beginning of 2012, they had the idea.

667
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,880
So it had been going for a year plus, maybe almost two years.

668
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,480
Well, this is like mid 2014.

669
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,800
So it was a bit over two years at this point,

670
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,160
maybe two and a half years of production and like going for

671
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,560
like three or four different teams worth of people.

672
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,920
But so the project never really had legs again,

673
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,560
but the director sort of stuck around and sort of like,

674
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,960
I posted about it for a while and that's,

675
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,680
and like checking up on their Tumblr to see like how it was going.

676
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,120
That's when we learned about the transition.

677
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,040
They changed her name to Erica at first.

678
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,160
And then a little while later, if you change her name to something else,

679
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,400
your name now is Violet.

680
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,440
I'm just looking at that Funko Pop.

681
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,200
That explains a lot.

682
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,920
That's funny.

683
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,080
She's just really exiting guys, I swear.

684
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,000
She just really likes your name.

685
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,600
That's pretty humorous.

686
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,120
The name just speaks to me, you know?

687
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,400
Like it's a chuckle out of me.

688
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,280
Yeah.

689
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, fascinating.

690
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,160
Well, that was a journey of the spark.

691
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,840
You were taking me on that journey with you.

692
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,040
That journey of the spark, yeah.

693
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,760
Of the spark, all right, all right, yeah, of course.

694
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,560
That fan of had a lot of shit going about it.

695
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,480
Oh yeah, there's a number one that's pretty good actually,

696
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,160
that Faye can comment on.

697
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,280
So I don't know, actually, no, of course you remember,

698
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,760
you were a fucking My Little Pony analyst.

699
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,000
You probably talked about this character on T-Bap.

700
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,760
Do you remember this wheelchair pony from Tradia?

701
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,760
Yes, the purple and brown guy, yeah.

702
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,360
The Make-A-Wish guy.

703
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,040
Yeah, with the steampunk wheels.

704
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,720
Yeah, I remember this guy standing out to me

705
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,760
when I first saw the episode.

706
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I'm like, this guy's weird and some YouTube comments were like,

707
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,040
oh, it's a Make-A-Wish kid.

708
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,960
He got a Make-A-Wish to be in the show.

709
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,240
And I'm like, oh, that's cool or whatever.

710
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,680
A few months afterwards, I got messaged by a friend on Facebook,

711
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
someone who is not a brony.

712
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,240
So in no relation to it, he'd sent me a Tumblr post saying,

713
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,000
oh my God, these bronies are sick.

714
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,760
Did you know that there was a Make-A-Wish kid in My Little Pony?

715
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,680
And they drew porn.

716
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,880
They drew hundreds of porn images of this child in My Little Pony.

717
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,480
Bronies, oh, they're so sick and twisted.

718
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,840
How dare they do this?

719
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,280
They're all fucked up.

720
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,600
And I was like, oh, let me check Derpy Breeru,

721
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,440
see how many images there actually are.

722
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,960
And there was less than 20 after many months.

723
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,400
And I'm like, that's nothing.

724
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,680
I told my friend, there's not really that many images.

725
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,200
And it looks like it's just two artists.

726
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,800
So I don't think it's that widespread of a problem.

727
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,920
So it seems like a valid reason to be concerned.

728
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,320
What I didn't know at the time, because I didn't know him yet,

729
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,080
the artist responsible was Four Eyes.

730
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,920
Well, Four Eyes, what do you have to say for yourself?

731
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,920
I'd do it again.

732
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,400
And I did.

733
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,840
What's your, well, officer, he says he'd do it again.

734
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,760
And we can't arrest him if he's not sorry.

735
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,680
I'm guilty, but it's fine.

736
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,560
It's fine, he wasn't actually a minor.

737
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,000
The kid wasn't actually a minor.

738
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,480
It's fine.

739
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,840
Yeah, yeah.

740
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,480
Oh, is that true?

741
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,600
Yeah, this Make-A-Wish kid was 18, first of all.

742
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,080
Faye, you tell the story to me or you actually talk to him.

743
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,280
Yeah, the whole scandal happened.

744
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,240
And as far as I know, nobody even knew that it was me that did it.

745
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,680
People just kind of saw that like me and like one other person

746
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:00,960
like did some vaguely not-safe work images and just labeled it all as bronies.

747
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,600
And I think during the whole scandal, the person was not present.

748
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,840
The guy behind the OC was not present at all.

749
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,160
But his mother was commenting on Derpy Boo, sending

750
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,920
asks to people on Tumblr saying, this is destroying my son's life.

751
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,920
He's ruining his reputation.

752
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,800
He's crying.

753
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,520
He's dying.

754
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,920
He's from Make-A-Wish, he's dying.

755
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
He literally was dying, right?

756
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,080
Sort of.

757
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,680
Is he alive?

758
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,480
He's still alive.

759
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,240
Yes, because about a few months after the whole thing settled down,

760
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,240
the guy specifically came to me on DeviantArt.

761
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,520
He gave me a private message on DeviantArt saying,

762
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,320
hey, I'm sorry for the way my mother was acting.

763
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,880
I'm actually over 18.

764
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,080
I really actually enjoy all the fan art that I've been getting of my character.

765
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,080
And I'm horny as fuck.

766
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,000
They apparently are completely fine with it

767
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,360
and have commissioned plenty of artworks off their character in NSFW situations.

768
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,440
Getting fucked in the ass by Discord.

769
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,200
No, that was just me.

770
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,280
They paid people to draw him fucking fore-eyes.

771
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,760
Yeah, that was what he paid one artist to draw as a gift back like,

772
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,960
hey, here's my character having sex with your character.

773
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,920
It's like, oh, thanks.

774
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,120
I'm glad there was a happy ending forever.

775
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,880
Happy ending.

776
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,360
He was okay with it and he didn't even die.

777
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,880
He didn't even die.

778
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,800
I don't know how much I can share.

779
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,600
I don't know how much I can share his illness.

780
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,560
I hope he's not listening.

781
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,680
This is going to sound...

782
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,480
I mean, it's fine.

783
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:40,880
Wait, what?

784
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,400
I think he's fine with it.

785
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,920
You don't know if he can share his illness?

786
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
I can't really share the details of it,

787
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,600
because one, I haven't really asked him much about it,

788
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,960
but he's talked about it sometimes.

789
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:51,920
I don't know.

790
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,280
I just thought that if you're a make-a-wish kid, it means you're going to die soon.

791
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,560
It's a...

792
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,640
So, you know, I was expecting...

793
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,960
I was, you know, I was hoping for a death.

794
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,200
They ripped me off.

795
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
My little pony told me that kid was going to die, damn it.

796
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,840
Well, I mean, he still has something.

797
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
I mean, it's been like years.

798
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,360
It's been years since that episode.

799
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,520
Like, guy, come on, like, clock's ticking.

800
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,240
Like, how many...

801
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,120
Like, are you going to keep us waiting for, like, how much longer here?

802
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,400
I can at least say it's not...

803
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
It is life-threatening, just not immediately.

804
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,440
It's something about how he'll only get worse and worse with age,

805
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,000
until he's basically incapable of handling himself.

806
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,360
So, while he is still capable of handling himself, he got a make-a-wish.

807
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,800
I'm...

808
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,160
I'm sorry to be so grim about it.

809
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,160
It's absolutely fine.

810
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,440
I'm pretty sure he's fine with it.

811
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,400
I don't actually want...

812
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
I don't actually want this kid to die.

813
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,400
I mean, he's happy.

814
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:50,880
He's like...

815
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,760
He's still making art.

816
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,960
He actually makes his own art.

817
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,520
Well, good.

818
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,640
Oh, good for him.

819
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,040
Very funny.

820
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,080
Yeah, I remember people commenting on the...

821
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,480
You know, the character is just...

822
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:07,760
It's just a little bit OC-looking, even before the kind of notable steampunk wheelchair,

823
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,840
which is a bit funny.

824
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,200
The colors are just a bit too dark, you know?

825
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,160
People make fun of...

826
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,800
The what?

827
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,840
The colors of his...

828
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,920
The color palette of his OC is just a little bit too not pastel, basically.

829
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,760
Yeah, yeah, a little bit too...

830
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,320
It looks like a fan character.

831
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,560
Yeah.

832
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,360
You know, I guess the steampunk wheelchair, you know, maybe that's like...

833
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,320
Maybe that's not fair.

834
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,760
Like, I mean, I guess it does kind of look like...

835
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,720
What do you call it?

836
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,400
I mean, they're more like training wheels.

837
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:38,960
A little bit, yeah.

838
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,240
Right, it's like the thing that you give like a dog that legs don't work, right?

839
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,840
Well, he is a horse.

840
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,440
Maybe it's supposed to resemble like a cantorlot, you know,

841
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,520
cantorlot architecture, which it kind of does.

842
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,960
I mean, in plenty of the images I've seen of his character that he's commissioned,

843
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,000
he's always in pretty fancy bedrooms, so maybe.

844
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,760
Well...

845
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,960
This is my game theory.

846
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,600
Thanks, Matt Pat.

847
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,160
Where would we be without you and your porn theories?

848
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,720
My knowledge of the dark side.

849
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,720
I'm barely even there anymore.

850
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,840
I'm a pretty shallow consumer of this stuff nowadays.

851
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,040
All right, all right.

852
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,800
That's fine, you know, whatever.

853
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,960
Very wax, very weird.

854
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,560
I'm actually kind of glad to know that the kid didn't die.

855
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,360
Yeah.

856
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,160
Yet.

857
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,760
That's kind of nice.

858
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
That's a bit heartwarming.

859
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,960
He's still doing good.

860
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,560
We'll all die eventually, Ben.

861
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,360
It's okay.

862
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,320
Yeah, we'll get him.

863
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,960
We all say to get your blood less yet.

864
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,800
So...

865
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,240
So...

866
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,480
Yeah, I don't know.

867
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,440
Tell me more.

868
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,040
Tell me more stories.

869
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,400
I got nothing else to talk about.

870
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,120
Uneventful week.

871
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,520
Uneventful week for me.

872
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,680
I mean, I've just been fucking sick too.

873
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,680
I would have had my animation that I've been working on for months out by the end of the year,

874
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,800
except that I got sick.

875
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,760
Don't know if it's COVID.

876
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,240
We can't seem to find a test where we're at.

877
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,480
Yeah.

878
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,000
I mean, even before that work was...

879
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,280
I was amazed that I could find some in CVS.

880
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,200
I was shocked that they had some available.

881
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,640
But they're out now.

882
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,960
I went the other day and I asked again and they're like,

883
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,680
nope, we're out.

884
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,560
And so I'm...

885
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,640
Yeah, all the places around here seem to be out.

886
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,600
But it kind of ruined all my plans.

887
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,640
Like, I was fine on Christmas, but like by...

888
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,280
No kidding.

889
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,600
That night, like when I woke up the day after Christmas,

890
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,840
I was just, there was a boulder in my throat.

891
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,960
I felt like it was...

892
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,760
Oh, so you definitely, so you definitely spread it.

893
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,920
You definitely were being a super spreader.

894
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,760
No, I wasn't leaving the house.

895
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,120
Our roommate who works at a movie theater brought it home

896
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,360
and gave it to all of us who sit indoors all day.

897
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,280
Oh, okay.

898
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,120
It was his Christmas present to you.

899
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,360
Yeah, I didn't go out for Christmas.

900
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,680
Okay.

901
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,080
But yeah, and that kind of...

902
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,960
I was bedridden for a while and my voice is all fucked up.

903
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,200
If I try to raise my voice, it just cuts out.

904
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,040
And I'm really worried that people aren't going to understand

905
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,200
what I'm saying sometimes because my voice just keeps going.

906
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,640
When I speak.

907
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,960
But um, oh God.

908
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,480
That was a hard cut off.

909
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,680
Yeah, I...

910
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,040
When I was able to at least not be in absolute pain and agony,

911
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,920
I've been drawing a bit, I've been working on music,

912
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,160
but not my main project because I already realized

913
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,280
I'm not a misfit deadline.

914
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,480
Did you have a fever?

915
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,560
I had a fucking bad fever.

916
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,600
I couldn't even sleep.

917
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
I was so, it was so hot.

918
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,240
I was all around six hours one night.

919
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,680
That was my experience.

920
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,920
That was the only thing that really was bad.

921
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,920
I didn't cough that much.

922
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,040
Didn't have much of a runny nose or anything.

923
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,000
Not my first.

924
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,240
There was a fever and the chills and I couldn't lay down.

925
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,440
I didn't get headaches, but I couldn't lie down

926
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,040
without sweating profusely.

927
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,760
And then I'd sit up and I'd feel cold and I'd be shivering.

928
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,120
And I'd be like, I can't tell how hot it is.

929
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,280
I can't tell what temperature it is in this room.

930
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,360
Am I just imagining the cold or is it real?

931
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,280
Yeah, that's what my partner's been going through.

932
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,640
They have it really bad.

933
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,600
I'll feel them.

934
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,880
I feel like he's blasting off their skin like a fucking oven

935
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,400
and they tell me that they're freezing cold.

936
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,200
And I'm like, no, you're not getting the extra blanket.

937
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,760
I'm sorry.

938
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,480
Even though they think they're shivering.

939
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,960
I experienced that a little bit.

940
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,600
My partner's immune system's a lot worse than mine though.

941
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,880
I've been taking care of them because

942
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,320
they caught it slightly later than me.

943
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,920
But yeah, we think it's COVID.

944
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,920
Like we've spoken to our other friends who caught it recently

945
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,000
and they've all described pretty much the same thing.

946
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,320
And yeah, that's probably what's happened.

947
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,120
We don't have our booster.

948
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,880
We're not eligible for a couple more weeks

949
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,360
because it hasn't been six months yet.

950
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,960
I don't think, I don't know if it makes that much of a difference.

951
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,600
Maybe it does.

952
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,840
Omicron though.

953
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,120
Omicron doesn't give a fuck.

954
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,720
I mean, it does a little bit.

955
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,240
It might be Omicron for all I know.

956
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,000
I caught regular COVID in early like 2020

957
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,320
and it was a little bit different.

958
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,040
I guess it depends.

959
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,080
Omicron might not be dominant everywhere yet,

960
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,280
but it probably will be soon.

961
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,600
If it is, I will have had COVID twice in my life.

962
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,320
So, woof.

963
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,320
Iki, icky, icky, icky sticky.

964
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,440
Iki, icky, no, thank you.

965
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,600
I mean, I guess if we don't have a lot of things to talk about,

966
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,400
we could go to that voicemail thing

967
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,320
because there's going to be a lot of discussion

968
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,440
to happen afterwards.

969
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,720
Oh, yeah, sure.

970
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,800
I mean, yeah, why not?

971
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,840
Why not just get the ball rolling on that, I guess.

972
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,480
Oh, yeah.

973
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,560
Do you want to post it?

974
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:48,960
All right.

975
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,400
Dropping voicemail finale in...

976
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh, it's taken a bit.

977
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,400
It's a bit long.

978
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,240
It's like horseshoe finale.

979
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,480
We're going to be here for several hours.

980
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,400
There's a lot of loose threads.

981
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,600
Horseshoe finale.

982
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,520
Horseshoe finale.

983
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,280
Jesse Wood, plebe and the weeb.

984
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,760
Plebe and the weeb blue rays available now.

985
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,560
Send me money.

986
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,120
Send me PayPal, me $30 plus shipping.

987
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,960
Get a fucking DVD.

988
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,480
Wow, can you fucking believe physical media still exists?

989
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,040
I can't.

990
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,200
Fred, how much will shipping be?

991
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,120
You're in Australia or some shit, right?

992
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,480
I am in Australia.

993
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,840
Or some shit.

994
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,120
Okay, now maybe something's changed.

995
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,960
After Christmas, the shipping has changed.

996
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,120
I know because my friend's sending me a computer part.

997
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,560
So it might be viable again.

998
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,560
America will...

999
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,240
The US post office will not ship just fucking ship to Australia.

1000
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,520
Although it might have gone back to that.

1001
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,400
But for a while there, it simply would not do it.

1002
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,520
Shipping is $5 inside America.

1003
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,280
$15 to other countries.

1004
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,720
But Australia, New Zealand, I can't do it.

1005
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,840
It's like $90.

1006
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,320
It's like $90 to ship some...

1007
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,520
What's a communist for America?

1008
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,320
It's because...

1009
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,720
Yeah, it's like the COVID lockdown something was like,

1010
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,760
well, first class mail just doesn't go to Australia anymore.

1011
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,800
You have to send it some other fucking way.

1012
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,080
And it costs like a hundred bucks.

1013
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,480
Yeah, maybe check a game soon, see if it's...

1014
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,200
If someone...

1015
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,600
Yeah, so I'm gonna...

1016
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,520
Since you gave me that burner.

1017
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,560
So I'll just give you one.

1018
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,320
I'll just have to wait until that is no longer the case.

1019
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,040
Yeah, it's okay.

1020
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,800
I'm fine to pay for shipping.

1021
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,720
That's like shipping to drag.

1022
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,160
Yeah, I don't want to...

1023
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,040
Yeah, but that's too much.

1024
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,640
So if you're a listener and you're in Australia...

1025
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,800
Sorry, but if you buy one, it will be $15.

1026
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,920
And I will just wait until the shipping is normal.

1027
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,760
And then I'll send it after it becomes normal.

1028
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,960
Like whenever that happens.

1029
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,240
Yeah.

1030
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,880
And then we have $5 or $15 if you're out of the country.

1031
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,200
Was it...

1032
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,280
Wait, $5 shipping in America.

1033
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,280
$15 to other countries.

1034
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,800
Base price is $30, but if you are a Patreon...

1035
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,840
If you are a Kickstarter...

1036
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,520
$40 pleadingly Kickstarter backer, I will.

1037
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,840
Purely out of the goodness of my heart, by the way.

1038
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,680
Purely, this is pure charity.

1039
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,600
I'll give you $20 off, right?

1040
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,160
So if you were a backer in America,

1041
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,040
it would cost you $15, including shipping.

1042
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,280
Right?

1043
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,480
That's how it works.

1044
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,360
PayPal me at IASUcomic is my PayPal email address.

1045
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,400
Send me the money.

1046
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,760
Include your shipping address.

1047
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,480
Patreon.com.

1048
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:37,920
That's...

1049
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,200
Oh, shit.

1050
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,480
I've been hijacked.

1051
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,520
All right, sorry.

1052
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,200
Anyway, voicemail finale.

1053
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,400
Oh god, it's four minutes.

1054
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,400
There's no such thing as a voicemail

1055
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,120
that could possibly justify it being four minutes long.

1056
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,480
Look, no, it's fine, Ben.

1057
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,840
That's what you think, Ben.

1058
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:56,800
Just wait.

1059
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:57,840
Just wait.

1060
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,200
All right.

1061
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
All right, let's do it.

1062
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,760
Three, two, one, go.

1063
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,560
I've done it.

1064
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,640
I finally made it all the way back to this

1065
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,560
miserable cum sock of a planet.

1066
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,320
Earth.

1067
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,440
Home of the PCP.

1068
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,440
The elite cabal who banished me to the Twilight Realm.

1069
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,720
Voice limbo.

1070
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,920
I toppled the king from his throne

1071
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,480
and bore this tape from his bone.

1072
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,600
This is the final tape.

1073
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,720
My swan song to you.

1074
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,200
All right.

1075
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,960
This tape will self-destruct.

1076
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:55,840
What?

1077
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,120
Oh boy.

1078
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,880
It's happening now.

1079
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,880
Oh.

1080
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,880
Take a sip, babes.

1081
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:09,920
Delicious.

1082
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,200
First voicemail of the day in heck.

1083
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,280
Ben St. didn't even bother to check.

1084
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,440
Just how many of these voicemail suckers

1085
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,520
want to be, want to be, league of nate fuckers?

1086
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,520
Cook up a carb-filled savory plan.

1087
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,360
Don't do keto or you'll be in strife.

1088
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,520
Just take a bite and change your life.

1089
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,240
Voice grail for life.

1090
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,000
Voice grail for life.

1091
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,560
I'm a fucking pile of snakes.

1092
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,640
Voice grail for life.

1093
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,480
Voice grail for life.

1094
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,560
Oh well, nothing until I wipe cough,

1095
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,640
wipe my grit and pull out my quark.

1096
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,800
Aim for Michelle as I start to suck.

1097
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,360
Oh my god, she's such a croc.

1098
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,440
Voice grail for life.

1099
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,200
Voice grail for life.

1100
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,360
I am Ben St's worst nightmare.

1101
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,440
I sure gave him quite a scare.

1102
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,600
He wants to put me in the brig.

1103
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,800
Cause I'm a fat, interrupting, non-specific farm animal.

1104
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:31,440
Yeah.

1105
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,480
Voice grail for life.

1106
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,320
Voice grail for life.

1107
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,480
This podcast has gone too long.

1108
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,560
I will now complain in song.

1109
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,720
If no nate, then I won't watch.

1110
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,120
I'll just torture Ben St's crotch.

1111
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,280
Voice grail for life.

1112
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,120
Voice grail for life.

1113
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,200
I've got a question here for Nate.

1114
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,360
I'm sorry if this comes in late.

1115
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:53,840
I just-

1116
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:28,480
I hate this podcast.

1117
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,760
I fucking hate it.

1118
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,400
I can't do a single point

1119
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,960
without literally every single host

1120
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,120
constantly like vultures

1121
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,480
trying to jump on me

1122
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,160
and cannibalize my point.

1123
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,520
Clear words unrecognized.

1124
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,640
Okay, stopping.

1125
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,760
And with that, my work is done.

1126
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,040
Finally, my inner peace.

1127
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,520
Oh god, it hurts.

1128
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,320
Why do I put these things in my fucking face?

1129
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,080
Pound of beef in the pan.

1130
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,680
What seems to be the problem, man?

1131
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,360
My tape.

1132
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
No, so sad.

1133
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,680
He got shot.

1134
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,720
The gun, a recipe for death.

1135
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:41,760
But there are more recipes to share in part two.

1136
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,160
Oh god, there's more.

1137
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,440
The second part's shorter, don't worry.

1138
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,640
I feel like this is actually the finale

1139
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,440
of all voicemails

1140
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,680
and we can't have any more voicemails after this.

1141
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,160
Like it's over.

1142
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,280
It's almost over.

1143
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,320
There's a few characters

1144
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,080
who have yet to have conclusions.

1145
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,160
But rest in peace, tapekeeper.

1146
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,040
You will be missed.

1147
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Yeah, that's the tapekeeper.

1148
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,200
Wait, from lesbian horse RPG.

1149
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:13,520
Yeah.

1150
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,120
Right?

1151
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,360
Yeah.

1152
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,120
Is this always, has this been the lore the whole time?

1153
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:19,680
Yes.

1154
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:19,920
Yes.

1155
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:22,880
Okay.

1156
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,560
Literally the best character in that game.

1157
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,400
Well, yeah, I remember voicing this character

1158
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,520
in TBAP plays.

1159
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,560
I talked inward.

1160
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,600
I did an inward voice breathing in voice like this.

1161
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,000
Dude, I fucking love that let's play so much.

1162
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,120
Oh god, my COVID.

1163
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,720
Oh, that really activates my,

1164
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,000
that really activates my,

1165
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,320
that really activates my antigens.

1166
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,280
That really gets my spike proteins.

1167
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,720
Jocelyn, yeah, vibrating.

1168
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,520
Oh boy.

1169
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,360
Vibrating with motion.

1170
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,080
Oh my god.

1171
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,560
Well, Mal.

1172
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,360
I recently watched like several reviews of that fucking game.

1173
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,920
It's so fun to watch people rip into that.

1174
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,840
Have you seen to Snaker's review?

1175
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,360
I have not actually.

1176
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,160
He was on the PCP a few weeks ago.

1177
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,720
He has one of, I think his and his and Running Shine's

1178
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,320
are my two favorite yick reviews.

1179
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:26,800
Oh yeah.

1180
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,880
In the crowded genre of YouTube yick reviews,

1181
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,920
those two are head and shoulders.

1182
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,960
In general, Running Shine is very entertaining.

1183
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,800
I rewatch his stuff every now and then.

1184
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,760
Pretty fun guy.

1185
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,440
Sure, yeah, I like Running Shine.

1186
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,760
I need to look up to Snaker's now.

1187
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,160
I will absolutely watch him.

1188
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,280
That's a good one.

1189
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:47,520
Yes.

1190
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,800
All right, voicemail finale revelations.

1191
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,720
This is part two, I guess.

1192
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,760
Are we ready?

1193
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,800
Yes, I'm ready.

1194
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,600
Are you ready?

1195
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,600
Eleazar, cut that part out where I got, where it stopped.

1196
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,040
We could just pretend that didn't happen.

1197
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,400
Just, I'll be cutting it because I'll edit this episode.

1198
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:04,560
Okay.

1199
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,200
Yeah.

1200
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:05,840
Pre Eleazar.

1201
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,560
Oh wait, that's right.

1202
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,920
You're editing this episode because Eleazar is gone.

1203
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,320
He's on a trip for like a week, yeah.

1204
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:12,800
He's on holiday.

1205
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,760
Eleazar, beta.

1206
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,800
Oh, good for him.

1207
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,720
Anyway, that's the side of the point.

1208
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,280
Voicemail finale.

1209
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,280
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1210
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,480
Apple seeds, buy the pound.

1211
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,640
Crush them all the way.

1212
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,280
Blend it well.

1213
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,280
Almond smell.

1214
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,240
Cheeseless.

1215
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,040
Cyanine, sense you to hell.

1216
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,640
Press for paste into a pill.

1217
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,520
That's good kill.

1218
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,800
I put the pill between my teeth.

1219
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,680
Take a bite and you're live.

1220
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,400
Rest in peace.

1221
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,080
Press F.

1222
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,720
Rest in peace.

1223
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,200
Tito Kitchen.

1224
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,440
What a fucking moron.

1225
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,600
Imagine killing yourself.

1226
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:20,800
Quinn.

1227
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,400
Classic.

1228
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,640
It appears I have a snake confession to make.

1229
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,760
For four years I have slivered this planet.

1230
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,120
Yet none know my true nature.

1231
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:44,480
I have always identified as 28,980 snakes.

1232
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:51,040
But in reality, I am simply one very lonely snake.

1233
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:57,440
With 28,979 snitch-shaped tumors.

1234
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,160
This begins.

1235
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,680
The then snakes cancer arc.

1236
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,080
Make a wish.

1237
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,600
It's finally time that I unplug my voice filter.

1238
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:19,520
My voice filter, which just so happens to be connected to my life's support system.

1239
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,040
I will die.

1240
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,480
But at least I can gaze upon Ben St.

1241
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,280
with my lone eyes.

1242
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,760
This ends.

1243
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,040
The then snakes cancer arc.

1244
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,960
Short but sweet.

1245
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,440
Them snakes.

1246
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,440
Oh, oh, there they are.

1247
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,760
It would seem that I'm not dead yet.

1248
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,800
Hello, hello.

1249
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,640
Snakes, are you are you feeling all right after unplugging your life's support?

1250
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:06,960
You do.

1251
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,120
I may have been overdramatic.

1252
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,800
This voice is really fucking hard to do when I have COVID.

1253
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,680
What the fuck?

1254
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,320
Jesus Christ.

1255
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,080
Yeah, and cancer and damn COVID and cancer.

1256
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,600
That's brutal.

1257
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,440
I'm so sorry.

1258
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,080
It's COVID.

1259
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,760
Must be rough.

1260
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:37,520
Three of your, well, one of you and two tumors, I guess, are here in the hall.

1261
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,560
We're here for moral support.

1262
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,760
Where the dearest, roundest, floppiest turn is a snake could ask for.

1263
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,800
Oh boy.

1264
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,480
I call them keto kitchen.

1265
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,680
I'm in Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1266
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,520
Yeah.

1267
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,800
Cluster Punk Kitchen, yeah.

1268
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,640
I was the keto man in Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1269
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,080
Everyone's dead.

1270
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:56,720
Everyone's dead.

1271
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:02,640
Everywhere at the end of the PCP, all the voicemailers have all been, they're all dead.

1272
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,360
They're all gone.

1273
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,560
They've all gone to the great comet in the sky.

1274
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,200
It's lonely.

1275
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,360
So lonely at the top.

1276
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,440
Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down.

1277
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,000
So, oh my god, them snakes, it was me all along.

1278
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,760
It was me, Austin.

1279
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,480
I know some people were very suspicious.

1280
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,120
How could it be?

1281
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,280
How could it be me?

1282
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,680
How could it be?

1283
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,520
Well, I fought.

1284
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,400
I don't believe it.

1285
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,040
I'm sorry.

1286
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:39,760
This is an op.

1287
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,840
Bandsynch.

1288
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,720
This is me.

1289
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,080
I believe it on the file.

1290
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,720
I just, God, it's hard to do.

1291
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,920
He doesn't have the voice filter.

1292
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,720
I can't convince him.

1293
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,800
Aha, them snakes would never cough.

1294
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,360
Or have COVID.

1295
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,360
Why did I have to be sick visually?

1296
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,280
You imposter.

1297
01:11:59,360 --> 01:11:59,680
God.

1298
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,560
Dude, recording that last of them snakes a bit was actually a nightmare.

1299
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:11,120
So, when the voicemail's first fucking started, the first character I made was crunchy,

1300
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,640
which was terrible and I had no ideas.

1301
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,760
I don't even remember that.

1302
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,800
The first voicemail, and it was on the very first episode.

1303
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,440
I mean, that was their name or you're describing like their audio quality was crunchy.

1304
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,960
Their name was crunchy.

1305
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,680
They were like munchies dark side or whatever the fuck.

1306
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,040
And the first voicemail, it's so bad.

1307
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:31,840
It's just me going.

1308
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,560
Like with like.

1309
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,120
What a memorable character.

1310
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,600
And the second time crunchy appeared, I did my impression of the undertayler

1311
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,040
with again with voice filters and shit.

1312
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,800
And I thought crunchy was a shit character and then I thought of them snakes.

1313
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,160
Oh, Ben St. Vem snakes.

1314
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,880
What if it's just a bunch of snakes and Ben doesn't like things that are

1315
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,040
unoriginal or that are like sequels or whatever the fuck.

1316
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,160
That was like a meme back then.

1317
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:02,880
So.

1318
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,160
Right.

1319
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:04,560
Yeah.

1320
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,680
Ha, Ben's the copycat.

1321
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:13,040
That one episode with Jeff, where I was like, iteration is bad.

1322
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,480
Yeah.

1323
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,280
And Ben Ben St. V iteration of snakes, clearly.

1324
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,280
Right.

1325
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,000
So Ben bad.

1326
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,280
That was that was the joke.

1327
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,640
I was going to go all the way around.

1328
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,000
I was going to do like analog woman, you know, for Digi bro.

1329
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,520
I was going to do a bunch and then I just kind of was like, no, let's not do that.

1330
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:35,360
And then I then I actually before the PCP editor contest even happened.

1331
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,520
I got to go on as Vem snakes.

1332
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,400
I fooled everyone managed to get myself in that was live.

1333
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,920
That was before remember, remember the rap?

1334
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,320
Remember that time I did the little animation for the rap?

1335
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:49,360
Yeah.

1336
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:49,680
Yeah.

1337
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,400
That was fun.

1338
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,120
Oh, yeah.

1339
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,080
That was beautiful.

1340
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,000
That was a beautiful moment.

1341
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,280
I'm still proud of that.

1342
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,320
I thought it was great.

1343
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,360
It was really fucking great.

1344
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,280
The editing on that episode was fucking crazy.

1345
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,280
It being on there was surreal.

1346
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:01,600
Yeah.

1347
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,040
I worked really hard on it.

1348
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:04,480
Yeah.

1349
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:04,800
What?

1350
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,560
So so I have two discords, obviously.

1351
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,200
And I even have two Minecraft accounts.

1352
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,640
I have a Minecraft account called Vem snakes.

1353
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,240
I had I made a YouTube channel did all this stuff to keep up the deception.

1354
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,840
The Vem snakes, Patreon page, all this shit to keep the deception running.

1355
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,560
Wait, is there a Vem snakes?

1356
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,240
Yeah.

1357
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:29,360
Like in the very first voicemail is characterpatreon.com slash Vem snakes.

1358
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:35,840
And then it says like, like, you know, like they Vem his pronouns, the plural they,

1359
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,760
you know, the rare plural they, of course, of course.

1360
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,320
Yeah.

1361
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:48,240
It was and then fucking Gibbs suggested making it the black and red snakes from the game,

1362
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,120
from the pump game.

1363
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,240
And that was a great idea.

1364
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,520
Right.

1365
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,400
And I think there was fan art of that episode.

1366
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,360
And four eyes.

1367
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,240
Oh, yeah.

1368
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,080
Do some Vem snakes fan art and even created Vem snakes mall.

1369
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,000
There was actually a thing with that.

1370
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,560
Oh, I remember.

1371
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:05,760
I remember that.

1372
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,120
I do remember that fan art.

1373
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,160
That's specific one.

1374
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:08,400
Yeah.

1375
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:08,720
For sure.

1376
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:13,680
I remember specifically I brought out that fan art and then somebody else who was also cold

1377
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,320
four eyes also did fan art at Vem snakes.

1378
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:16,960
Yeah.

1379
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,280
Yes.

1380
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:17,760
That was great.

1381
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,360
There is another person named four eyes on Twitter who, yeah.

1382
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,520
They are also like coincidence.

1383
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,960
Pretty horny from what I've seen.

1384
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,480
I thought you two were the same person for a while because like.

1385
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,320
No, it's just fucking big coincidence.

1386
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,000
I think it's a reasonable assumption.

1387
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,640
But oh, yeah.

1388
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,880
No, I just look in the shadows.

1389
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:37,600
Yeah.

1390
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,320
Okay.

1391
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:38,640
Yeah.

1392
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:42,480
Oh, yeah.

1393
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,400
Where is that fan art though?

1394
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,600
I want to put it in chat so we can show the screen.

1395
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,080
Oh, let me.

1396
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,360
Let me.

1397
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,400
I think it was this one with the funny.

1398
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,880
That was during that was during an era that was during an era in which I was putting in high

1399
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,360
effort, high effort editing on the PCP.

1400
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:04,000
That was the era of the Vem snakes rap battle and also that bonus episode with where we played

1401
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,240
the Baron Munchausen.

1402
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:08,720
Oh my God.

1403
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,320
And I animated the battles.

1404
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:10,640
Oh man.

1405
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,360
That was a fun episode.

1406
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,480
That one was way fun.

1407
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,080
I thought that was great.

1408
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,840
I never saw the video for Valley only.

1409
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,680
I only saw I only got the audio frivos.

1410
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,800
I just downloaded the audio for bonus episodes foolishly.

1411
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,720
I should have grabbed the videos.

1412
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,160
I don't even know where the playlist is.

1413
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,480
Yeah.

1414
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,720
The audio component or the video component, like the character, like their mouths are

1415
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,040
animated in that style of like, you know, black background and like, you know, the colored outline.

1416
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,160
And like they like draw their weapons and they like clash in the screen and they like shoot

1417
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,880
past each other and like flash red and take damage and stuff.

1418
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,400
It's a whole, it was a whole production.

1419
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:45,760
Yeah.

1420
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,960
That was that.

1421
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,600
Before we fucking were like, why don't we just pay someone to make these episodes for us?

1422
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,720
Nobody even watches them.

1423
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,320
They just download the audio.

1424
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,320
LaMalle.

1425
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:57,840
That's what happened.

1426
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,760
I have this image.

1427
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:00,960
This image.

1428
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,360
Excuse me.

1429
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,560
Oh yeah.

1430
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,240
I wanted to, that was a scrapped idea, but it's still cool.

1431
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,840
Where was the VemSnakes mom with the snake boobs made out of snakes?

1432
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,560
With the vagina.

1433
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,640
Not sure I remember.

1434
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,200
I don't know if you would have seen it.

1435
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,640
This is like a completely separate thing.

1436
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:22,800
Like, back when I was getting like way into like, when you were introducing me to VemSnakes and

1437
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,760
showed me like the episode and stuff, I was, I just became a bit of a big fan.

1438
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,200
So I need to find it for sure.

1439
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:31,520
Yeah.

1440
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,120
I did.

1441
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,280
I went on 4chan at the time.

1442
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:43,440
VemSnakes is, he's sexy, but also at the time also getting into

1443
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:50,000
Choose Your Own Adventures, which is apparently just a thing that is on the MLP board for 4chan.

1444
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,480
And I thought, I would love to do something like that.

1445
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:58,160
And there's a whole thing where like, you're playing as underwater fish ponies and stuff like that.

1446
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,680
And there's a weird plot about a bunch of.

1447
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,680
On the sea ponies.

1448
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,480
True they do.

1449
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:04,720
Yeah.

1450
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,600
When you're in distress.

1451
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,960
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1452
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,720
Should be due, should be due.

1453
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,960
And there were a bunch of black snakes underwater for some reason that could just breathe, I guess.

1454
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,520
And they were taking it over the whole land and terrorizing people.

1455
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:26,560
And they were led by a gigantic milk snake that had giant, that had giant tits made out of snakes.

1456
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,480
That's crazy shit.

1457
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,840
Here we go.

1458
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,400
Crazy shit, my dude.

1459
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,000
Very, very old stuff, very, very old stuff.

1460
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,560
Very good, very good.

1461
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,440
I was a big fan of this.

1462
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:48,080
I was starting to get really into, that is the best compliment you can give that, very good.

1463
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,800
Yeah, I mean it's great, I love it.

1464
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,960
It ended very quickly, but that is a thing that exists.

1465
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,400
It's cute and good and I like it.

1466
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,120
That is cute.

1467
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,920
It has lesbians.

1468
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,080
I guess when there was Lost Tapes Archive, which...

1469
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,960
How that started was, Forai's had a really kind of funny psychic pebbles impression he was doing.

1470
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,360
And calls a lot.

1471
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,120
I thought, that's a funny voice.

1472
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,760
What if we like make a voicemail character out of that?

1473
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,800
And so we came up with the idea of this guy who just like finds all your dirty secrets and shit.

1474
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,040
And I really wanted to do the Ben St. Licious meme.

1475
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,080
And my partner, back then, this was before they started Pormones.

1476
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,120
So they were able to do their Twilight voice still.

1477
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,200
I remember you guys were like, wait, did they get Tara Strong?

1478
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,520
And I was like, that was a compliment.

1479
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,080
That was epic.

1480
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,360
Oh, amazing, amazing.

1481
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,800
I also remember Nate being like, huh, we're getting a lot of voicemails for Ben.

1482
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,240
What about the rest of us, huh?

1483
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,600
I remember that also being a thing.

1484
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:50,960
Shut up.

1485
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,720
Which is also my doing.

1486
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,080
Where are you now, Ben?

1487
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,280
Where are you now?

1488
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,880
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1489
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,440
Ben's the most reliable person to pick on because he's always here.

1490
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,200
Yeah.

1491
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:06,960
And then from there, for Tom's tape, the one with the train,

1492
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,000
like the Thomas Votan engine parody, we got Will Ryan.

1493
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,440
He's a YouTuber with life.

1494
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,320
I'd like me to go back and listen to all these again.

1495
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,480
Now that all this is out in the open, the Vem Snake channel will be used to

1496
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,600
archive compilations of every complete series of Clusters 1 Kitchen,

1497
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,720
Vem Snake, Sloth's Tape Archive.

1498
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,920
It's all going up there probably in February.

1499
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,360
Oh my God.

1500
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:27,760
Okay.

1501
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,080
Well, I guess we'll have to link that in the description.

1502
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,000
I don't know if it probably won't be archived that soon.

1503
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,680
You can just link the Vem Snake's channel and it'll be up there in a few weeks probably.

1504
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:40,640
Yeah, okay.

1505
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,760
That'll work just as well.

1506
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,360
That's pretty funny.

1507
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,000
All right.

1508
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,560
Yeah.

1509
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,600
Vem Snake's channel.

1510
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,000
I'll subscribe.

1511
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,600
You weren't already subscribed?

1512
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,800
Ooh, shameful.

1513
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,080
I don't think so.

1514
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,880
I don't think so.

1515
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,640
Maybe I was.

1516
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,040
You know, we should have Vem Snake's on the draw cast.

1517
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,440
No, he's dead.

1518
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,280
Bring him back.

1519
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,320
He's fucked up.

1520
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:02,880
He's dead.

1521
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,280
No.

1522
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,840
See, there's a thing.

1523
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,240
That's my secret.

1524
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,360
Yeah, just bring him back.

1525
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,680
Vem Snake's has been on so many draw casts.

1526
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,160
He's been on the rest of the world.

1527
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:10,880
Just make him not dead.

1528
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,200
Yeah, but as I was saying about the Tom Tape,

1529
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,760
Will Ryan voiced some of the Thomas characters?

1530
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,680
He's a YouTuber with over a million subscribers.

1531
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,640
Did you say Will Ryan?

1532
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,600
Yeah, Will Ryan of DA Games, that channel I work for.

1533
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,960
Challenge everything.

1534
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,440
Challenge everything.

1535
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,240
Yeah.

1536
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:30,800
Yeah.

1537
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,560
So, it all got.

1538
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,760
And then there was the DeVoo rap.

1539
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,600
Oh, that was so great.

1540
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,720
That's my ringtone.

1541
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,160
That's ironically my ringtone.

1542
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:38,640
I love it.

1543
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,080
Yeah.

1544
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,880
I like the goo.

1545
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,040
I don't know.

1546
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,080
Lost Tapes is my favorite series before I had the most effort put in.

1547
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:46,640
There's a lot.

1548
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,400
I had a lot of voicemails.

1549
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,880
I had a lot of voicemails over the years.

1550
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,520
Yeah.

1551
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,000
And then there was Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1552
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,760
I was editing the PCP during that.

1553
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,120
I liked your book, Kiki.

1554
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,240
Keto Delito.

1555
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:58,720
Right, yeah.

1556
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,440
That was good.

1557
01:21:59,440 --> 01:21:59,760
Yes.

1558
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,560
Keto Delito.

1559
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,760
That's why I was saying Keto for Cluster Punk Kitchen.

1560
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,560
Yeah, Keto Delito.

1561
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,440
I was Ben St. in that voicemail.

1562
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:08,640
Oh, yeah.

1563
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,080
You were the little Ben St. standing.

1564
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,040
Well, I'm so sorry.

1565
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,240
I'm so sorry for you.

1566
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,480
It's tough.

1567
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,040
It's okay.

1568
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,000
I survived.

1569
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,040
I've only lost an arm.

1570
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,560
Then there's a whole bunch of minor.

1571
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,560
There's a whole bunch of minor characters.

1572
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,280
Right wing Richard.

1573
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,320
Left wing Larry.

1574
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,360
That was us.

1575
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,360
Okay.

1576
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,800
Center Sam.

1577
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,080
Politics.

1578
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:34,800
What are they?

1579
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,400
Oh, yeah.

1580
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,440
That was just a...

1581
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,920
That literally came about as me just saying something random

1582
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,040
and you just thought it was so funny that I just said that.

1583
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,080
That was weird.

1584
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,680
There was a double, double Satan.

1585
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,480
Satan.

1586
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,280
That was also me.

1587
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,760
There's fucking hundreds.

1588
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,920
I've done so many characters and so many voices.

1589
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,320
Oh, yeah.

1590
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,920
The big thing this year was the League of Nightfuckers,

1591
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,600
which I created.

1592
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,960
That was my brainchild.

1593
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,200
I gathered Seatull and Four Eyes.

1594
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,280
And I just have a funny idea.

1595
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,000
I did it.

1596
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,320
Okay.

1597
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,040
It didn't actually start when Michelle thought

1598
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,360
Sean was going to spicy salt.

1599
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,560
And we were talking about that situation.

1600
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,800
And that gave you the idea.

1601
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,200
I heard that Michelle thought

1602
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,600
that Sean was going to sex Nate or something.

1603
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,200
And I'm like, and...

1604
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:23,920
Sean...

1605
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,960
Wait, who's Sean?

1606
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,160
Sean Dawn.

1607
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:26,880
Sean Dawn.

1608
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,920
He made the...

1609
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,280
Oh, right.

1610
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:29,600
Yes.

1611
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,280
Yeah, yeah.

1612
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:31,600
Okay.

1613
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,320
That's Sean.

1614
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:32,640
Sorry.

1615
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,720
I was thinking of the Skull YouTuber.

1616
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,120
Yeah.

1617
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,800
You drew him a thing recently.

1618
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,200
Oh, yeah.

1619
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,400
He wants to fuck Nate.

1620
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,120
Yes, I know.

1621
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,680
Yes, I know.

1622
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,760
I drew his sword.

1623
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,000
Sorry.

1624
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,600
I was just thinking of a different show.

1625
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,280
So anyways, I heard Michelle thought

1626
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,480
that Sean wanted to fuck Nate.

1627
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,760
And I'm like, that's not true.

1628
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,000
But that's also really funny.

1629
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:50,480
You know what?

1630
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,080
Everyone wants to fuck Nate now.

1631
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,440
And so I sat down and like,

1632
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,800
this is like two weeks in advance.

1633
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,200
I'm like, we need to make like a bunch of voicemails

1634
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,360
and like submit them all back to back.

1635
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,080
Just all of them.

1636
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,800
And then we thought of like the Thousand Lung Man

1637
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,040
who's just like, like fucking breathing.

1638
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,120
We did one from Lost Tapes Archive.

1639
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,160
I did one as Van Snakes.

1640
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,160
A bunch, just a bunch of fucking freaks.

1641
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,240
That's where the William came from.

1642
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,320
My favorite one was the Freddy Freaker parody.

1643
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,360
Yeah, the Freddy Freaker song was so good.

1644
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,720
And you and Gib also were like fucking dying during that.

1645
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:21,440
Yes.

1646
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,160
And then we just kept going.

1647
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,680
Ben, do you remember the Lord of the Rings, Smeagol?

1648
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,120
Oh, yes.

1649
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,240
Nate fucker.

1650
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,120
Yeah.

1651
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:31,600
Yeah.

1652
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,960
Yeah, I remember Smeagol.

1653
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,680
Yeah.

1654
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,640
Don't do Smeagol.

1655
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,280
That was for us.

1656
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,000
Yes.

1657
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,320
Okay.

1658
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,000
This feels like this feels like the end of an era.

1659
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:42,480
Yes.

1660
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,600
The human guitar.

1661
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,120
Oh God, human guitar.

1662
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,160
Poor Alie Azar.

1663
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,080
Every time I submitted a human guitar voicemail,

1664
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,600
he would message me being like oblivion.

1665
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,320
Please my ears.

1666
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,560
I'm like, I'm sorry, I have to punish Ben St.

1667
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,840
It's the only way.

1668
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,360
It's the only way.

1669
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:57,760
True.

1670
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,320
You're an unfortunate side effect.

1671
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,040
The Legendary.

1672
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,600
You too.

1673
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah, he's a collateral damage.

1674
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,080
He's collateral damage.

1675
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,800
It's all about just messing with Ben St's head

1676
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,280
that's been in the game for like three years,

1677
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,560
four years almost, probably.

1678
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,640
What am I supposed to do?

1679
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,160
Not do that?

1680
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,320
Exactly.

1681
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:18,800
Sorry.

1682
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,320
Yeah.

1683
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,480
It is an unhealthy, genuinely,

1684
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,080
it's an unhealthy addiction I've had,

1685
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,760
just making voicemails is a dumb idea.

1686
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,080
And then I spend like three or four hours.

1687
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,200
New year's resolution is get clean,

1688
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,240
get clean off voicemails.

1689
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,600
No more voicemails.

1690
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,720
This is like, I'm blowing my little all white joke.

1691
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,600
That's what that was.

1692
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,200
This man has been in the middle of work,

1693
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,720
get an idea for a voicemail,

1694
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,280
and then spend like two to three hours not doing work

1695
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,280
so he can get this idea perfectly out.

1696
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,760
And he's just like, please do this voice for me.

1697
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,800
I know that feeling.

1698
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,920
I know that feeling.

1699
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,840
Not for the PCP.

1700
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,080
I would never like do work for the PCP.

1701
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,320
For other things.

1702
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,520
Gotcha.

1703
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,080
Okay.

1704
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:05,120
Well, this really is voicemails revelations.

1705
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,240
It's all coming out in the watch.

1706
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:08,640
It's all coming out.

1707
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,000
Third impact, baby.

1708
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,680
And the third impact.

1709
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,640
Yeah.

1710
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,440
Oh, God.

1711
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,800
So now we know.

1712
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,080
The pig saga was so good.

1713
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,120
The terrible truth.

1714
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,880
The pig saga was so good.

1715
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,120
Turns out there was a voicemail cinematic universe.

1716
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,760
The voicemail cinematic universe created by me

1717
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,280
and my friends who I roped into it.

1718
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,480
Yes.

1719
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,440
And it's been going on even since before I was the editor.

1720
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,800
I even managed to fucking get on as VemSnakes,

1721
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,560
which was so funny.

1722
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,440
There's so many points.

1723
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,200
Like when the first time I came on the PCP

1724
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,480
as the believe in fall, I'm sitting here like,

1725
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,240
I've been here before and they don't even fucking know.

1726
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:41,600
Yeah.

1727
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:42,880
Yeah.

1728
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:49,760
I mean, I had some inkling, but I'm sure there were suspicions.

1729
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,640
Do you really think all of these people were oblivion fall?

1730
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,360
I knew that some of them were oblivion fall.

1731
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:01,360
I didn't exactly know who, but I think it was pretty obvious.

1732
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:01,840
I knew that.

1733
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,560
No, I knew that.

1734
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,960
I knew that ClusterPunk kitchen.

1735
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,440
Yeah.

1736
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,080
For sure.

1737
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:06,320
Oh, yeah.

1738
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,680
That's just my regular voice.

1739
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,320
Just slowed down.

1740
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:08,880
Yeah.

1741
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,000
Yeah.

1742
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,280
Human guitar, I think, is also pretty clearly your voice

1743
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,520
if you can listen past the filter.

1744
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,720
I also just spilled the beans on that one immediately.

1745
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:23,680
So.

1746
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh, yeah.

1747
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,360
I thought it was a surprise.

1748
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:30,960
Well, I guess we'll just never have another good voicemail ever again.

1749
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,360
Exactly.

1750
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,240
You're all these shit from now on.

1751
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:34,880
We've peaked.

1752
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,480
This is it.

1753
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,200
I think so.

1754
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,880
So, I mean, should we listen to some bad voicemails?

1755
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,280
Oh, yeah.

1756
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,240
Yeah, let's go for it.

1757
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,160
All right.

1758
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:51,520
I guess let's let's let's do some and just see what just see what remains.

1759
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:51,840
All right.

1760
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:57,200
Let's see what the kingdom of ashes is left for us to to reign over.

1761
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,680
Let's see what the nuclear apocalypse looks like.

1762
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:00,960
I think so.

1763
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,840
I think that's right.

1764
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,040
All right.

1765
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:08,800
First one of today is it's called Keckfest 2020.

1766
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:11,520
Okay.

1767
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:12,800
Sorry.

1768
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,640
My folder computer.

1769
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,200
Oh, God.

1770
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,360
Oh, my God.

1771
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:19,680
Okay.

1772
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:20,800
Never mind.

1773
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,960
It's a three second voicemail.

1774
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,520
I think there's a.

1775
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,560
Okay.

1776
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:25,360
Yeah.

1777
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,240
Listen to that.

1778
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,400
But the actual voicemail is here.

1779
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:32,400
It's a YouTube link here is the link.

1780
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:33,440
Okay.

1781
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:35,680
What the?

1782
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:40,320
Simeon Jimmy's treehouse procrastinators podcast versus Simeon Jimmy.

1783
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:41,440
What?

1784
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,560
This is just monkey.

1785
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,200
What is this?

1786
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:43,920
The fuck is this?

1787
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,000
This is a 46 minute monkey video.

1788
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:47,680
Is this new?

1789
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,520
This came out.

1790
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:49,920
Oh, yeah.

1791
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,680
This came out at the end of last year.

1792
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:52,640
Whoa.

1793
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,920
Like two days ago.

1794
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:54,160
What?

1795
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,120
What the fuck is this?

1796
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:55,360
Okay.

1797
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,640
This came up two days ago.

1798
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:58,960
Yeah.

1799
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,680
I guess I better give this a watch.

1800
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,200
That's I'm concerned.

1801
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:03,680
Yeah.

1802
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,560
I'll wash that later.

1803
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,440
I guess.

1804
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,240
Oh, God.

1805
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,200
How embarrassing.

1806
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,800
I, uh, uh, this is, uh.

1807
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,360
It's been so long since I heard monkey's voice.

1808
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,840
I'm like, I'm like concerned.

1809
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,760
I'm like afraid to listen to this.

1810
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,480
I don't even want to know what he's going to say.

1811
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,840
Treksy's under digital brain.

1812
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:25,200
Oh, my gosh.

1813
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,080
This calm, this comment.

1814
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,680
Comment on this video.

1815
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:28,560
Wait, what does this say?

1816
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,160
Um, holy shit.

1817
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,600
I woke up from a four year coma.

1818
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,040
I've missed so many uploads from the PCP.

1819
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,400
I can't wait to see all the crazy content

1820
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,480
they made together in the PCP house.

1821
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,840
And what the bleep in the weave.

1822
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,040
Can't wait for those bleep and weave

1823
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,320
Blu-rays baby.

1824
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:40,800
Yeah.

1825
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,160
Get with the bleep and weave video

1826
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,880
that I spent $500 crowdfunding look like.

1827
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,800
And I sure hope that Digi is living successfully

1828
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,000
with his wife and hasn't become

1829
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,920
a literal homeless drug addict.

1830
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,680
Getting less than 200 views for video.

1831
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:52,080
Oh boy.

1832
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,120
I'm so excited.

1833
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:57,920
Uh, the bleep, Blu-rays baby.

1834
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,120
The Blu-rays are real.

1835
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,240
What a time.

1836
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,440
What a time to be alive.

1837
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,760
Men saying to the rescue.

1838
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:04,880
Yeah.

1839
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,880
At least, at least,

1840
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,680
chap McBloake making from his coma

1841
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,040
love something to look forward to.

1842
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,560
And that's those Blu-rays.

1843
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,400
I see, I see a comment from Project FM.

1844
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,560
Imagine forgetting both mother's basement

1845
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,240
and the DeVoo, but not Si.

1846
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,880
Yeah, like Si is listed as a member here.

1847
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,080
I mentioned that I asked Si

1848
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,440
if he wanted to come on the show

1849
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,720
and he was just like, nah,

1850
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,320
he's just too good.

1851
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,840
He's too good for the PCP now.

1852
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,480
Tragic, tragic.

1853
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,880
Mother's basement would absolutely come on though.

1854
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,240
Mother's basement would never turn down the PCP.

1855
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:42,960
This is a fact.

1856
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,160
No, there's a guy with integrity.

1857
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,920
There's a guy who would never turn his back

1858
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,200
on his old pals at the Procrastinators podcast.

1859
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,800
Okay, that's very funny.

1860
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,000
Obviously, we're not going to watch it

1861
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,120
because it's 40 minutes long.

1862
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,080
Link in the description to

1863
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,400
Simi and Jimmy's Treehouse Procrastinators podcast.

1864
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:04,960
If there's a Simi...

1865
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,760
I'm like, ugh.

1866
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,960
I don't want to know what he has to say.

1867
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:14,160
Apparently, he replaced DeVoo with Si last minute for some reason.

1868
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,560
Sure, whatever.

1869
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,920
Okay, so that's very funny, probably.

1870
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,360
Next voicemail is here.

1871
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,400
I'll put it in chat.

1872
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,120
It is called...

1873
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,040
What's it called?

1874
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,480
It's called a concerned viewer.

1875
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,080
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1876
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,000
Hey, PCP.

1877
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,200
You ever wonder what happened to that one fellow

1878
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,280
who was just always really thirsty?

1879
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,120
At least, I don't think we've heard from him in a while.

1880
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,200
But then, I remember, it's dry dump December.

1881
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,360
He's not thirsty anymore.

1882
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:01,200
He's absorbing back all the moisture from the poo he's been holding in.

1883
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,000
We've done so much good.

1884
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,840
He's really changed someone's life for the better.

1885
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,160
Yeah.

1886
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,360
And thank you for that.

1887
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,640
You're the best PCP.

1888
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,160
Hell yeah.

1889
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,200
You're doing good.

1890
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:12,560
You know, a couple of days ago was dried up December for me

1891
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,160
during the height of my fever.

1892
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,640
I guess all the moisture in my body was just being like

1893
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,760
sucked out into sweat.

1894
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:18,960
And I had to...

1895
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,360
You needed it.

1896
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,920
My butt was glued shut.

1897
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:22,800
God.

1898
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,000
It was awful.

1899
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,760
Wow, that's nasty.

1900
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,240
That's just fucked up.

1901
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,800
Dried up December.

1902
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,840
It's just fucked up.

1903
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,320
Delicious.

1904
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,280
That's just beyond the pale.

1905
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,520
Eleazar, edit that out, please.

1906
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,520
I'll edit that out, Eleazar.

1907
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,160
Thanks, Ele.

1908
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,520
Thanks, Eleazar.

1909
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,720
Oblivion, edit Eleazar.

1910
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,760
Oblivion, edit Eleazar back in.

1911
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,240
He's good.

1912
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,120
Oblivion Fall.

1913
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:41,840
Eddie at...

1914
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:42,640
Yeah, put it...

1915
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,000
Oblivion Fall, fuck you.

1916
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,640
Get out of here.

1917
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,680
Put Eleazar back in the episode in the editing bay.

1918
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,160
Thank you.

1919
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,240
God bless.

1920
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,880
Next episode is called...

1921
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,200
TheFAG is on Twitter.

1922
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:59,200
This is at FAG Penridge, all one word.

1923
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,600
You remember, this was that club that was

1924
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,600
doing a counter turning point USA

1925
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,000
campaign at their school.

1926
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,520
Oh, yes.

1927
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,240
Yes, I remember this.

1928
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,200
I remember this.

1929
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,280
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1930
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,120
Hey, PCP.

1931
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,840
I called in a little bit ago, maybe two weeks ago,

1932
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,040
about the FAG, the Fellowship of Atheist Gamers.

1933
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,440
And I just wanted to call back in to say

1934
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,640
that the FAG has a Twitter account now.

1935
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,200
Who, boy?

1936
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:30,240
Because I know that Instagram's kind of for Zoomers

1937
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,680
and there's more for Boomers.

1938
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,520
So I'm just trying to diversify our platforms.

1939
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,640
And now we have a Twitter.

1940
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:40,640
It is at FAG Penridge, at Fag Penridge.

1941
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,200
And it's just going to be the uploading

1942
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,120
what's already on the Instagram account.

1943
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,360
But it turns out that Turning Point Penridge

1944
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,960
also has a Twitter account.

1945
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,200
So, yeah, I get it.

1946
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,040
Now we're taking a full frontal assault.

1947
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:53,840
Everywhere.

1948
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,640
Oh, boy.

1949
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,400
You got to take it to the streets.

1950
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,320
Well, we are liberal.

1951
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,680
Hashtag love is love.

1952
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,960
Hashtag FAG.

1953
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,440
The official page for the Penridge chapter

1954
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,360
of the Fellowship of Atheist Gamers.

1955
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,240
Take the blue pill.

1956
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:08,640
I don't know.

1957
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,920
I don't know anything about these people.

1958
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,600
But every single tweet that they make,

1959
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,000
I fully endorse and 100% believe in.

1960
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,920
100, agreed.

1961
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,400
Agreed.

1962
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,520
I'm doing it.

1963
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,200
I'm giving them a follow.

1964
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,080
I'm giving them a follow.

1965
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,640
They're tweeting little pamphlets.

1966
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:25,280
That's neat.

1967
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,320
And that's an endorsement.

1968
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,360
Yeah, a little Jimmy Carter, Grover Cleveland,

1969
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,880
a little historical section search.

1970
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,200
Here are three reasons why capitalism

1971
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,040
is an optimized and fair system.

1972
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,160
I like their reasons.

1973
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,280
Damn it, he's right.

1974
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,400
Yeah, look at them.

1975
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,000
What are their reasons?

1976
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:45,040
See them?

1977
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,120
Good one.

1978
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:51,760
Good one.

1979
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,160
Got them.

1980
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,120
That'll show capitalism.

1981
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:56,960
Is epic.

1982
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:58,800
Endorse.

1983
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,440
It is epic.

1984
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,560
It is a little epic.

1985
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,280
I support it.

1986
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,560
Okay, next voicemail is just who chooses

1987
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,080
the episode titles and usually Eleazar.

1988
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,560
Usually Eleazar just picks them

1989
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,240
unless I say I want it to be called something else.

1990
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,440
But usually I don't do that.

1991
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,120
Yeah, Eleazar.

1992
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:23,360
Okay, next one is just called E,

1993
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,720
the lowercase letter E.

1994
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,560
It's uploading.

1995
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,200
Okay, there it is.

1996
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,760
Three, two, one, go.

1997
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,280
Eleazar always makes good thumbnails,

1998
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,280
but the last one let me down.

1999
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,400
Why isn't the thumbnail Ben Sainte with huge tits?

2000
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,640
We have that, don't we?

2001
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,160
Yeah.

2002
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,720
Don't we have Ben Sainte with huge tits

2003
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,400
taking the blue pill somewhere?

2004
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,520
Blue tits.

2005
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,000
Blue tits.

2006
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,720
Oh no, blueberry inflation.

2007
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,920
It's all coming full circle.

2008
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,640
One though.

2009
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,480
Right, because last week me and Gibb talked

2010
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,400
about how oppressed big booby women are

2011
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,560
and how they're all gate kept out of Hollywood.

2012
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,960
And there aren't enough leading women in Hollywood

2013
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,320
with huge knockers.

2014
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,600
It's true.

2015
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,800
It's fucked up.

2016
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:09,440
And so in solidarity, I've given myself huge tits.

2017
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,800
With enough synthetic plastic, we can fix that.

2018
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,080
Yeah, we can fix that.

2019
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,360
Even Ben Sainte can have huge tits.

2020
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,200
Technology sure is incredible.

2021
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,200
Even Ben Sainte.

2022
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,200
Even, even, yeah.

2023
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,120
The greatest technology of all, Ben Sainte.

2024
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:31,680
Next voicemail is called X5321GO.

2025
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:40,560
He is coming for you, Ben Sainte.

2026
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:42,960
Oh no.

2027
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,800
He's still coming.

2028
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:46,400
For me to see.

2029
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,160
You know, it's kind of, we haven't really

2030
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,760
shared that sort of information.

2031
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,520
You got big fills to shoot.

2032
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,040
We got another arc, baby.

2033
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,240
We got another character.

2034
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,200
We got some new characters in the voicemails.

2035
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,800
These are the people picking up them snakes mantle.

2036
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,720
Picking up the slack, yeah.

2037
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,760
Picking up the skin.

2038
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,080
Season 12 of the Ben Sainte arc.

2039
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:06,800
There's an arc.

2040
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,680
There's an arc here.

2041
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,360
This is, we're in the midst of it.

2042
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,480
We're at the top of it.

2043
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,680
We're hanging suspended in midair before the fall.

2044
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,600
The second half we come plummeting down to the ground.

2045
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,760
Next voicemail is another YouTube link.

2046
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,360
And it asks what to make of this at gmail.com.

2047
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:26,320
Oh, it's the same link.

2048
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,000
It's another one.

2049
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,720
The procrastinators podcast for two people.

2050
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,160
Okay, fair.

2051
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,800
Okay, fair.

2052
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,920
Big news.

2053
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,120
Tell you next week, maybe.

2054
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:37,680
I don't know.

2055
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,280
I don't think I'm going to watch it.

2056
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,480
It makes me a little uncomfortable.

2057
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,680
I'll tell you in the comment section.

2058
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,400
I'll tell you in the comment section what to make of it.

2059
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,840
I think it's funny and concept,

2060
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,480
but I don't know if I actually want to sit through it.

2061
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,600
Just for my personal comfort, Lamal.

2062
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,640
Next voicemail is called Talking Pirates in a Nutshell.

2063
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:01,920
Parentheses, it's good.

2064
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,440
It's good.

2065
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,600
It's good.

2066
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,080
All right, three, two, one, go.

2067
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:15,760
So, Jimbe bad, hockey bad, law bad.

2068
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:16,640
Yes.

2069
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:24,480
Oda make mistake, law bad, pre-timeskip, good.

2070
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,000
Yes.

2071
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,640
Booba.

2072
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:28,800
Booba.

2073
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,200
Booba.

2074
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,080
All good.

2075
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,560
Booba.

2076
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,600
New bad.

2077
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,120
But booba is eternal.

2078
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,240
Booba is timeless.

2079
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,400
I think I agree.

2080
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,760
I've seen that before and after.

2081
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:38,880
That sounds about right.

2082
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,480
I've seen the exaggeration of Oda's work with One Piece,

2083
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,200
and it's amazing how much every woman in that

2084
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,720
has just become more of a bimbo.

2085
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,240
That's good.

2086
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,520
One Piece is the real binification poll.

2087
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,000
These do sound like Nate's opinions,

2088
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,520
as far as I'm aware of them.

2089
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,040
So, I mean, it's just, yeah.

2090
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,080
Oh, I found it.

2091
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,600
It's like you never left.

2092
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,800
I found the picture of you with big boobs, Ben.

2093
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,440
I found it.

2094
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,400
Here you go.

2095
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,680
Oh boy.

2096
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,800
Oh, shit, nice.

2097
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,280
Oh, wow.

2098
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,640
Oh, yeah, I remember this one.

2099
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:11,360
Yeah.

2100
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:11,840
Yeah.

2101
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,000
Good shit.

2102
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,040
Good shit.

2103
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,120
Hey, I'm getting the beard back.

2104
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,560
Again, I'm getting beardy again.

2105
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,200
Those are some guitar pick-shaped boobs.

2106
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,920
Yeah, they're not big enough.

2107
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:26,000
That size would get me cast in Hollywood.

2108
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,360
I'll give them the weight and the sag desired.

2109
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,280
I'll make you a true busty boy, Ben,

2110
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,080
yet you'll see.

2111
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,520
Just make sure he's also still taking the pills.

2112
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:39,200
You know, but change the pills to something else.

2113
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,560
Just booby pills, maybe.

2114
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,040
It's a good change to make them blue.

2115
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,800
You gave me the pink hair.

2116
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,800
We need a rule 60 free, Ben saying, to be honest.

2117
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,000
You gave me pink hair, blue pills, tits.

2118
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,400
All I need is pronouns, and then I'd be good to go.

2119
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:56,960
Do you not already have pronouns?

2120
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,240
Oh, Simon drew this?

2121
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,360
Yeah, Simon drew this.

2122
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,480
I have, sorry, my pronoun game is just...

2123
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:09,920
I think Simon's still any old, but I default to she-they.

2124
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,600
Well, that's fine.

2125
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,200
I'm talking about me, though.

2126
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,680
Can we keep the focus on me, where it belongs?

2127
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,080
Thank you.

2128
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:16,240
No.

2129
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,040
I'm sorry.

2130
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,640
Next voice, they, yeah, yep, you are.

2131
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:28,080
Next voicemail is called My Favorite PCP Member.

2132
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,200
Three, two, one, go.

2133
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,080
You know, I was thinking about my favorite PCP member,

2134
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,080
and I went back to watch the old episodes,

2135
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,760
and it always used to be Digi, Best Guy Ever,

2136
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,840
and Jesse, and guys like them.

2137
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,760
Now, my favorites are obviously Tom, Ben Benzane,

2138
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,480
that you give, and honestly, fuck everybody else.

2139
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,000
Well, you gotta go back, watch those old episodes,

2140
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,720
just everyone else is a fucking idiot,

2141
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:04,480
and then there's Ben, Tom, and give the legends.

2142
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,200
So, you're saying your opinion has changed in hindsight,

2143
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,240
which is fair.

2144
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,280
Yes, clearly.

2145
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,080
I mean, I agree.

2146
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,080
I hate those fucking guys, and that's not true.

2147
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,520
Well, I hate Digi, obviously.

2148
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:23,360
Trixie, Beatrice, Blu-rays, even we Blu-rays.

2149
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,040
Trixie, Blue Horse, Blu-rays.

2150
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,880
Blue Pill?

2151
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,160
Blue Berries?

2152
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:35,360
Blue Berry, Violet Beauregard, Blu-rays, Blu-Pills.

2153
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,520
Time is a flat circle.

2154
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,440
Time is a flat circle, it's true.

2155
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,720
Time is a flat circle, it's true.

2156
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,440
Buy my fucking shit.

2157
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,280
Hey, buy a Blu-ray.

2158
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:52,640
While you're buying a Blu-ray, why not buy a copy of Rotoradcon?

2159
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,480
I got those, I got like 50 more of those.

2160
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,160
Please, please sell me out.

2161
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,800
I don't want 50 of them.

2162
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,840
I got mine.

2163
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:00,720
That's good to know.

2164
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,880
You know, I had kind of hoped to have the Radcon dogen ready by now too,

2165
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,800
so I could maybe have, I could sell it all.

2166
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,720
I will give like a bulk discount if you buy the dogen and the Rotoradcon,

2167
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:17,600
but the dogen has seen unforeseen delays whose nature I will not elaborate upon here.

2168
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,640
Because you're not a messy bitch.

2169
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,560
I do get angry about it.

2170
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,520
I do get upset.

2171
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:27,040
I do get upset in the, in some bonus content and some behind the scenes bonus content.

2172
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,600
I did, I did rave a little bit about it to Gibb last week,

2173
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,720
but that's whatever.

2174
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,240
That's not, that's not main show talk.

2175
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:36,640
Yeah.

2176
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,200
Anyway, what the fuck was I talking about?

2177
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:49,600
Oh, next episode is called Digimon Lecture 321 Go.

2178
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:55,120
On episode 274, Ben was floating the idea of doing a lecture on the real Digimon forums

2179
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,720
where most of it is stuff from the something awful third or from memory

2180
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,040
and Jack went, that sounds kind of bad lol.

2181
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,000
No, it doesn't.

2182
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,200
It sounds amazing.

2183
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,840
Who gives a single solitary shit about proof?

2184
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,240
All of the lectures are just people talking about their memory of the interesting topic at hand.

2185
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:10,800
That's not entirely true.

2186
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,520
There's been times in lectures where an audience member asked a question

2187
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,440
and the lecturer didn't know the answer.

2188
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:19,520
These aren't encyclopedic 100% accurate records of the topic at hand.

2189
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,280
They're engaging retellings.

2190
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,000
The real Digimon believers shit sounds great.

2191
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,640
Do it.

2192
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:25,760
Fuck the haters.

2193
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,440
The real, yeah, the real Digimon believers shit is, it was great.

2194
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,320
It was awesome.

2195
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,200
It's just that, I don't know.

2196
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,880
It's just that simply like not much of the record of it exists.

2197
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,760
And like, I'd be the, I can, all I can really do with the Digimon believer stuff at this point

2198
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:47,360
is explain what it was and then like, there's not, it doesn't really take that long to explain.

2199
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:48,880
Yeah.

2200
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,320
Take a page out of Trixie's book.

2201
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,360
Do the mini lectures.

2202
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,960
You can make a 10 minute video essay on it.

2203
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,160
Oh, the, the little, the little lecture.

2204
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,000
Yeah, that are just like small videos.

2205
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:04,080
About like, about like why like you should diagnose yourself with autism or whatever.

2206
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:05,200
Yeah.

2207
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,480
Okay.

2208
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:09,200
Yeah, just do one of those, but about something good.

2209
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,280
You know, you've been stealing all of Trixie's ideas and making them good.

2210
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,800
Why not just do it again?

2211
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:15,440
That's true.

2212
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:16,880
That's true.

2213
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,480
I hope she gets mad.

2214
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,600
I hope she gets upset about the, the Blu-rays.

2215
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,120
Ah, that'd be funny.

2216
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:24,160
That would be really funny.

2217
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:24,720
It would be.

2218
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,360
It would be funny.

2219
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,400
I could see her thinking that she could be like, oh, that's my intellectual property though,

2220
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,440
which would be very funny.

2221
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,120
I mean, I don't know if that'll happen.

2222
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,200
She's probably to check that.

2223
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:35,440
She'd have to get-

2224
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,080
She's probably to checked out to even, to even notice.

2225
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,400
Yeah.

2226
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,040
To do anything with that, she'd have to also get Jess on board.

2227
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,960
And I think, I don't know the guy.

2228
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,040
I feel like he just be happy it's all over.

2229
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,000
Like it's done.

2230
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,120
It's off his back.

2231
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,240
That's the impression I get too.

2232
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,360
I think Jesse would just not want to even have anything to do with it,

2233
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,760
which is what he has been doing for years.

2234
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:57,920
Okay.

2235
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,400
Next voicemail, it was, next, this is the last voicemail.

2236
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,120
Oh, fuck yeah.

2237
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,800
Well, it's a second long.

2238
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,520
Wait.

2239
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,160
Sorry, no.

2240
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,480
Anyway, listen, three, two, one, go.

2241
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:09,360
Formation in this.

2242
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,160
What?

2243
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:13,120
It's so quiet.

2244
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:13,760
It's very quiet.

2245
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,400
Formation boost, what the fuck does that even mean?

2246
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:16,720
I don't know.

2247
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,960
Well, there's a YouTube link attached to it.

2248
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,640
Oh, I knew it.

2249
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:23,360
I knew it.

2250
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:24,880
Yeah.

2251
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,360
I mentioned last week, I thought I said, I asked like,

2252
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,440
was there an endless just fuck football video?

2253
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,840
And I thought it was no, but yeah, I guess there was.

2254
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:32,080
Okay.

2255
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:32,960
I was right.

2256
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:33,600
I knew it.

2257
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,680
I knew it.

2258
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:37,680
Okay.

2259
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,040
Well, that's good to know.

2260
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,720
You weren't wrong after all, Ben.

2261
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,160
You weren't wrong after all.

2262
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,040
I was right.

2263
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,400
I do remember the, maybe COVID didn't shrink my brain that much

2264
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,120
after all.

2265
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:48,880
I remember stuff.

2266
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:50,400
I was wrong.

2267
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,640
There's one more voicemail, but here it is.

2268
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,120
It's three seconds long.

2269
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,800
It's called, in my opinion.

2270
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,120
Okay.

2271
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,280
Three, two, one, go.

2272
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,240
In my opinion, all pro and on should die.

2273
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,000
Yeah.

2274
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:06,720
Iceborg.

2275
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,080
Well, hello.

2276
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:08,480
Wow.

2277
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,080
Iceborg.

2278
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,400
Hard agree.

2279
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,960
Thoughts.

2280
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,440
Is the pro and on still occurring?

2281
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,800
Does that still exist?

2282
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,280
Yeah.

2283
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,280
We did a New Year's episode.

2284
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:24,880
It's mostly just a friend group where we hang out and vibe.

2285
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:27,200
Die.

2286
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,920
Die.

2287
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,480
Die.

2288
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,120
No.

2289
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:33,760
I mean, soon I'm going to be streaming Disco Elysium on the pro and on channel

2290
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,880
if you're interested in that.

2291
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,200
It's Pog.

2292
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,920
And there's also my Stardew streams.

2293
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,440
You're Stardew?

2294
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:41,680
Yeah.

2295
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:42,800
Stardew.

2296
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,560
I play as Garfield.

2297
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,400
I roll play as Garfield.

2298
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:54,240
I had a Stardew Valley game that I like complete.

2299
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,640
I was going to I was going to pave the entire world.

2300
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,480
That was my plan for Stardew Valley.

2301
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,160
By making like pavement tiles and just placing there.

2302
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:05,280
I paved a lot of it, but not enough.

2303
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:06,880
We go back to it then.

2304
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,000
It was pretty funny.

2305
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,280
You can always pick it back up.

2306
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,840
You know, I had a world where I like I it was like islands.

2307
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:19,120
Like my farm was like had like an island layout and I paved all the islands and I built bridges

2308
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:23,200
and I put like I had slime farms.

2309
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:28,800
I had slime slime hatcheries and I like I organized all the slimes by color on different

2310
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:34,960
little islands and I paved everything and it was all nice and nice and industrial look.

2311
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:40,800
It was spent like really long time because it's really tedious to do to make the the paved

2312
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:47,440
I think there's a shortcut now to like make a bunch of them at once, which is pretty base.

2313
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,360
Oh, that's pretty good.

2314
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,560
Yeah, I would have been helpful.

2315
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:56,000
I have a very little experience with Stardew, but I did play multiplayer once.

2316
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:03,120
Someone on Twitter, GabaNinja1 on Twitter just coincidentally added me and asked

2317
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,160
where's the announcement.

2318
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:07,920
I'm pretty sure they're talking about because I said I was going to announce

2319
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,080
the secret project on New Year's.

2320
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,880
The reason I haven't announced it on Twitter.

2321
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,880
I will have announced it by the time this episode comes out.

2322
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,800
The reason I haven't announced it on Twitter is because literally because I had COVID,

2323
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:26,080
I have not been able to go to Munchie's house and take a picture of myself holding

2324
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:30,320
the Blu-ray in my hand while it's like playing on the television.

2325
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:33,440
I want to take that picture and be like the Blu-ray is real.

2326
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:34,320
Here's what it looks like.

2327
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,200
It actually has like a menu system and stuff.

2328
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:41,680
I just need to get that picture and then I can announce it.

2329
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:45,600
And just because I'm still COVID positive, I have not been able to go over there and do that.

2330
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,320
So there's a reason why I put me behind schedule because I said I was going to

2331
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:53,520
announce it on New Year's, but I was set back slightly.

2332
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,080
2021.

2333
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,680
You wouldn't risk Munchie's home.

2334
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:04,320
No. I have to go to the printer and pick up the DVD sleeves, like the cover jacket.

2335
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,280
I have one.

2336
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:08,960
I have one box that has a sleeve that I'm going to use for the picture.

2337
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,480
And then I have 48.

2338
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,960
I have 50 more in a box that I need to pick up and put on the other 50 boxes

2339
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,120
because I made a batch of 50 of them.

2340
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,120
They are sitting in my closet.

2341
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,360
They have been quarantined from myself.

2342
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,120
I have not gone in my closet and fucked with them since I got COVID.

2343
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:29,600
Because I want to keep them uncontaminated.

2344
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,160
I'm pretty sure it's fine.

2345
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,120
Even if I had breathed on them, COVID doesn't live on surfaces forever.

2346
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,440
It dies after a few days, I think.

2347
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,840
So it would be fine anyway, but I'm trying to keep them away from myself just in case.

2348
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,680
Something like on plastics, it lasts three days and on cardboard,

2349
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:54,080
it lasts two days or one day or something.

2350
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:55,760
Okay.

2351
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,160
So it should be fine.

2352
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:01,120
Maybe I'll just wait a couple of days after my...

2353
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:05,360
I'll wait a couple of days after my I'm negative before I actually send any.

2354
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:08,560
Just be super, super safe.

2355
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:09,680
Spray some Windex on it.

2356
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,040
Yeah.

2357
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,920
I guess I could do that.

2358
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,040
Yeah, just a little bit of disinfecting.

2359
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:20,240
Spray it directly onto the surface of the disc.

2360
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:23,040
And then scour and scrub it really hard.

2361
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:23,600
Yeah.

2362
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,880
I'm just saying I'm absolutely sure it gets any contaminants off of there.

2363
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,080
Just leave the disinfectant on for like five minutes.

2364
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,280
That'll get rid of any like germs and stuff.

2365
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,040
And then you wipe it away and you're done.

2366
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,600
I gotta complain about this.

2367
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,920
It was so hard finding...

2368
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,280
It was easy to order Blu-ray discs that had a printable surface so that I could like print

2369
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,120
an image onto the disc.

2370
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:56,400
Getting discs like that was easy, but finding a way to actually print the image onto those discs

2371
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,320
was unbelievably hard.

2372
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:03,280
And I called like so many different printing services and like local print shops and was

2373
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,640
like, can you print on this disc?

2374
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:07,840
And they were all like, no, we won't do it.

2375
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,120
We simply won't do it.

2376
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:12,160
But you can buy a printer that does it.

2377
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,440
And ultimately this is what I had to do.

2378
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,000
I literally...

2379
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,720
Oh, I didn't buy it.

2380
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:18,400
I asked my parents if they would get me one as like a Christmas present and they were like,

2381
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,200
sure, whatever.

2382
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:25,200
So they got me a printer for Christmas that has a disc.

2383
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:26,080
It's a Canon printer.

2384
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,480
It's only like a $200 printer.

2385
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,680
Like it's not an incredibly expensive piece of equipment, but it has a tray that you can

2386
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,760
put a disc in and it will print on the disc.

2387
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,240
It's just a thing you can buy for not that much money on a home printer.

2388
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:41,520
And yet commercial printers, they just like, no, we can't do it.

2389
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,360
We simply don't have the technology.

2390
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,080
We just don't have a machine that does it.

2391
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:46,480
Sorry.

2392
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,320
I tried.

2393
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,040
I really tried.

2394
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,560
I didn't want to buy a whole printer over it, but I had to.

2395
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,080
I was like, okay.

2396
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,160
So that was my...

2397
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:00,800
This was like a month-long struggle that I went through trying to find a method of printing

2398
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,760
images onto discs when it worked out.

2399
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:03,920
Damn.

2400
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:07,840
That was by far the hardest part of the whole process.

2401
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,000
I got a Serbian guy named Slobodan to actually do the...

2402
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:13,680
To do the...

2403
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,720
Slobodan, that's great.

2404
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:19,840
Like the data, like to build the actual like DVD file and like menus and stuff.

2405
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,280
I got a guy on Fiverr to do it.

2406
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,280
Slobodan, he's my guy.

2407
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,560
Give me an incredible deal.

2408
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:29,120
Other people were asking for like $500 for this job.

2409
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,640
This guy was like, I'll do it for 100.

2410
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,440
He did it perfectly.

2411
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,840
He did it exactly what I could have wanted for.

2412
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,840
I was like, this guy saved me so much money.

2413
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,040
I tipped him 50%.

2414
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,120
Did you put him in the credits?

2415
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:42,720
Credit to Slobodan?

2416
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:43,920
No.

2417
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:46,480
No, I didn't.

2418
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:47,200
No, I didn't.

2419
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,280
I should have put it on the back.

2420
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,120
I should have put it on the back of the box.

2421
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:53,600
Label, I should have been like, uh, credits to Slobodan.

2422
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,800
Shout outs to Slobodan.

2423
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,520
Just pull paper inserts.

2424
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,720
Just a little piece of paper that says credits to Slobodan.

2425
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:02,560
It's, it's great.

2426
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:05,280
It's like you put, you put it in the fucking Blu-ray player.

2427
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,320
There's a menu screen and it plays the jingle by Sick Rick.

2428
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,680
The little, the like the background song for the season two, Plebe and the Weeb theme song.

2429
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:16,160
I added bonus features.

2430
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,680
There are bonus features, including a special message from Ben St.

2431
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:24,640
That's an exclusive, exclusive content on there.

2432
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,720
I went all out.

2433
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,440
I went all out.

2434
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:30,320
I think it's like the funniest fucking thing ever.

2435
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,240
I can't wait for people to have them.

2436
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,160
So I'm very, I'm very excited.

2437
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:37,440
I'm very excited about these.

2438
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:38,480
Yeah, you can tell.

2439
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,040
That's good.

2440
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,720
Anyway, I'm glad it's finally out.

2441
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:40,880
Yeah, sorry.

2442
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,800
And that other people don't know about it.

2443
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,080
Don't apologize.

2444
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:44,560
Stop that.

2445
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:45,760
Yeah.

2446
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,800
It's fine.

2447
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:47,600
You're fine.

2448
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:52,720
I got, yeah, the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray burner you bought me broke.

2449
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:53,440
I know.

2450
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,080
I was there when you were complaining and I couldn't get ahold of them.

2451
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,160
I was so mad.

2452
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,840
I burned, I burned one disc and then it fucking broke.

2453
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:08,000
And I was just like, but, so I had to, again, I got the, also, also as a Christmas present.

2454
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,400
I asked my, my parents, they were like, what do you want for Christmas?

2455
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,720
And I was like, well, I need a Blu-ray burner.

2456
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:15,120
And then later I knew it was like, also I need a printer.

2457
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:17,200
Ben, I told you I was just buying you a new one.

2458
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,400
I didn't want you to buy me another one.

2459
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,360
That, that sucks.

2460
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,160
It was only like a hundred bucks.

2461
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:24,320
Yeah.

2462
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,360
It was like 90.

2463
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:26,320
So whatever.

2464
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:30,400
I just got one, one disc, one disc and the thing fucking breaks.

2465
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,160
That thing is trash.

2466
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:32,960
That thing was so,

2467
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,840
has maybe made me really mad.

2468
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:38,800
This is a safe space.

2469
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:39,200
You can be mad.

2470
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:39,920
You can be mad.

2471
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,280
You can be mad here.

2472
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,160
Modern technology.

2473
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:47,520
There's fucking Chinese swindlers, the shysters that sold that thing.

2474
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,520
And they didn't even get, you should get a refund.

2475
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,800
You should get a refund on that thing.

2476
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:51,440
Oh, you want that?

2477
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,240
Just yell at them.

2478
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:55,360
Be like, hey, you, you sold the thing you sold me fucking broke.

2479
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:55,760
I'll kill you.

2480
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,320
Instantly.

2481
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,280
It like didn't work.

2482
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,360
I'll show up to your house and I'll kill you.

2483
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:02,320
Anyway, I have a question for you, Ben Singh.

2484
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:06,640
There seems to be rumors about the pro and on going on, like how we're dead.

2485
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:07,440
What's up with that?

2486
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,520
Wait, what?

2487
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,680
There's rumors about what?

2488
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,360
About us being dead.

2489
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,600
You like just ask, like, hey, are we even alive?

2490
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:19,280
Like, I keep hearing that people say we're dead.

2491
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,400
Haven't been paying attention.

2492
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,040
I just haven't heard anything about it in a while.

2493
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,200
I just haven't heard about it.

2494
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,000
Like I know that like you and Sean and Simon,

2495
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,120
is Simon a pro and on?

2496
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,160
He is, right?

2497
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,080
Simon's like dead.

2498
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,920
Simon's in our D&D game.

2499
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,240
Okay.

2500
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,600
Like I know, and like Dune Koon and like I know all these people,

2501
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,920
or no, she's not called Dune Koon anymore.

2502
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,360
She's, I don't know her name.

2503
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,720
She's, I know, I know.

2504
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:47,920
Every time I say anything about Dune, she gets embarrassed that,

2505
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,640
her YouTube is still doing Dune Koon.

2506
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:53,120
Actually, she's just got monetization on our YouTube channel.

2507
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:54,640
Nice.

2508
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:55,200
Oh, wow.

2509
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:58,160
I mean, I know you guys are still around.

2510
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:01,600
I just haven't heard anyone mention the pro and on cast in a while.

2511
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:02,800
So I don't know.

2512
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,200
Yeah, we just, we're just a friend group now.

2513
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:08,480
That's fair.

2514
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:11,680
Talking about the PCP, nearly tore our friendship apart.

2515
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,920
And we're like, we don't want to be that much like the PCP.

2516
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:14,720
Yeah.

2517
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,360
We don't want to.

2518
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:19,200
Being the procrastinators tore our friendship apart as well.

2519
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:20,880
Yeah.

2520
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:24,080
So we're like, let's just stop reviewing the PCP.

2521
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,320
Let's just make things when we have something to say.

2522
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:29,520
Don't want to go the way, you don't want to go the way of the PCP.

2523
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,160
You don't want to follow us over that, over that cliff.

2524
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:32,480
Yeah.

2525
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,960
So instead we just hang out.

2526
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:36,960
We play D&D.

2527
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,040
We play video games.

2528
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,520
We're going to be playing Magic soon, I hope.

2529
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,840
I'm trying to coerce them into playing Magic with me.

2530
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,720
It's going to be great.

2531
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,640
Yeah.

2532
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,680
We're just having fun.

2533
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:52,240
We're just a group of funny little guys having a good time.

2534
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:52,560
Yeah.

2535
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:53,840
Yeah.

2536
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,280
It's great to be a funny little guy.

2537
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:58,160
It's a great world to be a funny little guy.

2538
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,440
And we're just having fun.

2539
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,720
We're just having a good time.

2540
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,840
Well, what's up?

2541
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,040
Are we done?

2542
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,040
Do you want to wrap up?

2543
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,640
I guess so.

2544
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,200
I'm winding down mentally.

2545
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,160
I think we have a draw cast today, the Femboy episode.

2546
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,880
Yeah, we do.

2547
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,720
I have to go run and see my uncles.

2548
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,680
So I have like-

2549
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:23,760
Make a message gothic to see if she's still ready for that

2550
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,400
and then find out who the other artist is going to be on that one.

2551
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,000
Right.

2552
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,320
Yeah.

2553
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,360
Check out the draw cast.

2554
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,760
Hey, Daniel, spend more time with us.

2555
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,520
Then you want to spend more time with us.

2556
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,560
Trying for Femboy.

2557
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,760
Not today.

2558
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,480
Not today.

2559
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:37,120
I'm busy.

2560
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:37,600
I'm busy.

2561
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:43,920
I'm looking forward to another week of furiously typing away in GML

2562
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,880
to add features that nobody asked for and are not necessary.

2563
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,120
But they fill out the menu and they make the game ha ha funnier.

2564
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,560
We could have all drawn Ben St. with tits.

2565
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:57,440
It could have happened.

2566
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:57,680
Oh.

2567
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,680
I just want to be left alone.

2568
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:02,640
I just want to be left alone to my own devices to do that.

2569
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,680
You want Ben St. with tits, you say?

2570
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:07,360
Here.

2571
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:11,360
Here, let me give you up Ben St. with tits.

2572
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:12,960
We already got one.

2573
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:13,600
We already got one.

2574
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:16,960
Oh, no, this is a new one that I made while we were talking about it

2575
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,000
because I thought it'd be funny.

2576
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,880
Oh, no.

2577
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,120
Demand is sky high.

2578
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,640
Production is infinitely low.

2579
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:24,960
I just thought it'd be funny.

2580
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:25,680
You know what?

2581
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:27,200
It was funny.

2582
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:27,920
Let me get it.

2583
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:28,800
Wait.

2584
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,840
Okay, I was going to say I don't see anything.

2585
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:32,560
No, you don't.

2586
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,040
Get it.

2587
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:33,920
Because I haven't put it up yet.

2588
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:34,960
Because I forgot what you looked like.

2589
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,080
Don't stop. Get it, get it.

2590
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:38,320
It's all your captaincy in here.

2591
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:38,560
Oh.

2592
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,520
Oh, my God.

2593
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,760
Just constantly shoveling them into the mouth.

2594
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:44,800
Incredible.

2595
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,560
The boobs, these boobs are way better.

2596
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,920
These boobs are way better.

2597
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,840
Yeah, those are closer to ideal.

2598
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,040
They're chunkier.

2599
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,640
They're getting bigger by the moment.

2600
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:54,720
Yeah, closer to ideal.

2601
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,000
You're getting the Oda treatment.

2602
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,320
Closer, we're 5% better.

2603
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,440
You're being bimbified as we speak.

2604
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,640
You know, this is what we need.

2605
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:06,320
This is the prejudice that we face,

2606
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,480
that we big booby women face in Hollywood.

2607
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,800
Just because our breasts are big doesn't mean we're slutty.

2608
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:11,840
Doesn't mean we're bimbos.

2609
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,240
Doesn't mean we're not intelligent or talented.

2610
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:16,080
Doesn't mean we can't be leading ladies

2611
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,760
in major motion pictures.

2612
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,440
And it definitely doesn't mean that you can talk to me that way.

2613
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,120
You fucking scoundrel.

2614
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:25,600
It is a very, very real prejudice.

2615
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,360
I follow some very, very big breasted women on Twitter.

2616
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,760
And all of them have made poise at various points about,

2617
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,600
like, they can't ever wear a low-cut top

2618
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:38,960
or without, like, mothers covering their children's eyes

2619
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:39,920
when they walk past.

2620
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,160
Even if they just wear normal clothing,

2621
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,560
like, have to wear excessively baggy clothing

2622
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,240
that disguises their form.

2623
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:48,880
Otherwise, they'll get dirty looks from everyone.

2624
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,280
Like, oh, how dare you be out in public

2625
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,280
with your obscene body, that sort of thing.

2626
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,200
And I think that's really disgusting

2627
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,240
that people don't like that.

2628
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:59,040
Them saying shit like, how dare you come out there

2629
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:02,880
with that, that erotic body is like,

2630
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:03,920
that's porn dialogue.

2631
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:04,480
What the fuck?

2632
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:06,720
So lewd, so lewd.

2633
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:09,600
I know, like, oh, look at your obscene body.

2634
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,600
Like, that is porn dialogue.

2635
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,760
But like, that's actually how these people are being tweeted

2636
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:14,880
and it's not a good thing.

2637
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,880
It's, they're being judged.

2638
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,200
What they don't know is what they're saying

2639
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,240
is even more obscene.

2640
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,040
Exactly, they're falling into the trap.

2641
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,320
I see.

2642
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,640
We have to end the oppression of big booby women.

2643
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,520
By becoming big booby women.

2644
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:31,360
By becoming big booby women, it's true.

2645
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:35,120
We got a tran- transition.

2646
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,760
Bam, we're all big booby women now.

2647
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,080
All the gravestones have tits.

2648
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,840
That's the Anthony Fantano strategy.

2649
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,640
You're actually going to put tits on all the gravestones.

2650
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:45,520
That'd be fun.

2651
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:45,840
No.

2652
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,080
Just put them on my mind, that's fine.

2653
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,920
I already have too many ambitious ideas

2654
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,760
for how the episode's going to look visually.

2655
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,960
Yeah, this is why you had to stop being our editor,

2656
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:00,160
because you've worked too hard and you put too much effort in.

2657
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,200
And it was unsustainable.

2658
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:03,360
Oh, Ben, like over two weeks ago,

2659
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,800
when Eleazar told me who has gone away,

2660
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,160
I'm like, hold on, Eleazar.

2661
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:08,320
And I fucking created an After Effects template.

2662
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,440
I did some crazy shit.

2663
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,840
When you see this episode, when you see what it looks like,

2664
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,840
you're going to be like, oh, god, what the fuck did he do?

2665
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,840
You're going to be, the audience has already seen it.

2666
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,440
They've been watching this whole time.

2667
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,320
Yeah, I guess I probably will say that.

2668
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,840
That sounds about right.

2669
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,800
I saw you prepping.

2670
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,240
It's kind of insane.

2671
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:25,680
It's kind of just very funny.

2672
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,960
Okay, well, I can't wait.

2673
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,480
I can't wait to go back two hours into the past

2674
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:36,000
and start this episode and see what that looks like and be shocked.

2675
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:41,360
Eleazar, Eleazar, edit my reaction to what the episode looks like.

2676
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,840
Wait, no, no, I can't see it.

2677
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:44,400
Never mind.

2678
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,680
No, it's fine, it's fine.

2679
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,960
We haven't been called.

2680
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:48,320
I can't do that until after.

2681
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:50,160
Okay, all right.

2682
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:51,760
What does that mean?

2683
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,560
Do you have the technology?

2684
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:58,880
Well, that's going to, well, that'll be pretty fucking stupid, I guess.

2685
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:00,400
All right.

2686
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,760
Yeah, let's let's wrap it up.

2687
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,760
Let's let's let's put a little bow on it.

2688
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:06,240
Check out the draw casts.

2689
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,960
Check out OblivionFall, follow.

2690
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:14,400
Yeah, patreon.com slash oblivionfall, twitter at oblivionfall underscore d.

2691
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:17,360
Me and Dune are making a comic, so go read that maybe.

2692
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,880
Link in description, maybe.

2693
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,120
Where?

2694
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,440
Where ever we post it.

2695
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,320
Where ever we post it when it comes out, I'll send it to Oblivion and Oblivion

2696
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:27,280
can put it in the description.

2697
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:27,760
It's fine.

2698
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:33,440
No matter what, Eleazar is our friend and we will sneak the comic link in one of the

2699
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,840
episodes at the PCP somewhere.

2700
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:36,720
It'll be great.

2701
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,200
Okay.

2702
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:41,440
Oh yeah, you'll need to give me whatever template you use for the video descriptions these days.

2703
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,760
Oh god.

2704
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,200
Or I'll just copy it from a recent video and just figure it out.

2705
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:53,520
Yeah, that's what I will do is I will simply go to the latest episode and copy paste the

2706
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,120
description and then just give you that.

2707
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:57,280
Yeah, all right.

2708
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,720
If you want me to do that for you, I can't just do it.

2709
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:01,200
I can't.

2710
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Benny, Wanny, I did so hard.

2711
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,200
I can't do it by myself.

2712
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,200
I know, I know, I know.

2713
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:07,680
You're so useless.

2714
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:08,720
More porn dialogue.

2715
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:10,880
That's it.

2716
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,840
My boobs are too big.

2717
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:17,280
I can't reach the keyboard to control C.

2718
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:22,080
Everyone, everyone watching the episode, draw Ben with big boobs and you'll be featured on

2719
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,520
the next episode of the PCP.

2720
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:24,800
Yeah.

2721
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,240
Heck, heck, why not?

2722
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:29,600
And then I'll, and then I'll meticulous, all right, I'll draw me with big boobs and then I'll

2723
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:35,440
go up through every submission and I will meticulously critique, I will critique every

2724
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,480
boob drawing.

2725
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:40,320
I will, I will cruelly point out what I do and don't like about them.

2726
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:47,920
I will dehumanize them and pick them apart and, and objectify them for the sake of, I

2727
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,480
don't know, big booby liberation.

2728
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:53,360
I'm going to de-sexualize them.

2729
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,560
It's self-objectification.

2730
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,680
By overanalyzing.

2731
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2732
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,040
I'm going to, I'm going to dehumanize myself in solidarity.

2733
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:03,280
What a true ally.

2734
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,520
Solidarity with big booby women all over the world.

2735
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:06,880
Four eyes, plug your Twitter.

2736
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:07,360
You love you.

2737
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,760
Four eyes on a score of T.

2738
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:12,240
Underscore T.

2739
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:12,800
Nice.

2740
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:16,560
Yeah, underscore T, like an actual underscore, because I don't know if I'm, I don't know if

2741
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:17,920
I'm following you.

2742
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18,320
You should.

2743
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:19,040
You definitely not.

2744
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,360
I went through a Twitter purge at one point.

2745
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,000
Four eyes.

2746
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,240
Oh yeah, underscore T.

2747
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:24,960
I will give you a file.

2748
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,160
I don't, I don't follow you.

2749
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:28,080
I follow the other four eyes, but you know what?

2750
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:30,080
I got a, well, there we go.

2751
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,800
Give you follow.

2752
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:31,200
Hell yeah.

2753
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,160
Thank you very much.

2754
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,760
Now you're going to see lots of titties.

2755
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:34,880
Okay.

2756
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,760
Just remember to retweet that smaller artist then.

2757
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:39,040
Oh yeah.

2758
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:39,360
Wait.

2759
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,120
Four eyes is bigger than me.

2760
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,720
Four eyes has more Twitter followers than I do.

2761
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,200
Oh snap.

2762
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,840
Never retweet that smaller artist, Four Eyes.

2763
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,840
So he'd better retweet me actually.

2764
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:51,440
Yeah.

2765
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:51,840
Uh-oh.

2766
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,160
I've never been in this position before.

2767
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:54,640
Whoops.

2768
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:55,280
You've been caught in it.

2769
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:58,080
How do I, how do I, how do I walk away?

2770
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:01,280
Too late.

2771
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,320
One foot behind the other.

2772
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:02,960
Oh no.

2773
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,200
Yeah.

2774
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:04,880
Okay.

2775
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,360
Anything else, anything else before we wrap?

2776
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:11,760
Uh, twitter.com forward slash cicada underscore God.

2777
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,000
No matter what, there I will pin the comic.

2778
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,080
If you want to read it, it'll be a comic.

2779
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:19,200
Hopefully it'll be good.

2780
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:22,960
My goal is to one day destroy Ben St.

2781
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:25,920
So if you want to support me in destroying Ben St.

2782
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,640
By making comics more regularly than him.

2783
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:29,440
And then laughing.

2784
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,280

You guys like Ben.

Right, right, right.

2804
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:03,760
A whole, a whole mass grave of voicemail characters.

2805
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:04,560
That's why we are.

2806
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:07,200
This is a good thing that PCP is a graveyard.

2807
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,720
We can just, we can just like add them.

2808
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,880
Like to add like gravestones for them as the episode goes on.

02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:11,120
Yeah.

2810
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:12,400
Oh, hell yeah.

2811
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,080
This episode was a voicemail Holocaust.

2812
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,000
This episode was a voicemail Holocaust.

2813
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:17,920
A voicemail Holocaust.

2814
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:19,200
So I would describe it.

2815
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:19,920
Oh, no.
