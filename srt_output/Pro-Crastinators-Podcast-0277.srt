1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is this the new duo, Sickly and Hammered?

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I think it might be the North Korean one is the Sickly and Hammer, and also the Brush.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If Tom shows up, he can be brrrrbrushed.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He can be brushing us off, because he's not on TV.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He responded when I said earlier that I was going to be late. I assumed he would be back, but I guess it's only been a little while.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The reason I'm on Kazzy's account is because I am at their house, Kazzy's and Munchy's house.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I was going to go back to my house to record, but I have a whole situation.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I feel like I should wait until we actually start the PCP proper to explain it.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, get your recording going.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's sync, I guess.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
On the count of three, one, two, three, sync.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
One, two, three, sync.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, no, I started my audacity, and it's still going, so that's convenient.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, I guess this is probably several minutes into the episode now, but welcome to another episode of the Pro Crastinators podcast.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's me, Ben St, and Gibbon Take, and Tom might show up.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We're starting early, fuck it.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We won't penalize them.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We won't penalize them for us starting early.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If I early, I mean late, because I said I wouldn't.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, as I was saying, so the reason why I'm late and I'm on Kazzy's account is because I have a whole moving out roommate situation, right?

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm moving out of my place and into the semi-permanent place that I have for a year in two days.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My roommate, my temporary roommate has already moved out.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That guy left so much trash just all over the kitchen and all over the floor.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He was just like, I'm leaving, fuck it.

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So he just did.

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And like, okay, I guess I'm just, I'll just live in a trash house for a while.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's fine.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But he also took, and I guess I can't really fault him for this, he took the, his Wi-Fi router with him.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I have no Wi-Fi at my house.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So if I were to go home and record there, I would have to use my phone as a hotspot, which would cost me a lot in data.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So I'm just doing it here at the Munch House.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Munch House, Baron Munch, Munchhousen.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So you're currently, well, you would be in the new apartment, but there's no Wi-Fi?

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, the old apartment.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Or like the one month temp apartment.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, yes.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The interim one month apartment is the place where...

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So the other guy took his, okay.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, he left early.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He left like a week early and he took his Wi-Fi with him.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I'm stuck.

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I got none.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, wow.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This computer has recording space for 228 hours on it.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's luxurious.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You think of the podcasts that could be recorded.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We should, we should just record the rest of the year's worth of episodes right now and just make a, make a buffer.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, we'll make a prediction.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay. What's the news?

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Not that we were ever news centric before, but we'll just predict news from the future.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
December, December 20th, 2021.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
North Korea dissolved by the, by unanimously dissolved by the UN invaded by NATO.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I thought you meant dissolved like they got a big bunch of acid and they poured it all over it.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah. Well, that too.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, that, that also.

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, it'll be, it'll be broken up into little tiny pieces and the pieces will be given as gifts to whoever lives in there.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I assume South Korea is next to his neighbors.

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you think King Jong-un would like dissolve if you poured salt, salt all over him?

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, because are you implying he's a snail?

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's a slug.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's fighting commentary.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah.

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, you know, actually I'm apologized to like slug fans out there.

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Apologize to all the North Koreans listening.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm just thinking of that dissolve made me think of that scene in the bugs life movie where the snail, the snail was served something with salt on it and his mouth starts dissolving.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's like, hey, I said no salt and he's dying and just cuts away.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He starts like bubbling.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That was very scary.

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He starts like, he starts like bubbling out of his mouth. Yeah.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, I said no salt.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And because of that, well, I didn't find it scary the first time because I'm a movie, whatever.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I didn't know.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But then as a stupid kid, I was like, oh, it's a slug.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What if I put salt on it?

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It was, it was devastating.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I felt so bad.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So that's siren, by the way.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
A little bit.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So you wait, did you try putting salt on the slide?

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I put salt on a real slug and it sort of, it was a guest grotesque.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm trying to remember exactly what it was like, but it sort of like ballooned out and then burst a little bit.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like, oh God, what have I done?

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This isn't just fucking around in the fucking yard anymore.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This isn't just kicking over an hills.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is serious.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This isn't like pouring like molten mercury into a fucking molten mercury wouldn't even be hot.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Molten lead into like an ant hill and like casting a mold.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is serious sin territory we ventured into.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is spitting in right in God's eye.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Bug fighters.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Slugs aren't even bugs when you get, when you get right down to it.

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Anything small as a bug.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I saw, I saw an enormous, well, it was, I mean, it was a praying mantis, which is a pretty big bug.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I saw a praying mantis last night we were walking around at night going to like 7-Eleven and a big old praying mantis.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like, I think it jumped off like a telephone pole and it like fluttered under the, under like the wheel of a car.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then I'm like, I thought it was a bird at first because it's like wings were so big it almost like look bird size in the, in the darkness.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I was like, well, what was that? I think it was a huge bug.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I went and I looked at the wheel and it like crawled out from under the wheel well and like crawled up the side of the car and we were like, wow, bug.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That do be feeling when you get the bug big.

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If only this were Animal Crossing, I could have made like several thousand bells from this discovery, but alas, it was worthless.

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, you know what I did yesterday? I did something cool. I did something I've never done before.

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm saying it's your mother. I hope not distracting you from the broadcast zone.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You gotta clean up your toys and sit in the living room.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Who's this? Who's that?

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're talking truck and you're fishing price. It's your mother. You gotta go to church tomorrow.

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We'll be talking right here.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That was, uh, no one.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, it sounded like someone.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, no, it wasn't who you're thinking it is.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Of course it wasn't. Yes, it was.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We're playing.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Write that down. Munchies on this episode of the progress. They put in the title. Everyone will come back.

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Eleazar, you better put a little munchie on the, you better put a little munchie on the, on the tombstone there and have it blink a little bit. You better do it.

116
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:58,600
Oh yeah, right, so the reason I'm here I was out of the houses because I did the big, I did like a convention.

117
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,000
Yesterday I tabled at a convention.

118
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Good. Yeah, I did the, which I've never done before.

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It wasn't like a real, that was pretty much a real thing. It was um, they have like every year, they used to do.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,860
for the m-m-m-m-m-.. Wait, Massachusetts Institute of Something or Other.

121
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,660
No, Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo. I went two years ago and like I met, I met

122
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,480
Abbey Howard and then I lost my phone so I lost the picture that I got together with

123
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,200
Abbey Howard so that's depressing. Abbey Howard was not there. There weren't as many,

124
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,440
it wasn't like as big an event.

125
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,460
I saw it on Twitter, the Chuck and Smirk went, you know, that guy, that cool guy with the

126
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,840
the comics that are funny.

127
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:52,640
I saw him tweet that he was like a tweet that implied he was going to go, but I mean, I'm

128
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,780
not a I don't know what he I don't know what he looks like.

129
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,480
So I might have like not even noticed.

130
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Well, he draws himself all the time.

131
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
He's got the light little horns.

132
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh, yeah, I didn't see anyone with little horns.

133
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:13,400
So unfortunately, um, yeah, so he might have been there and I just, I don't know.

134
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,920
I don't I don't think he was tabling.

135
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,640
I looked over the attendee list and I didn't see anyone named Beanie Tuesday.

136
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,040
Um, shit, maybe he was there, but he was like listed under his real name and I just

137
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,280
didn't know it's possible.

138
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,400
Maybe he was like the weirdo next to me.

139
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:40,240
Uh, I was, uh, uh, yeah, so I did the it was so this year they did mini mice.

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
They called it.

141
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,040
And it was like an outdoor thing.

142
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,760
And it happened to be in what was essentially a parking lot, but it was like a parking lot

143
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,280
that it had these like temporary like walls sort of built around it.

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,480
Um, so it was kind of, it was kind of nice and enclosed.

145
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,800
It was, it was literally like right in front of the, the mural from problem sleuth, the

146
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,080
ethnic cheer mural that he has in his office on Twitter that that's, that's a real thing.

147
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Yeah.

148
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,720
And I, I was there.

149
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,480
Um, did you get a picture of you next to it?

150
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Yes.

151
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,480
We took a group photo, me and, uh, me and, uh, and, uh, Kazi and Munchie and, and crack,

152
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:33,040
uh, and some other unimportant people, uh, uh, Jones was there, uh, if you know, Jones,

153
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,520
um, uh, yes, as can, um, so, so yeah, we got, we got a picture in front of the, of the

154
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,120
mural, uh, and I did, I did the, I sold, I sold comics and I sold RFC K pins and I

155
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,800
got to, I had to do, I sat there for four hours and I had to like pitch my shit over

156
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
and over again.

157
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
I was, I was amazed that like, like I actually sold stuff.

158
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,920
People actually came up to my booth having never like heard of me and just were like,

159
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
what's this?

160
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,960
And I was like, this is the vapors.

161
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
It's a story.

162
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,480
It's a comic that I made law and here's my, uh, here's, here's, and then I had to explain,

163
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,520
I had to explain what endless war is.

164
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,440
Like when, as I'm explaining the, the, the, my, my pitch for the vapors was it's a comic

165
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,240
that I made along with some guest artists.

166
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
It's a series of vignettes about awkward college kids embarrassing themselves.

167
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,800
That's what I said and it would usually get a little chuckle.

168
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,920
So I think that was, that worked.

169
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,000
And then, uh, the RFC K stuff, I was like, this is based on a game that me and some of

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,680
these guys make cause, cause Munchy and Crack just happened to both be there.

171
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,200
And they're like, this is based on a game that we made.

172
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,760
It's an end, it's a text-based MMORPG.

173
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,440
It's, it's, uh, in the, in the game you play as a juvenile delinquent who must join a gang

174
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,160
who in a, in a city of slime, you got to join a gang and you got to get slime.

175
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,320
Uh, people really liked that.

176
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,360
A lot of people were like, what, tell me more about this endless war thing.

177
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,400
Like you made a game in discord.

178
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,960
Wait, are you saying an entirely free tech space MMORPG playable entirely in a discord

179
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
server?

180
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,360
And I said, yes.

181
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Wow.

182
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Yes.

183
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
I am.

184
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,480
And here's a button of red man's face from the game.

185
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,760
I had to, sometimes it was a kid and I had to tastefully avoid like saying what the gangs,

186
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,560
the gang names are one.

187
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Okay.

188
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,240
One, a little girl came up to with, with her mom, I think, I think it was her mom, a little

189
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,360
girl came up and like picked up the slime corp logo and was like, is this the Illuminati?

190
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,160
And it was like, kind of, and she bought it.

191
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,440
She bought a slime, she bought slime corp.

192
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,580
Uh, what, I sold, I sold a, I sold a bunch of nega slime, the Lord of ghosts and the

193
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,460
nega slime, that one, like, that one in pizza Chan, actually, were the ones that I sold

194
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,340
the most of, I sold a cup, I think I sold one or two, I think I sold one rowdy pin,

195
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:12,820
rowdy fuckers pin, uh, uh, oh, two, these two kids, these boys, like, ran up and like,

196
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,860
they picked up slime coin and they were like, oh, I want this, oh, I want that.

197
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,940
And the dad was like, okay, and he just bought kids to slime coin, like, yeah, the big like

198
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,460
medallion thing, that's cool, I mean, it looks great.

199
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,660
It does look great.

200
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,820
I think they were the only ones to get one of those, but, uh, yeah, I actually, I made,

201
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,460
and I sold them, I didn't think I was going to sell like anything, um, because I mean,

202
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,140
you know, it's just some like, it's just some local fucking con, just for nerds, basically,

203
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,860
and no one's like, heard of me, uh, but no, like, I brought a dozen, I brought a dozen

204
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,940
copies each of Vapors One and Vapors Two, and I didn't sell out, but I like, I almost,

205
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,540
I like mostly sold all of them.

206
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:03,580
I think I made, I made like $350, just like, just selling, it was $10 for, I sold the Vapors

207
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,580
for $10 a piece, I offered a bin, this was crack suggestion, that I offered a bargain

208
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,100
bundle, $15 for both, and most people that I offered that to were like, yes, sure, why

209
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,060
not, and I sold the pins and the patches for $5 and the coins were $10.

210
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:25,620
Yeah, I made like $350, which was, I was expecting to make like 20.

211
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:33,900
You know, I had, I had, um, I think I had, there were, there were a few names there that

212
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:40,740
were like kind of big, what was the one, there was a guy like a cross for me, his name started

213
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,900
with an, his name started with an E.

214
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,740
He was, he was kind of legit, he probably, I didn't really look at his stuff, but most

215
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,500
of the other tables that I saw were small, they were small timers, and they mostly had

216
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,660
like zines, like most of their comics were not as, were not like, you know, perfect bound

217
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,020
and like a, you know, printed by like a real printer like mine was.

218
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,780
So I think I had like fairly upscaled merchandise for the venue.

219
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,660
So I didn't feel like other places were charging like $5 or less for their comics, but they

220
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,660
were mostly like much smaller and like not as like professional looking.

221
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,900
So I feel like, I feel like $10 was like a fair asking price.

222
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,380
People seem like, people seem like impressed to like the comics were like as, as big as

223
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
they were.

224
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
I don't know.

225
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,940
Everyone else and dog shit.

226
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Everyone else bullshit.

227
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
I was, I was king.

228
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:40,100
I mean, what's the printing cursed of like the Vapra's one, um, uh, it was like, I think

229
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:47,500
because I got like a bulk order of 500, I think it cost maybe like 250 to print a piece

230
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,260
and then it was some more to ship.

231
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,920
So it probably came out to maybe like 350 to get them made.

232
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
So you know, yeah.

233
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,620
So like that's upfront costs, but it was paid for by Kickstarter.

234
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,780
I guess if, if you, if you don't have like a Kickstarter campaign and you're just like

235
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,420
investing money into your comic, you don't want to go too high.

236
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,980
Yeah.

237
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,500
Just, just, just like printing them and getting them shipped to me.

238
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,180
I think was like 1800 or something.

239
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,580
So, you know, and then it was, and then like crazy.

240
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,540
Yeah.

241
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,660
And then it was like envelopes and, but you know, doing the 500, the print of the

242
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,060
run of 500 saved money per copy.

243
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,940
So it, uh, it raised my, uh, what do you call it?

244
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:38,340
My, my profit margins, you know, assuming you, assuming you move product in bulk, I'm

245
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,860
like almost, I'm almost out of Vapors one.

246
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,100
I literally have like 10 copies of it left, like period.

247
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,860
So if I, if I were going to do another con or something, I would actually have to

248
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,140
like get more printed because I'm out.

249
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,260
I just don't have any more.

250
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,500
Um, actually sneakily, I had some, I had some Vapors one copy because I, we did,

251
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,860
when I did the Kickstarter, I did the, the, the stretch goal to like get the card

252
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,420
stock cover.

253
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,420
I had a few printed that didn't have the card stock cover and I didn't give those

254
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,940
to people that bought online because I said I was going to have the card stock

255
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,420
cover, but at the, at the con, I brought the ones that didn't have the card stock

256
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,700
cover because I don't feel bad about selling those there because the person

257
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,100
is like, actually, like if they're seeing it and they're seeing exactly what

258
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,660
they're getting.

259
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,220
So I didn't feel bad about selling those, even though they didn't quite match the

260
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,060
Vapors two, because the Vapors two had the card stock cover and Vapors one didn't,

261
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,740
but nobody, nobody seemed to mind.

262
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Uh, yeah.

263
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,020
So it was pretty good.

264
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,740
It flew by.

265
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,540
I thought it was, I thought it was going to be boring and I thought I was going

266
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,900
to be sitting like by myself with no one, like looking at the tape.

267
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,260
I thought there was going to be long stretches where I just be sitting like,

268
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,820
like twiddling my thumbs.

269
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,980
But no, people like were coming up to me like constantly.

270
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,140
People were coming up to my table.

271
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,180
They, you know, there was just like a flow of people just circling around the

272
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,620
whole place and they would just stop at every table and hear like the

273
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:05,980
pitch.

274
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,300
Yeah.

275
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,580
I mean, I'm thinking, like imagining, like if it's a mini convention, a

276
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,420
single person could probably see everything.

277
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:14,740
Right.

278
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,500
If it's just like a parking lot size.

279
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,260
Yeah.

280
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,460
They were probably like instead of like a gigantic convention where your

281
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,380
position may determine whether people ever see you.

282
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,300
Yeah.

283
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,060
That, um, at the old mice, the one that was inside of, um, I think it was one of

284
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,660
like some Tufts campus.

285
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,180
It was something like a university building near importer square.

286
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,140
Um, there was, it was like two floors and there would be like the, the, the

287
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,740
ground floor level and you would walk around and there were tables and then

288
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,820
you would go down and you would go down hallways and in the rooms, in the

289
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,540
hallways, there would be like a big room full of tables and then you would go

290
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,100
downstairs to like a basement floor.

291
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,580
And then that was just one, one big like room with like tables all around.

292
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,820
So yeah, there were definitely a lot more, uh, uh, vendors at the old one.

293
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,140
I guess that, I guess that's why they called it mini mice.

294
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,100
But, um, yeah, I didn't have to pay anything to table.

295
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,820
I literally just sent them an email.

296
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,540
They were like, we're open for applications.

297
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,900
And I just sent them an email and they had, they said, like attach your

298
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,140
comics to the email and I did.

299
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,380
And they were like, okay, you have a table and congratulations.

300
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,620
I would like to do such a thing.

301
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,460
It was fun.

302
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,380
It was more, it was better than I expected.

303
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,500
I thought it was going to be kind of a nightmare.

304
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,540
I thought it would probably be a hassle and I wouldn't sell anything, but no.

305
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,380
All it was, it was good.

306
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,820
I was glad that like Kazzy and Munchy and Crack Hall came and hung out, although

307
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,220
I was honestly like so busy, like giving my pitch over and over again.

308
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,900
Like I didn't even like get to talk to them that much, but like it was okay.

309
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,980
They, uh, they, uh, they were, uh, I think, I think they had a good time.

310
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,220
Oh, I have a funny story.

311
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,900
There was, there was the, the lady next to me, lady next to me was like,

312
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,620
we were, we were setting up and this, this, she, she asked, um, the person,

313
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,620
not me, but the person on her other side, she was like, hi, I'm Liz.

314
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
What's your name?

315
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,860
And the person said the name and they were like, okay, what are your pronouns?

316
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,860
So they just, they just, they just, they just, they just, they just, they just,

317
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,820
it was like, she, her, and he's like, okay, I'm any, all, any, all for me.

318
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,820
And then she turned to me and she said, what are your pronouns?

319
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,220
And I laughed and I hope it didn't, I laughed because she asked me my pronouns

320
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,700
before she asked me my name and I didn't mean to, I hope I didn't, but when I

321
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,460
say it out loud, I hope I didn't come off as like a, ha, ha, you asked me my

322
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,500
pronouns, you idiot.

323
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,340
I just thought it was funny that that was the order, but she didn't seem

324
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,900
offended, so that's good.

325
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,260
Uh, uh, they gave me stickers.

326
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,820
They gave me pronoun stickers too.

327
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,460
I put it on my badge and it was very helpful.

328
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,980
If only Beanie Tuesday had been there.

329
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,220
He's, he's the, he's a heterosexual icon.

330
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,780
He would have, he would have had all the he, him stickers made us all proud.

331
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,380
Uh, yeah.

332
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,420
Now, if Beanie Tuesday was there and I didn't see him, I'm going to be so,

333
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,220
I'll be upset.

334
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,020
I want to, I want to, I want to pat him on the back.

335
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:36,820
Maybe he, maybe he was, maybe he was that person next to me and I didn't even

336
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,540
know how would I even know?

337
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,780
Now I'm so, now I'm curious, does anyone, does anyone know what he looks like?

338
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,020
If Beanie Tuesday was there like tabling, you would have been able to see, did

339
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,740
you get a chance to go check out other people's stuff?

340
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,380
Only a little bit.

341
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,940
No, I didn't really like go around and like look at everyone's other

342
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,340
booths cause I was just, I was busy at mine.

343
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,740
Uh, so he, it is conceivable that maybe there was some table that he was at.

344
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,300
And I just didn't look at it.

345
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,580
Wait a shit.

346
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,620
Now I, now I'm like, oh wait, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

347
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Now I gotta go to Twitter, and I gotta go to BeanieTuesday.

348
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,620
BeanieTuesday, chalk and smirk.

349
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,620
Let's see, did he post anything about that?

350
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,620
No.

351
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,620
Didn't he?

352
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,620
In fact, he has a picture of you, and he's like, ah, look at this idiot.

353
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
No.

354
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
He says, yeah, yeah, this is what I saw.

355
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,620
He posted that this is how I'm showing up at MassMice tomorrow.

356
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Pro cod player walks into GameStop, expects to get notice, and no one cares.

357
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:58,620
So that definitely implies he was there to table, but he didn't expect much of anything.

358
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
It's done in response.

359
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,620
I think it could mean that he was just going to visit.

360
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,620
I don't think it necessarily implies that he was tabling.

361
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,620
Oh, no, he said he got a reply.

362
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Oh, actually, this is another guy.

363
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,620
This is funny.

364
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,620
I see this reply from SnacksYumski.

365
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,620
He says, I didn't know you were tabling at mice, and Chalkin says, I'm not.

366
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,620
So no, he was just going to look or whatever.

367
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
Okay, he was just an attendee.

368
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,620
So I might have talked to him and not even know.

369
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
That's depressing.

370
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:39,620
It just so happens that this guy SnacksYumski, I met this guy SnacksYumski.

371
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:50,620
Munchy shouted at him on the way to meet me at the place because he was wearing a shirt that Munchy liked.

372
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,620
He was like, hey, you, I like your complicated shirt.

373
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,620
And he was like, okay, cool.

374
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,620
And then we met again at the place.

375
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:09,620
I mean, because he had these cards, he had these business cards that had a little green pyramid with an eye on it and looked like Endless War.

376
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,620
He did some kind of like a radio drama that had this little Illuminati symbol as its logo.

377
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,620
And we were like, oh, we have a green triangle with an eye on it too.

378
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:27,620
So I just happened to know who this guy is who made the reply that Chalkin, Smirk replied to and said, I'm not tabling.

379
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,620
So that's funny.

380
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,620
And then just by coincidence, that guy left.

381
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
This is just weird.

382
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,620
That guy left and then we stayed for a while longer.

383
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:46,620
And then when it was over, we packed our stuff up and we were leaving and we got on the bus and we were going back to this house.

384
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,620
And like when we were almost here, we just saw that guy again just sitting on through the bus window.

385
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
We just passed him sitting on a bench.

386
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,620
We were like, oh my God, it's that same guy.

387
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
What the fuck?

388
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:06,620
There's only one person other than you and Munchy and Kazi and the others.

389
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,620
There's just one guy going around buying everything.

390
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,620
Listen, I don't think it's just because it was in a completely different place.

391
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,620
It was just like, it wasn't like he was just was still outside.

392
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,620
He had left the venue and gone somewhere entirely other.

393
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
And there he was.

394
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Oh my God.

395
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
I mean, it's the same city.

396
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
How far away was it?

397
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,620
It's a big city, Gib.

398
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:43,620
It's likely, I'm talking about when we saw that guy on the bench.

399
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,620
Kazi's making a face at me.

400
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
I can't hear them.

401
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
Max.

402
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,620
It didn't finish the sentence.

403
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
It's a big city, Gib.

404
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,620
It's not, you don't just, it's not some couple.

405
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,620
You don't just escalation point go to and it instantly travels.

406
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,620
And there's like only two other people in the district with you and you're all fishing together.

407
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
No, it's a big city.

408
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,620
It's not some hamlet where everybody knows each other.

409
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,620
This isn't Cheers, whatever.

410
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,620
Wacky stuff.

411
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
Well, that's my whole week.

412
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
That's all I did this week.

413
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
I've got nothing else to say.

414
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
That's pretty cool though. It's more than I did.

415
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,620
I did, I made $350.

416
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
I'm amazed.

417
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
I'm blown away.

418
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
I literally thought I was going to sell like two copies.

419
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:47,620
I was going to sell two pity copies.

420
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:57,620
But yeah, I guess I had a bit of a moment this week or I had a continual moment that started.

421
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:05,620
It's an ending moment of bad feelings.

422
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
I don't want to talk about the bad feelings too much.

423
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:15,620
I do want to talk about that one moment I had where I felt okay for a little bit and it was cool.

424
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:22,620
I went outside and I went for a walk because the sun was setting and I felt like I had wasted my entire day being inside.

425
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,620
It was like, ah, that was a lovely day.

426
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,620
I just watched leave.

427
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:33,620
I just watched it go and I was like, no, even if it's cold, even if it gets dark really soon, I got to do something.

428
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
Otherwise, I'm just going to jump off a bridge.

429
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,620
So I got to go out there and it went out and I didn't bring my phone.

430
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,620
And I couldn't take pictures of all the cool nice things I was looking at.

431
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
So I had to just look at them instead.

432
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,620
That was way better, I realize.

433
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,620
The process of getting your phone out when you see like, oh, it's a baby duck.

434
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
Get your phone out.

435
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:05,620
Try and get a good shot of the baby duck and you fail to get a good shot because it's kind of dark.

436
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Well, whatever.

437
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:15,620
The moment is soured because of the failure to get a picture, but if you don't even have a phone, you can just appreciate the little baby duck that you saw.

438
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,620
And that's how I was feeling.

439
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
I was walking around.

440
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
I saw a baby duck.

441
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,620
I saw the sky was blue and then it was turning the colors, you know, how sunsets work.

442
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
And it was twilight hour.

443
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
It was like that exact time of day.

444
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Everybody was sort of leaving the park.

445
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
My little pony.

446
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Yeah, from my little pony.

447
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,620
I've heard about this.

448
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:46,620
And it was, I stood in a big old field and I heard the wind rustle through the trees.

449
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,620
And it was hardly anyone around.

450
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,620
It was getting dark and it just sort of felt great.

451
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Well, you know what?

452
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
It felt great in retrospect.

453
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I think I was so depressed at the time I could barely feel anything.

454
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:06,620
It was just sort of like, you know, when you're like sad and you're like, okay, I got to do something to cheer myself up and you do something.

455
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Or like you just sort of exist.

456
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,620
You stare into nothingness and you're like, well, I don't feel bad or I don't feel good.

457
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
I don't feel much of anything.

458
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,620
But I'm sure I'm going to stand here for at least 40 minutes and I did.

459
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Okay.

460
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,620
So, and then did you feel better afterwards?

461
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,620
I don't know.

462
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,620
It was weird.

463
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,620
I appreciated existing in the moment, I guess.

464
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I like the memory.

465
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,620
Sure.

466
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:50,620
But yeah, the rest of the month or week or whatever has just been a lot of existential thoughts.

467
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:58,620
More specifically, I don't think there's any reason to do anything.

468
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,620
I can't logically argue for doing anything, nor can I emotionally argue for it.

469
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,620
And I've been trying to think of ways to kickstart myself into thinking that I should probably do anything.

470
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,620
But it's like, nah, I don't know.

471
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:26,620
I saw your post, your Patreon post about the like, why do anything, Money Spenders podcast, but I haven't listened to it yet.

472
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,620
It's only a little, it's not a Money Spenders podcast.

473
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:38,620
It's an into the void, like thought dump that I do occasionally, which are sort of unedited off the cuff thoughts.

474
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:51,620
But maybe it would be interesting, but usually I was just sort of like, I wanted to write like a video essay about why do anything?

475
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Because I was watching video essays and I'm like, that's cool how they can like take a thing and explain it.

476
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
And I can hear it.

477
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,620
And I wanted that.

478
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,620
But I guess I had to make it and then I had to think, how do I do that?

479
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,620
And then I realized that the question is kind of flawed.

480
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
I don't know.

481
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,620
It's hard to explain because I failed to figure out how to explain it.

482
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
And so I'm just like, ah, you know what?

483
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:26,620
This idea of trying to do stuff is itself impossible.

484
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,620
I don't know if I follow that.

485
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,620
I don't really know what I'm talking about either.

486
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,620
The crux of the thing is there's a voice in my head that's saying, yeah, but why would you do that?

487
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
Why would you even do anything?

488
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,620
And I can't like beat that guy in a debate.

489
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:53,620
That person constantly is coming up whenever I'm thinking, maybe I could just do, maybe I should or maybe I could do something.

490
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,620
And then they're like, give a why though.

491
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,620
You don't even know why you should do anything.

492
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
You can't even answer that question.

493
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
And I'm like, damn.

494
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:15,620
Well, I've had that thought and I've had that same feeling of like, I could do something.

495
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
But why?

496
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
But why?

497
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,620
So I know what you're talking about the.

498
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,620
I think, okay, I don't know.

499
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,620
I don't know if this is like, I don't know.

500
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,620
I don't know if this is like healthy or good.

501
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:48,620
But in the past, when I have, when I have done things, it has been, it has been because I feel like I, it's not like, okay, I'm going to decide.

502
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,620
I don't feel like, hmm, I think, what if I did this?

503
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,620
Okay, maybe I'll just, I'll just try and do it and just see what happens.

504
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,620
It's, I feel like I must do it.

505
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
I have to do it.

506
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
They have, I have no choice.

507
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
This is how I feel.

508
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Oh, the other, I guess the other thing I was doing this week is I have really, I have really been getting a lot done on the phantoms revenge.

509
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:17,620
And I, I, I had hoped maybe to have it done this month, but that's definitely not happening.

510
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,620
But it's getting, it's getting pretty close to done.

511
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,620
And when I work on that, I feel like, I feel like, oh, oh, there's so much work to do.

512
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,620
Oh, I've worked so hard on this and I have so much more work ahead of me.

513
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,620
And it's so, it's so demanding.

514
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,620
And it's so, it's such a tall order.

515
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,620
It's such a, such an amount that is being asked of me.

516
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,620
But then I'm just like, well, it doesn't matter.

517
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,620
I know I just have to do it.

518
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
I have no choice.

519
00:35:52,620 --> 00:36:00,620
I feel, I feel a compulsion that will not let me be satisfied until it is done.

520
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,620
So no matter how long it takes, it must be done.

521
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
So I might as well do it.

522
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
I don't know how to get that.

523
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:13,620
I feel like, I mean, I don't always feel that like that, but just project in particular makes me feel like that.

524
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
But like sometimes I have that as well.

525
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,620
Like, oh, I've got to get this thing done.

526
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:26,620
But I think the things I'm attribute, like the, the, I've been streaming recently, just video games.

527
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,620
And I've been sort of, it's been kind of fun.

528
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:40,620
And I think that is where I've latched on to, I've got to do this because I said I would instead of the far more difficult time consuming, creatively draining,

529
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:48,620
but also like way more fulfilling stuff of like creating comics and working on the, you know, stuff relating to all that.

530
00:36:48,620 --> 00:37:01,620
And I've, I keep thinking, yeah, but what if, like, there's, there's layers to this, this evil demon that says why, the why demon.

531
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,620
He asks why and I'm like, well, it doesn't matter why I'm just going to do it.

532
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,620
Like if I punch through that hole, he's like, well, you could fuck up.

533
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:16,620
And it would be really embarrassing and terrible if you, you know, and think of all the reasons that you suck.

534
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,620
And I'm like, oh no, this ammunition used against me.

535
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
It's very powerful.

536
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,620
It's super effective, you might say, just like Pokemon.

537
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Now I understand.

538
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
So like, I'm taking damage from that.

539
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:40,620
And I'm like, a lot of the time, like the, the way to like, just stop feeling bad is to get something done.

540
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
And I know that.

541
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:51,620
But instead, I, I got something insubstantial, unsubstantial, unimportant.

542
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,620
I got something unimportant on like a Super Mario stream.

543
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:04,620
I played Super Mario one and, and that was fun until I got stuck and I was tired and I couldn't beat world eight.

544
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,620
And I'm going to, oh, I was like, I'll do another stream to finish it later.

545
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,620
And I was saying during the stream, oh, you know what, wouldn't it wouldn't be fun if I like beat every Mario game one after the other.

546
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
That'd be cool.

547
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:23,620
But like a bunch of streams and like making big promises about streams I would do, even though not like a very small amount of people care about those.

548
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:31,620
And I don't even care about them because I, I'm not like entertaining enough, I feel, to be like a good streamer.

549
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Even though people find value in it, it's like, I feel like I'm using that as like a, like to let the pressure out of the valve.

550
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,620
That's building up when I'm not doing anything.

551
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:56,620
And then other than that, when I realized that that's what I'm doing, I'm like, oh God, I'm focusing on doing these streams instead of focusing on doing the stuff that's good or better, at least.

552
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,620
Then I, then I feel really bad.

553
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:12,620
And that's when I go all catatonic and I get all, I don't know, like hollow and like static dark noise music plays in my head that doesn't exist.

554
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,620
You know what I mean?

555
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Like the sort of like doomer anthem that I've never heard before, but I know what it sounds like, which is just like a low rumble and like crackling and like screaming banshees in the distance.

556
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
I just feel that vibe.

557
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,620
And then I lie on the floor and that's it.

558
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
It sucks.

559
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,620
I can't even cry.

560
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,620
I wish I was like emotional, but it's not even that.

561
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,620
That sounds like, that sounds like depression.

562
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
That is depression.

563
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,620
I mean, I'm not one to self diagnose, but it certainly sucks.

564
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Well, I have, I have, I have felt that way before.

565
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
So insecure.

566
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
That's true.

567
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,620
No, I, I'm mostly not understand.

568
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,620
I don't, I don't know if I have the, the, the doomer anthem banshee wailing experience.

569
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,620
Well, that was just sort of like a way.

570
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,620
The metaphor.

571
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,620
I feel like one of my imagination goes, I'm like, God, I just, there's like so.

572
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:27,620
There's like so, such a large like, like a screaming, but I'm not screaming, you know?

573
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Like I could imagine the sound my mind would make if it were a song that other people could listen to.

574
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
But my face is totally blank.

575
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,620
I'm completely motionless.

576
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,620
It's a, it's like that woe jack with like the black scribbles all over it.

577
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,620
Yeah.

578
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Oh yeah.

579
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Oh, I know, I know that one.

580
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:02,620
So like a, and then occasionally, very occasionally I will draw like a little sketch, sad skeleton comic and post that on Twitter.

581
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Oh, the one where he's looking into the puddle.

582
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,620
Yeah.

583
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,620
The little puddle one, the please validate my existence studios, little guy.

584
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
Yes.

585
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
Yes.

586
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
And things relating to that.

587
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,620
That's bent stuff.

588
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
And that sometimes gets me out of it actually.

589
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,620
Maybe I should do more of that.

590
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,620
Maybe you should do more of that.

591
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:36,620
Sometimes when I come up with like a doomer like vent comic that is like, it's, it's sort of the absurd and like stupid in a way that I actually makes me laugh and makes me feel better.

592
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,620
So I should probably do that.

593
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,620
There's so many things I feel like I must be doing with my time.

594
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,620
Yeah.

595
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:51,620
Every time I'm not doing them, it's, it's, it's the worst feeling, which is no feeling.

596
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,620
People feels bad and then I end up feeling nothing.

597
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,620
People keep asking me to do other things.

598
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,620
People keep asking me like Ben, please make more Winnie the Pooh videos.

599
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,620
Ben, please make Sonichu 103.

600
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Ben, please make another Nuzlocke.

601
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,620
Please make champion chapter two.

602
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
Please make, please make papers.

603
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,620
Ben, please stop peddling your toddler leftist beliefs.

604
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
Your toddler leftist beliefs.

605
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Yeah, that's a big one.

606
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,620
People ask me that a lot.

607
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,620
And I have to, and I have to, but it's, it's kind of a relief.

608
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,620
It's kind of a relief that I have Phantoms Revenge.

609
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:40,620
Phantoms Revenge is my rock in these, in these hard times because they don't know.

610
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,620
They don't know what they want.

611
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,620
I am the artist.

612
00:42:44,620 --> 00:43:00,620
I, my job is to anticipate what they want, the people before they want it and then get, and give it to them and surprise and amaze them with their own delight at having received such a thing.

613
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,620
And Phantoms Revenge is that thing.

614
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
And I know that they don't want me to do those things.

615
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:11,620
What they really want is for me to finish Phantoms Revenge and blow all their minds with the masterpiece that it will be.

616
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,620
So when they, when they, when people tell me, Ben, you should do this, I don't even have to think.

617
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:27,620
I don't even have to think about respecting their opinion because I know I have faith in my, in my self and in my heart that I, what I am doing is right.

618
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,620
Like, even if it spits in the face of what they, of what they want and what they wish.

619
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,620
Who gives a fuck?

620
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,620
That's pretty good.

621
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:46,620
I have, I have, I just want to bring it up because the way, in terms of like things I should be doing, it's, it's very clarifying.

622
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,620
It cuts me through the bullshit.

623
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,620
At any given time, I know what I should be doing is finishing Phantoms Revenge.

624
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,620
It's the only thing that matters.

625
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:05,620
If I'm not doing that, well, I know I'm fucking up, but at least I know exactly how I can fix the situation, which is to get back to working on Phantoms Revenge.

626
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:14,620
Yeah, I wish I had like a rock like that, or at least I wish I had like people asking things of me because I don't really have that.

627
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:24,620
I think the most people ask is like the occasional old hypocrite fan, but that's stopped for a while.

628
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,620
I don't think people really ask for those to come back.

629
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:34,620
The sentiment's still there, I guess, but like, oh, and the podcast, that's the thing people are asking.

630
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,620
I'm like, that's a joint effort and me and Nate both have to get together to do that.

631
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,620
And I guess neither of us want to.

632
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,620
I feel like whatever.

633
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:51,620
But like, when it comes to my own projects, nobody's like asking me, oh, can you do more of this or that?

634
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,620
I'm like, I'm left to completely my choice.

635
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:01,620
There's no nowhere that's been like, I don't know, tugged at.

636
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:10,620
Nobody's clamoring for me to like finish Clarissa Gunsmoke, even though I know people did like it when they saw it.

637
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,620
And I know it's good.

638
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,620
I just need to do it.

639
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,620
But like, nobody seems to care about these issues.

640
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:25,620
Now I feel bad because I meant, I still haven't read it because I said I'll read it when it's finished and it hasn't been finished.

641
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,620
No, but like, that's fine.

642
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,620
I'm not like trying to impugn people for like not nagging me for stuff.

643
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,620
It needs to happen naturally.

644
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:38,620
I guess I just don't have enough, what do you call it?

645
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:46,620
Like, I'm not a high priority in people's minds of like, I got to see the next give and take comic of this or that.

646
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,620
They'll just be happy when it happens and I'll be happy to make it.

647
00:45:50,620 --> 00:46:00,620
Well, I mean, all right, let's let's let's let's let's interrogate that thought for a second.

648
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:08,620
I mean, no, no, no comic, even like the most famous comic artist or whatever isn't like a high priority in anyone's mind.

649
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:23,620
Like no, like nobody is like waking up and being like, oh, man, I wish the next issue of Brian Leo Malley's snot girl was out now and like I need to go and like the first order of businesses go and like ask him when it's coming out.

650
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,620
Right.

651
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,620
I don't mean like priority as in like some individual person's most important thing.

652
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:46,620
But like, I don't feel like I'm enough of or at least my work is not of enough of a priority higher up on high up on anyone, anyone's priority list for them to like decide to ask me about my comics.

653
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,620
Well, I mean,

654
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:55,620
Well, speak, I mean, speaking of your comics, me and me and Cassie were talking about the Lord of Ghosts yesterday and Cassie told me that they have.

655
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:02,620
I was I was a bash because Cassie said they've started working on theirs and I have not I have not started on mine.

656
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:08,620
But I guess I guess I had a I guess I have to get that get that going soon.

657
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,620
I probably I probably don't have enough time to get it done before the move.

658
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,620
So maybe I will maybe I will have to take a break.

659
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,620
I don't want to take a break from phantom's revenge, but maybe I will take like a.

660
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:28,620
You'd probably get it drawn in like two days or so if I really if I really bust my hump.

661
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,620
Let's take it.

662
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:36,620
Maybe I can do that first thing after I after I get all settled in to my new apartment.

663
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:52,620
So I guess I I mean, the thing you're doing now, I mean, I guess I assumed you were you were focused on, you know, Lord of Ghosts fulfillment stuff, getting the zine made and so on and so forth.

664
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
Yes.

665
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,620
I've put off certain things that I really could have got done.

666
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,620
I could have printed the red man comics by now.

667
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,620
Yeah.

668
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,620
I made the little test print and I did.

669
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,620
I just haven't got around to like fixing the PDF because I need to like download.

670
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:18,620
I need to pirate a new PDF editing thing is the thing I had like exploded Adobe caught me.

671
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,620
Mm hmm.

672
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,620
So I have to do that bullshit again.

673
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,620
I just hadn't felt like it.

674
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,620
And then the Lord of Ghost plush samplers here.

675
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,620
I could order the rest.

676
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:40,620
I guess part of me has been like, oh, what if somebody wants a plush and they haven't mentioned it and they they're willing to pay for it later?

677
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,620
You mean you mean you're thinking like, oh, what if what if I need more?

678
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,620
What if I need to order a few extra?

679
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,620
That's basically the sort of thing.

680
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,620
I mean, I could I could have done that.

681
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:57,620
Like I could have like figured out if anybody wanted any by asking or if anybody had changed their mind.

682
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,620
I don't know.

683
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,620
I could have done like graphs and management for the Lord of Ghosts.

684
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,620
I mean, start a backer reward to your stuff.

685
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,620
I just haven't.

686
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:09,620
If I if I were you, this is just my practical two senses.

687
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:18,620
I would I would plan to have some extra because like probably there will be people in the future who would be like, do you still have any more of those plushes?

688
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,620
Can I can I get one?

689
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,620
Or, you know, if you if you ever do if you ever do like table at a con or something, that's that's merch.

690
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,620
That's merch to move at something like that.

691
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:37,620
I did my Kickstarter is all I, you know, I ordered in bulk so I could get a price cut at the price breakpoint and then I would have extra stock to sell later on.

692
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,620
I'm always planning.

693
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,620
I'm always planning for the future.

694
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,620
Yeah, I guess I just just buy a few extra.

695
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:52,620
I did make a little over the what I needed in the Kickstarter.

696
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Yeah.

697
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,620
Right.

698
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:59,620
So yeah, I mean, those are going to take a while to get made anyway.

699
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,620
So I should order them as soon as possible.

700
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,620
Yeah.

701
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:15,620
In terms of the the Lord of Ghost comic itself, I need to wait for the artists to get their things finished so I can put them all in and make that PDF finished and then get that printed.

702
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,620
And I have the pins already, which is good.

703
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:36,620
And then after that, it's a it's a simple making a hundred billion like signatures and and doodling on some of the copies and then getting all the packaging and logistics and sending them out.

704
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:46,620
Oh, man, speaking about speaking about the Lord of Ghost, I just want to about like, OK, yesterday, so I was tabling and I was talking about the pins.

705
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,620
I was explaining Endless War and sometimes people would be like, Oh, what's this?

706
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,620
What's this?

707
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,620
They would pick up a pin and be like, what's this?

708
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,620
And like, yeah, we sold.

709
00:50:54,620 --> 00:51:00,620
I sold all three of I just brought like a couple of each pin because I assumed like no one was going to be buying like a ton of any one thing.

710
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,620
And I was right.

711
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:08,620
But I sold all I sold all three of the Lord of Ghost nega slime pins that I brought and people asked like, oh, this is cute.

712
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,620
What is this?

713
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:17,620
And I had to be like, I had to explain the lore of like, why did the Lord of Ghost summon the nega slime?

714
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,620
What was the nega pause?

715
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,620
And did you really need to do that?

716
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,620
Yeah, several times.

717
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,620
I got I had asked and like the old this is the only way I can explain it.

718
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:32,620
I have to take like a whole but but it was but like telling telling the story.

719
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,620
I think I think twice I had to go through the whole like, yeah.

720
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,620
So the leader of the cop killers and the leader of the rowdy fuckers, they were running, they had a mayor election.

721
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:46,620
But the Lord of Ghost, who is a stay dead, which by the way is someone who decides not to revive when they get killed in gang violence.

722
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:50,620
The Lord of Ghost, he ran as a spoiler candidate and he won the pity vote.

723
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:55,620
So he actually got elected and he used it and it was basically that scene from Ghostbusters 2.

724
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:02,620
And both times I explain it like the people that were asking like, they were like laughing and stuff.

725
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:10,620
They were like, chuckling as they were having a good reaction to hearing like the whole narrative like condensed just how fucking absurd it was.

726
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,620
And I was just like, I don't know.

727
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:19,620
It's like, man, that sure was a that sure was a weird time in history.

728
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,620
It still makes a good story, I guess.

729
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:33,620
Yeah, people really like that smear that smear pin that and one like one like old guy, he came up and he just like picked up Levy Jevy.

730
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,620
And he was just like, I don't think he even wanted to know what it was.

731
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:42,620
But I think he asked me like, what's the and I explained what a stay dead was and he was like, hell yeah.

732
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
Oh, God.

733
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,620
Clean up your toys.

734
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,620
Your hot wheels are all over the living room floor.

735
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,620
You're right.

736
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,620
Clean them up or you're grounded.

737
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,620
You're right, dad.

738
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,620
I stepped on your hot wheel.

739
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,620
It hurt my footy.

740
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,620
That's funny, dad.

741
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,620
I'm sorry.

742
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,620
I'm feeling like toeing out Benjamin because of your hot wheels.

743
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,620
He's recording one of his podcasts.

744
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,620
What are you in there?

745
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,620
I don't care.

746
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,620
He's got to do his part in the household.

747
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,620
Stop fighting, mom and dad.

748
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,620
Stop fighting.

749
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,620
This is why I'm here with Jeremy.

750
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,620
Jeremy, I see you.

751
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,620
He's got to do his part in this household.

752
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,620
He's got to get a job.

753
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,620
I don't care if he's five years old.

754
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,620
No.

755
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,620
He's got to put his foot in the hot wheel.

756
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,620
He's got to have money.

757
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,620
He's not making shit.

758
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,620
It's not making shit.

759
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,620
It's not making shit.

760
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,620
It's not making shit.

761
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,620
It's not true.

762
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,620
I'm straight edge, mom and dad.

763
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,620
I'm a pro gamer.

764
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,620
Thanks.

765
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,620
Thanks.

766
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,620
Don't get divorced, please.

767
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:38,620
They're getting divorced.

768
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,620
Mom and dad.

769
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,620
Sure are our characters.

770
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,620
Man, they're not even my real mom and dad.

771
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,620
They don't have to listen to them.

772
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,620
What are we talking about?

773
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,620
Lord of ghosts.

774
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,620
Oh, yeah.

775
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,620
Pins.

776
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,620
Levy Jevy.

777
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,620
Levy Jevy.

778
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,620
That one guy.

779
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,620
Oh, yeah.

780
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,620
I think that guy, I explained that a state editor is someone who's just like giving up on shit.

781
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,620
And he was just like, yeah, cool.

782
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,620
I want it.

783
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,620
Nice.

784
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,620
Oh, man.

785
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,620
It was really, it was really weird.

786
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:12,620
I said this before, but it was just so weird having like a little kid be like, what's slime

787
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,620
core?

788
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,620
Like what's a cop killer?

789
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:21,620
I was like, uh, well, let me try to explain without using any F words.

790
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,620
What a delight.

791
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,620
What a treat.

792
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,620
They're in the server.

793
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,620
Well, actually I don't.

794
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
Oh, this was my beat.

795
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,620
Like, okay.

796
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,620
If eventually I quickly realized like, I need to not have to explain this over and over.

797
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:42,620
So I wrote, I wrote like a little sign that was like endless war, a free text based MMORPG

798
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
playable on discord.

799
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,620
And then I wrote like the discord link down.

800
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,620
So anyone that wanted to, to like check it out, I could just point to that and be like,

801
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,620
that's, that's the link.

802
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,620
If you want, I had stickers.

803
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:56,620
I had a bunch of stickers that the ones that smear had had designed that had the discord

804
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,620
link on them.

805
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,620
And like anyone that bought a pin, I was like, here, take, take the sticker.

806
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:03,620
It's, if you want to check the game out, it's got the, it's got the link on it there.

807
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:08,620
So for all I know, some of them did go and like showing the server after and be like, yeah,

808
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:13,620
I bought this, I bought this pin that's like a pink screaming face and a clown hat.

809
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,620
And like, I don't know what, I don't know what it is, but it gave me this sticker and

810
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,620
it had this discord on it.

811
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,620
So what's going on in here?

812
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,620
I haven't, I wonder.

813
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:29,620
I used to go around and stick those stickers just on, on like walls and on like posts and

814
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,620
stuff.

815
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,620
And I think one or two people did just like join the server just based on seeing like

816
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,620
stickers around, which is pretty funny.

817
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:47,620
It's, I really like the meme of it just being an actual URL, but printed in like, you know,

818
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,620
it's not a, it's not a special URL where it's actually a name like a company or a brand.

819
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,620
It's just like a discord URL with random numbers and letters.

820
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,620
Yeah.

821
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,620
MTS, MTSRX, like ZK or MK.

822
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,620
It's, you can say it phonetically.

823
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:09,620
You can say it's, it's like Mount, Mount Sergic or something is the, is the random URL for

824
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,620
the server.

825
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,620
Yeah.

826
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,620
I like, it doesn't explain itself.

827
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,620
It doesn't have a name.

828
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:19,620
It's just a random like a like QR code or, or, or URL that you can just, if you're curious,

829
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:25,620
you can just type it in and you will arrive at this mad magical land of gang violence and

830
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,620
slime.

831
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:33,620
I'm thinking imagine, like imagining, you know, those little rubber arm bands that you can

832
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,620
get like mass produced.

833
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,620
Yeah.

834
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,620
Kind of uncomfortable.

835
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,620
With the swastika on it.

836
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:43,620
Imagine having the, yeah, imagine having a discord logo and not, no, no, the discord

837
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,620
URL on one of those bands.

838
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,620
Oh, like the, like the Livestrong like bracelet.

839
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,620
Yeah, those things.

840
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,620
Yeah.

841
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,620
Yeah.

842
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,620
I made a shirt that is just the, the, the QR code.

843
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,620
I don't think anyone bought it.

844
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:05,620
Cause like, I mean, why would you want to wear a shirt that's just a QR code?

845
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,620
But it would be funny if anyone did.

846
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:12,620
If anyone wore it and they were, someone was just like, whoa, let me scan your shirt for

847
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,620
a second.

848
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Whoa.

849
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,620
Slime.

850
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,620
Uh,

851
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,620
It just makes their phone green.

852
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:26,620
It's like, it's like, um, yeah, it's just like the green just like extends down their

853
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,620
hand and like covers their, like, like in one of those, like in a gushers commercial

854
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:35,620
where like you eat the gusher and like it turns your whole body a certain color and

855
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,620
then your head turns into a fruit.

856
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,620
It's, it's like that, but it turns you green and your head turns into endless war.

857
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:47,620
And you, and then it just pops like a grape and slime just goes everywhere.

858
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,620
Hell.

859
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,620
Yeah.

860
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,620
Do you ever see those old gushers commercials where their heads turn into fruit?

861
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
I don't know.

862
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,620
I think I understand the, the, what it looks like though.

863
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,620
There's probably something similar.

864
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,620
Now those, now those would make, if those were color graded correctly, that would make

865
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,620
some pretty good endless war propaganda.

866
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,620
Gushers are very RFC K core.

867
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,620
I would say they're pretty slimy.

868
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,620
Um, right.

869
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,620
So the lord of ghosts.

870
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,620
Uh, yeah.

871
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:23,620
Uh, gotta, gotta get my fucking, gotta get my fucking comic done.

872
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:33,620
Soon, soon when I'm, when I'm, when I'm moved, being in like a temporary apartment

873
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,620
has been really stressful and it was, it took me a while for a while.

874
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:43,620
I was like feeling too like insecure about like my, my place in life to like get a lot

875
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,620
of done.

876
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:48,620
And then like halfway through the month I was like, no, Ben, just get, get a fucking

877
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,620
grip on yourself.

878
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,620
And then I've been, I've been really cranking out work since then.

879
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,620
Uh, moving into the new place where I'm like, yes, I'm settled.

880
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,620
I'm here.

881
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,620
I don't have to move for another year.

882
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,620
I'm good.

883
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:05,620
That'll be like few and hopefully the people there won't just fucking leave garbage in

884
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,620
the sink and all over the kitchen and like get fucking clouds of fruit flies fucking

885
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,620
everywhere.

886
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,620
Uh, one, one hopes.

887
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,620
Terrible, just terrible.

888
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,620
I fucking hate this guy.

889
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,620
Oh, but he's gone now.

890
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,620
He's gone.

891
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,620
He can't hurt me.

892
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:24,620
Oh yeah.

893
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:29,620
Speaking of moving, I have to move out of my cool apartment that I've been in for the

894
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,620
last bunch of months, which is pretty upsetting.

895
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,620
Yeah.

896
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,620
You told me that that was, that arrangement was, was over.

897
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,620
Yeah.

898
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,620
It was only going to, at the beginning they said it would maybe last till July.

899
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,620
So I guess I'm lucky that it lasted longer.

900
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,620
Yeah.

901
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:52,620
Um, but the, the cool deal that I had, uh, is I now have, if I had to, if I were to

902
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:56,620
stay here, I would have to pay very big money that I don't have.

903
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:01,620
So I have to, I guess I'm just going to move back with my parents for a while.

904
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,620
I'm trying to look for another place.

905
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,620
I've no, I, I don't know.

906
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:10,620
It's, it's a, when I've got all this load of ghost stuff to do, I don't really want

907
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,620
to be moving around.

908
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,620
I want to get all that finished at least first.

909
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,620
Yeah.

910
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:20,620
Oh, side note, but I have the, the, the Road to Radcon books are printed.

911
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:25,620
I just have to go pick them up from the printer, but I guess I won't do that until

912
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,620
they're not open the weekend.

913
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,620
So I can't get them now.

914
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,620
I can't get them on Monday, but I'll probably just wait until Wednesday when I, uh, I'm,

915
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,620
I'm not going to have to move anymore.

916
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:37,620
I don't want an extra box to have to carry around.

917
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,620
Um, yeah.

918
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,620
How, okay.

919
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:45,620
So your apartment, how, how was, I don't know, how was the experience of like living

920
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,620
in your own place?

921
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,620
How did you feel about it?

922
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:54,620
Aside from feeling sick quite often, uh, it was great.

923
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,620
I like the, uh, I like the.

924
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,620
The cooking ability.

925
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,620
Hmm.

926
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:07,620
Cause it's always been possible to cook at home, but like dad always cooks.

927
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,620
Yeah.

928
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,620
A lot.

929
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,620
He's like, got the fridge filled with like future ingredients.

930
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,620
It's like difficult to like plan around him.

931
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,620
Hmm.

932
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,620
I'm going to try anyway.

933
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,620
Cause like I've learned a lot of, of cooking things.

934
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,620
I've tried to learn lots of different recipes.

935
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,620
Um, and I feel like I, I, I can do it now.

936
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,620
I can cook things.

937
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:32,620
I can, I can have a bunch of stuff in the fridge, ingredients and be like, okay, I can

938
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:36,620
put something together and I can actually make it work without really needing a recipe,

939
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,620
which is pretty cool.

940
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,620
Um, cause I know like, I know some basics.

941
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,620
I know how, how to cook an onion until it's soft.

942
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,620
I'm like, that's that.

943
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,620
Then I, I finished the onions done.

944
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,620
Now I put something else on it.

945
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,620
What?

946
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,620
You put a can of tomatoes on it.

947
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,620
Spread some peanut butter on it.

948
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,620
No.

949
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,620
Okay.

950
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,620
Why would you do that?

951
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,620
Who knows?

952
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,620
You experiment.

953
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,620
You cook an onion until it's soft.

954
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,620
You know, you know what?

955
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:12,620
I laugh, but I've seen that, that, that the Townsend video of him, they did used to, they used

956
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,620
to just bake onion.

957
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:18,620
You could just bake an onion in the oven and then eat it and apparently it's good.

958
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,620
I mean, it's the thing you eat.

959
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:24,620
So at some point it'll be good.

960
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,620
I mean, I mean, I've never eaten just an onion.

961
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:32,620
Apparently you can do it, but that's not even like, that's not even what I mean is like,

962
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,620
like for basics.

963
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:39,620
Cause like before I know how to cook, you follow a recipe in the numbers.

964
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:44,620
They're like, Oh, you do it for 10 minutes and you do this for two minutes and you turn

965
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:49,620
it over after four minutes and I don't really have a sense of like when something is about

966
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,620
to be burnt or whether it's good or whether it's undercooked.

967
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,620
I just follow the numbers.

968
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,620
But now I kind of get an intuition.

969
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:03,620
I intuitively understand when something is like, that's done.

970
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,620
I think I can, I can see a lot of things when they're done.

971
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,620
Not so much in the oven cause I didn't have an oven.

972
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,620
It was mostly frying and boiling and stuff.

973
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,620
This whatever I can cook now.

974
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:20,620
If my, if my new kitchen, I would be very upset if my new kitchen doesn't have an oven because

975
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:27,620
how else can I cook my delicious frozen fried chicken wings that I buy in bulk from Costco?

976
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,620
That's my new, that's my new dietary staple.

977
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,620
I love that shit.

978
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,620
Yeah.

979
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:40,620
The cooking has been good.

980
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,620
The independence.

981
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:47,620
Well, it's not so much just the independence, but the ability to like dress how I want.

982
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,620
I've been trying on some, some more feminine clothing and it's not embarrassing because

983
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,620
I don't have to worry about people seeing me.

984
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:59,620
And I've sort of built up some courage to go outside and a bit more feminine clothing.

985
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,620
Haven't gone out in a skirt yet.

986
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,620
Not really ready for that, but I have gone out in leggings and stuff.

987
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:11,620
Do you, would you, I mean, I guess at your parents place or where you're at now,

988
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:17,620
are you near like a city, like a, like a center of, do you like walk to like the store?

989
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,620
Do you like walk down the street and like go buy some?

990
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,620
I walk down the street to the high street to get food and groceries.

991
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,620
Yeah, okay.

992
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,620
Yeah.

993
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,620
Okay.

994
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,620
I was, I was just wondering, I was wondering if like you're in like a place where you're like going out

995
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:33,620
and walking around people.

996
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,620
Yeah, yeah.

997
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,620
I mean, when I go to get groceries, it's quite a busy street.

998
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:42,620
And the only other time I really go out is, is to like walk in the nearby park.

999
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,620
And there's always a bunch of people there.

1000
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,620
So it's like, yeah, it's a nice park.

1001
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,620
I probably, I don't go on enough walks.

1002
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,620
Walks are based.

1003
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,620
Yeah.

1004
01:04:53,620 --> 01:05:00,620
I used to justify walks like, oh, I need to walk more, but I don't want to, but I could play Pokemon Go.

1005
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,620
Yeah.

1006
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,620
And as soon as Pokemon Go stopped being interesting, I stopped going on walks.

1007
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,620
So that was a stupid idea.

1008
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,620
Yeah.

1009
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:11,620
But it did, it did make me realize that the walks could be fun.

1010
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:17,620
So I have been going on more just to experience like fresh air on my face.

1011
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,620
It was nice.

1012
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:26,620
I used, I used to go, I used to go on Pokemon Go walks and now my phone is so old and shitty.

1013
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,620
Like I basically can't do it anymore.

1014
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,620
So I don't go on walks.

1015
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,620
You know, it helped, it helped.

1016
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:39,620
Going on walks helped me lose weight like before, like when I, when I lost all the Radcon 2 weight,

1017
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,620
or Radcon 3 weight rather.

1018
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:48,620
So I should, yeah, I should probably walk again because I need to, I've got, I'm fat again.

1019
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:52,620
Although I think I have lost a little bit of weight since moving because I've been very,

1020
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,620
I've been very strict about keto this month.

1021
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:59,620
And I think it's, I think it's, it's going, although it's not going as fast as I would like.

1022
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,620
Oh, but so I guess, because I haven't, I haven't been walking and because I have,

1023
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:09,620
I have not been lifting this month because I had to disassemble the rack.

1024
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:14,620
I had to disassemble the exercise rack and it's sitting in pieces now.

1025
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:20,620
And I'm not, I get, after I move again, I can reassemble it and then I can use it again.

1026
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,620
I was on such a roll too.

1027
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,620
I was on such a roll.

1028
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,620
My squat was actually really good and now it's shit again.

1029
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,620
I lost all my progress.

1030
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,620
God.

1031
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,620
You just gotta find heavy things and pick them up and put them down.

1032
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:37,620
No, you have to do the one way.

1033
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,620
You only do the one thing.

1034
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:44,620
You put the bar on your back and like a crumbly old building.

1035
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,620
You pick up a brick and put it down again over and over.

1036
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:53,620
Pick it up and you throw it across the courtyard and you go find it and you catch it and you wind up

1037
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:57,620
and you throw it the other way and you just go back and forth until the brick breaks

1038
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,620
and that's how you know that you're strong enough.

1039
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,620
You just gotta find.

1040
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:06,620
You, you, you pick up a brick and with two hands, like pull it apart.

1041
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,620
And once you can pull it apart, then you're ready.

1042
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,620
You're for, you're for whatever it is.

1043
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,620
You just, you just gotta find a calf.

1044
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:20,620
You gotta find a newborn baby calf and carry it on your shoulders and go for a jog.

1045
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:25,620
And then as the calf grows and becomes a mature cow,

1046
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:30,620
you will get stronger and stronger until you're eventually just running around with an entire cow on your shoulders

1047
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,620
and you're the strongest guy.

1048
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,620
And then you can occasionally suck on the teeth for energy.

1049
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,620
Absolutely.

1050
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:39,620
It's mid-run.

1051
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,620
Yeah.

1052
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,620
A female calf is recommended.

1053
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,620
Yeah.

1054
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:48,620
When she gets heavy enough, you're going to need, you're going to need that milk.

1055
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:53,620
When she's getting to the milk producing age, you're going to need that, the lactose in that milk.

1056
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,620
Let me tell you, that's an essential part of the, of the strategy.

1057
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,620
Oh God.

1058
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,620
Delicious.

1059
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,620
A man in his cow.

1060
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:09,620
It's just getting ripped.

1061
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:10,620
You carry the calf from birth.

1062
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,620
Every so often you have to put it down in a field so it can eat, so it doesn't starve to death.

1063
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:21,620
And you just walk across the entire earth slowly that the cow grows and it gets used to jumping on your back.

1064
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,620
It never.

1065
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,620
You have to keep getting stronger.

1066
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:28,620
It's the only way it gets around is because you need to exercise.

1067
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,620
That's like a story.

1068
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,620
I think, I don't think it's Hercules, but it's some Greek hero.

1069
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:41,620
That's like the story of how he got fucking super, super strong is because he did that with a cow.

1070
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,620
I don't.

1071
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,620
It's the origin story.

1072
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,620
I want to.

1073
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,620
I want to read that.

1074
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,620
It's a superhero origin story.

1075
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,620
Wait a minute.

1076
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,620
I can.

1077
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,620
Hold on.

1078
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,620
Hercules.

1079
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,620
No.

1080
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,620
Berkulosis.

1081
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,620
No.

1082
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,620
Greek.

1083
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,620
Carry.

1084
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,620
Poseidon.

1085
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,620
Strong.

1086
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:58,620
Perseidon.

1087
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,620
Perseidon.

1088
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,620
Strong.

1089
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,620
Perseidon.

1090
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,620
Strong.

1091
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,620
Perseidon.

1092
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,620
Perseidon.

1093
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,620
Strong.

1094
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:06,620
Perseidon.

1095
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,620
Perseidon.

1096
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,620
Strong.

1097
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:09,620
Perseidon.

1098
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,620
Strong.

1099
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,620
Perseidon.

1100
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,620
Strong.

1101
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,620
Perseidon.

1102
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:14,620
Perseidon.

1103
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,620
Posturer's name.

1104
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,620
He was just a real resurrected凡s.

1105
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:22,620
Winning 32 wrestling competitions in the ancient Greek Olympics.

1106
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:27,600
According to legend Milo trained by carrying a calf whining from its birth until it became

1107
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,620
a full sized ox.

1108
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,620
Milo of Croton.

1109
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,820
Just a real dude who really did it.

1110
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,820
It really happened.

1111
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:41,260
He really ran around with a full size ox on his shoulders.

1112
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,260
That's his history.

1113
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,260
Dang.

1114
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,860
The past really do be better than us.

1115
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:53,060
You know, I said, I'm not going to phrase it as, if this were, if that happened today,

1116
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,060
this would happen.

1117
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,180
Because for all I know, something like it did happen.

1118
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:02,740
But imagine if he was like, like he gets famous from winning all these wrestling competitions

1119
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,100
in the ancient Greek Olympics, and it's like, man, everyone knows my love, Chris.

1120
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:11,660
So imagine he like, I can imagine that he like, sold fucking like scrolls.

1121
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:16,860
He's I imagine he sold some kind of like self-help table like like the Milo method.

1122
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,060
Like, no, like, like he has it like print.

1123
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,060
I guess they didn't have movable printed type.

1124
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:26,860
So I don't know what like, I don't know what like the most economical way of like disseminating

1125
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,860
some sort of like written material would have been an ancient Greek, but there must have

1126
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,860
been some way to do it.

1127
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,460
And I wouldn't be surprised if this guy literally like sold pamphlets.

1128
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:39,260
It's like the Milo method for getting fucking ripped because like, what else do you do?

1129
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:45,260
What else do you do with when you're a world famous athlete who's run 32 wrestling competitions

1130
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,460
in the ancient Greek Olympics?

1131
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,660
Like what what is the point of that?

1132
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,660
If not to somehow monetize it?

1133
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:56,460
I mean, I don't know much about ancient Greece, but were they a capitalist system?

1134
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Did they work like that?

1135
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,860
I mean, they had they had money.

1136
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,060
They did commerce.

1137
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,860
It's not like they wouldn't have understood the concept of like farmhand on most of the

1138
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:05,860
time.

1139
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:11,860
And then for fun, they'll get together and see who's the strongest.

1140
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,660
Do you do you think that there was just no money to be made?

1141
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:21,660
Like it was all just for no, they must they must have been so I mean, I don't I'm saying

1142
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,660
I don't know.

1143
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:28,160
So maybe but like my gut reaction is that they they weren't so cynical back then.

1144
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
Maybe they would have been.

1145
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:37,860
I think I think that the the almighty dollar, right, the value of money is not a new, you

1146
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,660
know, they understood the money.

1147
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:40,660
They had money.

1148
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,660
They did commerce.

1149
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:48,380
Like if he didn't, I mean, maybe people just didn't have like strategies for capitalizing

1150
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:49,380
on fame.

1151
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:54,620
I guess I guess my thought process is like, I don't think he would have done it for money.

1152
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:57,620
I think he may have done it for fame and glory.

1153
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:02,720
Like I am the strongest and you will all be my pupils and they're like, oh, Pog.

1154
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,960
Okay, I could I could believe maybe that like he's, you know, he's getting into he's getting

1155
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,520
into all this wrestling competitions and he's like, he's really good at it.

1156
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,920
He's the best wrestler and everyone's like, dude, you should do the Olympics.

1157
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:21,080
And he's like, yeah, I should do the Olympics and he does the Olympics and he's so good

1158
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,760
that he wins 32 competitions over however many years.

1159
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,520
But, you know, you can't do that forever, right?

1160
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,820
You're not a you're not a world-class athlete your whole life.

1161
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,820
So at some point he's like, damn, I'm too old for this shit.

1162
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:35,980
I'm like, you know, I'm 30 now, you know, my body is failing.

1163
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:36,980
I'm decrepit.

1164
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:37,980
I'm ancient.

1165
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,980
It's time to retire.

1166
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,980
Now what do I do?

1167
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:47,420
Well, I'm I'm world famous athlete Milo of Proton.

1168
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,420
So you guys.

1169
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,420
Olives.

1170
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,420
No.

1171
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,420
So you got to do.

1172
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,420
Make olive oil.

1173
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,420
You got to do something with that.

1174
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:57,100
I refuse to believe this is like a modern like late capitalist invention.

1175
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,640
You must have.

1176
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,880
I mean, they had schools.

1177
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:05,600
I bet he like I bet like the school of Athens or whatever like I bet he was like a guest

1178
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,600
lecture.

1179
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,200
I bet they had him like give speeches and like give I bet he like taught something like

1180
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
what do you do?

1181
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,800
Speaking engagements been like a trainer for like younger athletes or like soldiers or

1182
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,840
something like when you're when you're famous when you're a famous guy, you like you got

1183
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,840
it.

1184
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,840
You do something.

1185
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:29,060
Society just demands that like you society rewards you and you when you just lean into

1186
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:32,140
that and you get and you go and you're like, I'm going to do I'm going to do something

1187
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,060
with this thing that I'm famous for.

1188
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:42,140
Like was it was it Greece or Rome that had like the wax tablets that they draw on and

1189
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,140
you can wipe them off?

1190
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,460
I am not.

1191
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,460
I am not sure.

1192
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,460
I'm not sure.

1193
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:51,060
There's like a thing I remember learning at school where it's like, oh, they didn't have

1194
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,860
books and paper to learn.

1195
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,040
They went to school with their wax tablets and they would carve things into the wax and

1196
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,880
that would be their way of jotting notes down.

1197
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,720
And I'm like, wow, that sounds really bad.

1198
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,120
Wait, so you could just like wipe the wax and like smooth it out again.

1199
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,560
You could squish it down and then it would be gone.

1200
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,600
I don't know what the purpose maybe I'm misremembering.

1201
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,600
I would assume.

1202
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Let me type that in.

1203
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,240
I would assume that you scratch the things into the wax and then maybe later you like

1204
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,020
copy them onto like a more permanent thing.

1205
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,340
Oh, yeah. Wax tablets is a Roman thing.

1206
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,820
No, I didn't know about Romans use wax tablets.

1207
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:37,780
Tablets, pieces of wood tied together so they would open and shut like a little book.

1208
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,140
Each piece of wood had a shallow recess that was filled with wax and formed the writing

1209
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,140
surface.

1210
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,340
So it's like really thick pieces of paper in a in a book and a tablet and stylus.

1211
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,480
It was just like real life.

1212
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,480
It's like a modern day.

1213
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,680
History is just like it's almost like these.

1214
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,280
This is really happened.

1215
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,680
It's like, yeah.

1216
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:07,640
So, so they just like used writing, making lists, leaving instructions.

1217
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,040
But why did they not have paper?

1218
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,540
I thought they would have.

1219
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,440
They had.

1220
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,840
I think, yeah, I think they had it.

1221
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,640
But it probably would have been expensive.

1222
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,240
I guess the fact that it was a reusable writing implement like, oh, I just got to remember

1223
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,640
something. Let me write that down.

1224
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,140
Honestly, honestly, kind of convenient.

1225
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:30,940
Sounds kind of good.

1226
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,440
Like it's you don't have to waste paper.

1227
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,840
Like, I mean, paper is like cost nothing now.

1228
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,040
But like maybe it wasn't always so, so plentiful or so hard, easy to come by.

1229
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,440
I'm just, I'm just trying to imagine like what it looks like.

1230
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,740
What it looks like to like scratch it into and then do you just take a cloth and like

1231
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,640
wipe the wax and it like smooths it out again?

1232
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,240
Like an etch a sketch?

1233
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,040
Wouldn't you eventually run out of wax?

1234
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,740
Wouldn't you eventually like wear it down?

1235
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,540
So it's, yeah, I guess.

1236
01:15:56,540 --> 01:16:00,540
But you could fill it with more wax or is it just like, huh?

1237
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,540
Wow.

1238
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,440
Look at that.

1239
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,040
Would you, would you fucking look at?

1240
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:05,340
Yeah.

1241
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,940
And I guess you just kind of smush it.

1242
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:10,340
Yeah, that's awesome.

1243
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,640
That's so cool.

1244
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,740
I love that.

1245
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,240
I want one.

1246
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:20,240
Imagine that you're going around and you're like, you're a young Roman.

1247
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,640
You're going to a fucking school.

1248
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,440
You're going to go to gym class with Milo of Croton from ancient Greece.

1249
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, true.

1250
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,240
And then you're just like, you, you, oh, and some of your friends like, hey, check this out.

1251
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,040
And he's like, I drew.

1252
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,040
I drew as a penis.

1253
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,640
I scratched, I scratched a, I just, I scratched a little picture of, of, of Mr.

1254
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,840
Mr. Mr. of Croton, like taking a dump.

1255
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,340
Haha.

1256
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,140
He, he's so smelly.

1257
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,840
Don't let him see this.

1258
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,240
Check it out.

1259
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,640
He's like, damn, that's damn.

1260
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,140
You, you got to, you got to, you got to rub that out of that wax, dude, before you see it.

1261
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,640
Like, no, I'm, I'm showing everyone.

1262
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,540
I don't know.

1263
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,840
That's fucking wild.

1264
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,840
The more I think about it, the more cool it is.

1265
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,140
Cause like, oh, the other things, every other writing implement,

1266
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:14,640
wears down a pencil or a piece of chalk, like a, you know, a quill with ink.

1267
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,140
Yeah.

1268
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:21,140
And this is like, it's just the illusion of a line, which is the same with everything else.

1269
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,140
But the illusion is made by squishing something.

1270
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:30,140
I assume, I assume you did have to like, like, wouldn't the wax like get dirty?

1271
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:37,140
I feel like, like the wax would get dirty and either you would have to, you would have to like, replace it all the time.

1272
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,140
Or how maybe it just gets dirty.

1273
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,140
Maybe it just gets brown and you're like, whatever, I'm just writing in it.

1274
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,140
I don't care.

1275
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,140
Hmm.

1276
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,140
This is, this is, this is, this is exciting.

1277
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,140
This is an exciting thing to see.

1278
01:17:51,140 --> 01:18:03,140
I love, I love to like, you know, when you, when you find out something from history that's like this, it's, it's, it's fun to think about like, it's, it seems weird.

1279
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:10,140
But like imagine, imagine just like real, like modern day people using it and like envision like, what would it look like?

1280
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,140
Cause like, cause like people back then were not so different.

1281
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,140
They were basically the same.

1282
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:18,140
They just had different like stuff around to use.

1283
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:25,140
So it's no different than if like a modern, modern kids were like carrying around these fucking books of wax.

1284
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,140
It's like, it could happen.

1285
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:33,140
Maybe there's an alternate history where people were using wax tablets up in like, you know, early America or whatever.

1286
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,140
I don't know.

1287
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,140
It's funny.

1288
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,140
It's funny.

1289
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:38,140
It's cool.

1290
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,140
History is neat sometimes.

1291
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,140
Yeah.

1292
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,140
Yeah.

1293
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,140
Yeah.

1294
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,140
Well.

1295
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
How do we get on that?

1296
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,140
Milo getting strong.

1297
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:55,140
Oh, I was complaining that I haven't been able to work out because my rack is disassembled.

1298
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,140
Nice rack.

1299
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,140
It's a nice rack.

1300
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:01,140
I've got a nice rack, you might say, but not at the moment.

1301
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,140
Well, we're an hour and a half in.

1302
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,140
We could go to voicemails.

1303
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,140
Yeah.

1304
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:10,140
Okay.

1305
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,140
Yeah.

1306
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,140
I think I'm all waxed, tablet it out.

1307
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,140
We've, we've waxed.

1308
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:20,140
We've been waxing philosophical about all this stuff for a while now.

1309
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,140
Dude, maybe that's where that comes from.

1310
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,140
God, it might.

1311
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,140
If you're in a philosophy class and you, and you got your wax tablet.

1312
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,140
And you're like, hey, quit.

1313
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:33,140
Just teach it to a slap study or quit waxing philosophical or quit, or quit waxing something

1314
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:36,140
other than whatever I'm talking about.

1315
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,140
Yeah.

1316
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,140
Quit waxing others to it.

1317
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,140
You should be waxing philosophical right now.

1318
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,140
No.

1319
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,140
No.

1320
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,140
I want to draw, I want to draw lewd caricatures of people I don't like.

1321
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,140
Okay.

1322
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,140
Let's.

1323
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,140
What's the ancient, the most ancient lewd?

1324
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,140
That's the, that's a video.

1325
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,140
Well.

1326
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,140
It's a video idea.

1327
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:01,140
I feel, I feel like there's no way that like cave paintings don't have like naked ladies

1328
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,140
in them.

1329
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,140
Naked ladies and perhaps depict the act of, of coitus.

1330
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,140
Maybe.

1331
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:11,140
I feel, I feel.

1332
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,140
I haven't heard of one.

1333
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,140
So.

1334
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,140
Although.

1335
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,140
Maybe, well, maybe all the, the archaeologists are embarrassed.

1336
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:22,140
Although, I mean, I feel like, not that I know a lot of cave about cave paintings, but

1337
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,140
I feel like they mostly depict people naked anyway.

1338
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:30,140
So maybe like they wouldn't have bothered drawing people naked because like they wouldn't

1339
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,140
even care because like everyone's just naked.

1340
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:33,140
Yeah.

1341
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,140
Everyone's naked.

1342
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,140
Everyone fucks.

1343
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,140
It's not really a weird thing.

1344
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,140
Yeah.

1345
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,140
It's not really like a, ooh, but I feel like sex.

1346
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,140
I like it.

1347
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:45,140
The, the, um, what are those, those fertility statues?

1348
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,140
Yeah.

1349
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,140
Little clay figures.

1350
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,140
That, that Venus of whatever.

1351
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:51,140
The, the thick little, little bitches.

1352
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:52,140
There's that.

1353
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,140
Yeah.

1354
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,140
There's that one, the ancient work of ancient pornography.

1355
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,140
The like fertility goddess statue.

1356
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,140
Yeah.

1357
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,140
I know that one.

1358
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,140
Oh, I'm well aware.

1359
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,140
Uh, but that was not like cave.

1360
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,140
That was not like cave painting.

1361
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,140
That was, that was from like a civilization.

1362
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,140
Sure.

1363
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:14,140
They lived, they lived in a society.

1364
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:21,140
But I guess, I guess like the, the idea of a fertility statue may not have been like

1365
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:24,140
an erotic like, oh, oh, oh, oh, sort of thing.

1366
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:29,140
It may have just been like a normal like part of like a statue that you would make about

1367
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,140
anything.

1368
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,140
I think.

1369
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,140
What?

1370
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,140
I don't know.

1371
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:38,140
My impression was that, was that people, was that people whacked off to it.

1372
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,140
But I, but I don't know for sure.

1373
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:42,140
All right.

1374
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:46,140
The first voicemail is called Bob is building an army.

1375
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,140
Three, two, one, go.

1376
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,140
Can't fucking sleep doing this now.

1377
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,140
All right.

1378
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,140
So the PCP community is terrible.

1379
01:21:56,140 --> 01:22:01,140
Tommy not be able to participate in the episode.

1380
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,140
So we must kill the voicemail.

1381
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:09,140
And here's how you do it for the next week.

1382
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:11,140
Anytime you have to fart.

1383
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:12,140
I believe so.

1384
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:16,140
Cored a fart voicemail and give it an innocuous title.

1385
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,140
So Ben doesn't know what it is.

1386
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,140
Speak pipe works on mobile.

1387
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,140
Okay.

1388
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,140
Hold your phone right up against your.

1389
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,140
Okay.

1390
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:29,140
So spam the voicemails and make them so, so bad.

1391
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,140
We'll have to listen to each and every one.

1392
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:35,140
Make them so bad that we have to kill the bit.

1393
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,140
And eventually.

1394
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,140
That's a great idea.

1395
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:40,140
Someone else had this idea.

1396
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,140
The pig person.

1397
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,140
Yeah.

1398
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:48,140
I mean, gaspan.

1399
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,140
The pig.

1400
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,140
The pig was kind of a similar idea.

1401
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,140
Okay.

1402
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,140
Okay.

1403
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,140
That was great.

1404
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,140
Loved it.

1405
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,140
Next one is called.

1406
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,140
It's a it's a fast.

1407
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,140
It's a different file.

1408
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,140
It's called voicemail roulette.

1409
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,140
You got it?

1410
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,140
Oh, okay.

1411
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,140
Yeah.

1412
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,140
It's one of these ones.

1413
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,140
I don't understand why some people submit a link to a

1414
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,140
different.

1415
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,140
Site where they upload their audio.

1416
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,140
I don't like why not?

1417
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,140
Why not just use speak pipe or whatever.

1418
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:21,140
It's fine.

1419
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,140
You ready?

1420
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:25,140
Maybe they don't realize they can upload edited audio or

1421
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,140
something.

1422
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,140
I don't know.

1423
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:30,140
I mean, I actually don't know how submitting on speak pipe

1424
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,140
works.

1425
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,140
So maybe it's something like that.

1426
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,140
Okay.

1427
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,140
You ready?

1428
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,140
Yeah.

1429
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,140
Voicemail roulette.

1430
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,140
Three, two, one, go.

1431
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,140
I've come up with rules for a game you might find interesting.

1432
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,140
It's called the voicemail roulette.

1433
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,140
Should you agree to play this game, you will be obligated to

1434
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:49,140
kill one voicemail per episode.

1435
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:52,140
Voicemailers that are killed must abstain from sending in

1436
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,140
voicemails for a month.

1437
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,140
This will incentivize creation of few high quality voicemails

1438
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,140
as opposed to lots of low quality ones.

1439
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:03,140
It will also provide an element of risk to every episode.

1440
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,140
Increasing viewer engagement.

1441
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,140
This game requires active participation on the side of

1442
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,140
voicemailers.

1443
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:15,140
I like the idea, but we can't enforce it.

1444
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,140
No.

1445
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:22,140
And also the name roulette is like a, it's a gamble.

1446
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,140
You don't know.

1447
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,140
But this is also, this is like saying good voicemails won't

1448
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,140
get shot.

1449
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:32,140
No, I think, I think the idea is that we pick completely

1450
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:33,140
randomly.

1451
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,140
So a good voicemail might get shot.

1452
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,140
But the idea is that like, you want to make, you want to

1453
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:41,140
make as few voicemails as possible.

1454
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,140
Oh, few voicemails.

1455
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,140
Just to lower your chances of being killed.

1456
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:50,140
I mean, what if just one person makes a voicemail?

1457
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:53,140
Do they automatically die or is it just?

1458
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,140
I think so.

1459
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,140
Yes.

1460
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,140
I think that would be the logical conclusion of this rule

1461
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,140
set.

1462
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,140
Okay.

1463
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,140
So now it's a game of chicken.

1464
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,140
Yeah.

1465
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,140
Yeah, basically.

1466
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,140
Everybody will, everybody will be like, they don't know how

1467
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,140
many voicemails are put in.

1468
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,140
And if they put one in, they may be the only one.

1469
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,140
Yeah.

1470
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:13,140
It's, and it's like the, the act, making any voicemail

1471
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:16,140
inherently carries some risk of like, is this one going to

1472
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:19,140
get me picked and get me, and get me killed?

1473
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,140
Yeah.

1474
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:23,140
But there's no, there's, we can't enforce it at all.

1475
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:27,140
We would, we would have to just expect you to voicemailers

1476
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,140
to play along, which I'm sure most of them would.

1477
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,140
It's a fun, it's a funny idea, but I don't know if, if, how

1478
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,140
practical it is.

1479
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:39,140
Next voicemail is called a guy clearly wearing Kringus

1480
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,140
Bingus' skin as a suit.

1481
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,140
Three, two, one, go.

1482
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,140
Oh yeah, I would do it.

1483
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:49,140
I'll never suspect it.

1484
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,140
Hey everybody, Kringus Bingus here.

1485
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,140
Sorry I haven't made a voicemail in a while.

1486
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:57,140
Anyway, the thing that I've been doing, fuck you, it's a

1487
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,140
Kring.

1488
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,140
Just roll with it.

1489
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:03,140
The thing that I think the most recently was moving into a

1490
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,140
house.

1491
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,140
It is fucking awful.

1492
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,140
Cause first thing you have to do is get rid of the old

1493
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,140
occupant, and then you have to move in your stuff and you

1494
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:13,140
have to get rid of the blood.

1495
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,140
It is a mess.

1496
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:19,140
And the thing that I think the most recently was odd

1497
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,140
taxi.

1498
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:23,140
I think that Ben St. would really like to do it.

1499
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,140
Anyways, Kringus Bingus signing out.

1500
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:29,140
Yeah, Kringus Bingus.

1501
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:32,140
I appreciate the voicemail.

1502
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,140
And you're absolutely right.

1503
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:37,140
Moving is a nightmare.

1504
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:38,140
I'm lucky.

1505
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,140
Especially the body.

1506
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,140
Luckily I'm going to have a little more help with the

1507
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,140
second move.

1508
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:47,140
And I mostly have everything from the first move just like

1509
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,140
still in boxes ready to go.

1510
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,140
So my second move won't be as bad.

1511
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,140
The body.

1512
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:59,140
I mean, I don't have to deal with that.

1513
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,140
Fortunately I don't have to deal with any bodies or anything.

1514
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:04,140
But you know, it's still, it's still, it's a real, it's a

1515
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:05,140
real hassle.

1516
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:09,140
So my, my, my deepest sympathies.

1517
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:13,140
Next voicemail is called Question to Ben.

1518
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:16,140
Three, two, one, go.

1519
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:20,140
Did you hate Trixie before she left the PCP?

1520
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:25,140
I was getting there for a while.

1521
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:28,140
Not like all, not like the whole time I knew her or anything,

1522
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:36,140
but like by the time, by the time she rage quit, I was like,

1523
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:39,140
I had been souring on her for a long time.

1524
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,140
Well, for a while, let's say.

1525
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,140
I mean,

1526
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:43,140
Well, how long?

1527
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,140
I mean,

1528
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,140
It wasn't like post retcon four.

1529
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:47,140
It was post, it was post retcon.

1530
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:51,140
I mean, Trixie wasn't, was annoying in some ways at like red,

1531
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,140
about retcon four, but it wasn't like so bad.

1532
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,140
I mean, she was kind of annoying about retcon three, two,

1533
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,140
but it wasn't like so bad that I was like,

1534
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,140
I don't like this person anymore.

1535
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:04,140
No, I think the turning point was, it was the time when I went

1536
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:09,140
on May's stream and that one person read that like George

1537
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:13,140
Floyd was just as bad as, as Michael Chauvin, uh,

1538
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:17,140
just read and I, and I got, got angry about it.

1539
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:21,140
And I, and May kicked me off the stream and then Trixie DM'd

1540
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,140
me to be like, why are you mad at my wife?

1541
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,140
You're just jealous.

1542
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,140
Cause you don't get pussy like me.

1543
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,140
Oh yeah.

1544
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,140
Why don't you, why don't you just get,

1545
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,140
why don't you just get some pussy, Ben?

1546
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:35,140
And then you won't be mad about this kind of thing anymore.

1547
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,140
Leave like, like you fucking idiot.

1548
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:39,140
So I think, I think that was when I was like,

1549
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,140
I don't think I like this person anymore.

1550
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:44,140
Um, yeah, probably.

1551
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,140
That was probably the biggest thing.

1552
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:52,140
Um, the next, do you want, do you want to answer or what?

1553
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:54,140
Oh me?

1554
01:28:54,140 --> 01:29:02,140
I mean, I guess I never disliked her until she rage quit

1555
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,140
and then all of that stuff.

1556
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:08,140
Um, I didn't really have a lot of rapport with her though.

1557
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,140
Yeah.

1558
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:16,140
It was sort of like a, a Gib and Digi or Trixie,

1559
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:20,140
uh, like project wouldn't really work.

1560
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,140
You, you, you guys never had a,

1561
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:26,140
you guys never had a spotlight episode.

1562
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,140
Spotlight episode.

1563
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:30,140
You know how like in My Little Pony or something,

1564
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:32,140
there were some, sometimes an episode would be like

1565
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,140
these two characters.

1566
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,140
Yeah, that was one time.

1567
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:39,140
What if Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie play pranks together?

1568
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,140
There was that one time we did like a My Little Pony

1569
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:45,140
review collab thing, but it was like,

1570
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:47,140
we didn't really work together.

1571
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:52,140
We just sort of had an idea to make the video with both of us in it.

1572
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,140
Right, right.

1573
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:58,140
So Trixie wrote her thing and then I sort of responded to it

1574
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:02,140
and then like they read my script of that.

1575
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,140
You mean this was back in the Pony days?

1576
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,140
Yeah, like Pony review thing.

1577
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:09,140
That was a long, long SM go.

1578
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:14,140
I was like, uh, admired their work and their work ethic.

1579
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,140
Yeah.

1580
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,140
But yeah, I never really,

1581
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:20,140
never really felt particularly strongly about them as a person

1582
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:24,140
until they started like being terrible.

1583
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:26,140
Oh, on a, on a somewhat related note,

1584
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,140
I put, uh, yeah, terrible.

1585
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:31,140
Just, just, just, just terrible behavior,

1586
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,140
just absolutely reprehensible behavior.

1587
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:35,140
Let me, let me be clear about that.

1588
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:37,140
Trixie's behavior is totally unacceptable.

1589
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,140
And I won't, I'm glad.

1590
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,140
I'm glad I will never have to deal with it again.

1591
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:45,140
Um, it wasn't, it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't always as bad.

1592
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,140
Trixie has got, Trixie got much worse,

1593
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,140
like at a certain point.

1594
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:53,140
I think, I think May was a really bad influence on Trixie,

1595
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:56,140
who was very, who was very, who was very,

1596
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:59,140
Trixie is very, Trixie is not very smart and is very susceptible

1597
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:02,140
to it being influenced.

1598
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:05,140
Um, because she thinks, because she thinks she's too smart for it.

1599
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:08,140
And that makes her like more vulnerable to just like believing

1600
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:11,140
dumb things because somebody told her so.

1601
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,140
Um, but on a somewhat related note,

1602
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:18,140
I've been, I've been doing, working on the game and I put some,

1603
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,140
you know, since, since the game about Phantom Horn,

1604
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:25,140
I couldn't help but put a few, uh, references to some,

1605
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:29,140
to some Pony people that I had,

1606
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:33,140
had quote unquote, admire in the, uh, in the game.

1607
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:36,140
So there, there might, there are some Easter eggs in there.

1608
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:40,140
I won't say, I won't say who, I won't say who's in there.

1609
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,140
But, uh, if you're familiar with that scene,

1610
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,140
you might recognize some people.

1611
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Uh, that's, I cackled to myself.

1612
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:54,140
I cackled as I, as I, as I implemented them.

1613
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,140
Um, next voicemail is called small, small turtle house.

1614
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:02,140
Three, two, one, go.

1615
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:05,140
What's your opinion on tow-hell?

1616
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,140
I don't even know what it is.

1617
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:12,140
Uh, it's a, from what I understand, it's a series of,

1618
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:19,140
uh, obscure indie, uh, like bullet hell games with anime characters.

1619
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,140
You know what? Um, I don't, oh, you know, it's not that obscure,

1620
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:27,140
but it's, it's the, it's started very small and it was like

1621
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,140
an internet thing, I think.

1622
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,140
I, I looked into it one time and I played like the first one

1623
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:35,140
and the first one is like really weird and hard to play

1624
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,140
and it's not really a bullet hell.

1625
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,140
It's kind of different.

1626
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,140
I think the, the first one is like a lot different

1627
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,140
than what the series ended up becoming,

1628
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,140
but I played that one on my own years ago.

1629
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,140
And then when I lived at Trixie's, I think it was at like

1630
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,140
Radcon 2 or something.

1631
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:55,140
I think Trixie got me to play one of the, of the Toho games on stream.

1632
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,140
And I think it was like fun.

1633
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,140
I'm not, bullet hells aren't like my favorite genre or anything,

1634
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:04,140
but I thought it was fine and cool, I suppose.

1635
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:06,140
Uh, so.

1636
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,140
And I know there's like fan music.

1637
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,140
I enjoy some of the.

1638
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,140
And there's a lot of music that people like from it.

1639
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,140
The music sounds pretty cool.

1640
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,140
There's a lot of music.

1641
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:19,140
I remember like lots of YouTube poop music video fads of Toho music,

1642
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:21,140
or at least one.

1643
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,140
Like you and Owen was her, like everybody did it,

1644
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,140
like a YouTube poop of that.

1645
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:32,140
And there's a lot of porn, I think, of those characters.

1646
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,140
That's pretty cool.

1647
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,140
I haven't seen, you know what, I might not,

1648
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:40,140
I probably wouldn't even recognize most Toho characters

1649
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,140
if I saw them.

1650
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,140
So.

1651
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
You might recognize Reimu.

1652
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:48,140
People, I know that one because people want her for Smash.

1653
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,140
I know that name.

1654
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:53,140
I might, I might recognize that one if I saw her.

1655
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:56,140
She's got the red dress and she's like the ghost,

1656
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:01,140
like Japanese ghost, which attire with the funny thing.

1657
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,140
With a stick with like the paper diamonds coming off of it.

1658
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,140
Yeah.

1659
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,140
Yeah.

1660
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,140
Yeah.

1661
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:10,140
Uh, so yeah, that's all.

1662
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:12,140
That's all I really had to think about Toho.

1663
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,140
Um, I don't think about you at all.

1664
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:19,140
Uh, next voicemail is called the return dot dot dot.

1665
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:22,140
Three, two, one, go.

1666
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,140
Hey, everybody.

1667
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,140
It's me, Cringy Spingus.

1668
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:31,140
I just want to say, I'm glad to be back after a long hiatus.

1669
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:35,140
And thank you to the guy who made that pink Floyd about me.

1670
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,140
That was really good.

1671
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,140
Who made a pink Floyd about?

1672
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,140
Let's just get right into it.

1673
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:45,140
What I, what I did recently is that I, my family had to watch

1674
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,140
a family friend's dog.

1675
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:52,140
And that dog was really crazy and, uh, just annoying.

1676
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:59,140
And I didn't, he was, he was sweet, but he was real rambunctious.

1677
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:03,140
And there was a lot to him.

1678
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,140
Yeah.

1679
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:07,140
Sounds like, sounds annoying.

1680
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:12,140
What I've been thinking recently is, uh, the, the, the critically

1681
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:20,140
acclaimed, um, live-action drama, suspense, comedy show, Breaking Bad.

1682
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:22,140
And it's really good.

1683
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:26,140
And I do say comedy because Breaking Bad's really funny, actually.

1684
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:28,140
It's, it's, you know, it's suspenseful.

1685
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,140
Sometimes it is.

1686
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:33,140
Serious and it's intense, but also it can be really funny.

1687
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,140
It's an interesting drama about a bunch of different characters

1688
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:41,140
and how, and how they, they interact with each other.

1689
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,140
True.

1690
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:45,140
So yeah, that's, that's what I cring and bang lately.

1691
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:49,140
I'll do some more of these soon and goodbye cringis fingers.

1692
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:51,140
Goodbye cringis fingers forever.

1693
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,140
Goodbye cringis fingers forever.

1694
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:54,140
Yeah.

1695
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:55,140
Yeah. Breaking Bad's pretty good.

1696
01:35:55,140 --> 01:36:00,140
I, you know, I never, I don't think I ever watched the last season

1697
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:02,140
of Better Call Saul.

1698
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:06,140
I think I meant, I watched a bunch of it and then I never finished it.

1699
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,140
I think it went on hiatus for a while and then it came back

1700
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:12,140
and I never got around to watching it, but I liked it.

1701
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,140
And I call Saul was pretty good.

1702
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,140
Damn.

1703
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:18,140
What about that other guy?

1704
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,140
What about that other cringis fingers?

1705
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,140
What's, what's the,

1706
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:24,140
That was the guy clearly wearing a cringis finger skin as a suit.

1707
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,140
Sure.

1708
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:27,140
So what's, what's the story?

1709
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:29,140
Who do I shoot?

1710
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,140
I gotta kill somebody.

1711
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,140
Gotta kill somebody.

1712
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,140
Oh, right.

1713
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:37,140
The Pink Floyd, somebody made the song, right?

1714
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,140
Yes.

1715
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,140
Okay.

1716
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,140
Does anybody remember cringis fingers?

1717
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:44,140
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

1718
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:49,140
We should make that, we should make that the opening song.

1719
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:53,140
It's just, it's just the song of the, it's the theme song now.

1720
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,140
Oh, next one.

1721
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,140
Oh boy.

1722
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:59,140
We've got one of these fucking things we've got.

1723
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:01,140
It's a, it's a comic.

1724
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:02,140
It's a comic.

1725
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:08,140
I guess I'll post it in the, in the general.

1726
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:11,140
Oh, it's a whole fucking thing.

1727
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:15,140
Phantom Horn, then doing his little virgin walk.

1728
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:18,140
Hey, Phantom, hey Phantom Horn.

1729
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,140
Want some cookies?

1730
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,140
No thing.

1731
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,140
That's, that's mage there.

1732
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,140
It's definitely mage.

1733
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,140
Don't be shy.

1734
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,140
We can always make more with my magic.

1735
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:27,140
Yeah.

1736
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,140
Well, bye.

1737
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:29,140
Later.

1738
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:33,140
Horn sells at me topics as unicorns live on easy mode.

1739
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:36,140
This hornoid bitch walked out to me today.

1740
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:37,140
Screech.

1741
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,140
I was worthless for having no magic.

1742
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:43,140
I lost it and called her what she was a worthless.

1743
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:47,140
I don't know what that something had.

1744
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:49,140
I don't know what's, hmm.

1745
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:53,140
I don't know what that, that term being blanked out is there.

1746
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,140
I told that bitch.

1747
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:55,140
I hate hornoids.

1748
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:58,140
So goddamn much.

1749
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,140
This is, this is how.

1750
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:01,140
No.

1751
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:07,140
Is this like an old, um, like mage at the time comic?

1752
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:10,140
Because it feels like it might be.

1753
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,140
I feel like I may have seen this, but.

1754
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:15,140
What do you mean by mage at the time?

1755
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
No, no, no, mage at the time, the comic.

1756
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:18,140
There's no way.

1757
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:21,140
Like this is majoring the Phantom Horn pony days.

1758
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:23,140
There's no way.

1759
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:29,140
Cause this is, this is that guy who's been doing the, the voicemail drawings.

1760
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:30,140
Is it the same guy?

1761
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,140
It looks very different.

1762
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:36,140
I think it's the same guy, but I don't know for sure.

1763
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:41,140
Um, the, the, the Phantom Horn is like dark blue.

1764
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:46,140
They, they must have used like some people draw Phantom like really dark blue.

1765
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:49,140
And then, and it's, it's funny.

1766
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,140
Um, that is, okay.

1767
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:56,140
I think, is this a reference to a shelf, shelf deprecation?

1768
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,140
Do you remember that?

1769
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,140
I don't.

1770
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:05,140
Me and, me and mage were doing a like collab comic where we would like each draw a page.

1771
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:08,140
We would do, like I would draw a page and then she would draw a page and then I would

1772
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,140
get it back and I would draw the next page.

1773
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,140
Yeah, we were, for a while we were doing a.

1774
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:15,140
Was that like a, like a primordial comics jam?

1775
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:17,140
It kind of, yeah, in a way.

1776
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,140
I think it was after.

1777
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:21,140
I think it was after we did the comics jams.

1778
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:24,140
Um, yeah, but this was back in the pony days.

1779
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:28,140
We were, we were doing a comic and she dropped it.

1780
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
By the way, she dropped the ball on it.

1781
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:36,140
I, I never, I never fail at anything.

1782
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:43,140
Um, but the story was about, it was about Phantom Horn, uh, getting.

1783
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,140
It was, fuck.

1784
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:49,140
It's like, I think he's like stealing keg's cookies off the shelf or something.

1785
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:56,140
Uh, and then, yeah, there was going to be a whole thing about like, mage using her magic

1786
01:39:56,140 --> 01:40:00,140
to get the cookies, but it just causes magical, wacky hijinks.

1787
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:03,140
Um, Phantom would not.

1788
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:08,140
Phantom is, um, Phantom wouldn't make a scre, an anti-Hornoid screed.

1789
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,140
Oh my God.

1790
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:13,140
I can't even tell who's one eye through the door.

1791
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,140
Crack is staring at me.

1792
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:21,140
Phantom wouldn't make a, a, an anti-unicorn screed because he's, he's pro unicorn.

1793
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,140
Right.

1794
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:25,140
So he's, um, I don't know.

1795
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:29,140
This is, he must have been having a bad day for him to have this.

1796
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,140
He must have been having a bad day for this.

1797
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,140
This is not, this is not as typical.

1798
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:34,140
His typical reaction would be like, I'm like that too.

1799
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:40,140
It might be, this is why I'm thinking it might be an older thing because like Phantom

1800
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:47,140
would used to kind of be like a little racist against unicorns because he was jealous of

1801
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:48,140
the horn.

1802
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:49,140
What, was he?

1803
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,140
I don't remember.

1804
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:57,140
Well, not like, like overtly, but like sort of, um, actually kind of, like I'm trying

1805
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,140
to remember.

1806
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,140
Well, I don't know.

1807
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,140
This is certainly an interpretation.

1808
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:01,140
Okay.

1809
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,140
There might have been, yeah.

1810
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:07,140
In the early Phantom horn days, there might have been some, he might not have been completely

1811
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,140
consistent about it.

1812
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:14,140
Uh, he, he might have, he might have had a grudge against certain unicorns.

1813
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,140
Maybe.

1814
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:16,140
You know what?

1815
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:21,140
He might, he might have, he might have begrudged certain unicorns for flaunting their, their

1816
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:22,140
magic privilege or something.

1817
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:24,140
I feel like that was something he would do.

1818
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:26,140
It wouldn't call them hornoids though.

1819
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:27,140
No.

1820
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:28,140
Uh, okay.

1821
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,140
Next.

1822
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:38,140
Anyway, I enjoy this is a, this meme is, it's usually like a, I think the original meme

1823
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:44,440
is like white guy meets black guy and black guy is just like, says something normal.

1824
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:50,140
And then white guy goes on forum and is like, oh, I saw some fucking N word today and he

1825
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,140
was so fucking bad.

1826
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,140
Uh, yeah.

1827
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:59,540
I think this, this particular is, is more like in parallel to like, like incels, like

1828
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,140
a normal woman just is normal.

1829
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:02,140
Yeah.

1830
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,140
Like God, what that, that bitch.

1831
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,140
Yeah.

1832
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:06,140
Yeah.

1833
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:09,140
And then it's like completely delusional.

1834
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:11,140
Um, yeah.

1835
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:12,140
You know what?

1836
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:16,140
Honestly, I mean, heck, that version I just described might not even be the original version.

1837
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:18,140
Maybe it was an incels thing first.

1838
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,140
I don't know.

1839
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:20,140
Uh, I like it.

1840
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:24,140
I'm having a, I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, ha ha.

1841
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:28,140
Uh, thumbs, thumbs up.

1842
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:29,140
Okay.

1843
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:32,140
Next voicemail is called nominal consideration.

1844
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:35,140
Three, two, one, go.

1845
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:36,140
Aliases.

1846
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:37,140
Talk about them.

1847
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,140
What do you think makes a good online name?

1848
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:42,140
I would say it requires a balance of brevity, distinctness and aesthetic quality.

1849
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:45,140
Notch is the one of the best out there in my opinion, though it sucks that notches the

1850
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,140
one who got it.

1851
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:51,140
Digibro is my personal favorite alias historically tied to the PCP, though most members or

1852
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:53,140
frequent guests have pretty good ones too.

1853
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,140
I'm I'll die.

1854
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:57,140
And I think while mine is a little clunky phonetically, it succeeds especially well thanks

1855
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:00,140
to how good it looks when written all lowercase with no apostrophe.

1856
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,140
What are your favorite online aliases?

1857
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:03,140
What do you value in them?

1858
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:05,140
Do you agree with my appraisals?

1859
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:09,140
What aliases of PCP members, PCP adjacent folk or commenters and fans over the past

1860
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:12,140
year stand out to you as especially good or bad?

1861
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:15,140
That's too many questions.

1862
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,140
I agree.

1863
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:18,140
I mean, the criteria you lay out.

1864
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:19,140
What is it like?

1865
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:25,140
Distinctness, aesthetic, I mean, aesthetic quality is obviously important, but that's

1866
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:28,140
like very, that's subjective.

1867
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:31,140
Distinct, distinctness is good.

1868
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:35,140
If it's a name that like nobody else has or no one has, like it's like, oh, you get

1869
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,140
confused with somebody else's name.

1870
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,140
That's important.

1871
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,140
Brevity.

1872
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:43,140
Yeah, brevity is important just because you don't want to be brevity.

1873
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:54,140
I think as with any name, beyond a certain threshold of like a household name or a famery,

1874
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,140
it doesn't matter what the name is.

1875
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:02,140
If people know what you are, they'll associate that name with you.

1876
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:06,140
Like dream, for example, is so big and it's just a dictionary word.

1877
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:11,140
It's kind of a shitty name to have, but because he's so big, it works.

1878
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:16,140
Yeah, you know what, about notch and dream, yeah, it works because they're big.

1879
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:22,140
I don't know if I think that dream or notch is like a great name on its own.

1880
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:29,140
Like if they were never, if you'd never heard of them, the name notch wouldn't stick with you.

1881
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:32,140
So I don't know if I agree about that one.

1882
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:41,140
I've always said that a name becomes associated with whatever it's referencing.

1883
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:44,140
So people just get used to it no matter how stupid it is.

1884
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:51,140
But there is a certain amount of like marketable qualities that a name needs to have.

1885
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:56,140
Yeah, like you can't copyright the name dream.

1886
01:44:56,140 --> 01:45:02,140
Yeah, and if it's hard to Google or if it's like a reference to something or a pun,

1887
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:06,140
like my name's like puns, gib and take.

1888
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:08,140
But Gibbs, pretty good.

1889
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:10,140
It works most of the time.

1890
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:19,140
Hippocrates was a lot worse of a name because it's a way that people actually misspell the word sometimes.

1891
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:21,140
I guess so.

1892
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:28,140
And it doesn't really communicate what it's about, although that's not always that important.

1893
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:30,140
I always complain.

1894
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:36,140
I thought that Kantent was a bad name because it is just because it's so...

1895
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:38,140
Okay, people disagreed with me.

1896
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:42,140
I think that it's kind of bad because it doesn't communicate what the show is.

1897
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:45,140
And I think the show needed a name that would communicate what it is.

1898
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:50,140
But worse than that, it's un-Googleable, but like for the different reasons.

1899
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:54,140
It's a common word, but because nobody knows how to spell it and nobody ever spells it right.

1900
01:45:54,140 --> 01:46:00,140
Yes, it is not spelled phonetically and it has like two H's that are silent and it's not a real word.

1901
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:05,140
It's spelled in a way that is like deliberately confusing and that's really bad.

1902
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:07,140
Yes, I always had a problem with that as well.

1903
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:09,140
When it comes to like...

1904
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,140
It's really bad for discoverability.

1905
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:16,140
I feel like it tells you more about what it's about than half in the bag does.

1906
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:18,140
I...

1907
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,140
As a name.

1908
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:23,140
I guess they both communicate basically nothing.

1909
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:25,140
So yeah, I don't know.

1910
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:27,140
That one's not as important.

1911
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,140
Because you're right.

1912
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:31,140
Like if you have a show, you can call it whatever you want.

1913
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:35,140
And once people know it, they're like, oh yeah, that's the name of the show.

1914
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:36,140
I know.

1915
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,140
Yeah.

1916
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:43,140
I mean, this is colloquially referred to as the PCP and we don't talk about that drug.

1917
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:46,140
No, we're Dewey.

1918
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,140
That's in the bonus episodes.

1919
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,140
We're on PCP in every bonus episode.

1920
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:52,140
That's what we pay for.

1921
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,140
I didn't put the bonus episodes up.

1922
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:57,140
Maybe I'll do it this week.

1923
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:59,140
Maybe I'll do it, but maybe I won't.

1924
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:00,140
Maybe I won't.

1925
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:01,140
I don't know.

1926
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:02,140
Who knows?

1927
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:07,140
Next voicemail is another image.

1928
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,140
Put it right there.

1929
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,140
Oh God.

1930
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:12,140
Oh, hang on.

1931
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,140
It's a...

1932
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,140
What's the actor's name?

1933
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:17,140
Is it one of the Phoenixes?

1934
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:18,140
It's not one.

1935
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,140
Is it Joaquin Phoenix?

1936
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,140
And Crazy Frog.

1937
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:25,140
It's Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and Crazy Frog.

1938
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:29,140
Happy about Crazy Frog's pregnancy.

1939
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:33,140
You're going to have a whole bunch of clown tadpoles.

1940
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:38,140
Dude, this is just a homesick image if you think about it.

1941
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:39,140
Yeah.

1942
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:43,140
We go to Subjugilator and...

1943
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,140
And a Frog.

1944
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:46,140
And a Universe Frog.

1945
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:47,140
Mmm.

1946
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:50,140
You know what?

1947
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:52,140
Based.

1948
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:57,140
Next voicemail is from at Mauricio Gamedev.

1949
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:59,140
I assume that's a Twitter handle.

1950
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:02,140
Three, two, one, go.

1951
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:07,140
A few episodes ago, when Ben made a tier list of all the PCP Electors,

1952
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:13,140
a topic was brought up that they still fly Kingdom Hearts, One Piece,

1953
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:19,140
and Final Fantasy wearing really good topics to make a lecture on.

1954
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:24,140
For me, those lectures are a good way to catch up on what was actually happening on those stories,

1955
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:28,140
since there is a lot of stuff to catch up on.

1956
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:33,140
Best example of this is Guilty Gear that I have been playing since I was a kid

1957
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,140
and had no idea what was going on.

1958
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:37,140
Final thing.

1959
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:45,140
Tom is great at doing lectures, and I think he should capitalize more on that for his own stuff.

1960
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,140
Right.

1961
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:50,140
I don't think I said the Kingdom Hearts one was not a good one.

1962
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,140
That one's a great topic.

1963
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:58,140
He pointed that out as the subject matter works, because it's hard to parse otherwise.

1964
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,140
Guilty Gear is the same.

1965
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:04,140
Guilty Gear is similar, because it's something that most people don't know the lore,

1966
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:09,140
and the lore is hard to get your head around and understand.

1967
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:12,140
One Piece and Final Fantasy, I don't think they have a greatness,

1968
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:18,140
because the games just have a story, and it's basically just relating the story of the game.

1969
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:22,140
I guess if you want something to just catch you up and give you a Cliff Notes version,

1970
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:25,140
I guess, sure, it's good for that.

1971
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:28,140
I would say it's better to just read it.

1972
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:33,140
I would say the One Piece one is, if we're talking about just those two,

1973
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:38,140
I feel like the Final Fantasy one is the weakest, because the individual Final Fantasy games

1974
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:44,140
have no relation to each other, and so they don't need to be in the same video.

1975
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,140
You know what I mean?

1976
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:49,140
Oh, thanks, Dad.

1977
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,140
My bacon's here.

1978
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:52,140
Your mother and I had a talk.

1979
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:55,140
I was too hard on you about your hot wheels.

1980
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,140
Thank you.

1981
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:57,140
I'll pick them up for you.

1982
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:58,140
You better.

1983
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:01,140
Just try to remember to pick up your hot wheels next time.

1984
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:02,140
I might, maybe.

1985
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:05,140
Sorry, I brought you some bacon.

1986
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,140
Acceptable.

1987
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:09,140
But however, your mother and I are getting a divorce.

1988
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:10,140
Okay.

1989
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:13,140
Well, you can't win them all, Dad.

1990
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:15,140
Good luck on your podcast, Benjamin.

1991
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:16,140
Thanks, Dad.

1992
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:17,140
I am winning.

1993
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:18,140
It's not dead.

1994
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:19,140
It's daddy.

1995
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:21,140
Okay, daddy.

1996
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:23,140
Thank you.

1997
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,140
You're welcome, son.

1998
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:26,140
I love it.

1999
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,140
Ew.

2000
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:28,140
Okay.

2001
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,140
I got bacon now.

2002
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,140
Sorry to love you.

2003
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:32,140
No.

2004
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:36,140
Yeah, they're my dad.

2005
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:39,140
Dad's gonna do that.

2006
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,140
What is your dad?

2007
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:42,140
What is your dad not love you?

2008
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:46,140
Fucking idiot.

2009
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,140
What was I talking about?

2010
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,140
Oh yeah, lectures.

2011
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:50,140
Tom's lectures are good.

2012
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,140
Okay.

2013
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:54,140
I feel like we've answered this one.

2014
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:55,140
Wait.

2015
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:57,140
This mouse is so sensitive.

2016
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:58,140
I don't like it.

2017
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:00,140
Benjamin, I'm sorry about you and my father.

2018
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:01,140
Oh my God.

2019
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,140
I hate my parents so much.

2020
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:04,140
Why?

2021
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:06,140
I'm trying to record a podcast, Mom!

2022
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:10,140
If you need something to talk about me and your father getting a divorce, Benjamin,

2023
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:12,140
then you can talk to them.

2024
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:13,140
No!

2025
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:15,140
I'm sick of it.

2026
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:17,140
I'm sick of all this bullshit.

2027
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:19,140
I'm cleaning out your father, Benjamin.

2028
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:21,140
I'm taking him to a family court.

2029
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:22,140
I can never remember fucking anything.

2030
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,140
I'm gonna do the amnesia.

2031
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:26,140
I'm gonna deal with lawsuit so fucking fast that we'll never be able to see you again.

2032
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,140
Okay.

2033
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:31,140
I need you to say to the federal court that he abused you and he molested you.

2034
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:34,140
I need you to say that so I can get a nice quick victory.

2035
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:35,140
Sure, Mom.

2036
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,140
Fine.

2037
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,140
Whatever it takes.

2038
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:38,140
Okay.

2039
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,140
I'll give you a lego settlement.

2040
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,140
You just have to make sure that you wake your father through the day.

2041
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:43,140
Two lego sets.

2042
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:44,140
Two lego sets.

2043
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,140
Yeah!

2044
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:49,140
You have to pretend that your father molested you in family court so you can keep the system

2045
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:51,140
rigged against broken fathers.

2046
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:52,140
Absolutely.

2047
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:53,140
Thank you.

2048
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,140
You've got it.

2049
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:59,140
I was gonna do that anyway.

2050
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:00,140
Okay.

2051
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:01,140
I'm sorry.

2052
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,140
I'm so sorry.

2053
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:07,140
I'm so, so sorry about all this bullshit.

2054
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:10,140
Next voicemail is called Peek PCP.

2055
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:13,140
Three, two, one, go.

2056
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:42,140
It's Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas.

2057
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:52,140
They just keep selling.

2058
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:55,140
This is the whole video.

2059
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:56,140
I think so.

2060
01:52:56,140 --> 01:53:06,140
Or it's a minute, 30 of it.

2061
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:07,140
It's catchy.

2062
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:08,140
It's catchy.

2063
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:18,140
Yeah, I remember it being pretty funny.

2064
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,140
Genius.

2065
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:28,140
Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas, Japanese niggas.

2066
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:34,140
You all have to simple hook, a simple concept where it really works.

2067
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:44,340
Yeah, they just kept going because of you

2068
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,340
OK, it finally it's finally over.

2069
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:52,820
Well, I have fun.

2070
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:55,600
Yeah, I'm.

2071
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:01,460
You know, you know, it is what it is.

2072
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:03,380
It's fine, it's cool.

2073
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:13,900
Uh, what a, what a, what a delight. Okay. Next one is called art parlor. Three, two, one, go.

2074
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:24,780
Hey, Ben Shane. I DM'd you on Twitter, but you didn't respond. I was asking if you wanted to be

2075
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:32,940
on my drawing show. It's being just a couple of grandmothers and we do funny drawing challenges.

2076
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:41,020
And then I edit the fuck out of the recording and make a fire video and give if you want to come

2077
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:47,580
on or Tom. That'll be cool. All you guys are invited to the grandma drawing show. I don't remember

2078
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:58,460
getting DM'd by a grandma. Grandma drawing show. Maybe. Maybe sometime if I catch me in the right

2079
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:07,580
mood. Maybe. Maybe. Next one is called hydration. Three, two, one, go.

2080
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:09,900
Give and take.

2081
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:21,980
You say that I need hydration, but there is no water anywhere around here.

2082
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,100
Have you tried pissing?

2083
01:55:52,700 --> 01:56:00,940
100% hot spring macaque water. That is what I need.

2084
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:05,660
Hey, sorry, I'm back. Did I miss anything?

2085
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:10,220
They're thirsty. They need hot spring macaque water.

2086
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:13,740
Who doesn't?

2087
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:25,900
You could also, if you can't piss for liquid, you could cut your veins open and drink that blood.

2088
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:34,860
The body is a wonderland. You're full of delicious liquids. And then you could just cry

2089
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:40,780
about how dry it is and you could make tears and you could get those. And all you need is two

2090
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:45,020
buckets worth. You get two buckets worth of water and then you can make an infinite source of

2091
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:54,540
water. In Minecraft? Yeah. Hell yeah. What do you like? Put one water source block next to another

2092
01:56:54,540 --> 01:57:05,100
one? And then it's infinite. Does it create two more in the square? Yeah, in the other corners.

2093
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:10,860
Hmm. I didn't know that. That's a trick I could use, actually.

2094
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:18,540
Next voicemail is called Tommy J Sucks. Three, two, one, go.

2095
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:28,540
I dread to even speak his name, but please stop playing the Tommy J voicemails.

2096
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:35,100
They're so horrible. You guys shouldn't have to go through them and we shouldn't have to go through

2097
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:43,260
them. They're just pain. They suck. And Tommy J, you suck. Please stop calling in.

2098
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:50,620
I think he just made the one call this week, so maybe it's a solved issue.

2099
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:54,940
They are not labeled in a way that we can identify who put them in before.

2100
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:58,380
Yeah, we just have to recognize the voice.

2101
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:06,220
Next voicemail is called Some Commenters Suck. Three, two, one, go.

2102
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:16,460
Also, commenters, stop leaving comments like, I don't like the podcast now. Bad podcast. You

2103
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:21,020
guys should do a different podcast. I think this is bad and should be something different.

2104
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:29,740
I think you should stop leaving that comment. It's been like a year and you haven't changed

2105
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:38,620
their minds yet. Stop saying the exact same thing over and over and over and over. Please,

2106
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:46,940
just stop watching or just accept that a thing is a thing, that a thing has changed,

2107
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:52,860
and that maybe you don't like it anymore. And maybe you can move on. Please.

2108
01:58:53,660 --> 01:59:01,420
Yeah, I got in a fight. I got in an argument on the last episode in the comments because somebody

2109
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:09,980
left that comment that was like, the podcast is stagged. Why don't you make the podcast something

2110
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:16,220
that would have more, what do they say? Why don't you make the podcast something that would have

2111
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:22,940
more, could actually grow? Why don't you make the podcast something that could grow? Why not

2112
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:34,860
do something else with your creative ambitions? Yeah, okay. First of all, I negatively commented

2113
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:41,420
on that comment and then someone else came in and was arguing at me that I was dumb to not like

2114
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:49,340
that comment. And it's like, okay, the podcast, first of all, I don't even know what they're asking

2115
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:55,260
because the podcast already is about our creative endeavor. We already talk about all the shit we're

2116
01:59:55,260 --> 02:00:04,300
doing. So what do you want? And second of all, why not make the podcast something that can grow,

2117
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:09,260
make the podcast something that'll be more successful? Like what? I don't know. Do they

2118
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:14,780
want us to do the drawcasts again? If you just like the drawcast, then just say you just make

2119
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:23,580
more drawcasts. But I don't understand the mindset that you're like, hmm, the PCP formula

2120
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:29,420
isn't working. So it should be something else. When it has always been, it has always been the

2121
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:35,260
same thing. It has always been, we get together and we just talk about shit once a week. There's

2122
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:39,420
nothing else. I mean, there have been minor changes like the introduction of voicemails and

2123
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:48,380
we don't do that specific chosen topic anymore. But those were changed for a reason.

2124
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:56,540
They recognize that they can't just say, have the other members back. I liked the podcast more

2125
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:01,980
when it was like that. There were more views. If you're a Natehead or a Trixiehead and you just

2126
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:07,580
want to hear Nate or Trixie, I mean, fair enough, you're just not going to get that here anymore.

2127
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:15,820
Then I think they're misunderstanding the reason that the podcast used to get more views and it's

2128
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:24,860
because the people who are on it had bigger channels than me and Ben. Yeah. I mean, the

2129
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:29,500
viewership is not, it is somewhat lower than it is, but it's not like it's completely falling

2130
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:36,780
off the cliff. I mean, the old episodes have more views largely just because they're older

2131
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:42,860
and they've been accumulating views for a while. True. I can't remember exactly, but there was a

2132
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:52,220
time when it was like hotter shit and the episodes were getting like maybe 10K views on a good day

2133
02:01:53,100 --> 02:02:00,140
and that was a fun time. I guess that's true. But that definitely does have to do with the

2134
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:06,940
people who happen to have large audiences being on the show. Trixie just had a bigger audience.

2135
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:13,340
It's not entirely to do with the quality of the show itself because people who were just there

2136
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:20,860
for Nate or just there for Trixie are gone mostly. Yeah. It's true. Or Jesse or whoever.

2137
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:24,940
Yeah. There's really no getting around that.

2138
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:36,620
Yeah. I guess I agree with this voicemail is the takeaway. Next one is called Nathaniel.

2139
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:42,460
Three, two, one, go. Also, also, I don't know if this was intentional,

2140
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:47,420
but you guys were talking about Nate as a role model and Gib just totally dunked on Nate. It

2141
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:50,780
was like, yeah, sometimes when you're little, you don't realize that videos aren't good.

2142
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:55,980
I don't even remember that. I just thought it was really funny that you essentially said like,

2143
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:59,180
yeah, you know, some people just don't realize that all of Nate's stuff is bad.

2144
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:07,020
It's not bad. I didn't mean that. That was an accident, I guess. I don't remember exactly what

2145
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:12,620
you said, but I mean, I like Nate's videos. At least, you know, I've like I've like I enjoyed

2146
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:19,980
me a mouth of her and we Aga was occasionally. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. I never I never watched

2147
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:25,900
a we Aga. I don't think I like I don't think I liked we Aga that much. There was there was a

2148
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:32,620
few that were like, the subject matter was interesting to me, or at least I remember the

2149
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:41,980
what was it when he talked about the guy from One Piece and I can't even remember his name.

2150
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:49,180
Oh, the the the Taffy guy or the the big man pirates, the Mochi guy Mochi guy. Yes. I haven't seen

2151
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:55,900
like I said, I've like never watched it. I think the only me a mouth of that I have what no not

2152
02:03:55,900 --> 02:04:00,220
me about I think the only we Aga I ever watched all the way through was because people were

2153
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:06,380
complaining about it in my discord. And it's because it's the one where he it's the one where

2154
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:13,500
he like walks back and clarifies that like, no, his Galco Chan video is not a body positivity

2155
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:19,340
video. He does not support fat women. That was kind of cringe. I didn't know that one's awful.

2156
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:23,580
That one's I didn't watch it until someone told me it's like, and I was like, there's no way he

2157
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:27,580
says that. And I went back and he watched, he's like, no, that's exactly what he says. He's like,

2158
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:33,260
he's just like, no, this is not the message of that video. This is not in support of like,

2159
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:38,780
as a body positive thing. And I want to clarify, I want to clarify. No, it is not. Yes, that's

2160
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:45,420
literally it. That's literally the point of that we Agua. There's there's. Yeah, although it's hard

2161
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:50,140
to find because it's not labeled. Then there are a bunch of we Agos that have like, that I'm that

2162
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:56,220
mentioned the Galco Chan video in them, I think. So sometimes I try to find it and I'll accidentally

2163
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:01,500
find another one where he isn't talking about it. There's one, though, where he says that one

2164
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:06,460
sucks. I don't like the Tifa, the Tifa boobs one is shitty, too. People complain about that one.

2165
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:11,580
And I watch it. I'm like, yeah, it sucks. That's annoying. Anyway, my comment about like, when

2166
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:17,180
you're young, you don't know what videos are good or not. And I think I was mostly talking about

2167
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:25,580
myself. Because like, you're young, you don't know, you don't know shit. I was into thunder for a while.

2168
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:33,900
Like a while. Yeah, like, he's he has merits in his science stuff. But yeah, he's a shithead. And

2169
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:39,660
I didn't realize that quite so much. I didn't really I only heard about Thunderfoot through

2170
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:44,860
people like criticizing his politics. I didn't I didn't realize that he does like other, like

2171
02:05:44,860 --> 02:05:50,940
science stuff, which I'm sure is probably fine. It's his better stuff. He does like, he does like

2172
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:57,660
debunks of bullshit. He hates Elon Musk, and he thinks he's like a con man. And so that's

2173
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:03,260
kind of based true like his his his like, obsession with Anita Sarkeesian.

2174
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:09,260
I mean, he wasn't he's not the only one. He's not the only one. And it yeah, but like,

2175
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:14,860
it's kind of cringe. Like, I didn't really notice it when I was subscribed, because just a video

2176
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:19,020
comes out every so often. But then you look at the playlists, and it's like, I don't know 100

2177
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:26,300
videos about why Anita Sarkeesian and feminism is stupid. Right. And it's like, uh, yeah, that's

2178
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:39,420
not very good. True. Yeah. Okay, next one is called I'm so hurt by never pain. Three, two, one, go.

2179
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:51,500
Oh, yeah. Fuck you.

2180
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:57,260
Yeah.

2181
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:01,820
No, false, false.

2182
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:14,700
Pain her anime has a weight loss problem in yours.

2183
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:21,660
No, I'm sorry.

2184
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:31,260
You know, I know what you're talking about. I mean, maybe meeting a first land

2185
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:32,460
makes sort of. Like, I know I can really effectively you're this like a

2186
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:39,260
gobbledig monster.

2187
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:43,260
I think this is like a golem like talking to himself kind of thing.

2188
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:50,000
I don't know, really honestly, I saw Cocoa's was better than the PCP at the end.

2189
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,580
Although that wasn't a showscore, I think.

2190
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:58,100
I mean, no.

2191
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:01,480
Major cope, major cope energy.

2192
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:02,480
Mae was always bad.

2193
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,460
I wanted to like Mae.

2194
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:07,820
Her videos were sort of okay, I guess.

2195
02:08:07,820 --> 02:08:11,020
I'll be honest, I didn't watch the anime has a weight loss problem video.

2196
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:12,620
It was an OK idea.

2197
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,580
I guess some sort of body positive, something or other.

2198
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:21,720
The hero we need, Nate refused to be the hero that fat girls need.

2199
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:23,520
So may had to do it.

2200
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:29,920
Yes. Yes.

2201
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,020
Get owned, get owned, never paint.

2202
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:35,780
Next one is called Ben, this is your doctor.

2203
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:38,740
Geez, three, two, one, go.

2204
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:42,740
So there's been a lot of talks on bringing back certain old members

2205
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:47,020
of the peace of mind, considering the certain shambles of the peace of mind

2206
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:48,320
right now.

2207
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,720
I love it. Ouch.

2208
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:53,120
Like a popular one is saying, you should come back.

2209
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,820
How we talk about fucking

2210
02:08:57,020 --> 02:09:00,220
Trixie Doodle, but.

2211
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:05,180
You'll forget one very important person, one very important piece

2212
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:10,920
of the puzzle that could come back and bring the PCP to its former fucking glory.

2213
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:13,920
And that is my boy, Cy live.

2214
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:19,720
Bring Cy live to the PCP and see the bitch's rise or or don't go off.

2215
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:20,980
OK, those are your two options.

2216
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:23,220
I'm giving Dr. Wolf or Cy live.

2217
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,280
Cy, is Cy live?

2218
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:27,220
Cy pillow, blue pill.

2219
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:29,720
Is who is that?

2220
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,120
Cy like S.Y.Y.

2221
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:33,280
I can only assume.

2222
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,080
I don't know. I talked about this.

2223
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:39,280
I asked him, I asked him if he wanted to be on and he just said no.

2224
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:42,380
He just was like, no, I don't want to come on the PCP.

2225
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:45,780
He's like, oh, OK, I don't know what his problem is.

2226
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:51,020
But he he just was like, no, no, no, like reason given.

2227
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,180
You know, it would never happen.

2228
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:54,680
We would have to like trick Dr.

2229
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:58,780
Wolf, but I kind of want to interview him about like,

2230
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:04,420
what the fuck is up with the everything you're doing, including TF2 analysis anarchy?

2231
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:08,560
Well, TF2 analysis, it's it's TF2 analysis.

2232
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:11,260
Anarchy is like the funniest thing that has ever existed.

2233
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:16,660
Yes, but there's a lecture in that, but I don't want to watch any of my God.

2234
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:18,060
You're so right.

2235
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:19,020
You're a genius.

2236
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,860
Give your own fucking genius.

2237
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:23,460
That would be so good.

2238
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:27,960
But it's like I've only watched the first one and I was in it.

2239
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:30,720
And then the other ones were like, oh, God, this is unbearable.

2240
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:34,360
I can't I can't imagine doing the research that would make

2241
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:37,920
an amazing, amazing lecture.

2242
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:40,060
I love that.

2243
02:10:40,060 --> 02:10:41,360
But Dr.

2244
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:45,720
Wolf, from what I can tell, he's mostly just doing like, you know,

2245
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,420
pretty normal like YouTube stuff.

2246
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:52,220
He'll upload like a two minute video where he like reacts to like a new bit

2247
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:56,320
of information that was just revealed about like the Gen 5 MLP.

2248
02:10:56,620 --> 02:10:59,420
Hold on, Dr. Wolf 01.

2249
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:01,020
Let me let me see what's what's he doing?

2250
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:06,120
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

2251
02:11:08,020 --> 02:11:13,120
Hip pedals, mixing royalty and social media is hitched.

2252
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:19,820
The next Fluttershy season five trailer reaction, sunset shimmer, audition announcement.

2253
02:11:19,820 --> 02:11:20,820
OK, he's doing something.

2254
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:23,220
He needs auditions or voice actors for something.

2255
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:31,120
Yeah, he's he's he's doing he's doing a lot of like little mini like videos

2256
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:35,320
where he like just notices something about the new MLP.

2257
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:37,920
He's priming his audience.

2258
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:43,920
He's priming his audience for a big comeback with with with with Gen 5.

2259
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:51,020
Oh, and he's still he's still hanging out with Josh Scorcher and Lightning Bliss.

2260
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:55,020
You know, the cool the cool kid's crowd.

2261
02:11:55,420 --> 02:12:01,220
Oh, who's who it who I'm sorry.

2262
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:06,520
Who is this pony right here?

2263
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:10,720
I want to I want to meet that pony and the bottom left with the red with the red

2264
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:13,520
and black hair. Now, that's an O.C.

2265
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:18,220
If I've ever seen I don't know that's and I'm excited.

2266
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:23,320
I mean, give me give me like alarm bells ring in red and black.

2267
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:27,120
You know what they say, red and black.

2268
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:30,720
I attack sexually.

2269
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,320
Yes, yes, good.

2270
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:37,520
Next voicemail, I think.

2271
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:42,520
It's called so I can just have Ben say anything here, huh?

2272
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:44,720
Three, two, one, go.

2273
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:49,320
So a lot of people are talking about how the PCP needs some new blood

2274
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:50,120
and I agree.

2275
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:53,720
But at the same time, the names getting thrown around don't really meet

2276
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:54,620
the proper guidelines.

2277
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:57,420
I don't think let's go over what makes a good PCP member.

2278
02:12:57,520 --> 02:12:58,820
Number one, content creator.

2279
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,820
Yeah, and most of them are that.

2280
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:02,020
So I'll give them a point for that.

2281
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:06,320
But as we go on number two, trans most of them aren't trans.

2282
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:07,620
So, you know, right there.

2283
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:10,420
Number three, Christ conscious level of four or higher.

2284
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,720
None of them have that.

2285
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,420
So I mean, that won't resonate.

2286
02:13:13,420 --> 02:13:15,120
I bet literally that will not resonate.

2287
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:19,520
I can't see them like saving the world with the love battleship number

2288
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,720
four killed and eight a man's heart.

2289
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:24,220
Maybe some of them have done this.

2290
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:26,620
It's possible, but they're not talking about it.

2291
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:27,820
That's missed content.

2292
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:30,520
Like we want that if they're not, if they're not the reason people are

2293
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:34,620
dying and I don't even want to hear uncircumcised none of them.

2294
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:38,820
Like you may as well just say, hey, yeah, the PCB should die.

2295
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,320
Put these people on and let it die.

2296
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:41,420
Pathetic.

2297
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:46,220
I like a man with standards.

2298
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,220
You know what?

2299
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,620
This guy, this guy, he's just being pragmatic.

2300
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:53,420
Look, he's looking at it the way it really is.

2301
02:13:53,520 --> 02:14:00,020
No, no, no sugarcoating next voicemail is called cope dot mp3

2302
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:01,920
three, two, one, go.

2303
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:07,320
What if what if like Nate is just like waiting, you know, to

2304
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:08,120
be on the podcast?

2305
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:11,420
What if he's got a big, big plan, you know, he's got a big comeback

2306
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:13,920
reveal, you know, what's all the rad content is out?

2307
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:17,120
You know, what's all the rad content things?

2308
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:21,520
Would it like he's got something planned, you know, like, oh,

2309
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,920
yeah, dude, like, oh, my God.

2310
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:34,820
Oh, my God, dude, it's going to be like a big horseshoe finale,

2311
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:39,720
like big reveal, like it was all part of my plan kind of thing.

2312
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:42,820
The views jumped to 1200.

2313
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,720
Oh, yeah.

2314
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:49,520
Oh, we're, we're, we're back, baby.

2315
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:53,420
Oh, the next one is an Imjur link.

2316
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:56,420
So let's take a look here.

2317
02:14:58,820 --> 02:14:59,920
Why do I look like that?

2318
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:03,720
Now that you're moving apartments, you'll be more responsible

2319
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:04,920
with your money, right?

2320
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:09,020
Big boy, let the good times.

2321
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:12,120
Why am I with horses?

2322
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,120
What are these parties doing?

2323
02:15:14,120 --> 02:15:15,120
Are they hooking us?

2324
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:18,620
They're your escorts, escorts.

2325
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:19,220
Yeah.

2326
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:19,620
Yeah.

2327
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:21,120
I mean, you're at a casino.

2328
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,620
Why is my hair like golden?

2329
02:15:24,620 --> 02:15:25,620
Like, man.

2330
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:34,920
It's a lot to like about this.

2331
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:36,520
I made it.

2332
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:37,120
I made it.

2333
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:39,620
I'm at the top of the food chain on top of the pole.

2334
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:42,920
I got my Citibank custom cash card.

2335
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,720
I'm never, I'm untouchable.

2336
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:48,420
So it's time to just roll the dice on Bitcoin.

2337
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:52,820
Actually, I did, I did, I did upset selling my Bitcoin

2338
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:54,520
because I was like, I don't know.

2339
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,420
I was like too scared.

2340
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:58,520
I was too scared of it dropping.

2341
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:00,820
So I basically broke even now.

2342
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:02,420
I pretty much broke even broke even.

2343
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:03,020
Yeah.

2344
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:06,020
It went up for a bit and then it kind of like went back to

2345
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:06,820
around where it was.

2346
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:11,020
And I was seeing in the, it was, it was slowing down

2347
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:16,120
and it's still kind of hovering, but like it's not really going up.

2348
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:18,120
I was seeing people.

2349
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:22,220
I was seeing the word exhaustion thrown around a lot

2350
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:25,620
and I was like, people were saying like Bitcoin.

2351
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:28,720
Oh, wait, it jumped.

2352
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:30,420
Oh, it actually jumped up.

2353
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:34,120
Oh, it's not, it's not that big of a jump or is it?

2354
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:35,720
Don't trick yourself, Ben.

2355
02:16:35,820 --> 02:16:38,420
Oh, it actually think of the larger scale.

2356
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:42,120
It actually went, it actually went up a bit today.

2357
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:46,920
So that's, I mean, it's still, yeah, it still hasn't gone back up to,

2358
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:47,920
oh, damn it.

2359
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,020
It's having a good day today, but it hasn't gone back up to 50K

2360
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:57,420
or it almost, wait, why doesn't it say that it hit 50K?

2361
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:59,120
It did briefly hit 50K.

2362
02:16:59,220 --> 02:17:00,920
Why does it, why does it say it didn't?

2363
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:02,220
What is this?

2364
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:03,820
What is wrong with this chart?

2365
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:06,920
Oh, that was back.

2366
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:08,820
Oh, wait, that was longer ago than I thought.

2367
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:10,220
It's coming.

2368
02:17:10,220 --> 02:17:11,520
It's climbing again.

2369
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:14,820
It's climbing again, but people were saying it's getting exhausted.

2370
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:16,520
I hate it.

2371
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:17,520
I fucking hate it.

2372
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:21,420
No matter what, even if I own Bitcoin or I don't own Bitcoin,

2373
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:23,020
I'm always losing all the time.

2374
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:23,820
There's no escape.

2375
02:17:24,420 --> 02:17:26,620
I can't, like, no, no, no more.

2376
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:29,020
Yeah, you gotta, you gotta let it go.

2377
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:32,520
Probably.

2378
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:36,620
You gotta jump in when it's really far down.

2379
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:44,320
This is what, okay, but if it was going to go up, it would still be worth buying

2380
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:47,720
even if it's high, if it was going to go even higher, it would still be worth it.

2381
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:52,320
I think that, well, the thing I think is that the precedent has been set

2382
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:56,620
that it will probably not be as high as it is right now because it's quite fucking high.

2383
02:17:58,320 --> 02:18:01,320
So it's likely it's going to go down before it goes up again.

2384
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:06,320
It was, I mean, it was and it still is possible that like the first big spike

2385
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:09,320
this year was only the beginning and it will spike even higher.

2386
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:12,120
Like, and like that was just like the first possible.

2387
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:16,120
But it is so hard to predict that it's like not worth trying to.

2388
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:21,620
My, my, my thought was like, my thought was like, if I don't own any Bitcoin

2389
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:26,420
and it goes to the moon, then I've, then I've lost a ton of money, basically.

2390
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:29,920
So it's like, well, I better have some just in case.

2391
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,620
Oh, people are saying it's or it's people were saying it was bullish.

2392
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:37,620
Now people are saying, it looks like it's losing steam.

2393
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:40,420
It might be bearish and like, who fucking knows?

2394
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:45,420
I mean, nobody knows, but everybody, everybody together thinks they know.

2395
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:46,420
Yeah.

2396
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,720
And so what they say kind of does influence the market.

2397
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:51,020
Yeah.

2398
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:53,920
Because it influences other people who think, oh, yeah, these people know

2399
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,920
what they're talking about and now I know what they're talking about.

2400
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:58,220
And now we all know what we're talking about.

2401
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:02,520
And it's like they've tricked each other into believing that it's not going up.

2402
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:04,120
So it just doesn't actually go up.

2403
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:06,420
Yeah.

2404
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,920
I mean, you're right.

2405
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:10,520
I'm just, I'm just looking at this image again.

2406
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,320
I guess that's Applejack.

2407
02:19:12,620 --> 02:19:13,220
Is that yes.

2408
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:14,220
Applejack and Twilight.

2409
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,020
Is it?

2410
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:16,320
I guess it's Twilight.

2411
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:17,820
That's definitely Applejack.

2412
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,320
And I'm just having a, I'm having a ball.

2413
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:23,020
You know, I wish, I wish this were me.

2414
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:26,320
It's so determined.

2415
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,620
Like, yeah, here we go.

2416
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:33,120
You're super large head makes the hand look like a baby hand.

2417
02:19:33,220 --> 02:19:37,520
What, like, what picture, what video is this image of me from?

2418
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:38,520
I don't recognize.

2419
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,420
It's all like warped and distorted.

2420
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:42,020
And I don't know why.

2421
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:43,220
Why would you do?

2422
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,020
Why would you stretch out on five?

2423
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:46,520
Why?

2424
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,620
I don't know what the point was.

2425
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:50,720
Oh, it looks, I look like a freak.

2426
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:53,820
This is great.

2427
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:57,920
The next, next voicemail is also an image.

2428
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,020
So let's see.

2429
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:00,720
Oh God.

2430
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:05,020
Ew, I don't know what this is.

2431
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:11,820
It's a, it looks like a, a fake monkey head robot on wheels.

2432
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,920
I don't, and it says the PCP in current time.

2433
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:18,320
I, I feel like this is a reference that I don't get.

2434
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:20,420
Like, I don't know what this thing is.

2435
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:23,520
I guess it's a reference or it could just be a bizarro meme.

2436
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:25,020
Like, it's just weird.

2437
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:25,820
And that's the point.

2438
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:27,220
Hmm.

2439
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:30,420
I can't because I don't think I can glean any like.

2440
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:32,620
Meaning out of this image.

2441
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:34,920
No, I'm not, I'm not getting anything from it.

2442
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:35,820
I'm sorry.

2443
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:36,520
I'm sorry.

2444
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:37,020
I'm sorry.

2445
02:20:37,020 --> 02:20:42,420
Big cheese shimolinsky at pinkypie.com who sent this next

2446
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:43,920
one is called Sigma.

2447
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,620
It's the Greek letter Sigma.

2448
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:47,720
Three, two, one, go.

2449
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,620
Do you think the collapse of human civilization will happen

2450
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:54,420
during the 21st century?

2451
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:59,820
No, no, people thought things are going to collapse.

2452
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:03,220
I mean, global warming is pretty big, but the,

2453
02:21:03,220 --> 02:21:06,320
yeah, but it's only going to start at the end of the century.

2454
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:09,620
It's like, it's a terrible, if it continues the way it is,

2455
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:12,120
you know, it's, it's not going to.

2456
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:13,020
Right.

2457
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:15,520
I mean, global warming is bad and we'll have catastrophic

2458
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:19,220
consequences, but it isn't going to like end civilization.

2459
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:24,720
I mean, unless it will just get really, really full of death

2460
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:27,020
for a while and then have less humans.

2461
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:28,520
Yes, that's right.

2462
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:30,820
So it's fine, actually.

2463
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:35,320
No, it's not life will grow and kill us all.

2464
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:38,320
Things are not, things are not that precarious.

2465
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:40,720
Like it's not, we're not under an existential threat of like

2466
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:42,420
there will be no more civilization.

2467
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:45,720
Like the infrastructure that exists will mostly continue

2468
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:46,620
to exist.

2469
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:47,820
Yeah.

2470
02:21:47,820 --> 02:21:52,420
People, people do like to imagine that they are at the

2471
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:54,520
end times because that makes them more important.

2472
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:58,220
Like I'm the last person who will see like stuff.

2473
02:21:58,520 --> 02:21:59,120
Yeah.

2474
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:00,520
But no, probably not.

2475
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,720
Probably not.

2476
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:05,920
No, it's things are pretty dire in a lot of ways, but it's

2477
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:08,920
not like, it's not end times bad.

2478
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:13,120
Next, I wouldn't rest on your laurels, but I also wouldn't

2479
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,120
like doomerize.

2480
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,920
Like there's no hope because they're clearly that's what

2481
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:18,520
that's what they want.

2482
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:21,020
That's what like oil companies stuff want people to be like,

2483
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:22,720
well, global warming happened.

2484
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:24,620
We fucked it up.

2485
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:25,820
There's nothing we can do.

2486
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,820
Nothing we can do.

2487
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:28,420
Well, better just say fuck it.

2488
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,720
We're already facing the about that's what they want you

2489
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:31,220
to think.

2490
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:34,920
Because then because then you don't have to fucking do

2491
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:35,820
anything about that.

2492
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:43,320
Next one is called Rx like the prescription 321 go.

2493
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:45,720
Hey, PCP.

2494
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:48,720
So a couple of weeks ago, someone suggested the name

2495
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:50,920
Nate mates instead of Nate heads.

2496
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:54,520
So I just wanted to suggest the name Ben pals instead of

2497
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:55,320
Ben heads.

2498
02:22:55,620 --> 02:22:57,420
Oh, you send me the great work.

2499
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:59,420
Ben pals is pretty good.

2500
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,320
Yeah, it's in Ben pals.

2501
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:03,920
That works really well actually like a pen pal.

2502
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,120
But for me.

2503
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:07,620
It's like a pen pal.

2504
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:11,020
But when that meme where you put a B instead of a P with a

2505
02:23:11,020 --> 02:23:12,020
B emoji.

2506
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:17,720
Yeah, beater beater Griffin.

2507
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:21,520
Then I don't I don't know the meme actually.

2508
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,420
I mean, I can imagine it.

2509
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:25,020
What is it?

2510
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:28,720
It's called if I Google B for P meme.

2511
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:33,120
Yeah, I don't really know if has a name be emoji meme.

2512
02:23:36,520 --> 02:23:37,720
It's just the letter B.

2513
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:41,720
Oh, that emoji.

2514
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:45,720
Yeah, the red regional indicator red letter B.

2515
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:47,720
Oh, I was imagining like the bug.

2516
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:49,820
No, no, I see.

2517
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:50,420
I see.

2518
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:52,920
Yeah.

2519
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:53,420
Okay.

2520
02:23:53,420 --> 02:23:54,420
Yeah, I've seen people do that.

2521
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:59,420
But the bug Venus put my Venus in the whatever bet this

2522
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,220
bet bet yes, that's it.

2523
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:06,420
That one low volume to asshole again three two one go.

2524
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:11,420
Hey guys, it's that low volume to asshole again.

2525
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:12,620
True.

2526
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:16,820
In light of recent events and the shitstorm surrounding Ben

2527
02:24:16,820 --> 02:24:19,820
and pretty much every single TV farmer ever.

2528
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:21,320
I'm just wondering.

2529
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:26,220
You know, has there ever been a point of your life where you

2530
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:29,820
hated Twitter so much that you just simply just want to

2531
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:32,620
straight up delete your account for something because

2532
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:37,320
no shit cannot be good for your psyche in the long run.

2533
02:24:38,620 --> 02:24:43,620
You know, it isn't it's not really sad when some people

2534
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:46,020
just don't want to fucking downward spiral.

2535
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:51,320
You know, say what you will about Will Whedon at least he

2536
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:53,620
realized how much of an asshole he was on Twitter and

2537
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,020
needed his account.

2538
02:24:56,420 --> 02:25:00,420
No, it's just I fucking hate life.

2539
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:06,520
Now, are you saying that I'm on a downward spiral because

2540
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:07,220
of Twitter?

2541
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:09,720
Maybe maybe a little bit.

2542
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:12,120
I don't think it happens to everyone.

2543
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:15,620
If you if you if you stay there too long, it's a very bad

2544
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,520
place to be.

2545
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:19,520
Yeah, I've you know, I think I'm cutting back.

2546
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:22,620
I'm happier when I'm I'm happier when I'm not using Twitter.

2547
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:26,320
So, you know, I was on a bunch for that for the whole Chris

2548
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:30,020
thing, but like in times when I don't have anything to be

2549
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:30,720
posting about.

2550
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,920
Yeah, I'm probably going to be a little more a little less

2551
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:34,720
on Twitter.

2552
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:38,720
You know, unless like I there's something that I feel like

2553
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:40,220
I need to be posting about.

2554
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:47,620
Next one is called silly question for give three to one

2555
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:48,220
go.

2556
02:25:49,220 --> 02:25:50,720
Whatever happened to Gibbon finale?

2557
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:52,220
Whatever happened?

2558
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:54,620
Oh, I give him finale.

2559
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,020
I'm sort of taken aback.

2560
02:25:58,020 --> 02:25:59,220
Someone even knows what that is.

2561
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:00,820
I don't even remember mentioning it.

2562
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:06,520
Um, but I guess in the vein of horseshoe finale, I wanted to

2563
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,120
have like.

2564
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:11,720
Uh, Gibbon, the character, the pony.

2565
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:12,820
Yeah, yeah.

2566
02:26:13,820 --> 02:26:17,820
Uh, I sort of set a few things in motion when I ended the

2567
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,820
Gibbon take a review show on the on, you know, with the

2568
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:22,820
pony character.

2569
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,920
Yeah, yeah.

2570
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:27,620
And I was thinking, what if all of the instances of Gibbon

2571
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:31,620
take were like part of like this big grand adventure plot

2572
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:35,020
that all culminated in a big fucking thing and I had so

2573
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,720
many fucking ideas and I was going to have like hippo was

2574
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:40,820
going to be there and action giraffe and phantom horn and

2575
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:44,820
teabap and, you know, it was going to be a big thing with

2576
02:26:44,820 --> 02:26:48,220
everybody and it was going to be like home stock.

2577
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:50,120
It was going to be so fucking sick.

2578
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:50,920
Yes.

2579
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:51,520
Yes.

2580
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:55,220
And of course I realized at some point I was like, wait, I

2581
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:56,020
should just do that.

2582
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:58,120
But it like an original comic idea.

2583
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:01,420
I don't need to fucking make it about my fucking pony review

2584
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:01,820
show.

2585
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:03,520
Kind of.

2586
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:04,820
Yeah, that's kind of true.

2587
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:08,920
Because I was I put so much effort into like that and I never

2588
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:11,820
showed anyone the plans I had.

2589
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,520
It was so fucking ridiculous.

2590
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:18,020
Well, did you did you like reincorporated into something

2591
02:27:18,020 --> 02:27:18,520
else?

2592
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:19,520
Hmm.

2593
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:21,020
Oh, who knows?

2594
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:24,520
Hmm, I'll never tell.

2595
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:26,720
Well, I'm okay.

2596
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:30,020
Well, now I wait.

2597
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:31,220
What is it?

2598
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:32,520
What does it mean?

2599
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:34,320
What does it mean?

2600
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:38,120
I want to know what like where did it what did it end up as?

2601
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:42,820
Okay, if you'd spoilers or something, then I guess then I

2602
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:45,620
guess we'll just move on.

2603
02:27:46,820 --> 02:27:48,120
So there's the answer.

2604
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:55,020
I thought I thought that give was killed in a pirate ship

2605
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:55,720
explosion.

2606
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:57,220
Yes.

2607
02:27:57,220 --> 02:28:00,020
Well, you know, all right, here's some lore that I'm never

2608
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:00,720
going to use anywhere.

2609
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,920
So I may as well explain.

2610
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:05,620
So give and take the pony wasn't me.

2611
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:10,520
I was a separate person and we were like, yeah, he he was the

2612
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:13,320
pony or I guess he was your own seat.

2613
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:15,420
Oh, is she?

2614
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:16,820
Well, you know what?

2615
02:28:16,820 --> 02:28:17,520
I don't know.

2616
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:22,320
It's completely it's up to I they were always like gender

2617
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:23,320
non-specific.

2618
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:25,820
Yeah, look in anyway.

2619
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:30,320
Yeah, I guess I guess they wait shit.

2620
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:34,220
I was going to say they're your oh, they're your OC from

2621
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:35,620
Dimension C one nine seven.

2622
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,520
So you know when the merge happens, you'll meet.

2623
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:42,620
I think and the end and they'll kill you if they don't like

2624
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:44,220
how you've treated them as a character.

2625
02:28:44,220 --> 02:28:47,920
Oh, no, I didn't kind of abuse them or I made fun of them.

2626
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,920
In the first in the first thing dying the marriage video.

2627
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:54,320
I used the give and take pony OC.

2628
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:58,220
It was like at the end of one of my like compilations.

2629
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:03,420
I was like, hmm, maybe I should do my little pony reviews,

2630
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:06,020
but I'll need no C and then a little character comes up and

2631
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:07,020
says, what about me?

2632
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:08,320
And I'm like, no.

2633
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:13,720
And he says, okay, but then I end up using it from then on

2634
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:17,920
they speak through me the pony review stuff and then I get

2635
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:21,620
bored of that and I stop but I have like a ending where give

2636
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:26,120
and take the pony goes off on a pirate ship to the ocean and

2637
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:28,620
then they get attacked by a pirate ship.

2638
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:34,520
Another one that has like a Kim possible discord sort of sale

2639
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:39,420
that nobody noticed as it was other brony analysis pirate evil.

2640
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:40,720
They killed him.

2641
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:46,720
He's dead except he didn't die because he turned up in crown

2642
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:50,520
princes animated version of a moment with Dr.

2643
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:51,920
Wolf starring me and Dr.

2644
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:56,120
Wolf and then I showed up in that Kim possible.

2645
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:59,420
Like let's go and meet the bronies animated segment.

2646
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:00,520
Yeah, I think.

2647
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:02,920
And it was also there.

2648
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,320
He was also there.

2649
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:09,220
Give was I mean, give was also in a TBAP resurrection.

2650
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:15,120
Yes, TBAP resurrection and well, TBAP resurrection is that

2651
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:21,320
version of of Gibb is with a starboard starboard bow Jesse's

2652
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:27,720
pony and because I had been lost at sea or the given the pony

2653
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:31,920
had been lost at sea presumed dead actually joined a pirate

2654
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:36,120
crew with starboard bow started reviewing ponies on the pony

2655
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:38,320
cursed crew.

2656
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:38,920
Yeah.

2657
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:39,720
Yeah.

2658
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:42,220
Wasn't there a video though where like you like put up some

2659
02:30:42,220 --> 02:30:46,220
binoculars and you like see like oh oh his ship exploded.

2660
02:30:46,220 --> 02:30:47,220
Oh, he's dead.

2661
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:48,620
No, the ship sank.

2662
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:49,220
It was off.

2663
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:52,520
It was binoculars and it was like oh shit.

2664
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:55,920
There's the ship and it got hit by a cannonball and it sank,

2665
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:57,920
but you didn't see anyone die.

2666
02:30:58,020 --> 02:30:58,520
Hmm.

2667
02:30:58,520 --> 02:30:58,820
Okay.

2668
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:02,020
So the so what happened is the Gibbon takes swam away and

2669
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:04,920
you know, got rescued had a whole piratey adventure.

2670
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:08,320
Eventually was on the pony cast with starboard bow and then

2671
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:13,320
that ship crashed and then they ended up in a TBAP resurrection.

2672
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:17,520
So presumably they'd been on adventures hunting and then treasure

2673
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:22,920
some such and then suddenly something happened and then

2674
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:24,220
they're in the Lord ghosts.

2675
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:26,520
Yeah, in the Lord ghosts.

2676
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:28,120
Wait, are they in the Lord ghosts?

2677
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,320
They're right at the end.

2678
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:31,920
I don't remember.

2679
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:40,120
Dog the dog the dog grasped them from like the clutches of

2680
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:44,420
like a shadow beast Netherrealm because dog just can go places

2681
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:46,220
like Pluto from Kingdom Hearts.

2682
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:51,820
And and and and he's just brought them here and they're like

2683
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:54,820
talking to flower head and flower heads like what the fuck

2684
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:56,620
who are you and was like we're ponies.

2685
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:57,720
So what the fuck's going on?

2686
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:59,220
Are you doing in my review?

2687
02:31:59,520 --> 02:31:59,820
What?

2688
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:00,020
Yeah.

2689
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:02,020
What are you doing in my comic basically?

2690
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:02,920
Mm hmm.

2691
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:03,420
Mm hmm.

2692
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:05,220
And then now they're in my now.

2693
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:08,520
Now they're in my Canon comic universe, which is kind of

2694
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:08,920
wrong.

2695
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:11,720
RFCK and everything's all connected.

2696
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:15,520
I gotta go that flower head plan I had, but it's it was

2697
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,120
kind of fun just put them in there.

2698
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,120
Yeah.

2699
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:19,120
Yeah.

2700
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:19,820
Gotcha.

2701
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:23,120
Well, now I know.

2702
02:32:23,820 --> 02:32:25,620
I'm sure he's I'm sure he's thriving.

2703
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:30,620
Next voicemail is called Ben's slave from the future.

2704
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:32,620
Three, two, one, go.

2705
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:36,820
We do eat things for customers.

2706
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:38,920
It is a sir.

2707
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:41,620
And I can't be bad news.

2708
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:47,120
Great leader Ben said has recently spent all our country

2709
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:50,720
money on 50,000 Bitcoin.

2710
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:55,320
This was a lot of Bitcoin financial decision.

2711
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:58,820
And now none of our people are eating.

2712
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:05,520
So I come to the past to tell the young man said not to

2713
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:08,520
spend all this money on you know, if I had that much

2714
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:10,320
Bitcoin, I could just sell it.

2715
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:17,520
And also Ben seems to get seeds in the future.

2716
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:20,320
So don't remember the location.

2717
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:22,120
Okay.

2718
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:22,720
Thanks.

2719
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:23,920
I won't.

2720
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:27,520
Oh, damn.

2721
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:29,120
I wish I had 50,000 Bitcoin.

2722
02:33:29,320 --> 02:33:30,720
Look, the future is looking up.

2723
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:35,520
So that's like 50,000 squared.

2724
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:38,920
So that's how many like like a billion, like 20 billion

2725
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:39,520
dollars.

2726
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:40,120
I don't know.

2727
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:43,820
Uh, next one is called death and no piss.

2728
02:33:43,820 --> 02:33:46,020
Three, two, one, go.

2729
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:48,320
Damn it.

2730
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:49,020
I fucked up.

2731
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:52,620
I recorded a voicemail and then I actually refreshed the

2732
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:53,620
page and lost it.

2733
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:57,320
But I was asking like, do you all think about when you

2734
02:33:57,320 --> 02:34:01,420
die, how much content there will be left that has your

2735
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:01,920
voices?

2736
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:03,420
Yeah, I think about that all the time.

2737
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:10,020
So like if you have kids or if, uh, like Nate has kids

2738
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:12,220
I got bit.

2739
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:18,420
They'll always have recordings of your voices to hear.

2740
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:18,920
Yeah.

2741
02:34:18,920 --> 02:34:20,220
It's not good, but they'll have it.

2742
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,020
But also I was pissing during it.

2743
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:22,720
So it's kind of funny.

2744
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:23,920
I was going to call it death and piss.

2745
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:25,820
Death and no piss.

2746
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:26,420
I see.

2747
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:28,120
I, uh, yeah, I think about that.

2748
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:30,720
Like, man, if like if I ever had kids there, they could

2749
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:34,520
just be like, man, my dad was on a podcast.

2750
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:36,420
I could just go and like listen to like what he was

2751
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:41,320
talking about in like 2000 and 18.

2752
02:34:42,020 --> 02:34:45,520
I don't know whether they'd give a shit.

2753
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:47,820
Like they'd see it there.

2754
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:49,820
Yeah.

2755
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:52,520
I mean, it would probably be hard to, it's hard to know

2756
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:55,620
because, you know, stuff like that of my own parents is

2757
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:56,620
does not exist.

2758
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:58,720
And so I can't know whether I'd be curious.

2759
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:01,920
I to like listen to podcasts.

2760
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:04,020
My dad and honestly.

2761
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:09,720
If, if, if my dad had like had a podcast, I probably would

2762
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:12,420
be curious and I probably would go back and listen to like

2763
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:15,420
what was my dad's podcast about when he was like 30?

2764
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:17,720
Yeah.

2765
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:19,120
I would, I would check it out.

2766
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:19,920
So yeah.

2767
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:22,820
And then like having a parasocial relationship with

2768
02:35:22,820 --> 02:35:27,320
your own parent and then, and then to imagine.

2769
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:27,520
Yeah.

2770
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:31,020
I'm like, after you're dead, there will just be your voice.

2771
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:33,920
Oh, I was going to say probably the thing that would

2772
02:35:34,420 --> 02:35:37,220
like if your parents like dying and you were like, wow,

2773
02:35:37,220 --> 02:35:38,920
I missed the sad that they died.

2774
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:41,420
Like I, I should, I'm going to go back and listen to my dad's

2775
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:43,220
old podcast and be like, so this is.

2776
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,620
I'm hearing him from beyond the grave.

2777
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:49,420
Sad.

2778
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:50,520
That'd be really sad.

2779
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:51,820
Yeah.

2780
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:53,120
Ah, geez.

2781
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:53,620
Yeah.

2782
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:54,820
Be really sad.

2783
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:58,620
Cheese.

2784
02:35:58,620 --> 02:35:59,820
Well, now I'm depressed.

2785
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:01,020
Next.

2786
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:04,420
In terms of like just general, like your voice being out

2787
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:05,920
there recorded for all time.

2788
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:09,420
I mean, I don't expect like YouTube to be around for all

2789
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:13,020
time, but like certain recordings will probably exist

2790
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:13,920
for a long time.

2791
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:23,120
I think that just the sheer amount of stuff kind of precludes

2792
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:24,920
the, I don't think that's the right word.

2793
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:26,120
I don't know how to use that word.

2794
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:31,920
Um, you'll be lost in, in the, the sea of people uploading

2795
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:35,620
stuff that nobody's ever going to find that unless you're

2796
02:36:35,620 --> 02:36:38,420
super famous at one point, you're like a note in history.

2797
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:43,620
Like, oh, then this podcast was the very important podcast

2798
02:36:43,620 --> 02:36:45,320
that caused this to happen.

2799
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:46,620
Yes.

2800
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:48,320
Like nobody will find it.

2801
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:49,920
So it's basically secret.

2802
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:53,520
It's basically like, like we never recorded it anyway.

2803
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:58,820
After we die, the PCP will, the PCP is like only irrelevant

2804
02:36:58,820 --> 02:37:02,020
because like we are alive and people know us and people are

2805
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:03,520
like, let's hear them.

2806
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:08,120
After we die, the PCP will no longer be relevant because we

2807
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,320
will be irrelevant because we won't even exist.

2808
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:14,920
So what would maybe some people might be like nostalgic for

2809
02:37:14,920 --> 02:37:17,120
it and might go back and listen to an old episode now and

2810
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:22,720
then, but like in the future, future, nobody's going to unless

2811
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:25,220
one, unless we have some sort of something happens and we have

2812
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:30,020
like an outsize influence on history and we become like someone

2813
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:32,920
of historical importance and then it's like, oh, wow, that,

2814
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:34,420
that guy had a podcast.

2815
02:37:34,420 --> 02:37:35,720
I'm going to go back and listen to his podcast.

2816
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:38,520
Imagine if ancient Romans had podcasts.

2817
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:42,620
They imagine if Milo of, of, of a croton or whatever.

2818
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:43,720
Fucking wax podcasts.

2819
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:45,420
Wax podcasts.

2820
02:37:46,420 --> 02:37:46,820
Yeah.

2821
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:47,320
Yeah.

2822
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:50,820
They'd get the, the gramophone or dig it into the wax.

2823
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:52,020
The wax cylinders.

2824
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:52,320
Yeah.

2825
02:37:52,320 --> 02:37:52,520
Yeah.

2826
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:55,620
The wax cylinder is the, you would crank it on like the, in

2827
02:37:55,620 --> 02:37:56,920
like a piano or something, right?

2828
02:37:56,920 --> 02:37:58,420
Like a player on the wax.

2829
02:37:58,420 --> 02:37:58,920
Yeah.

2830
02:37:59,020 --> 02:37:59,520
Yeah.

2831
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:01,320
So, you know, it's not that crazy.

2832
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:03,120
That's basically, they had that in ancient Rome.

2833
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:05,620
They did probably did have podcasts, but they, they, they

2834
02:38:05,620 --> 02:38:07,820
scrubbed the wax cylinders clean.

2835
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:11,320
I think that in my opinion, Beethoven's ninth symphony is

2836
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:13,320
my favorite podcast.

2837
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:15,320
He didn't, he couldn't record his voice.

2838
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:18,220
So he, he did the next best thing and just like wrote a bunch

2839
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:20,720
of notes down and was like, yeah, listen to that.

2840
02:38:21,220 --> 02:38:23,020
That's my podcast.

2841
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:28,920
Death sure is sad.

2842
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:29,720
Lamal.

2843
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:31,020
Next voice.

2844
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:31,720
That's funny.

2845
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:32,320
Actually.

2846
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:33,220
Oh shit.

2847
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:33,820
You're right.

2848
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:34,720
Actually.

2849
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:38,220
Next voicemail is called Berserk or Homestuck follow-up.

2850
02:38:38,220 --> 02:38:40,020
Three, two, one, go.

2851
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:46,720
So I finally decided between Berserk and Homestuck.

2852
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:47,820
You don't have to choose.

2853
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:50,320
I just wanted to do a follow-up for the last.

2854
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:53,620
Weeks voicemails about Berserk and like, yeah.

2855
02:38:54,220 --> 02:38:55,620
Uh, I'm reading Bleach.

2856
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:56,620
Great.

2857
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:58,720
I mean, Bleach isn't that bad.

2858
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,920
It sort of falls off at some point, but this is some good

2859
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:02,520
stuff in there.

2860
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:03,520
I've never read it.

2861
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:04,320
So I don't know.

2862
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:07,020
I'm, I'm pretty sure it's not as good.

2863
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:11,220
I'm pretty sure like visually like, uh, like, oh, cinematic

2864
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:14,520
with panel layouts and like, oh, cool drawings, bro.

2865
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,720
Oh, the story is pretty normal.

2866
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:18,420
That's pretty cool.

2867
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:22,420
I guess, uh, yeah, no, no experience of Bleach at all.

2868
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:25,220
Last voicemail is an image.

2869
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:29,520
So let's fucking take a look at that shit.

2870
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:37,020
I really don't get this meme.

2871
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,420
I really don't get this meme.

2872
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:40,220
We've got you surrounded.

2873
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:41,420
Come enjoy this meme.

2874
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:42,820
No.

2875
02:39:45,020 --> 02:39:48,120
I mean, I mean, you know what?

2876
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,120
You forced it on me.

2877
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:51,320
I have no choice but to like it now.

2878
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,820
But why, why are you smiling?

2879
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:56,820
You don't get the meme.

2880
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:57,320
I don't know.

2881
02:39:57,320 --> 02:39:58,320
You have an AK.

2882
02:39:58,520 --> 02:39:59,620
I don't know.

2883
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:02,920
I, I don't understand.

2884
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:04,520
I don't understand anything.

2885
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:06,720
This is the week.

2886
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:11,920
It's the new iteration of the same irrelevant meme.

2887
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:17,920
Honestly, um, I'll be, to be honest though, this, this drawing

2888
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:20,920
of me is like the most accurate one I've ever seen.

2889
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:22,820
This one, this actually looks like me.

2890
02:40:22,820 --> 02:40:26,320
This is how I see myself in the mirror.

2891
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:29,220
And I go, oh, don't show me that table with an AK.

2892
02:40:29,220 --> 02:40:34,020
47 and devilish grin, a big, a, you know, a big, a big round

2893
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:38,520
head, sparsely covered with a huge forehead sticking out

2894
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:41,720
and, uh, and the little, yeah, the sniveling little glass.

2895
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:45,020
Although I don't have a beard at the moment.

2896
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:48,120
I should though and just stop picking at my beard.

2897
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:49,820
So I can get the, I got a haircut.

2898
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:50,520
Oh, I got a haircut.

2899
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:51,520
And now I have short hair again.

2900
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:52,920
I had long hair for a long time.

2901
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:55,720
Now it's short and I need to grow the beard so I can look

2902
02:40:55,720 --> 02:41:00,520
like, uh, brony con Ben again from those pictures.

2903
02:41:01,220 --> 02:41:03,920
You're, you posted those, those, those pictures of us on stage

2904
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:05,820
or brony con the ones that that's, that's the look I need

2905
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:06,720
to go back to.

2906
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:08,120
That was peak then.

2907
02:41:09,020 --> 02:41:10,520
Uh, yeah.

2908
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:12,320
So that's my hair situation.

2909
02:41:13,220 --> 02:41:14,720
And that's the end of the podcast.

2910
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:15,520
Slaw.

2911
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:17,520
Well, it's over.

2912
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:20,320
Wait, let me refresh and make sure there's no last minute

2913
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:20,920
voicemail.

2914
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:21,520
Nope.

2915
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:23,120
It's over.

2916
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,620
Thank God.

2917
02:41:25,720 --> 02:41:26,120
Nice.

2918
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:26,720
We did it.

2919
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:31,020
Um, a patron, a patron.

2920
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:33,320
Dot com slash the procrastinators speak, have that

2921
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:34,320
com slash PCB voicemail.

2922
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:37,320
If you want to leave a voicemail, don't leave any shitty

2923
02:41:37,320 --> 02:41:40,120
comments and be like, don't like the podcast anymore.

2924
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:40,720
We know.

2925
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,720
We know you hate the podcast.

2926
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:44,620
We don't only do it to spite you.

2927
02:41:45,020 --> 02:41:50,520
Uh, anything else on the voicemail roulette or click.

2928
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:53,020
Oh, we shot Tommy J.

2929
02:41:53,020 --> 02:41:54,220
Oh, Tommy J is dead.

2930
02:41:54,220 --> 02:41:55,120
Oh, darn.

2931
02:41:55,720 --> 02:41:57,420
Oh, dear Tommy J.

2932
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:59,620
You can't, you can't put a voicemail.

2933
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:01,820
So sad for a month or a week.

2934
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:02,720
He said a month.

2935
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:03,920
The voice that month.

2936
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:06,620
Let's see if you can, you can play along.

2937
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:07,620
That was the rules.

2938
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:08,920
I don't, I don't make the rules.

2939
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:10,620
It's just how it's just how it goes.

2940
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:13,120
Uh, okay.

2941
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,020
Good, good, good.

2942
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:15,820
Bye.

2943
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:17,120
Goodbye.

2944
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:17,520
Bye.

2945
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:18,120
I love you.

2946
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:21,320
Just like my parents.

2947
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:22,320
Okay.

2948
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:22,720
Later.
