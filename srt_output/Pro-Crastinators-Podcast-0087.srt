1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
The term was originally coined by James Bartholomew for the spectator to decry people who say,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,080
I don't like this thing very much in order to feel good about themselves and then just

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
vote labour every few years or whatever and take no stake in actually making things better.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
This is a fairly straightforwardly good call to action. The term actually decried a real

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,040
existing problem. Of course, then the idiots got their hands on it.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:42,560
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,160
a podcast on the internet by people also on the internet. We make stuff and now we're talking

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,520
about other stuff. I'm the best guy ever and today we're joined by such charismatic individuals as

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Tom Oliver. Hello, I am here, signaling my presence.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,880
Excellent. Virtuous it is indeed. I try. Hippocrit is here. I'm great.

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,960
The end. Lethal Aurora Mage. And I'm not like the other girls.

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm purple. Yeah. Excellent. And the often forgotten Fertive Benz.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,240
The Fertive Benz. So easily forgotten. Crouched in darkness.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,960
Origin of all despair in the world. Excellent. Excellent. I try. Thanks for being here everybody

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,600
and thank you audience for being here as well. It's time to talk about some dumb shit. So our

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,800
topic today is indeed virtue signaling. Virtue signaling. Virtue signaling. Wow, Nate.

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,320
Is that impressive? Yeah. Virtue signaling when they get a big, big old light bulb and then they

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,160
shite it in the sky and then Virtue Man comes. Is that what they do? Exactly. Basically. You know,

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm unclear. I'm unclear on what Virtue signaling is, but I think I know where we can find out, Nate.

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
We got to go to a place where there's both the intellectual content we desire

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,960
and the street smart delivery that makes it go down oh so smooth.

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
Guys, before we go and read the official definition of virtue signaling, I just wanted to

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,200
define a possible meaning for virtue signaling. Do you guys have you seen the anime state young

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,280
men? Yes. So when Buddha is being virtuous, he starts to glow and so he's signaling to everyone

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,480
that he's being virtuous. That should be the thumbnail for this episode. That would be good.

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,320
It's kind of like how, this is actually a very apt metaphor, like how lightning bugs are signal

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,080
like that they are prepared to mate the fuck out of the ladies out there or maybe the female signal

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
or something, but it's like a mating dance they do when they light up. So what? Yeah, it's that

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,040
kind of shit. That's just like the beta males on Twitter. Exactly. Virtue signals retract at

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,200
pus. I see what you're talking about. I got you. Exactly, right? That's a very apt metaphor.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
Just glowing. Glowing with virtuousness is their Christ consciousness sores and their

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,400
myrkabah spins and the dimensional energies just go higher and higher as their chromosomes multiply

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,200
and they rapidly become over 50 feet tall. Just like the ancient Egyptians. Of course.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Okay, so here we go. Here's our top definition on urban dictionary for virtue signaling.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Saying you love or hate something to show off what a virtuous person you are instead of actually

36
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,360
trying to fix the problem. Jane. Wow, I hate Fox News. They're so evil and they hate women.

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,520
John, why don't you actually do something instead of just virtue signaling about it?

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Jane. OMG, that would be way too much work. Goes back to shit posting on Twitter. Yeah, why don't

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,480
you make your own fucking news network, Jane? All right. So I have consistently heard and

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,280
reheard this definition of virtue signaling. I always forget it. So I'm just going to give you

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,320
one and see if this is true. Okay. I hate starving African children. Is that virtue

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,840
signaling? Because I hate how starving they are. In a way, it sounds like you hate them as

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,680
opposed to you hate the poor conditions that they live in. They make me feel bad with their

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,160
insistence on not eating anything. That is a miscalculation. They're over it. They're

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:44,640
guilting me every day. It makes me hard to enjoy all the luxuries in my life. It makes me hard if

46
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,280
you know what I'm mean. Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. I guess this is good. How quickly you had me

47
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,120
again some decent. That was fast. So, okay. So the whole point of virtue signaling is not to

48
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,760
feel good yourself. Well, I mean, it sort of is. But it is to make people think that you're cool or

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,160
good for whatever reason like you would want to do that. And this is run rampant in our society

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,560
these days. And it's like absolutely everywhere. Everybody's including me. I'm sure we've

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,760
all done it. I'm doing it right now by being on the PCP and letting everyone know what a cool guy

52
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:27,360
I am. Indeed. Indeed. It is part of it like you aren't actually doing anything good. Yes,

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
it is. Yes, it is. That's a key component here. Sometimes you don't even have to believe what

54
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,360
you're saying is just you doing it so that others people would just... I would almost say that's

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
a requirement. That's the difference between virtue signaling and actually being virtuous.

56
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,240
Well, no, you can virtue signal by like trying to amplify what you already believe. But there's

57
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,240
tons of people who just be like, I want to gain social favor in some way. Usually online. A lot

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,600
of the time is on Twitter. So I'm going to either echo or project a sentiment that is popular in

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
order to align myself with this popular perception to make myself look better by by osmosis.

60
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:13,040
I got my start virtue signaling very early in life. When my parents, my dad, I think, got me

61
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,720
a Backstreet Boys CD and I was jamming out. I never want to hear you say I want it that way.

62
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,760
Yeah, it was a smooth. It was a smooth and silky jam. But I came to realize that the kids at my

63
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,160
school were over the Backstreet Boys and that was not cool. That was something that girls liked

64
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,840
and cool kids didn't like that. So one day I told my dad and he was like, hey, you want to put on

65
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Backstreet Boys? I was like, no, dad, I don't like the Backstreet Boys. They're gay. My dad

66
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,920
called me. He was like, you like them. They're just not very popular. And I was like, it cut me

67
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,960
to the core because it was absolutely true. But I couldn't admit it. Now that is definitely in a

68
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,160
sense similar to virtue signaling. But specifically, this would relate to trying to make you look

69
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,240
morally superior. The virtue of being cool and not liking things that society has deemed are for

70
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,920
girls and gay. In that case, you're absolutely right. By the way, I also had an in-sync CD that

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,960
we bought simultaneously to the Backstreet Boys. We each had one. We were jamming. We were jamming to

72
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:23,840
the. So where does giving to charity so that you can say I give to charity? Does that fall into

73
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,040
the same thing? Absolutely. I mean, you are giving to charity. So that is like a real action you're

74
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,160
doing. But like it depends. A lot of it depends on your motivation. The giving to charity isn't so

75
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,920
much virtue signaling. It's making sure everyone knows that you did it. That's the virtue signaling

76
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,000
part. But let me give you a great example from recent days of exactly what a virtue

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,760
signaling is. Like when I think virtue signaling, I think male feminist almost immediately. That's

78
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,040
where my mind goes. And like Harvey Weinstein, big leftist, turns out he's basically a rapist or

79
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,240
something. That is a classic virtue signaling right there. It's these guys with these duplicitous

80
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,440
motives. Like again, male feminists who go on and on about how much they love women and they want to

81
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,800
fight for women's rights. But their end game is to fuck women. That's their goal. But they're going

82
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,200
about it in such a way so as to like do it through virtue. They're doing the popular thing to get

83
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,760
closer to what they want. What really bothers me when people virtue signal is like they pretend

84
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,720
like they're seeing something like non-mainstream, something edgy and risky and like, oh, they're

85
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,920
going to get in trouble for seeing that. But like they say the most popular mundane acceptable

86
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:43,600
shit. An unpopular opinion. But I don't think people should be ostracized for their sexual

87
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:52,000
preferences. Society. Just slow it down. Okay. Yeah. That's such an unpopular. You know, I'm in the minority here.

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
We don't know what's funny about this whole thing. Unpopular opinions. I guess we're all

89
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,000
virtue signals. I have a gay friend. Hope I don't get stoned in the town square.

90
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Oh, but I'm going to get stoned in the town square if you know what I mean.

91
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,200
Legalized, bro. Unpopular opinion. But legalized weed, bro.

92
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,600
You know, it's funny because a lot of these issues now I don't want to be insensitive to

93
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,640
people's lived experiences. But a lot of these sorts of unpopular opinions, I mean, I'm sure you

94
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,800
guys will generally agree with this, are things that people like are no longer problems. Like,

95
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,240
for example, like a gay marriage was legalized what like like seven years ago. So that's like not

96
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,120
that's not a long time. But the not everywhere. Well, it federally has been the problem is

97
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,760
I'm going to interject right here. Oh, right. The problem is it's not even that these things

98
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,880
aren't a problem anymore. It's that you have a bunch of people who ardently believe in these

99
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,320
things. Sure. Like they believe in gay and like, you know, gay marriage and LGBT rights and all

100
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,240
that stuff, right? And that's all those are all good things to fight. Right, we would all support

101
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,040
those in general. Here's the problem with virtue signaling is that when you go on Twitter, and

102
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,080
you tell everybody about it, everybody who's on Twitter already agrees with you. So it's a circle

103
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,880
jerk on Twitter to get all the people you want to like you to like you because you share their

104
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,280
opinions. Whereas you actually want to do something about that, you'd have to like go somewhere

105
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,440
besides Twitter where people don't believe these things and state your case and try and change

106
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,720
OK, here's here's a great thing. I've been watching I've watched for a long time now Sam Harris's

107
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,840
podcast, the waking up podcast. And one of his episodes was he brought on this guy. I can't

108
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,880
remember his name. But like the whole point of the episode was like doing the most good with your

109
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,840
life. How do we do practical good? Could there be a more Nate podcast? Sam Harris is like exactly

110
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,360
me. He's like literally me. So like the whole point of this is to like mathematically determine

111
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,320
what is the best way to do the most good with your money, which is the exact opposite of virtue

112
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,200
signaling. It is the mathematical other extreme. You can't see me smirking and shaking my head

113
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,760
right now. Good. That's what I want. That's what I want the people to do when they hear me speak.

114
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,760
So like and what was determined throughout this was that for like for your buck, the best you

115
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,000
can do to like to help people is to buy mosquito nets for like Sub-Saharan Africa, I think, or

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,840
maybe it was like South America, somewhere where like malaria, I think was like a big deal and

117
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,080
mosquito nets would prevent that. Like that was mathematically the best thing you can do to save

118
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,680
the most human life on the planet. And that could change for sure. Like let's say the mosquitoes

119
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,600
die, then you would find something else that's like the best way to help people. Once the mosquito

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,840
problem has been curbed, the supply and demand curve will shift and you got to keep up with it.

121
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,680
That's right. If you want to do the most good, that's right. That's right. And like that's the

122
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,680
real shit. And so for just for example, like Sam Harris was like, you know what? Okay, this is good.

123
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,720
I'm going to immediately start giving like X amount of money to this charity because like he's a

124
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,880
pure like rational, scientifically minded guy, of course. So he's just giving his money there.

125
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,960
And if I was so inclined to give my money to anyone, I would probably feel like that would

126
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,640
be the right thing to do, you know, give to those people. Or of course, you know, just engage in

127
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,200
capitalism in general, which is not really the same. It's just like how you build a functioning

128
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,880
economy. But yeah, that's like that is the good stuff. That's what I want to see. And I got no

129
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,600
time for people and their personal little issues. Like, like, like for example, feminists in America

130
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,840
complaining about how women are, there's a problem with AC is being too cold. Like I actually

131
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,160
sympathize with that immensely. I hate when it's too cold in office buildings that like men of

132
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,880
internal higher body temperature, like I get it. And I'm with you on that. But let's not forget

133
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,880
that literally every woman in Saudi Arabia is a slave for the for the most part, like all of them.

134
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,880
All of them. It's fun how we don't talk about that at all. Well, because I mean,

135
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,360
I think the AC thing is like it's not it's not like like the fact that there are worse problems.

136
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:12,080
I support their struggle. I was sexist. Like, okay, it's a problem. Okay, like, hey, it's too cold.

137
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,400
I would prefer it to be warmer. Okay, sure, that's an issue. We can fix that. But don't call out of

138
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,120
your way and claim it only sexist. I mean, I guess I mean, I guess it is a gendered problem in that

139
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,520
like, statistically, probably management of most places is male. And they're probably the ones

140
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,000
making the decision. So like, it is a gendered issue. I would argue it's a gender issue, but not

141
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,280
sexist issue. Not necessarily. It depends on how you frame the frame it. Like if you say that only

142
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,600
men's, you know, quote, like lived experience is used to determine the correct temperature

143
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,720
for inside the office building. And we just like don't care about the women because they're the

144
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,920
minority. If they just went to like someone who works the AC and be like, Hey, could you raise

145
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
it a little bit? I'm sure they would have raised it a little bit. But the goddamn patriarch, you

146
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,120
won't allow it. I mean, I mean, yeah, like, like what it comes down to is that like, obviously,

147
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,360
every employee's input should count the same. Yeah, everyone's comfort should be valued equally.

148
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:16,480
So like, yeah. And if they're not being, then that is sexist. But like, yeah, yeah, I doubt

149
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,240
that they're saying, fuck the women's opinion, we don't care. Yeah. But there is a certain temperature

150
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,840
that will be the middle range of the comfort level. And people just need to attune themselves to

151
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,120
whatever that is. Realistically speaking, you know, you got to do an example of virtue signaling

152
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,000
would be somebody who runs like an office of like three people and goes on Twitter, he's like,

153
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,080
I changed my AC today because I care about my female employees. Give me hundreds of thousands

154
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,120
of retweets, please. Yeah, you're not wrong signaling right there. Especially because like,

155
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,520
again, mathematically speaking, what if two of your employees are male? Like it actually makes

156
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,760
sense to do the most good for the world to make it like a temperature that, you know, is the most

157
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,200
comfortable for the most number of people. Like just as an example, I'm not saying you should

158
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,280
always, you know, cater to men, I'm just saying, mathematically speaking, it makes the most sense.

159
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,000
That's the way we should operate. Do you think a way to determine virtue signaling is like

160
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,680
the percentage of people who respond to what you said with, yeah, all right, whatever, fine.

161
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,480
Like if you say that, the more people who say that to what you say,

162
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,720
that makes it more virtue signaling than less. Difference is the answer.

163
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,400
It's hard to say because it depends on who you're projecting to. There's a lot of people who laugh

164
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,120
that shit up. Like if you would, you cast that net into the right audience, everyone's gonna be like,

165
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,560
oh, you're so great. You're so good. Like every time, you know, a, a, a, like this whole like

166
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,720
me too thing, like it's a huge problem. But every time another celebrity comes out, like something

167
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,920
happened to me at some point by somebody, this is bad. Everyone's like, oh, you're so brave. Well,

168
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,520
you know, the real problem. It's like, well, why don't you drop the name? It's less and less brave.

169
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,200
Let's solve the problem. The more you do it, the more it happens, the less brave you are.

170
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,720
And you're not brave for not dropping names. If you know exactly who fucking did it and you're

171
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
going to keep letting them go on and continue to harass other people, you're not brave. You're

172
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,600
looking for social credit. Fuck you. I have no respect for you.

173
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,760
Entirely true. And the thing I hate about, I don't, I don't hate the movement, but the thing

174
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,240
that is a problem about it is that so many people, like just under this heading of me too,

175
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,480
like everyone's thing gets lumped in together as like equally bad. Like you could have been

176
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,920
legal, literally raped by Harvey Weinstein, or you could have had like your butt touched by Al

177
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,880
Franken, or you could have had like a co-worker make a sexually charged joke to someone else,

178
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,280
not directed at you. And these would all be lumped under me too. My life is hell. You know,

179
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,840
I have experienced deep sexual, like the problem is not that these things, that,

180
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,680
that that you're complaining about these things. Each of them is fine. It should be treated with

181
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,320
a level of, of, of respect. But the issue here is proportionality. That is my favorite word in

182
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,400
the world, proportionality. Just like I was saying before about how the women AC thing,

183
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,600
like that, that, you could take that as a problem. I understand. I'm willing to talk about that.

184
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,720
But also Saudi Arabia, full of litter, all the women are slaves, all of them, basically. And

185
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,240
like, like proportionality-wise speaking, we should talk about that a lot more. That's like

186
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,560
the big deal that, that really matters. Right. Yeah, but like Saudi Arabia is really far away.

187
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,120
But like the AC knob is right here. It's right here in my, in my house. And I can't twist it.

188
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,000
You have to claim patriarchy for someone else to twist it.

189
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,320
Well, well, let's, I mean, Alexa is a woman and she's the one really in charge of all our

190
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,880
computers and environmental controls these days. So Alexa, be the patriarchy. Maybe it's

191
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,000
internalized patriarchy or internalized misogyny on Alexa's part. You know what other sort of

192
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,480
virtue-sugging I really dislike? Like someone, let's say, you know, they're sharing an experience

193
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,200
maybe a negative one, something bad that happened to them. You know, that's fine.

194
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,480
Sometimes you need to vent. Sometimes you just want to share a story and that's perfectly fine.

195
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,360
But then someone else takes your story and then runs with it, puts it on blast, and like, look

196
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,080
at me. What a good person I am for like making this public and we should all stop this horrible

197
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,720
thing from happening to people and then they make it their own problem. Are you saying they're like

198
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,080
just lying and like taking other people's stories to gain the social credit?

199
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,720
No, not lying rather than like, like, look at me. How good I am. I'm helping this person.

200
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,960
Are you saying virtue signaling they're virtue hijacking? They're like hijacking your point

201
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,480
and making it about them. They're like, like turning someone else into like a symbol of like

202
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
they're using your struggle as a prop for their virtue. Yeah, exactly.

203
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,960
Yeah, yeah. That's a classic thing. The whole idea of like, of like retweeting and sharing and

204
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,320
liking and stuff like that is just it. What's the word? It accommodates virtue, virtue signaling

205
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,640
to happen because it's like it's very easy to just put someone else's statement on your thing

206
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,960
and say look at what I believe. What look at what I agree with. Like it's fine to sometimes just

207
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,800
share certain stories that you want to make people aware, but like don't make it your battle.

208
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,720
It's really just an obnoxiousness slider. Like you can be a good person and say,

209
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,240
hey, you should help this charity or this thing and this guy's got a kickstarter to get medical

210
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,600
funds or whatever. And you know, you re-share it or whatever because you care and you want people

211
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,960
to know about it. But there's just like the more you're putting yourself in the picture frame of

212
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,440
hey look, it's me who's doing all this. It's me who's showing you this.

213
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,280
And that's what it's all about. That's what this is all about.

214
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,760
Let's not mince words about this. These days, virtue signaling is big fucking business, right?

215
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,120
Oh, of course. Like you can be financially successful. You can make like a living. No,

216
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,520
no. You can make a living if you invent the right hashtag and are active enough in a hashtag. You

217
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,160
can be like hashtag famous because you made the right hashtag that embodies some social issue

218
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:15,680
that enough people want to jump on the bandwagon for and fucking be up on in a Twitter arms race

219
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:26,880
about. Oh, for sure. Absolutely. And it's like just showing that you support an issue enough

220
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,240
can make you famous, can make people want to support you based on that. So you can make a

221
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,960
living virtue signaling if you're smart about it and if you can get like a following based on it.

222
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,520
When discussion gets wide enough about it, you can monetize it so you can get

223
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:54,800
monetized thickness. Right? I mean, that's what, I mean, this is, I'm kind of going,

224
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm going broad with this, but that's kind of what like, that's kind of what like fucking

225
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,160
YouTubers that like that's that's what like someone like Sargon of Akkad does is they just

226
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,880
virtue signal their what they what they perceive as virtues and like people just like pick up on

227
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,520
those like, yes, this is a very virtuous person. I want to ally myself with that. I mean, this is

228
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,240
like this is what all pundits do. This is what like every YouTube or like blog pundit or something

229
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,960
does. They're out there just putting their opinions out there showing that they support the right

230
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,640
issues and then the other people that support those issues want to be like, yeah, me too. This

231
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,040
person is powerful. This person is influential and I want to show and I want to show myself

232
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,880
to be in alliance with them and I'll do that whenever I can. I'll retweet their shit. I'll

233
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,240
back them. I'll guess I want to show that I am also on this bandwagon and that's what it's all

234
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,240
about. I really because like thinking about that, like everybody is basically a virtue

235
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:55,200
signaler in some fashion. Does that mean virtue signaling is not really that bad and it's just

236
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:03,280
sometimes people take it to an obnoxious degree? I think it is one of these things that is

237
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,200
almost a fundamental human desire or tendency, but that doesn't make it good. It would be good

238
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,760
if we could stop doing it and just be objective about things. I do think there's a difference

239
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,480
between fighting for a cause or like trying to spread. I'm not even awareness, but like just

240
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,520
discuss things. There's a difference between having a debate or a discussion and trying to

241
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,600
just talk about a certain thing and virtue signaling, right? Because like if somebody,

242
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,600
like to go back to a pundit, if a pundit talks about an issue and like hammers away at it all

243
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,320
the time because they truly believe this is a big problem and it needs to be addressed more,

244
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,600
that's different than that same pundit going on and making a big deal about whatever's popular

245
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,000
at the time in order to bolster their own self-image. Well, you know, it's a creeping thing

246
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,560
really because like the real issue with virtue signaling generally is it is catering to an audience

247
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,240
and like every every worse because there's money because people will pay you to cater to talk about

248
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,520
the thing that bothers them. Yeah, it's just it's just kind of by nature of the business of

249
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,680
having someone with a pain. It ties to victim culture, right? That's true because in order to

250
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,560
be like it's because we have this weird kind of social dynamic now where being a victim is

251
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,760
virtuous. Yeah, so they tie together a lot nowadays. Like I've been wronged. Look how bad this thing

252
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,680
is. We need to solve this problem because I've been wronged. Now please give me money to make

253
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,280
up for the fact that society shortchanged me in the next way. Yeah, sure. But because we've got

254
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,080
like, you know, social media in the way that we do now, it's so easy for people to like keep catering

255
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,400
to their audience and it just like things spiral out of control and they just keep going down a

256
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,320
rabbit hole where you got guys like, I don't know, like there was some guy on like Joe Rogan's

257
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,840
podcast recently who like it was a self avowed like big SJW guy and then he was there saying like,

258
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,200
yeah, that like and he had supposedly like stopped doing that or whatever and I'm taking

259
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,640
him by his word. I don't really know who he is or anything and he was just and Joe was like with

260
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,720
him on it. So he was like, yeah, man, like I just kept like retweeting the same people. Like just

261
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,560
kept doing it and doing it because like everyone around me was like, yeah, this is it. This is

262
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,640
right. We got to keep doing this shit. There's no alternative facts to be considered or other

263
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,880
viewpoints or whatever. So like, I almost want to give people credit or not not give them credit,

264
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,400
but like not lambast them too harshly for this because just by the nature of the way that our

265
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,120
interactions work these days, it is almost inevitable that we fall into these. I was going to make

266
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,240
a point at some point that this is a huge this is I'm not going to say this is a product of social

267
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,680
media, but it's absolutely spiraled out of control. The way it has because of the way social media

268
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,280
works. Like social media first enables us to happen at scale. Virtue, virtue signal in person

269
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,880
very effectively. Yeah, you have like five or 10 people. Virtue signaling on social media is highly

270
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,680
incentivized socially as well as financially. Well, even the algorithm does because as you

271
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,000
continue to virtue signal and like you show support for that content, all these algorithms

272
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,160
just show you more of that stuff. So you're just seeing more of it. It's just kind of and then

273
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,080
you're you'll be have this little like social bubble because you're only going to interact and

274
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,920
you're only going to see people who talk about these topics and you know what I'm like a bigger

275
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,920
problem to you. Let me let me give you a big example that's happening right now. Okay, and it's

276
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,640
net neutrality. And I think that we might actually disagree on this to some degree because I'm

277
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,960
actually not 100% in favor of net neutrality all the way. Whoa. But let's let's let's let's discuss

278
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,760
this. So so right right now, a lot of people just assume that net neutrality is obviously the best

279
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,240
thing. Obviously. And I feel it sort of fits under this discussion about this recently too. And

280
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,640
it was aware of new facts that I was not aware of. Okay, so maybe we'll both learn something.

281
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, well, I'm not going to learn anything. It's super. It's I think you're I was going to bring

282
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
up net neutrality at some point as well. And I think it's a great example of what we're talking

283
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,120
about right now. Yeah, is because net neutrality, the issue there's huge issues with revoking title

284
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,000
to status. But I think so the conversation has become that title to has become synonymous with

285
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,040
net neutrality when net neutrality is just a subset of what title to means for internet regulation.

286
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,680
Right, right. Because we have so many people who are defenders of net neutrality, myself included,

287
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,720
we nobody talks about the other effects of having a title to classified internet,

288
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,280
there's a lot more regulation on building out infrastructure and stuff. And smaller startup

289
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,680
companies are have more difficulty. Let me let me throw this at you regarding

290
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,000
regarding net neutrality, everybody. So like, this is this is just an example about you fair

291
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,280
viewer, you probably have heard almost nothing, except that net neutrality is great by people

292
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,720
online and that it all it is is super important that we keep it with its title to status and

293
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
all that bullshit. You've probably heard nothing about that. But let me raise this,

294
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,120
this point to it. Right now, net neutrality enforces that all internet traffic go along

295
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,400
the same exact channels that there can be no delineation between, you know, different types

296
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,680
of pipelines. It all has to go through the same series of tubes. Therefore, things that take

297
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,040
up a lot of data, for example, the gigantic advent of online HD streaming these days has

298
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,400
completely changed the game for how much data is demanded per capita at any one time. And like,

299
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,680
it is like, I don't think it's the majority, but it's really getting up there to be like a huge

300
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,160
percentage of like all internet data traffic. It counts for like 40% of internet bandwidth.

301
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,360
Exactly, exactly. And so considering that, everybody, let's say you fair viewer are just

302
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,600
trying to watch, you're just trying to go online, trying to go to fucking your own website to do

303
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,440
something, you know, bigdicks.com, your favorite website, you're just trying to get there.

304
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,800
If I'm going to bigdicks.com, I definitely want some 4k HDR.

305
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,280
Well, let's use an example we can all agree on.

306
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,240
These are artistic photographs. Let's use an example we can all agree on. Maybe you're headed

307
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,640
over to your favorite hub for all your favorite content on the internet, patreon.com slash Ben

308
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Sane. Just check out what's been going on.

309
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,440
Yeah, right.

310
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,160
I thought you were just going to say St. Comix because that would make more sense.

311
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,720
Your life is an absolute shambles. It's in shambles. It's the only place you can take

312
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,360
solace in this cruel world is on patreon.com slash Ben Sane. That's where you need to be.

313
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,920
You know, you'll find a friend there.

314
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,320
For a price, of course. He hasn't come cheap.

315
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,920
Okay, so you're just going to some bullshit website that's not an HD video streaming website.

316
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,480
That's the point I'm trying to get to. Okay, so you go there and the page is loading really slow

317
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
and you think, why might this be? And then you realize, like, it's the season finale.

318
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,720
It's the series finale of Game of Thrones or something. It just came out and everyone in the

319
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,800
world is using Netflix right now to try to get that fucking, you know, watch that fucking video

320
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,440
that just came out. And so the internet is just down like around you because everyone is demanding

321
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,840
so much data right now that it's a fucking nightmare. Now, does that model necessarily make more sense

322
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,200
than one where there are indeed separated lines where something like Netflix has a dedicated line

323
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,320
and then something like, you know, your static web page loading service that has its own dedicated

324
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,720
line? No, I'm not saying they necessarily should be charging different rates or any of that bullshit.

325
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm just saying that that neutrality enforces that everything uses the exact same pipeline

326
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,160
and that does not necessarily demand or create the best environment for all use. It does not

327
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,480
necessarily optimize happiness for everyone. I think not necessarily. There's absolutely a

328
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,000
discussion to be had about how to best optimize, you know, bandwidth and stuff like this because

329
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,200
you have these heavy ban. The problem is by revoking, and this is the argument for net neutrality,

330
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,520
is that by revoking Title II, we can optimize like that, but we can also do all this other

331
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,720
heinous shit which Comcast and Verizon have. Did you expect them to make money to not milk it as much

332
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,160
as they can? Like, do you know there's like, I think there's no net neutrality. They've already

333
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,480
started doing it. There's already examples of them doing it. I mean, if you, a couple years ago,

334
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,920
Comcast and Verizon throttled Netflix, they throttled Netflix until Netflix started paying

335
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,720
them extra money to cover their bandwidth costs. And then there's like graphs of like this,

336
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,800
the speed slowing down significantly, then the date Netflix started paying, it all went back up,

337
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,600
and both these companies colluded to basically kneecap the company and extort them for money.

338
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,360
Well, okay, I mean, business is business. And I get them wanting to be able to do

339
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,840
those sorts of things, or how businesses find an equilibrium of power. But like, again, you need

340
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,200
competitors to drive down Verizon. And that's the problem right now. Isn't that collusion

341
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,560
and monopoly monopolizing and, you know, trust, aren't trusts illegal? Isn't that why we busted

342
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,440
all those trusts back in the days of Teddy Roosevelt or whatever? To some degree, yes. To

343
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,160
some degree, you're absolutely right. And I totally agree with all of these things,

344
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,920
you know, in practice. I'm sort of being an idealist about like what I would like to see.

345
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:02,160
I would love to have a free market of competition in the space of ISPs and stuff.

346
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,200
The problem is right now, we don't have the infrastructure to do it.

347
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay, but it's just that the problem is the origin of this problem was government regulation,

348
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,440
because there used to be a lot of little ISP providers until things got consolidated. And like

349
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,720
AT&T was like the big one that just took over everything. So as to like supposedly to streamline

350
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,360
the process and to make things more efficient in the development of like phone line infrastructure

351
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,360
at the time and now, you know, a lot of, right? No, no. The problem right now is that government

352
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,320
regulations and like letting these companies lobby and basically dictate policy has totally

353
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,800
fucked up any new players stepping in. It's like, I want the libertarian solution. But like

354
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,080
this particular thing of like enforcing the neutrality is indeed like an extra like restriction.

355
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,800
But like, that doesn't get it closer to egalitarianism. I just want it to like all stop. And it's all

356
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,840
to be free to exchange commerce in a free open way. But that's not like what this one issue

357
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,040
solves. Let's say we pull it all back and we revoked title two and put it back on title one and

358
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,760
anybody can do anything. My concern with that is that, okay, this solution, because like this is

359
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,160
what people are talking about, let's get rid of all the legislation. And yeah, if Comcast and Verizon

360
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,360
and all these fucks decide to like make the internet terrible, we're just gonna have more

361
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,560
companies come in and take their place. And my two concerns with that is one, what do we do in the

362
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,800
meantime, while all these new companies magically sprout out out of the ether, the internet still

363
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,160
fucked, we're still kneecapped for the time being. And two, like if the market responds to supply and

364
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,920
demand, like if we wait long enough, and this is just how the internet is, like none of these

365
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,720
companies are legally binded to be good people, like you can just have another company come in

366
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,880
and like not restricted by regulation, but be like, yeah, Verizon and Comcast is doing it,

367
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,280
I'm gonna do it too, but I'll charge five bucks less. And so there's no guarantee that the problem

368
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,520
that we're talking about that's going to go away would go away. Whereas with net neutrality,

369
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,080
it does go away. So it's a guarantee versus a hope that people are going to do the right thing.

370
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,160
And I don't trust people because people are assholes. That's understandable. That's understandable.

371
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
But I think there's way more nuance to this discussion that's being completely thrown out,

372
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,560
because we're not talking about title two, we're just talking about net neutrality,

373
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:14,720
which is only a small part of the impact of title two regulations. Indeed. And this is what I

374
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,040
want to bring up. Like what we're doing right now is not virtue signaling. This is an actual

375
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,160
discussion about the pros and cons of these issues. What I'm gonna do after this is that I am going

376
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,560
to post this, the time code of you talking about net neutrality on my Twitter saying, I was there.

377
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,520
I know about net neutrality. This is me and my buddies talking about it, even though I didn't

378
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
say shit because I don't get it. You'll be so smart. You'll be so smart. That'll be new virtue

379
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,760
signaling. That's my plan. Yeah, intellectual virtue signaling. Yeah, that's cool. I like it.

380
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,080
Make sure you put your Patreon in there so people can give you money to help fight the good fight

381
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,480
for net neutrality. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's the thing right there. Like guys, I'm working so hard to

382
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,600
support. Oh, you know what it reminds me of? Remember Ben, like Mad Munchkins, like her,

383
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,200
her like, what was it, another Patreon, but her like things like support artists in the local

384
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,080
community or something? Yeah, yeah, her kickstarted with the incredibly vague like goal of like,

385
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,040
yeah, support like local business. Okay, she's just giving me money so I can buy things.

386
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,520
Live in my town and purchase things from my local, from my local vendors. You know what a great

387
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,760
example of virtue signaling that kind of hit close to home because it's in our backyard

388
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,880
is all these people being like, I got demonetized again on YouTube. Please give me money on Patreon.

389
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:38,080
It's the only way I can survive. That's the virtue signaling right there. Tom, didn't you say that

390
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:44,000
exact same thing? I don't know. I did. I did. I keep bitching about it, but I'm not like I never

391
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,480
post my Patreon link ever. I think I did once as a joke. Okay, but but but I don't say it's funny.

392
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,360
There's this one guy is a joke though. Yeah, I will agree that one time I'm being hypocritical,

393
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,400
but it's funny. I mean, I don't blame every time I bitch about like being demonetized. I'm not

394
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,800
I did it just now. I don't like my fucking because like minutes ago, like like if none of these videos

395
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,000
I post are going to make any money anyways, they're going to make like a dollar like I don't even

396
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,080
fucking I if I should just turn off monetization on my channel entirely because I make nothing.

397
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,400
It's more the principle the matter that pisses me off. Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's funny

398
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,920
because this one guy keeps replying to all of my posts with my Patreon link. I'm like, dude,

399
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,480
I'm not posting it because I'm not trying to I'm not trying to virtue signal. I'm trying to say,

400
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,120
look how dumb this is. But um, but there are people that who do that who would just make a big

401
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,560
deal about it and like I get it. I get that it's a huge problem and but to there's there's a point

402
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,960
where like I think there are some people who like have like hundreds of thousands of subscribers

403
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,280
and just lost 50% of their income and that's all the money they were making and they're like shit

404
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,520
guys. I'm opening a Patreon. Could you help me? I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't have

405
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,240
this and then there's the people who jump on that bandwagon or like this is a good way to get on

406
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,400
this narrative and get some extra Patreon. Because it is legit for some people because it is legit

407
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:10,000
for some people. It's also a convenient excuse. And I mean, I said, but now Patreon's kind of a

408
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,480
bit fucked as well. So it's getting there. Okay, as much as I depend upon it, Patreon is a terrible

409
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,600
company and I wish there were an alternative. So these changes, these changes that are happening

410
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,000
in Patreon that definitely are to some degree going to make people not want to use it as much.

411
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,520
There are people who have already lost hundreds of dollars for this.

412
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Yeah, I've lost a couple bucks so far and it's going to hit on the 18th. I believe it's one of the

413
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,920
fees like the bill comes for the for the patrons so we will see them leave. It's a thing that's like

414
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,680
it's not it doesn't yeah like like more of the fee is the fees putting like part of the fees being

415
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,640
put onto the the patrons rather than taken out of the of the creator's cut and like it's a pretty

416
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,800
small percentage but it's also got like a small tax on it's like 2.9% plus 35 so for a $1 pledge that

417
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,840
it bumps it up from like $1 to like $1.40 which is right and that's a 40% increase yeah the thing

418
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,600
that sucks is that like let's say because the argument that everyone's making I think is totally

419
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:16,480
valid let's say there's a guy who pledges a dollar to the PCP and a dollar to all of us that's $11

420
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,840
a month he has to pay that 40 cent fee on each one so now that's right he's paying $15 $16 it's

421
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,880
really it's really it's really it's really much more harshly punishing like low level patrons I

422
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,280
don't want to point out that like this fee this cost has always been there and so yeah we were just

423
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,800
taking it out of our income which I was fine with yeah I was pretty fine with it like I understood

424
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,520
that going in I don't I mean I would rather I would rather lose I would rather lose a cut I would

425
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,320
rather lose a cut of a patron's pledge than dissuade them from pledging at all because they're

426
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,840
uncomfortable I hear what you're saying I just wish things had been like this from the start and

427
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,200
people knew what they were signing up for that would make here's my thing yeah here's my question

428
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,520
because like if you know because I looked at the numbers and I'm dumb I don't know man you're smart

429
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,800
um because the numbers that patreon threw out is that we made what like 80 to 88 percent of each

430
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,200
dollar and that was what they were talking like that was the number before and now it's 95

431
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,120
yeah that's about right because I don't understand where if it's the same percent that seems low

432
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,320
well the thing is is like if we were making 80 percent at the low end before but now one dollar

433
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,920
patrons have to pay 40 percent more it's it's because patron making more money no no no no that's

434
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,280
coming from patreon is taking the same amount they're they pay they need the more money because

435
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,880
they're changing the infrastructure so that they it's uh the the thing is more like a subscription

436
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,120
service where the person who pledges um gets paid on the same time every month that they pledged

437
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,840
well to do that they need more they need to do more transactions which means higher transaction

438
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,880
fees I I wasn't aware that that was changing so there is there is more money being taken total

439
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,120
now right I do not think that's being taken more money is being taken in total but the money

440
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,960
that that's right that is being taken is used to pay for the extra transactions which I mean

441
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,640
would make patreon more smooth and and less confusing but it does you're being slightly

442
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,800
inaccurate that that's not quite right what's actually changing is patreon is specifically

443
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,800
trying to change how transparent they are about how much patron pledges like actually are giving the

444
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,120
money to the people you are patroning to so when you pledge one dollar what you're pledging is to

445
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,680
make to do whatever is necessary to get that one dollar to the pledge I was just explaining that

446
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,320
the reason the money is going up is not to get patreon more money they they made an update

447
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,720
to to alleviate concerns and I read that and I was like okay I like the the the main goal was to

448
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,280
make patreon itself work more smoothly and less confusingly um and they gave a few reasons for

449
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,960
like the way the system is now people like yeah I don't know it's it's I just want to look it up and

450
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,080
you'll read it I'll lay this case out real simple for you before patreon used to like if you pledged

451
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,760
a dollar what uh we you would send in a dollar and patreon and the money you know and like the

452
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,480
people you are patroning to they figure out what fees they need to pay to get whatever's left of

453
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,280
that pledge to the person that you're patroning to now what they're doing is they're making sure

454
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,080
that uh okay so 95 of that one dollar goes to the patreon person and then five percent of your

455
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,200
pledge goes to patreon as their earnings and then off of your back you do whatever's necessary to

456
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,360
pay those fees that like 40 cents or whatever to get that money to where it needs to go that's

457
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,160
that's also true but like that yeah the reason that that is like the thing is they wanted to

458
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,160
to like dress it up nice because that their main thing was they were for the artist they're for

459
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,800
the artist yeah they're for the artist they wanted to be like oh we're gonna give the creators more

460
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,920
money make sure there's we're taking less of off of your paycheck that was what they led with but

461
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,800
the reason they're doing it at all is to change the infrastructure of the site which just leads them

462
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,600
with more transaction fees that they have to give to either the creators or the the the pledges and

463
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,560
they decided to give it to the pledges and now everyone's upset I don't like the okay patron

464
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,920
has done but that is the reason they've to bring this back to virtue signaling because I we're

465
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,200
getting a little we're getting a little caught off-path now oh yeah don't you think that this problem

466
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,360
has become exponentially bigger than it otherwise would have been because all these artists are

467
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,240
virtue signaling online about how bad it is and now everyone's aware that's true yeah that's true

468
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,280
yeah I you know I've I've been a lot of people are deep pledging because they've been made aware of

469
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,520
this where they have just saw it in their bank account they would have been like that's dumb or

470
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,520
they would have like investigated and read what patreon said to be like that's okay but because

471
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,240
all these people like this is evil now everyone's like I don't want to support this evil company

472
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,280
I've been that's not true guys it's just business I've been seeing a lot of comic people on Twitter

473
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,800
who are like railing against it and like on the one hand like I'm not happy about it because I am

474
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,160
I do think that it has us a pretty good chance to de-incentivize people from pledging and put

475
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,680
people off and and could hurt me but on the other hand like to go to go out and be like guys patron

476
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:12,080
is evil like well I mean I don't want to my goal is not to dissuade people from from doing it I mean

477
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,320
I don't want them to jump into it and then get hit with a bunch of extra fees they weren't expecting

478
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,120
but like you know I just as long as it's transparent and they know what they're pledging for like

479
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,880
of course I want people to do it you know that's my people are so people are so retarded when it

480
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,280
comes to like fees and business and whatever I have I feel like I have a fundamentally different

481
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,960
view from like a lot of my fellow millennials out there like guys business is business sometimes

482
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,120
businesses rearrange the way that their cost structures are working sometimes they just

483
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,680
have to make changes and and they they are telling you what the changes so you can say you know what

484
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,280
this is not not what I want to do I'm going to stop doing this it is not evil to change your

485
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,160
business model they are simply adjusting things and if you don't like it fucking leave well from

486
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,160
that's not evil perspective because I agree with you you know like they have to do what they have

487
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,640
to do to make the business work and like there are there are questions of ethics that we can ask

488
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,960
I don't think sure but uh but like again like that's it's not a question of ethics why they're

489
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,200
doing it I think the the problem with patreon doing this is that they've tried to spin it

490
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,560
to make them look like good guys and not just like this is a business decision because I think

491
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,720
they just like work that's what I hate about we have to adjust for the market and this is how

492
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,640
we're going to do it would have been much better than like hey guys we really want to make sure

493
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,120
you get as much money as possible because we love you so much patreon is going to give you some more

494
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,240
money right all right that's that's the part that really pissed me off like like I don't know like

495
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,440
like jack conti really kind of just creeps me out jack conti biggest virtual biggest virtual

496
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,440
signal in the world and about hater of all pornography patreon like pornography patreon has

497
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,080
in an infamous I mean at least among the pcp an infamous email writer who sends us yeah

498
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,800
um every single time it's like some sort of announcement yeah and she's like talking to

499
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,040
us like we're four year olds like oh we're patreon we love creators like you it's like oh

500
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,840
sad okay it makes me mad it makes me mad and it feels disingenuous because because patreon

501
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,880
like yet like to me and like to us like they're this is like they're not a community like we

502
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,280
don't interact with the patreon community they're just a service dude they want you to be in that

503
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,160
community so bad so that you'll keep recirculating you'll pledge to your friends and then all the

504
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,160
money will continuously recycle and then patreon just draws more money off the top of all of it

505
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,960
don't know what community they're talking about I don't know I don't know they they really just

506
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,760
they feel they feel like I don't know they like xylophones to them to like it's like from their

507
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,240
perspective or at least how they wish it was it's like all the people that have patrons are like

508
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,920
their family and they're all their children and they're all working and we're all working together

509
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,720
for the common goal of making patreon and they need to dictate what's good and what's bad art

510
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,280
and they need to make sure and I really do not like the attitude they cop that like I'm supposed

511
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,920
to buy into this narrative let's just let's just same side no you're a service that I use you should

512
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,280
be literally paypal paypal is all these things people have been asking me like what to do if you

513
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,040
don't want to use patreon anymore because you find this evil because you're a retarded person

514
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,520
uh the the answer is use paypal yeah like you can set up you can set up recurring payments on

515
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,720
paypal if you want I have links to my paypal in my fucking my channel bar so I have I have links to

516
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,040
do that on my on my about page on stcomics.com I mean I've had yeah it's it's not one guy but it

517
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,920
works just as well I mean I was using paypal for recurring purchases before patreon even existed

518
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,080
so like it's not like this is a new service they have but it but it needs to come to me

519
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,200
didn't you were like how do we make money and one of the things we were like oh we can make

520
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,400
recurring payments on paypal I guess we can try that but it doesn't have that friendly face painted

521
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,160
it's not a creator's maybe maybe that's a necessary evil then maybe some of these people

522
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,200
need their hug box in order to get them on board which I find really odd but it just makes me mad

523
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,680
it just makes me mad to hear from Taryn all the time because she's talking about what a great

524
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,520
hug box community and I'm like I have yet to receive a single hug from you patreon

525
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
hahaha

526
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,960
some hug box yeah what the fuck I want to talk about um the the the dick show patreon because

527
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,680
okay I I don't know whether who would agree on like where would this would stand in virtue

528
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,360
signaling because the reason his patreon is gigantic yeah is because he's writing off of

529
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,480
the the backlash from Maddox like that if Maddox wasn't um doing things against dick and giving

530
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,720
him reasons to you know to to feel like the victim people would not be pledging to dick

531
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,440
it's interesting that you bring this up just because I I I just finished the biggest problem

532
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,360
like listening to it like three days ago uh because did you told me to like get off my

533
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,760
ass and and listen to it so I finally did so I was I've actually been interested because like

534
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,360
it just ends the podcast just kind of ends I'm like what the fuck so I I've been starting to dig

535
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,440
in like what the fuck happened like what and then I saw dick's patreon I'm like holy fuck the man's

536
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,960
loaded yeah so yeah the basic idea is like Maddox didn't say anything and dick did so everyone

537
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,760
went over to dick's show and dick you know said all the gossip and stuff and then recently Maddox

538
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,400
is like filed a lawsuit against uh dick for like um you know damages and stuff and it's a big lawsuit

539
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:37,200
and dick is like dick's patreon has blown up considerably since then because because he's

540
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,200
because he's you know I saw he was at like 20k before is it like he's at almost 23k right now

541
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,120
holy shit and yeah it is like every every time Maddox every time Maddox lashes out against him

542
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,000
and he's done and he's done so in some really stupid and baffling ways before so I get it like

543
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,960
I get how I get why dick looks like the good guy in this I mean I don't even disagree with that

544
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,240
Maddox was a big asshole uh but but yeah like every time Maddox takes any action against dick

545
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,160
it's like we gotta it's it's a fucking rush to to support dick because now Maddox and any and he's

546
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,400
hugely benefited off of it to be fair I'm sure the biggest dick sucker in the world a digi bro

547
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,240
would say that like a dick has like capitalized on the opportunity and turned that gossip into a

548
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:28,960
comedy show yeah like that's his real source of you know stuff yeah I don't know tomato tomato

549
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,760
tomato hmm but I think we can agree the foundation here is is a sort of virtue signaling I think

550
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,600
I have no idea what you guys are talking about I think it is yeah I think dick I just yeah dick

551
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,880
did a really good job dick did a really good job of painting himself as the good guy in that conflict

552
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,040
and he did it paid off I don't uh yeah you know uh virtue signaling pays guys once again good good

553
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,640
good good for him good for him I suppose like he really did monetize being a victim and in

554
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,720
sometimes that's appropriate like if you yeah a bit you know yeah you know you know like if you

555
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,640
sue someone in the US that's reasonable oh yeah go on go on no no no that's fine that's moving on

556
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,880
if that's what we had to say about that I I feel like we've pretty much run of gamut here I think

557
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,800
we've done a lot of good stuff on on this topic and I I'm pretty pretty spent I just I just want to

558

564
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,760
check in it I'll believe whatever you say that's from Ghostbusters that's Winston is that the new

565
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,200
Ghostbusters the old no no that's the old one yeah yeah when he answers the ad he answers the ad

566
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,640
and the receptionist is like do you believe in the paranormal experiences after like life after

death the Loch Ness monster and UFOs and he's like if there's a steady paycheck in it I'll believe

568
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,880
whatever you say because he's a because he's an opportunist but he's also got a heart of gold

569
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:22,640
Nate that was Winston not women Jesus hello okay let's I mean I got I got some questions here

570
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,480
if we're all set I can pull up some of these questions I'm okay to do that okay here's a

571
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:36,240
here's a point of order question at the one true Henry asks okay why does your logo say TPC

572
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:43,360
but the podcast is PCP wouldn't it be TPCP if you are the procrastinators then it should be the

573
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:50,560
procrastinators podcast justify yourself okay okay I'm gonna I'll go on record I think the logo

574
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:57,360
probably should read PCP rather than TPC but the reason it says TPC is because it stands for

575
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,400
the procrastinators which is the name of our organization whereas procrastinators podcast is

576
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,720
the name of the show indeed I like I like TPC just because it means that if we if we if we want to

577
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:15,280
end the podcast and make a different show we can that yeah that's true that's true there are there

578
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,120
are many shows under the subset of this other the heading of TPC of I mean let's let's be honest

579
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,720
just just to be like we we've talked a few times about munchy rebranding all this because this was

580
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,680
all cobbled together without any sort of like logical thought at all we just kind of like

581
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,000
squeezed our cheeks together and shit this out and that's that's the graphic design of

582
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,800
the procrastinators in general wait if you squeeze your cheeks together and then shit it out well

583
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,120
you're gonna get shit all over your cheeks just yeah and that's why that's why we're such a

584
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:50,720
fucking mess that's why we're a fucking mess and that explains where the the aesthetic is

585
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,280
shit everywhere all over the place in places except except get out from my case Jesus yeah

586
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,920
it was even more apt than you know than you know it's it's shit everywhere except on

587
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,040
procrastinators red bubble merch shop where you can get all the cool not shit designs right now

588
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,000
indeed uh so that's that that's that under the under the sweat under the rug what else we got

589
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,120
hey uh here's one I don't know if this might be a quick one but at stumble reel asks any of you

590
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,560
watch or listen to Harman Town do you any of you guys watch that show I listen to like one episode

591
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:32,080
I kind of always meant to listen to it but I haven't so no also stumble reel is the guy who

592
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,960
discovered the origin of the pcp guy that's right that's now dead pcp guy rest in peace

593
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,360
long last it's forever in our hearts uh and here's one more question from from the pity from the

594
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:51,760
pity section here on on twitter uh at zacktm underscore asks wait oh sorry that was the wrong

595
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,440
person get fucked zack uh it was actually at center point 360 uh asks what's your favorite

596
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,480
thing to do while sick that's an important question because you're always looking for something to do

597
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,080
while sick any tips here would be very much appreciated do you sleep yeah sleep yeah sleep and

598
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:14,720
just do my own thing I always roll around in my vomit and my shit and just my favorite thing to do

599
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,560
is is to have like a like a thing of like just plain crackers and a glass of water and sit and

600
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,480
watch a show a marathon a show on a big old tv marathoning anime is what I do I don't I don't

601
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,320
know if this counts when I say everything to do while sick is to skip work any excuse I have to

602
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:37,120
oh yeah work is a 10 out of 10 in my book I depending on how sick I am like um if I'm super

603
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,880
sick and I can't do much like in super high here whatever didn't sleep because that's the only thing

604
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,400
I can do and it makes time pass and hopefully that means when I wake up I'll feel better uh but if

605
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,160
it's like the kind of sick that I can still get out of bed and do stuff then um usually just like

606
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,560
maybe play games on phone or watch videos or listen to something something mild

607
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,360
I mean I mean everything I do is just fucking sitting around on youtube or just drawn or whatever

608
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:11,200
so I just I I do all the same nothing changes nothing changes when I'm incapacitated nothing

609
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,400
changes between Ben being alive and dead it's basically the same

610
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,880
same difference um okay should we have some patreon questions absolutely I've got one right here

611
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,120
there's two questions related to me so I want to okay go for it are we gonna see mage at ratcon

612
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:35,120
three the rat cunning uh where is it gonna happen do you guys know in america somewhere that's a

613
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,920
no no no mage there you go maybe maybe if we maybe if we kick started the shit out of it

614
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,520
we could we could fly you out I mean at at one point at one point we were we were considering

615
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:54,000
like me and mage flying together so it wouldn't be like scary but it's we don't know anything about

616
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,400
ratcon three yet so it's gonna happen barely even exists so yeah it's gonna happen during the summer

617
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,880
so long if it's gonna happen during the summer then it's gonna be a strict no for me because

618
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,800
I have obligations during the summer but really noted yeah it's gonna happen at any other time

619
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,280
then we'll see we'll have to discuss it I'd really like it I'd really like it if we don't we don't

620
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,480
have digi house anymore so that that that's really been the big issue I think if digi still had his

621
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,240
house we all would have hung out again by now probably possibly yeah I'm glad to get out of that

622
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,040
house no I want to expand just come to like UK and have an adventure in London but that's so much

623
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,440
more expensive for everyone you know combined I know but like one day one day we'll do the

624
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,040
maybe you have a little bit of female privilege but don't don't push your luck all right I don't

625
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,240
know maybe maybe maybe if we get me you know maybe if the pcp keeps growing and we make you know we

626
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,640
start we have more money to throw around maybe we could make radcon four in fucking London patreon.com

627
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,880

one dollar off my next order and even though that doesn't make it cheaper than the competition

635
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:46,720
I have to spend that free that dirt cheap dollar or else it's a waste so I'm fucking trapped I've

650
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:19,280
undertale to probably a lie probably a lie but god I want to believe I can't wait to see gell

651
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,040
mill del Toro reprise his role as sand yeah it's gonna be fucking great that little troll of a man

yeah oh fantastic uh tom what do you want for christmas um oh my god I don't I don't do it I

653
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,200
don't have a meme answer so I just want to fucking switch I want to I want to I want to buy mario

654
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,840
honestly god damn it can't blame you dude I cannot blame you it's fucking good dude they just

655
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:47,600
announced bayonetta 3 I'm done I know for the switch the hits keep coming god damn like fuck

656
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,520
yeah that that that and 10 billion subscribers so I can stop working yeah job that that's that'd be

657
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,040
nice we all want that uh mage what do you want for christmas uh I don't have a meme answer either

658
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,320
like I have a bit of a dilemma I do want the switch as well but like there aren't any currently

659
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,760
games that I want on it but there will be like I know that there's a shin megami tense a game

660
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,760
coming out yeah that's coming that's coming there's definitely going to be a pokemon game on it so

661
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:20,160
no doubt me getting a switch at some point in my life is probably going to be inevitable isn't

662
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,920
ultra sun and ultra moon coming out on the switch yeah that's already available yeah that's out that's

663
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,360
yeah I have a 3ds so I could get it if I wanted to but I'm I'm not particularly inclined to get it

664
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:37,600
because I'm saving up some money um and the other thing I want is I want to play persona 5

665
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:45,360
really really bad but the problem is I don't have a ps4 nor a tv to put it onto that's on vita

666
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:53,760
2 isn't it um no no it's not sadly no okay just pull your just dust off your old vita I yeah I have

667
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,040
a vita like I've got it for really wait you do yeah I have a ps vita I got it for really cheap for my

668
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,200
sister's but uh well currently husband it's really cheap and I got a digimon game on it

669
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,000
that was fun hey apparently it is available for the vita but it's got stutters and it doesn't run

670
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,840
great wait no no I love it up are you sure maybe I'm wrong I don't know I am not you know what okay

671
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,720
this is my mission life I'm gonna find out right now hang on okay because there's definitely a persona

672
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:26,720
for golden on ps vita which I'm gonna get for Christmas from my parents oh wait it's available

673
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,560
on ps3 that's that's something I don't own it though that that has stutters I've heard though

674
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,080
okay that's that's probably what it is okay well that's fucked uh yeah so like if if I want persona

675
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:48,640
5 I'd have to get like a ps4 and a tv or so I'm not gonna get any of them but in a perfect world

676
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,960
I would get everything dreams are made to not be fulfilled that's what I that's what I believe

677
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,240
men going and keep them unsatisfied indeed my dream is to never have my dream fulfilled

678
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,720
that's that's a pretty good dream I think because if you do then you'll just languish

679
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,280
wait that's not true life should be about achieving goals then setting new goals so never mind uh

680
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:17,920
yeah ignore that uh anything else gib is there anything else you want um I was trying to think

681
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:23,280
and it's really just I want to get all of my affairs like my currently outstanding affairs in order

682
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:30,160
by the time the new year party and all that like right clean slate let's do this let's do like it'll

683
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,920
help my mind be clear yeah so that I so that I don't have to think I gotta do that that's a great

684
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,040
I totally feel you because I just finished that animation and now if I can get that strike off of

685
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,640
that uh second part of the y3d anime fails all the projects I started this year will be done

686
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,640
and yeah rates so I have like a two-week window to make that work I'm hoping I'm hoping like even

687
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,520
even though it doesn't really make any difference because it's just the next day but it is new year

688
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,440
it's a very mental like block when totally old year stuff is still being done it's become a cultural

689
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:10,960
thing and so you're affected by it naturally um and I guess what I want for Christmas I want a

690
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,320
microwave I would like a microwave for Christmas I don't want a microwave I do not have a microwave

691
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:22,640
yep yep I don't know I feel like they wouldn't having a microwave make it easier to to start eating

692
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,480
things that aren't fucking cans of kidney beans oh you just want to heat up those kidney beans is

693
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,400
that is that what this is all about frankly the real reason is I just want to be able to cook oats

694
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,640
much more easily than I do right now that's that's the real thing I want dude you know what I have

695
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,360
when I have like oatmeal and stuff we have a water dispenser and it dispenses hot water so it's

696
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,680
like instant like literally like you pour the hot water in with the oats and it's instantly done

697
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,680
it's the most magical thing of all time that's pretty good though I'm not sure that actually

698
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,080
works with like the steel cut oats that I've got because like you have to like they're pretty tough

699
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,160
and I think the microwave process like softens them or something maybe I don't know maybe I'm

700
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:06,160
wrong I don't know but in any case I need some solution well I'm gonna work on that that's my

701
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,560
goal to have better oats really what I want for Christmas is oats I want those sweet sweet oats

702
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,960
like what a weird utilitarian answer I gotta get my fucking gains dude okay here we go

703
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,560
now another question uh snow zillofenikin that's mazillofenikin what's up dude

704
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,040
any plans on the pcp having more guest appearances or guest interviews with content creators you

705
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,600
enjoy I've been thinking about this a little bit haven't actually haven't haven't had any ideas for

706
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:38,320
that lately that's true I I want to get Andrew Hussie on the Undertale uh what oh my god it'll

707
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,720
be our Undertale 2 podcast our best game ever number two when I get Undertale 2 for Christmas

708
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:52,000
and then release it on steam and make a hundred million dollars um I actually there is a guy who

709
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,240
I've been I've this has been like a pet project of mine for a long time uh that I haven't really

710
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:02,400
talked about that much but I I want to interview rosseter from twin perfect because he fascinates

711
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,240
me and I he's like the main guy with glasses and uh blonde hair with no beard you know okay

712
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,800
yeah yeah yeah he's like the he's the main dude I want to know what fascinates you about him

713
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,000
like because I've because I've watched those twin perfect silent hill videos yeah you're at your

714
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,160
behest good good it's it's the the the uniquely like adversarial attitude of his videos I find

715
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:32,080
very compelling and the incredible meticulous detail both in the research of the videos as well as the

716
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:38,800
editing of the videos is definitely like an has been an influence on me and uh uh I mean it's it's

717
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,680
it's just very interesting especially the kind of languishing that the channel has done uh that

718
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,400
like I'm I'm just wondering why he hasn't like dedicated himself more to producing more content

719
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,600
in a more expedient manner I just want to know what makes the man tick and and know what the

720
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,200
deals because it's one of my favorite channels on all of YouTube that releases content very

721
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,360
irregularly I don't know that there are real enigma to me I want to know them more you're

722
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,160
going to have to lick me this channel because I have no idea who you're talking about I will

723
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,720
twin perfect youtube search youtube search uh the real silent hill experience there's a playlist

724
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:18,000
just start watching it it is like it is like an 18 or 17 episode long gauntlet of like some gigantic

725
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,480
videos it kind of it kind of falls apart at the end but whatever nah yeah it does there's like a

726
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,480
podcast in there well okay that that yeah is it like a let's play or is it like no no no no no no

727
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,000
it's like a long analytical thing okay it's it's on youtube the merits of silent hill 2 it basically

728
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,960
it's it's a it goes through the whole series the whole series yeah it just discuss it in great

729
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,640
detail I was pretty interested by even despite that I've never played a silent hill before

730
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,480
watching those is what maybe you want to play sound hill and then I did so they're they're real good

731
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,720
they're real good uh in any case that so that's that's like an idea I've had and I actually

732
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,360
messaged rosseter once before but he just didn't reply but now that I am now that I've officially

733
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:03,440
passed twin perfect insubscribers perhaps now he'll pay attention to me and give a shit about me

734
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:11,200
we'll see will I pay attention to you when you're the senpai yeah exactly the co has become the senpai

735
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:18,160
I just realized I didn't credit the people that I asked and answered the questions too so quickly

736
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:24,240
oh okay the the person who asked if I was going to be in radclan was daxter from patreon lounge

737
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:32,560
and Ken majored out me person was squid mika from patreon lounge excellent um I okay I think that's

738
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:39,600
going to do it I'm not seeing any other questions here okay not about me okay back what was each of

739
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:44,320
your best parts of 2017 both professionally and personally oh that's a good question that is a

740
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:52,960
good question buy a one spar on uh let's go first yeah I think for mine it was following after me

741
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:58,160
and math of uh it was you know it's dark demon blood month bro and then Igmovo to a ditch that was like

742
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,480
that was a lot of videos and that was really stressful but it was cool that I did it some

743
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,640
stressful and some of those dark the just some of those dark demon blood month videos are really

744
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,600
good still damn right they are and the thumbnail to the first one for demon stills is still like

745
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:20,000
one of my favorite thumbnails of all time a demon an arrow to the demon oh it's excellent uh this has

746
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,880
been a huge year for me obviously uh me and mafa was was was uh crazy was huge was big uh but actually

747
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,800
like the channel doubled in size of course with the galco video beforehand where I finally broke

748
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,440
like it was funny like all these barriers like kind of broke all at the same time around like may

749
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,280
this year were like I had never I remember like I had been saying on twitter and stuff

750
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,640
I so I'm so close to 17 000 subscribers the old goal that that uh tbap never reached I want to

751
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,440
break that that's my goal and then I did and then immediately galco came out and over the next like

752
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,840
couple of couple of days and weeks my channel more than doubled in size like 40 000 and then um

753
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,800
yeah fuck and then just like me and mafa was already happening because I already planned it

754
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,520
before galco came out and that was that was big that made people like aware of my channel as

755
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,600
like a thing that was it was going to update regularly and now I'm I've just like learned

756
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,280
from those experiences and I made a couple videos and now I'm doing we agua and things have never

757
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:20,640
been better in terms of the online stuff yeah it's real great it's real great oh also we all

758
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,600
started the pcp uh patreon this year and that was definitely god that was only this year that was

759
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:32,400
only this year it was only this year it was like march or something yeah she it yep yep yep um

760
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:39,600
well I mean I finished champion chapter one finally uh which was great I finished a nuzloc

761
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:47,040
conquest which was a relief oh yeah I was so glad when that was over um yeah good stuff good stuff

762
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,960
yeah um I think my favorite like professional thing that I did this year was just learning 3d

763
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,240
like I've I've told myself I wanted to learn I was gonna make a video about this actually today

764
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,960
just talking about it because I just released the animation uh but I've wanted to do 3d since 2006

765
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,480
and I always told myself I was too dumb to do it and this year I finally nut it up and I went from

766
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:09,680
knowing nothing about it to making an animation in 11 months so way to go dude that was cool

767
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,480
and I really love your little uh the little gifts like rotations of like little models you make

768
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,000
oh tom yeah the the thing the animation went up today right uh you went up yesterday actually

769
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,840
okay I haven't seen it yet so I gotta I thought it was pretty impressed though I want to watch it

770
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,080
again because I could only quickly watch it at the time yeah it's not I mean there's room for

771
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,480
improvement but in terms of just like getting it out look pretty smooth I noticed that hips way I

772
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,040
noticed that hips way going on which which channel was it on uh it's on my main channel it's on

773
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,960
it's funny you say that hips way is good because I had a guy uh who I woke up to this guy who looks

774
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:50,080
like a huge essay comment saying he was quote a professional animator and did a shot by shot

775
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,680
breakdown of how terrible it was well that's kind of a compliment I suppose in its own way it's his

776
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:01,200
comment was a fuck you I thought you were good at art what is dude what the fuck that it's it's

777
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,880
it's really all right I saw that comment as well it's basically he he copied it from a discord

778
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,400
where he was discussing it among people yeah and he pasted it but he didn't take out like the the

779
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,760
colloquial things he was saying to his friends about how tom in in the third person is terrible

780
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,120
yeah it was it was the worst thing and then I called him on it I called him on it he's like yeah

781
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,640
that's exactly what happened and then he messaged me on twitter's like I'm sorry I'm like yeah fuck

782
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:33,120
you well okay that's nice but yeah some of the some of the criticisms he had was you know they

783
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,920
they they they they were all right like there was tons of good good ideas in there for improving

784
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:44,000
sandwich between you're a fucking retard so that was fun but that that my favorite like

785
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,000
professional thing was was a 3d my favorite personal thing this year was definitely uh

786
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,120
rad country watching mad bull with everybody oh i forgot rad country was this year guys remember

787
01:10:53,120 --> 01:11:01,280
that i remember now but yeah it was fucking january jeez Louise yeah i miss those days soon for me

788
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,760
personally i think i mentioned that in the last podcast when i got my health in order like at the

789
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:16,480
end of um may or so that was that was like the best that's a huge deal major's out there major's

790

807
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,880
enjoy this but there's just so many there's so many when i see when i see comments like that like

808
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,640
the king of hearts video was out this year and that was also great but whenever i get a mean

809
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,400
comments on anything or rather when i get a really nice comment that i'd like to be like oh thanks

810
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,360
dude or anything like that i i generally suppress the urge because i don't want the people leaving

811
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,280
mean comments to know that i'm reading their comments and only replying to the nice ones i

812
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,080
don't want to give them that yeah no i never i would never reply to like a shitty comment or a

813
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,720
comment criticizing me because it's like yeah yeah we don't we don't we don't need to give them what

814
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,080
they want we don't need to spare those any attention no my favorite thing to do with mean

815
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,800
comments is to reply nicely because they don't know what to do after that that's always fun because

816
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,400
if they respond they're just like uh if if fuck if they do uh they are in fact the fool i usually

817
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,440
reply by making their attitude or make fun of them i don't know like it really depends on the comment

818
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,280
like sometimes i don't reply at all if it's just not worth my time sometimes maybe if i feel

819
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:50,160
feel like i have something to say i say it but if someone if someone just seriously if someone

820
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:54,320
just comments in a way that's like they don't like me then i just don't respond because like

821
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,880
right or whatever but if but if it's someone like if it's someone who's like criticizing or

822
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,480
saying something that's like wrong or like making some kind of some kind of like claim that's wrong

823
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,680
and like then i'll reply and be like listen yeah let me set the record straight on this because like

824
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:14,160
i don't want people reading this comment and and believing it i'm always tempted to reply to those

825
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:18,480
sorts of things but generally i find myself replying more to i mean if this is rare this is

826
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:24,160
like the rarest breed but like someone making like a substantive sincere criticism of like any

827
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:32,800
point or whatever those i will reply to uh sometimes not i want to say quickly uh it's like um if people

828
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,720
like post like super angry or or something like comments like that like one of my favorite things

829
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:45,120
to play with is just lol that that's all i i don't want to do that because i feel like that gives

830
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,320
them what they want they got your attention no i just like they never reply they never reply to

831
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:56,960
it though like i haven't had a person reply to lol to lol well fair enough if it works for you then

832
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:06,640
but godspeed uh i don't always but sometimes i do well um any more questions i think that's about

833
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:12,320
it i think we've tapped out you have something to say i think i feel like he had i was it was just

834
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:18,320
about a comment thing um but i don't know the moment feels like it's past you can say it's okay i

835
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,360
want to hear it give i want to hear that shit tell me about the comment oh okay who are you

836
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:31,760
the the fucking uh i had a comment recently uh on my ape escape part three uh video

837
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:37,440
saying it was the worst one i ever made and i was the worst video ever i felt terrible yeah i saw

838
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:46,480
that i wanted to kill him yeah but um has he even seen a g r p j i mean i i love g r p j i honestly

839
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:52,720
i wish you would make more g r p j yeah me too me me too um anyway uh there was two people who

840
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,080
asked that said that and i was like oh i'm gonna respond because i i just i just really want to

841
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:04,080
know like why why why is it the worst one and i felt better just asking him so what didn't you

842
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:09,520
like about it and then he replied with more specifics and i was like okay that actually makes me feel

843
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:16,240
better knowing it precisely what was wrong yeah because it's no longer like an ephemeral thing of

844
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,520
like you're terrible now it's like okay he's like specific criticisms like these can be changed or

845
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,280
you know i can totally relate uh one of the comments i got on the the video that i disabled

846
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,440
the comments on like it's not necessarily a bad comment it's not the reason i disabled comments

847
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,120
it's just like um and they come to someone like oh well where the fuck did that at enemy go and i'm

848
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:44,240
like what's the problem with it and they were like oh and that specific point uh uh his head

849
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,840
seems a bit too big and i was like yeah that's a fair point uh you could have just started with that

850
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,000
and they're like i'm sorry about being too direct i was like see that the problem was that you

851
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,760
weren't direct enough right exactly yeah it's just like the commenter atmosphere you know like we

852
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,800
we got to change the commenter culture guys make it work it's it's really just that people think

853
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:10,560
that they're not going to have uh to respond to a reply about it so they don't feel the need to

854
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,200
make it clear the first time and i just throwing it out there we all love a little bit of shit posting

869
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:35,520
coming and uh we've also got the podcast here available on itunes and google play at least for

870
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,560
now even though we seem to be getting shit for downloads on those so uh i gotta i gotta everybody

871
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,600
asked for and then i checked the google play downloads yesterday it's like three yeah exactly

872
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,240
i don't i don't know what the fuck you people are talking about making me work to the bone

873
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:55,600
maybe itunes is more i don't know maybe i i was agonized over the itunes things for like a year

874
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,840
it was it was a lot of work and it still isn't it's it's more work than it should be getting them up

875
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,920
and the dumb thing is itunes doesn't track your downloads so i gotta dig in the blue hose to find

876
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:09,360
out downloads for itunes which is her moronic regrettable i found no the reason i found out is

877
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,800
that itunes like apple has one guy in charge of all of podcasts because they don't because they

878
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,880
don't make any money off of it they don't give a fuck so one guy's in charge of the entire thing

879
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,200
yeah i guess that makes sense okay well now we know that's why capitalism works baby if you

880
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,800
made money then people would care about it capitalism makes me work i gotta do extra

881
