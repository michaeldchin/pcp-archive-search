00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of Rick's D Minutes. We're back with the finale

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,960
of season 3, episode 10, the Rick Churri and Morty date. The last episode of Rick's D Minutes

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,840
for the foreseeable future. Yeah, possibly for years. Could be years until the next one.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,360
Unless we decide to like go back and do the other seasons at some point. Which we could

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,560
do. Feeling masochistic. Maybe as like a batch we could do the season or something. But in

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,200
any case. It could be more interesting because those ones already have commentary and stuff

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,400
that we could go through. Right. Which I have not watched any of but would very much like

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,000
to based on what you've told me about them. They're really fun. They're worth watching.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,680
But anyway. Let's get into it. So, Rick Churri and Morty date. Oh, I'm Digibro by the way.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:50,200
Oh, that's right. I can't use Kyver. There you go. Yeah. And yeah, this is the season finale.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,920
Kind of sprung on me out of nowhere because for some reason previously on Wikipedia it had

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,960
suggested that this would be a 13 episode season. So, I really thought they were like

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,640
going all out and making it a longer one. And considering how much

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,000
plot development happened this season, it felt like that would be the case.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,320
Yes. But then suddenly it was just, oh, episode 10. That's the last one. It's just fucking over.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,840
Did you feel, I don't remember where I read this. But somewhere I think I read that

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,840
Justin Royland specifically said like, yeah, we were supposed to do 13. It got shrunk down to 10.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Sorry about that. Next time we'll try to do better. If that's the case. I have the feeling

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,520
that there were a lot of production mishaps on this season. And that that contributes a lot

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,840
to why it took so fucking long to make. Because there was a definite sensation I had from this

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,840
episode. And this is skipping right to the end. But the last scene sort of restores things

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,040
to normal. Like they were in season one sort of gets us back to the status quo.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,800
And Beth says like outright, it's basically going to be like season one except more streamlined

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,320
from now on. Indeed. And I couldn't help but think that what happened here, like what happened with

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,040
this whole season was that by the end of season two, they'd written themselves into this place

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,040
where it's like we are now going to do a continuous narrative with this show. Right.

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,880
And I think maybe in the process of trying to hash out what that continuous narrative is,

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,720
it became apparent that this was not a good idea or that they didn't know how or that there just

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,720
wasn't a way. And so they went, yeah, let's let's just address all the open ended things

30
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,160
this season and then just kind of wrap back into something normal that we can continue with,

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,480
you know, that's how it felt to me. I would be inclined to agree. And especially the whole

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,000
ending scene feels extremely tacked on to the end of this. I mean, what's fascinating to me

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,880
about this episode, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like this is the first episode of

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,280
Rick and Morty where the B plot has been a thousand times better than the A plot. And it was it was

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,840
so unusual for the show to spend so much time on this, this whole like presidential like

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,040
breakup, you know, like bad feelings thing. And then like, and then we get to the thing that

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,720
actually matters. Like last episode, we were like, Oh man, will they ever address will we ever see

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,320
an addressing happened in this episode and we're past it. It's done. The questions are answered in

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,880
the trash. It goes amazing and not in a good way. I kind of feel, yeah, it's a weird feeling.

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,080
I can easily imagine the writers with this story seeing it kind of spiraling out of control and

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,040
getting to because like, if you look back at what Rick and Morty was, what the successful formula

42
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,920
was like season one was not great because it had an ongoing plot. It had little tidbits of like

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,840
emotional stuff that carries over. Like, you know, in one episode, they ditched their universe in

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,560
another episode, it's confirmed that they are still in the ditched universe. There is a continuity.

45
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Bro, that's abnormal in some way. And then by the time we get to Rick has overthrown the government

46
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,360
of the entire cosmos. And like, there's all this background shit going on. And now Beth,

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,040
what if she goes and has her own adventure? And I have the feeling someone had to go like,

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,400
we can't write about Beth and her adventures because this is going to get so unfocused.

49
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Oh, they fucked up so bad. The correct way to handle that we already addressed. At least I

50
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,120
think we did last episode. You just go have her do her adventures. And then like in a season or two

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,080
or whatever, you can have an episode about that Beth. And then it blinds everyone. We're like, oh

52
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,240
my God, we totally forgot about that. But this has been the fake bet the whole time. This recontextualizes

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,120
everything I thought. Like everyone would have loved that. It would have been super cool. But

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,800
they're just like, no, too much work. We can't do all that. We just want to address it. But yeah,

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,640
I mean, but then if they leave that open thread, then it's just one more thing they got to worry.

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,440
I guess there was something cheap about like, and I'm not celebrating that they did this

57
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,280
necessarily. But I couldn't help but feel like the ending of this season was their way of going,

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,520
just put it all back to normal. I don't want to do this anymore. You know, fuck, what have we done?

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,920
And just seeing that, you know, that several episodes have commented on the slowness of the

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,080
season coming out, the fact like the conflicts and getting it made, like it's pretty clear that

61
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,880
Dan and Justin have, I've only been picking up like random things like tertiary knowledge about

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,360
this. But people have been saying like that they've been addressing a lot of issues like apparently

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Dan Harmon hated the episode we hated. The vindicators. That's right. Yeah, the vindicators.

64
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,440
And good man. He's got good taste, obviously. Yeah. And so it makes me think, man, it must have

65
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,640
just been fucking chaos putting the season together. Like I'm thinking that they hit

66
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,640
simultaneously the most ambition they wanted to have with the show and the least they could

67
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,440
actually do with the show at the same time. You know, that's the kind of feeling I'm getting.

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,400
But this is all speculation. And it's interesting because this show has absolutely blown up this

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,280
season. This has been the season post season two. I mean, it was a long time after post season two

70
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,600
into this, but now people are really paying attention to the show just in time for it to

71
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,800
stumble a little bit, stumble along its way. Not completely, obviously. Some of these episodes

72
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,280
were fantastic. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's unavoidable. But I don't know. Is this still

73
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,680
going to happen? You think as the show clearly is taking on an even bigger role than it had

74
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,040
previously. The funny thing about Rick and Morty, and this was already the case in season two,

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,960
is it's too big for itself. Yeah. Like it's too successful because it's on fucking adult swim.

76
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Right. Like it's never going to be a like high budget production. It's always going to be like

77
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,160
this weird off kilter passion project. And the fact that it has this kind of attention is kind of

78
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,480
like strange. It's almost like with my little pony friendship is magic, a show we're both very

79
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:21,080
familiar with where the show suddenly erupts in popularity right around the time that the actual

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,160
lead writer is leaving because like it sucks to work on the show. And then you get this weird,

81
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,480
muddied storyline and production where as the show is getting more popular, it's also getting

82
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,200
worse. And I feel like we're seeing something similar here. I don't even necessarily think

83
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,000
the season is worse, but like there's clearly been issues with the production where like the

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,120
popularity of the show is taking people from the show and leaving them not able to actually

85
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,440
make the show that will satisfy its new, huge audience. That's my question. Do you think we'll

86
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,040
finally see a stoppage of the leak of talent from Rick and Morty because it's so popular now?

87
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,600
Will they finally recognize like, okay, that's it. Does it make more money by being more popular?

88
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,880
That's a good question. Is adult swim like able to pay these people enough to keep them, you know?

89
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,040
How have they made all these like spin off like games and shit and all these like shorts and

90
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,040
these 3D, you know, whatever, like all the spin off stuff that's come from Rick and Morty. How the

91
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,160
fuck was it all financed and like where those just if all those make money, then like, okay,

92
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,640
maybe they can pay for themselves. But how do they get people on these projects to make these?

93
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,480
I don't know. I guess it's all part of the zeitgeist that's carried Rick and Morty to the

94
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,640
popularity set now. And I'll say I'm going to, since we're talking about the meta of the season

95
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,560
anyways, to talk about the content of this episode. For the most part, yeah. And I don't hate this

96
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,200
episode. I thought it was fine, but like it's not the one that has the most deep shit to talk about.

97
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,840
Season three as a whole. Compared to the last season finale, like, Jesus Christ.

98
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,200
I almost felt like this one was deliberately retarded. I got a little bit. Like just because

99
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:15,160
it was so like, so dumb with the president thing, like, like going above and beyond to make the

100
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,760
president this petty idiotic character and to focus so much on this dumb story almost felt like

101
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,840
they were deliberately making sure, you know, like, okay, we're not doing that again. Season two

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,960
finale was a fluke. That's not where this is going. We're restoring normalcy. We're going back to

103
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:39,640
sitcom roots, you know, who's felt like a sitcom episode. Like this episode, in some ways, it felt

104
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,840
almost family guy-esque to me. Yeah. Yeah, totally. But then to be more kind to it, I would compare

105
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,040
it to an episode of the Venture Brothers, like just that kind of sense of irreverence. But while,

106
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,280
you know, applying the unique brand of this show to a sort of classic scenario, like working for

107
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:05,880
the president, you know, which feels like an old school sitcom premise almost. But yeah, it's

108
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,200
and I think it's a goofy fun time. I enjoyed what I got, but it definitely was weird to see this as

109
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,400
the season finale. Well, that's the whole thing. I really feel I have no way of knowing this is

110
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,880
true enough. But I really think this is just like one of the episodes, considering we know so much

111
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,160
about how many problems that we're just getting this made. And the, you know, we, I wish I had

112
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,320
actually looked this up, but I know somewhere, Justin Rowland said, like, yeah, they fucked up

113
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,480
and they couldn't make as many episodes as they wanted to. I really feel like this was just going

114
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,640
to be an episode in the series. But then they got to the crunch time and they're like, oh, fuck,

115
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,920
we need to make this the season finale. And then they, like they either slapped on the Beth plot

116
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,760
into this and the whole ending thing where they wrapped all that shit up. That's what it feels

117
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,400
like to me. But that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the president stuff, because I did. It was

118
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,720
good and fun. I just the whole time I was sitting here knowing this was the season finale and was

119
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,200
like, okay, ready to be impressed. Here I am sitting here looking for that good shit. Oh,

120
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,760
there's Beth things going on. Something interesting is going to happen with that. And it did. The

121
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,160
Beth plot was interesting. But like so much more time was devoted to the president stuff.

122
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,920
And hey, the fight, the fight that Rick has with the president was like dopey shit. And like,

123
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,320
I love that they incorporated all the things that have been brought up so far about the White House,

124
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,920
you know, that they go through all like, because you don't have to question all this crazy shit

125
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,360
that they're that's happening underneath the White House because we've already established

126
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,960
before that all this shit exists. Have those all been mentioned or have they been shown before?

127
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,440
I thought that about some of them. Remember, he at the beginning, he's talking about how like,

128
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,400
oh, don't go into the like the Lincoln slave, whatever. And like this other way, he's like

129
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,800
him. Yeah, the like Coke room, which they fall into the Coke room. Right. Right. He's faced

130
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,280
a bowl of coke. So you know, like, that's true. But some of the stuff that would have been harder

131
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,760
to explain, I guess, I really like seeing it's like the present the battle president aesthetic.

132
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,480
I was I like surprisingly a lot. He had all this tech, like, my favorite was when he pulls out

133
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,800
like his watch and points the laser at Rick and then an orbiting satellite shoots the laser down

134
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,280
from space. The hammer of dawn from Gears of War. That's the one. That's the one. Yeah, it was

135
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,840
fucking great. And like the little the little twins that he just blows the whistle and turn to monsters.

136
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah, it was good shit, man. That whole fight was great. Yeah, that was by far the most entertaining

137
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,800
part up until that point. It felt a little slow. But the fight was the the Rick and Morty genius

138
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,360
of lots of things happening really fast without explanation. But you kind of get it, you know,

139
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,360
like racing just just a little bit ahead of your able ability to parse the information,

140
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,280
you know, you have to be an intellectual to like Rick and Morty. There it is. There it is. Yeah.

141
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,000
So that leads me into what I really want to talk about meta wise, which is that I hate that the

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,120
show has gotten popular and I hate watching it with the world. I couldn't agree more. I know

143
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,400
this is this is this is the most hipster I'm ever going to sound. But I miss when Rick and Morty

144
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,360
was just my show, you know, I know exactly what I feel. And it's not even that I got in on the

145
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,400
ground floor of it. Like I found out about it like throughout season one, I was hearing the

146
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,000
early review saying like this is the best show on TV when no one was talking about it. You know,

147
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,160
film crit Hulk was I think the first person I heard it from. And, you know, I watched I caught up

148
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,480
in between seasons one and two. I got everyone I knew to watch it because I thought it was great.

149
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,320
Watch the commentaries, watch the episodes like four times, you know, and then season two rolled

150
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,000
around. And when they when they were the leaked episodes, I was way excited about them. Like I

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,240
watched each of those leaked episodes, you know, multiple times. Yep. And then it came for where

152
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,480
the show was actually airing. And I was watching it week by week. And first of all, I think watching

153
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,840
anything week by week will always make it worse. And this is I've stuck to I firmly fucking believe

154
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,840
in this. And every time I've tried to challenge it, I've come up failing. Like no matter what,

155
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,320
if you watch a show week by week, it will be worse. Because every time it falters a little,

156
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,280
it's a much bigger deal. You know, I marathon season one the first time. And it was just amazing.

157
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,040
Of course, it was just perfect. And I marathoned it like three more times. And I could eventually

158
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,840
pick out which episodes I thought were weaker from the others. But like it never felt like a big

159
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,680
deal. This season, when we got to the Revengencers episode, it was like, this is real. Like for a

160
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,200
whole week, it was like, ah, you know, I legit was not excited about doing this podcast for a lot

161
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,280
of the podcasts run after that episode. To me, like it was always scary. Like am I going to go in and

162
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,200
watch a shitty episode of Rick and Morty and have nothing to say about it? And and and then deal with

163
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,560
the comments who are never appreciative of what we have to say about the show. Like I very quickly

164
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,520
abandoned reading the comments for 60 minutes because it's a lot. It's they're weird because we

165
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,600
get lots of people who don't really know who we are because they're just like looking for Rick

166
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,600
and Morty podcast. I enjoy that. But yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. And it's it's just been a

167
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,760
it's been a weird experience keeping up with the season. And like I feel like after season two,

168
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,760
which I think everyone agrees was overall great. Like even though for me, I felt less enthusiastic

169
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,000
about it than I was about season one just by way of watching it week by week. I still ultimately

170
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,880
enjoyed it a lot. I think after season two, everyone felt really entitled to great Rick and

171
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,320
Morty. You know, I hear what you're saying. And when season three rolled around and anything wrong

172
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:44,280
with it got picked apart to shreds because the people like me who loved the first two seasons

173
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:51,160
and wouldn't shut up about it like idiots like I feel stupid because all I did was rave and rave

174
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,360
and rave about how this show is so perfect. And now every time anything slightly imperfect happens,

175
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:04,840
everyone like, oh, the female writers. Rick and Morty wasn't the greatest show on television

176
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:12,360
this week. So, you know, so I mean, these female writers are just such intellectuals. We can't

177
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,680
understand what they're going for. And then people people who fucking rag on the Rick and

178
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,880
Morty fan base, which I as as is always the case, I've never seen the annoying fans. I've only

179
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,640
seen the people complaining about the annoying fans. You know, like I've never once, unless one of

180
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,560
the people who's making fun of them like literally reposts their shit. And then I see it and I go,

181
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,840
yeah, well, that guy's clearly a fucking like retarded, like literally retarded, you know,

182
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,120
like posting that like Facebook group of the people who see themselves as ricks. Yeah, right.

183
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,640
And are like favorite people in the world. And it's like, okay, these people are clearly not

184
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,160
indicative of most of the people watching this show. Like you can't say, oh, the Rick and Morty

185
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,360
fandom are so like, no. Well, you know, that's it's selective reasoning. Because, you know,

186
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,760
of course, you're gonna with people who want to defend the like the fandom, they'll look at the

187
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,800
people they like best and be like, Oh, those are the guys, they're not the real ones. Whereas if

188
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,960
you're on, if you're like looking for a reason, if you hear one person be annoying about Rick

189
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,480
and Morty, you're just gonna be like those fucking fans, they're all like this is the worst.

190
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't get that. Like when I see an annoying per idiot, like participating in a fandom, I think,

191
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,240
wow, that's an annoying idiot, you know, has nothing to do with the show they like, because

192
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,520
guess what? Every show has annoying retarded fans. Like I can't name a show that doesn't have any

193
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,680
annoying retarded fans. So this whole position, like it's somehow Rick and Morty's like specifically

194
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,360
has this problem. It's like, no, it's just a show that people are talking about right now. So

195
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,080
those people boil to the surface, you know, it's just the nature of anything that gets too popular.

196
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,360
People will like it. There will always be someone who likes it to an obnoxious degree.

197
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:04,280
And just be big on the train for a burp. Nothing matters, Morty. Belch every God's not real burp.

198
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm gay, Morty. Suck my dick. Yeah, it's inevitable. It's a nature of fandom.

199
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,560
I will say the most gratifying thing about the season was listening to the dick show and hearing

200
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,320
him reference Rick and Morty almost every week. Oh, that's cool. Not even anything specific,

201
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,240
just referencing the fact that he's watching it. And I was always like, yeah, Rick and Morty.

202
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,200
How nice for you, did you? How nice. I'm glad you enjoyed that. That's the best thing about watching

203
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,680
this show for me. You know, now I'm starting to get why people wanted to hear this episode of

204
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,240
60 Minutes come out. Because yeah, I feel a bit of emptiness after watching this episode. Just

205
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,760
and again, I think it is, I wouldn't frame it as entitlement to a good episode, but

206
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,800
heightened expectations certainly are there. And I mean, this was definitely a case where

207
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,320
about four minutes into the episode, I went, oh, okay, you know, maybe not even that far.

208
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,040
Like it was that feeling of I loading up the last episode thinking like, what's is it going to be

209
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,240
a big is it because I haven't heard anything. Nobody's been freaking out. Everybody's been

210
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,200
telling me when are you going to do the last 60 minutes? Nobody's been saying it's a crazy episode.

211
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,320
It's just been when are you going to do it? So I start watching it in a few minutes and I'm like,

212
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,760
oh, it's not going to be anything. Like if this is not going to be a big season closer episode,

213
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,920
you know, it's fine. But it's unfortunate that just like a standalone episode like the like the

214
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,000
toxic episode was like, in my opinion, quite superior to this one. This is like the whole point.

215
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,080
There's this joke of the president is jealous that Rick broke up with them or something. They

216
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,360
have a big president battle. There's some cool stuff that happens. And then Beth immediately has

217
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,760
confronted the issue that was set up last episode about if she's a clone or not. So both the one

218
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,080
was kind of not that interesting. And the other was like kind of kind of a premature ejaculation

219
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,600
on like a thing I was expecting to be a part of the narrative. And just like I was really

220
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,000
looking forward to going into next season as well and thinking about like, ooh, what does this

221
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,320
indicate that this is clone Beth or this is real Beth? What can I learn from this? They didn't have

222
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,480
to go that way. But I was like expecting that. And this really is just like blowing their load

223
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,640
immediately. And it's a little disappointing. So and I do. Yeah, the whole president plot. I mean,

224
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,240
this episode is kind of a sequel to the show me what you got episode season two, which was at

225
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,200
a perfect place in that season. Episode four, we've already been hit with some really heavy

226
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,280
sci fi stuff. Later, we'll get it with some more emotional stuff. But right here, here's a goofy

227
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,040
fun episode about saving America, bringing back which the president himself is not that memorable

228
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,560
a character from the episode. So like bringing him back, I had to kind of take a second and

229
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,640
like I remember thinking, oh, I guess president's still black in the Rick and Morty universe.

230
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,440
And then I remembered that it was a character that they had before. And I was like, oh, right.

231
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,960
Whenever I think about a situation like this, like, so yeah, this is this is basically them

232
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,440
saying like, OK, we've got this character, let's recycle him and do something interesting with

233
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,320
it. And they manage that reasonably OK. The problem that happens every time is that

234
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,040
I always my favorite example to go to is the party God from Adventure Time. The party God in

235
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,560
Adventure Time was the best character ever conceived because he was a giant floating wolf head

236
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,040
with the backwards baseball cap, who supercharges I think Jake at some point, so that he can go

237
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,280
like save. I was going to call him Morty fucking. What the fuck is the kid's name from Adventure

238
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,840
Time, Finn? Yes, thank you. And he just shows up at one point completely out of nowhere. He

239
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,120
does this magical thing. It's hilarious. And then he leaves. And then way later, like seasons

240
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,040
later in Adventure Time, they like made an episode developing the character of the party God. And

241
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,120
it was like, what the fuck are you doing? That that's like that's that's just such a misunderstanding

242
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,280
when he was a character supposed to be that exactly that is a one off joke. Rick Rick and

243
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,480
Morty's definitely had some of these issues. And I would say it's done reincorporation really well.

244
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:23,560
I think Bird Person was reincorporated well, like fucking the first time that the first

245
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,240
time that Gear Guy was brought back and Rick like replaces eyes with his balls. That was great.

246
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,920
The second time Gear Guy is brought back this season was terrible. And it was like, why do you

247
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,920
keep bringing back this character? Like why did it have to be him? You know, why is he there?

248
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,640
They're getting lazy, dude. I mean, I'm not saying that the show is like lazy itself, but but that

249
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:50,120
is a lazy idea to do. Exactly. Like we didn't get we didn't get a wealth of great new characters

250
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,600
this season. No, we did not. No, we did not. In fact, I can't think of one I particularly cared

251
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,200
about. A lot of people like that guy. What was his name? Cougar or Jaguar? That action guy. He was

252
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,240
he was pretty cool. Just whatever. He served as part of the episode and I don't ever really care

253
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,960
about seeing him again, though. So yeah, that's fair. Remember unity? Remember fucking unity from

254
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,840
season two? She is like, that's like the best character ever. I fucking love unity, not to

255
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,520
mention like the incredible relationship. It's like the best episode of the whole fucking show.

256
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,680
It is. It is one of the best. But like the ending is legendary. Yeah, I would say the first three

257
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,240
episodes of season no episodes two and three of season two are like the two best. What was the

258
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,720
other one besides the unity episode there? Episode two is the one with the fucking when they go to

259
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,240
Blitz and Chits. Oh, yeah. And and they meet the fart cloud. Yep. That's that whole one.

260
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,080
Wait, is that the same episode? I think so. No, yeah, you're right. I think it's got the it's

261
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,880
got crumb crumbopulus Michael in it. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Anyway, I can actually remember that name,

262
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:01,000
by the way. I could not have remembered that. That's a sanity. Yeah. I don't know what else to

263
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,520
say about this finale. It was kind of underwhelming. It was a, you know, the season was okay. I would

264
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,920
say this would not be I don't think the season would have disappointed people if it hadn't taken

265
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:20,920
so long to come out. Yes, it's important. And I hope I I wish upon a star that next time I'll

266
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,240
somehow be able to watch it weekly, but I know that or not watch it weekly rather, but I know

267
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,480
that won't be the case. Yeah, I'm going to end up having to and it's going to perpetually ruin

268
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,000
this show for me as this happened to every other show I've ever watched weekly.

269
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,680
You know what? I do want to I want to challenge you. Don't you think that our enjoyment of

270
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Aromanga Sensei was heightened by the fact that we had to stew on every episode in between them

271
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,000
and just just get ready enjoyment of our reactions to it. Exactly. That's what that that's what was

272
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,880
all about. That's what it was all about. Incidentally, Made in Abyss Weekly will probably finish that at

273
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,360
some point. Indeed. Indeed. Very soon, I think. And if anybody cares who listens to this show.

274
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,840
By the way, let me let me let me shout out two jokes that were hilarious and I love

275
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,440
do it quick because I got a poop. Okay, we'll do. So remember when when the President is growing

276
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,920
back in size and they just give him the shirt because apparently he needs to swing his dick

277
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:23,720
around. Hilarious. I laughed. Good. Good. The other one was when it just went when the President

278
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,160
is like ordering this guy to clean his room and he's just like, I don't think you even know what

279
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,720
Secretary of Interior means. Just small side. I laughed. That was a weird one, but I did think

280
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,080
it was. Well, you know, Rick and Morty is a pretty intellectual series. You know, not everybody's

281
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,320
going to get it. You know, you got to you got to think about it. Oh, and also when when Morty is

282
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,040
just like, I don't know, Commander in Queef want to count my pubes, I laughed. I laughed. That's

283
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,440
it. I got nothing else. All right, everybody, see you in the future. Possibly in years like nothing

284
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,200
matters. Yep, we're all dead universes. Choices don't matter. Consequences don't matter. Kill

285
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,200
yourself. Do whatever you want, everybody. That's that's my thing. Bye bye. Oh my God,

286
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,320
I almost forgot to add the last thing. Hey, everybody, best guy ever. World famous Rick

287
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,160
and Morty analyst here. Yo, you know how Minecraft was in this fucking episode? Oh,

288
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,920
I thought it was really dope how like in real life, like the President's portal like had to be

289
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,200
lit with a fucking lighter like in Minecraft. I am a Minecraft specialist. Thank you very much.

290
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,480
I'll see you next time. Bye bye.
