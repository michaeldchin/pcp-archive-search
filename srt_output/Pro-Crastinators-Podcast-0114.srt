00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,640
Hey guys, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today we have a really funny thing to do for

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,320
you guys. So here we go. Here's the high octane action and lovable cast members that you've

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,360
all become accustomed to on this glorious podcast of ours, on this podcast that spans

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:38,080
C to Shining C. We have Hippocrit. Hey, it's me. Tom. Hey, it's me. So this is what we're

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,640
going to do. We're going to talk like this, which is our normal voice, and then every

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,560
once in a while, when we want to make a funny joke, then we'll just scream really loud.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,880
And then that translates into us being happy and slash or energetic. And that will mean

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,520
that the show is better because energetic is better. It's not about having interesting

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,120
things to say. And when you're naturally passionate about a topic, then you will just get loud

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,120
because you have a lot of things to say. The raw volume is what determines the interest,

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,520
not the energy behind that volume. So just crank up your gain, and that's how you make

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,160
a good podcast. Speaking of which, today's topic is podcasts. That's what we're talking

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,880
about. Speaking of podcasts, last week, my intro was Topic Sky Committee, Rhymes with

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,720
Chitty. And that's my new topic here again. Nate's not here. Nate's not here. You may

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
have noticed Nate's not here. And when Nate's not here, everything falls apart. Everyone,

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,520
like their mind control ceases, like their eyes are turned normal from their all black

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,520
and red state. And they start looking around and they start to unbuckle their chance. And

18
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,040
they think, what the fuck am I doing here? So we're doing podcasts. A topic none of us

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,560
have any passion for or even know how to tackle. What can we talk about podcasts? Podcasts

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,880
that we like? Just go to like a list of podcasts that we like. Oh, that's really fucking funny.

21
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,720
Here, I'm going to do that for you. Revolutions. Hello, Internet. There you go. Those are the

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,440
two podcasts I listened to.

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,640
Fucking Cox and Crendoor. You know, podcasts, they're bad. And I don't like them. And this

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,760
is also a bad one. And you know why this is also a bad one? It's because, and I actually

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,920
remember like the very first podcast, like the procrastinators podcast discussion of

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,080
like what it should be. We were discussing this at the very, very, very beginning.

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,720
Oh, that's history. It is a history fucking cool. Because Ben was like pushing for the

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,680
podcast to have a topic like a theme, like a thing that we would do. And every week we

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,280
would do a thing. And Nate was like, no, it's okay, we can just turn our like conversations

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
that we have all the time in the chat into a topic, we just talk about any topic. And

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,000
that eventually won. And so the procrastinators podcast became topics of any type that we

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,360
were talking about. And that has been like the curse. If only if only we'd listen to Ben, if

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,840
only we'd listen to Ben and made the show something that you could, you could, you know, it

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,800
could stay fresh by having like a structure to it. Right, right. And a structure that was

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,800
flexible and not just completely dictated by weird ass segments that we tap on the very end. So

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,280
here's what the structure of the PCP is right now. You got the intro, you got the Urban Dictionary

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
reading every single time. You got that every single time. Then you got the top the actual

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,200
topic for an hour. And then at the end, just shit that I assume everyone turns out like tunes

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,520
out for because I tune out for it because because what is it? It's just being like, Oh, wow, look

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,800
at this fan art. It's really good. Thank you. Look at these things. They're like, I like the fan

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,320
interaction. I like building the community. That's always good. I mean, dude, some of the

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,640
fan art has been fucking sick. Like the main stuff has been dope as fuck. It has been like

43
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,080
as as as as an audio pod. Yeah, as a segment in a podcast, it's sort of like, I don't know, feels

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,760
I mean, it is obligatory. Like I would react nicely to it normally, but like to have to voice

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,520
it in a podcast makes it sort of weird to me anyway.

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,480
To have to come up with something just like like for the sake of coming up for something on for

47
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,520
the segment, then it just means Oh, autumn, like automatically, it means that we're forcing

48
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,560
ourselves to say something like like for a lot of like fan art, I'd like it a whole bunch. I'm

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,720
glad that it exists. But it's not like we need to have an entire hour long segment dedicated. This

50
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,760
is why are we doing this right now? Okay, we podcast. Do we have anything to say about podcasts?

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,400
Well, I mean, I guess the interesting thing about podcasts is like podcasts started way back in

52
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,960
like 2003, like the early 2000s, they started doing podcasts just because it was an efficient way

53
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,360
with like internet speeds and stuff of the time to do long form content. This was like pre

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,880
YouTube pre like being able to do long format video. So like podcasts were just an efficient way

55
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,040
of like going through iTunes and going through RSS and stuff of getting like radio style content on

56
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,520
demand through the internet, you know, it was definitely it was a medium that was defined by

57
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,000
like technical limitations at the time, you know, like iPods back then, because that's what the

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,520
name podcast came from was putting them on your iPod is like a broadcast on your iPod, whatever,

59
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,760
was because they only did audio, you couldn't watch a video on an iPod, you didn't have internet

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,160
connection at the time on your iPod, it was like, it was a different time back in 2002, people. But

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,040
um, obviously, as technology evolved and shit, like podcasts kind of became sort of antiquated,

62
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,120
you know, now we just like we throw a video up on YouTube that you can or cannot watch, you know,

63
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,240
depending on how artistic you are. And it still functions as the same thing, because that's just

64
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,960
what the format is. But like, the the the limitation no longer has to be there, people do our long

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,280
video podcasts, you can stream and watch or whatever. But the interesting thing is like, we're

66
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,640
kind of sweet, like there's a bunch of people I watch, like there's a podcast, Gary Vee's podcast,

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,440
which I watch a lot, and listen to, I suppose. And he's talking about and I think it makes a lot

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,840
of sense that like audio is making a big comeback now, because like, there's so much shit online

69
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,720
right now, and there's and people are just like super busy, that like podcasts now, even though

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,920
they're not, it's not a technical constraint anymore, people value time and the ability to

71
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,080
multitask. And like, we talk about this all the time, like we put on a podcast in the background

72
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,440
while we're doing something else, you know, that's something you can't do with a video. So

73
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,640
what started as like a technical limits limitation is now like a convenience thing, because like

74
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,840
we're so bombarded with media, and like, I want to play this video game while doing this while

75
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,200
doing that. Well, now podcasts allow you to do I felt like that for a while. But I feel like

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,000
that's like a trap mindset, like if you're you're trapped at work, like, and you're doing a nine

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,280
to five, you know, when you have to leave, then it's probably okay. But like, if you're a person

78
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,480
who can like, like, so I feel like this, this is a sort of thing, like if you put on a video of

79
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,200
any length, you feel like you want to watch it to the end. And you're like, okay, I'm, I need a

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,280
break. I need a lunch break. So I'm going to go get some lunch. And I'm going to watch a video. And

81
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,520
it's like 20 minutes long, you finish eating after like six minutes. And and then you're watching a

82
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,560
video for like 14 minutes longer than you wouldn't you wanted to have a break for. And I feel like

83
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,120
podcasts for me, for a long time was just like, Well, I'm watching it. I haven't got to the end of

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,880
it yet. I got to finish it before I can do anything else to do with audio. And that's that

85
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,560
it's terrible. It's the worst thing that I've ever I've cut out most podcasts out of my life,

86
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,640
because of this reason. It's like a time it's like a multitasking thing, but only for people who do

87
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,360
the most menial of tasks. I resonate with that a lot. But I feel like I have more space in my

88
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,600
heart for podcasts for stuff like videos where it's like, I mean, the most common example is did

89
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,120
you or did you would always talk about how monkeys podcast was perfect or podcast? Nuzlocke was

90
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,720
perfect for lunches because he could eat a sandwich in the meantime while he watched it. And I was

91
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,800
like, Yeah, that makes sense. But actually doing it for like any video above like 20 minutes, I've

92
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,640
actually been doing this a lot funnily enough with digi videos, where I've turned on one of the

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,520
Bloodborne Let's Places doing with May, and then I'll either Chipotle, and I'll either do it really

94
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,080
slowly so I can trick myself into thinking that I'm maximizing my time by like finishing the

95
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,040
burrito like a couple minutes before it ends, or just eat like normal. And then and then just be

96
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,920
like, Well, I've already started this video. It has 16 more minutes, but but you know, I've already

97
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,560
started. So I just want to continue. But like podcasts, I think are great, because I don't

98
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,800
really video edit a lot. Certainly have anything to work with with audio a lot of the time. So I

99
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,040
can just draw and put it on a podcast and it is of little effect to me. Yeah, it's good for

100
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,720
some people who don't have to to work with audio. So there's things or something to say about how

101
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,360
my brain has been permanently altered and I am a new type. And my brain does not function the same

102
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,920
way that I think you guys might, where it just due to the fact that I've always grown up on the

103
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
internet and there's always been a thousand things to do at once. I feel like I'm like

104
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,840
constantly if I'm not doing two things at once, my life is being wasted. And I know that that's a

105
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,440
complete like that's not true at all. And in fact, you should just be focused on one thing at all.

106
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
But it's just it's just like a social thing that's been hammered into me and my brain can no longer

107
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
work. And like right now, I'm just rocking back and forth, looking at my audacity. And I'm also

108
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,400
like strolling through Twitter right out at the same time, because I'm fucking broken. And I'm

109
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm a media creation. That is not a new type thing. That is something everybody I think deals

110
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,760
with at some point. If they if they get used to being able to do two things at once kind of

111
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,000
like, like, I know a lot of us who are like in the PCP have just talked about like being unable

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,400
to play a game without listening to a podcast. Like if there's not a new podcast, I'm not playing

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,960
any more Dark Souls, I need something to listen to. I've heard Digi say that I've kind of felt

114
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,560
like that sometimes. But I don't like it because I don't know, it's just it's it feels like it's

115
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,720
fake. It's like cheating. It's like not real podcasts, and let's plays and like video content

116
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,600
where you're listening to other people. If they're not like incredibly interesting, it's usually just

117
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,200
like a surrogate friendship chat, like, like, you know, I'm just hanging out with my friends,

118
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,840
they're speaking, they're making funny noises, and I'm going hey, and I'm playing video games.

119
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm just like in the room with them playing video games. And I'm like, it's it's like a

120
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,080
it's not a fix for actual human interaction and like relationship building. It's sort of like a

121
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,880
what do you call it, like a quick get rich quick on friendship high. Yeah, like a high. And it's

122
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:13,840
I feel like the ideal is to never listen to anything like that. If you can avoid it, but

123
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,840
people sort of sink into that sort of lifestyle and they can't help like listen to and watch millions

124
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,800
of hours of people talking about stuff. And I don't think it's healthy. I don't think it's a good

125
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,120
thing you can you should do because if you do it too much, you think that's all you need because

126
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,040
it's the highest the fix if it sort of prevents you from realizing that you have a lack of like,

127
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,320
you know, if you do actually have a lack of like human interaction in your life,

128
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,680
you sort of dull that sense by by listening to all this stuff. And then occasionally you'll

129
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:55,360
remember oh yeah, I'm really lonely and you'll explode. There's just so many problems inherent

130
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,520
to the idea of a personality driven show. From the point of the producer to the voice actor

131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,440
to the consumer, there is just it's just a riddle of like a medium riddled with problems

132
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,440
where okay, I listen to a lot of podcasts admittedly, but they're only podcasts that I feel like

133
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,920
have a point and enrich my life in a number of ways. I named drop to the beginning,

134
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,160
Revolutions, which is a history podcast, which has no personality really, the guy will occasionally

135
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,200
crack a joke, but it's mainly just hit him, you know, reciting history lessons, which I enjoy

136
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,360
greatly. And then there's Hello Internet, which is a show admittedly built upon personalities.

137
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,840
But the reason I care about the personalities is because they constantly have interesting

138
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,280
conversation that is that are integral to my enjoyment of them as people. I would not really

139
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,520
care about CGP Grey or Brady if they were just two, you know, comedy hosts, so they're just there

140
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,560
for chuckles and laughs. But the fact that they have genuine enriching conversations about technology

141
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,920
and science and stuff is the reason why I tune into that. And just like having personalities

142
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,560
parade around in podcasts or let's plays or whatever will like, okay, on the part of the

143
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,440
creator, it will get old fast for them to do, they will not have a direction, so they'll mostly

144
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,280
have to flounder. And it's not sustainable anyway, because you only have so many like stories and

145
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,760
relatable points to mine from the cold pit that is your soul to parade around to the point where

146
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,040
after you've done like a year or two of that content, you'll be all tapped out on, well,

147
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,960
I've already told this story, I've already showed this part of my personality, I've already done

148
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,720
this gimmick for them. So you just have to flip out, you know, retarded shit that you don't actually

149
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
care about, but you just want to phone in, you know, sort of like a podcast topic, something like

150
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,720
that, you know, some sort of like meta commentary such as that. And then on the point of the consumer,

151
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,840
again, like what you said, a hippo, it's just, you know, arbitrarily filling in the space of a real

152
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,680
friend. I don't know how many times I've, you know, like, like, my let's plays to hanging out with

153
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,560
real friends ratio is horribly skewed. And I never, I've never gotten the same amount of amusement

154
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,120
or joy I've gotten out of listening to let's play, as opposed to just inviting my friends over and

155
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,120
playing smash. Those memories that I have with my actual real friends are greater than any enjoyment

156
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,320
I've ever gotten out of let's play in my entire fucking life. So why do I do it? Because it's easy,

157
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,160
because I because, you know, because sometimes I don't want to deal with having people or sometimes

158
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
I don't want to clean up my room. I just want to sit around in the darkness. I want to watch a let's

159
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,000
play. It's disgusting. It's horrible. It gives me nothing. The personalities on display in most

160
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,080
let's plays are not inherently interesting. Game for us was good because they occasionally had

161
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,560
really in depth conversation and it might not be, you know, like the most high of mind conversation,

162
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,320
but with conversation that you cared about the Nickelodeon gut stuff is not just funny because

163
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
it's John and Aaron making goofy noises. It's funny because it's relatable and you've had those

164
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
experiences before in your life. And it's interesting to hear, you know, people get mad at one another.

165
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,840
It's interesting because of the thing that the personalities are talking about not just because

166
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,320
the personalities are speaking inherently, which is what we're doing right now. Where's where's

167
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,760
washed up personalities who were funny and who were cool and people liked listening to because

168
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,200
they watch old PCP topics and they're like, oh man, I love this funny fucking one. They keep

169
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,800
referencing the Wake Me Up song by whatever that band is or like this one where they talk about all

170
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,600
the memes that need design and almost all of them are not memes. That's what the really fucked up

171
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,080
weird editing style. I like all of those things because they were interesting topics. Those were

172
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,520
interesting things that people wanted to hear about. Those were things that people were like,

173
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,880
oh yeah, I like these personalities because they're talking about this topic and this topic is integral

174
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,720
to their work, their social life and something they've talked about before. So they have a lot

175
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,960
of interesting things to say. But nowadays, it's just like, oh, what do we do? What do we do? We're

176
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,960
gonna pull up document. Oh, wow. Look at all these topics. They're all one noun and this one noun

177
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,840
we have to talk about for an entire hour and one hour specifically. Even if you're, you know,

178
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,720
you've somehow gotten lucky one and you want to go over one hour or if you it's something that

179
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,760
you've actually want to talk about, but no one else has approached the topic from the same angle

180
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,920
as you. So you've just been waiting itching to say your actual point between the entire thing.

181
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,160
Oh, oh, no, one hour. Alright, everyone stop. You know, it's one hour. You know, we gotta turn

182
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,840
the thing in. It's baked. It's good. It's done. Just push it out. It's over. It's a podcast topic.

183
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,040
Yeah, it's really fucking funny. What do they say about podcasts? I've said all that. Yep. What else?

184
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,200
What else? You've said all the things. Do you remember the fucking horse cuss? Do you remember

185
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,240
the good old days when the pony boys would jump into a call and talk about nothing?

186
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,680
That was fun. It's so the horse cuss. I've actually re-listened to all of the

187
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:52,560
horse cuss recently for my own nefarious purposes. Type in YouTube ham n o i z. Type in

188
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,480
that to YouTube and you'll find a secret item hidden behind the wall. But anyway,

189
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,040
I've re-listened to all of the podcast, the horse cuss recently, and it's kind of jarring

190
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,040
not only to see how everyone's personality has changed, but also to hear them make like

191
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:17,120
allusions to like friendship and like, you know, playing video games or like watching anime or like,

192
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,280
you know, speaking. Yeah, it's it's so much more clinical now back then. It was like,

193
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,480
we'd I we don't we didn't have conversations in person. Those were like the first times we

194
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,800
were talking audibly to each other. And that it was just you could it's so weird. It's so weird.

195
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't like how where we are right now. It's just it's a product of our own design. It's

196
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,440
it's of our own design that this is the case. Because there's no reason why we have to have

197
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,040
one noun topics. It's not even like we had one noun topics throughout the entirety of this show.

198
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,880
There were there were some things that were just like, like, like broad topics that we just,

199
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,480
you know, switch in and out of back in the early days. People liked that we went off topic and we

200
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,080
branched out from one topic to another. Because you know, that's how conversations work. That's

201
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,200
how real life interaction works is you talk about one thing. And then you talk about for as long or

202
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,720
as little as you want, because there's no reason to pad out time or to reduce the amount of time to

203
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,160
make a concise YouTube video. You just talk about for as long as you want to. And you know what?

204
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,720
Tugging for things as long as you want to usually interesting, because usually you know when things

205
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
aren't interesting. And you don't want to talk about bullshit for longer than you need to because

206
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
you're not you don't have you don't have time for that. Because you're not because you're pretty busy

207
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,880
and just want to say what you want to. And what you want to say is usually cool, because you're

208
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,640
saying it and you're a cool person. There's no reason to talk about things for an hour specifically.

209
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,600
That just that just was the case for all topics as we're talking from, you know, like around an hour

210
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
and hour and a half. We'll just make that the normal. We'll just make that we'll just make that

211
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,600
every single episode because that makes sense. Because because guarantee you guarantee you we

212
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,760
can talk about podcasts for an hour. Something we jumped into this medium. I've never even

213
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,560
the progress podcast was like the first podcast I ever really listened to.

214
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,640
I guess the horse cast technically. But you guys were the only podcast I had listened to.

215
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,160
And up until like a year ago, maybe even like nine months ago, I brightened out the other stuff,

216
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,120
revolution to low internet, other shit like that. You guys were the first. So like, like,

217
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,440
I don't it's not even to have a history podcast. And like, oh, well, my childhood, I used to watch

218
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,880
over the bum fuck podcast all the time. No, you guys, you guys were the podcast.

219
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,960
If we're doing an episode about podcasts, let's talk about you guys, because you guys are the

220
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,880
only podcasts that I listened to. And what has happened? Why? Why is it like this? I was a fan.

221
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,320
I was a fan of the PCP. And I loved it with all my heart. I was in the fan chat. I prowled out

222
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,160
every single day. And now I'm here. And why have you bespurched me in this way? I wanted to be

223
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,720
like the horse. That's why I'm fucking here. He was like, Oh, I love these guys. Oh, I love

224
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
the gym. They're so interesting. I've never seen I've never heard these opinions before in my life.

225
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:25,920
Here's why it's because due to various, you know, happenings of life, we talked about so much stuff

226
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,960
in the discord or the Skype rather. We talked for so long about so many things. And we started

227
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,400
to have podcast things where we would elaborate on what we were saying in the chat. And we did

228
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,440
that so much that we stopped having things to say to each other that weren't like fresh news,

229
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,440
like new things that were going on. We knew each other so well through what we had said,

230
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,720
that there was nothing new to talk about. And now every week, we have to shuffle on into this

231
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:02,800
little this this this gross little gray room. And the topic list and be like, do you have

232
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,240
anything to say about that? I've never heard any of you talk about this topic, but maybe everyone

233
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,600
will have something to say. Yeah. No, no. I think it's because like now that it's it's like expected

234
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,960
to come out every week that there's like money involved. And it's like, Oh, we got to make a

235
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,880
podcast. We got to have a product to make as opposed to like, I mean, I was never on the

236
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,680
horsecast, but like the horsecast was more spontaneous. There was no schedule for the

237
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,120
horsecast. It just kind of happened. You know, all right, let me let me blow your fucking brains,

238
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:42,000
friends. PCP obviously comes out once week, because you know, not to make it sound too cynical,

239
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,880
like we're like, we're trying to pull a fast one on you or like we don't give a shit about

240
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,200
anything. But that's what's good for business. So that's what makes sense and is concise and

241
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,000
good for algorithm comes out once a week. And people just like regular people just like having

242
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,360
things come out on a regular time because it brings you know, familiarity to their life.

243
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,120
And just as an overall, you know, good thing to do if you want the podcast to grow, which

244
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,800
you wouldn't want the podcast to go. You want to build your business. And also you want to meet

245
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,800
more people with the content that you create. But here's the thing. It doesn't have to be that way.

246
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,240
That's not the way that things have to be. And you may think, Oh, but but of course,

247
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,000
having a regular schedule will of course make the podcast successful. Well, here's the thing.

248
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,120
The Hello Internet podcast is notorious for never coming out on time. And it has like

249
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,760
unbelievably diverse like windows of release. Sometimes it'll come out two in a single week.

250
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,880
Sometimes we'll be like an entire month before one release. And you may think,

251
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,040
ah, well, just because the fact that they have interesting conversation and they wait

252
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,360
to have recordings podcast and they have something to say and they make everything,

253
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,600
you know, actually interesting and they wait until they have points to discuss.

254
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
Just because they do that doesn't mean it'll be successful because, you know,

255
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,800
they aren't doing it right. They aren't releasing every week. They're making $4,000 per episode.

256
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:11,200
$4,000 $4,000 and $62. Sorry. Hello Internet is is a masterful show because it is clearly

257
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,320
it does the same thing that we used to do, which is we were talking about something in the chat

258
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,600
and be like, let's do a podcast about this. Let's hash it out in more in depth and record it.

259
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,200
And that was the initial idea. And they do that. But they do it, you know, whenever they actually

260
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,560
have anything to say. And it's it works so well, because those those guys have such chemistry

261
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,480
through like their interactions. It's just two guys. It's the fucking it's the best.

262
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,800
It's so great. And the thing to actually like talk about the podcast topic a little bit here,

263
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,080
just just a tiny little bit to satiate. Yeah. The reason I like Hello Internet,

264
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,640
which is interesting to me is that there's no cursing on Hello Internet.

265
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:07,120
There's no apparent jokes. There's no real wet comedy. It's just like two people

266
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:15,760
who are nice, upstanding, like normal citizens, just speaking to one another about their experiences

267
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,320
who they are content creators. They speak about some of the same stuff that we talked about a

268
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,880
long time ago, but they just do it without cursing or making themselves weird targets of drama

269
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,080
or like weird social pariahs. They don't curse. They don't do weird shit. They just talk like

270
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,080
normal. And they have interesting points about like technology and the state of humanity,

271
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:47,440
space travel. These are just upstanding citizens. And they're living the high life. They go on

272
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
trips all the time. And they turn their and you know, they have interesting things to say about

273
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,400
the trips. It's all perfect. CGP Cray is literally my ideal life, but I literally, I literally cannot

274
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,760
live the CGP gray life anymore. I cannot. I didn't think of this a lot recently. I cannot run for

275
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,160
president. I don't want to run for president, but I could not. I cannot have any political office

276
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,520
because I've done this show and I've said the n-word a lot. I cannot do that anymore. My life

277
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,840
is so limited by my own design. This is what I wanted. This is what I wanted my life to be. And

278
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,200
now that it's, now that it's here, I realize, oh, I don't have to scream. Oh, I don't have to make

279
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,640
jokes. Oh, I don't have to curse. I don't have to be edgy. I don't have to do any of those things.

280
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,400
But this is what I wanted. And this is the life that I have now. It's like growing up, dude,

281
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,600
like you fucking realize that like, oh, I don't have to like put on airs and shit. I can just be

282
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,640
who I want to be. My life would be better for it. The thing that like I've noticed about, I guess,

283
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,160
our dynamic and shit is like, the topics are very forced because like we have this list, we have to

284
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,680
do one topic. I always felt that the PCP is in this interesting like middle ground of like the two

285
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,040
extremes that I think are six or make for a more successful podcast. Like the podcast that I like

286
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,800
the most are either podcasts that are a single topic. And it's exploring that topic in depth in

287
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,400
each episode. So like, I listened to like a podcast called pro blogger. And like most of the podcasts

288
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,200
I listened to are just like to get information. But like pro blogger is about blogging. Every

289
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,080
episode is about blogging. And it just explores a different aspect of that. So like, there's always

290
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,680
a singular kind of like cohesive concept behind the entire show. So you go in knowing exactly

291
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,120
what you're going to get. And the people who do the show have a direction every episode, they always

292
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,320
know like, Okay, there's one big meta topic that that drives this entire production. So there's

293
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
all there's never any like doubt or confusion as to what are we going to talk about this week,

294
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,800
it's like, blogging, obviously, but how, right? And then the other end of the spectrum is like

295
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,200
when it's personality driven, it's just like whatever the people are passionate about and like

296
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:10,480
not trying to like, have it be focused on one, like topic for that episode, we're in the middle

297
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,160
where we have one topic, but it's there's no cohesion behind it. Like we don't just dissect

298
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,480
like a big meta topic. It's just like, it's like the worst of both sides kind of like, and that's

299
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,280
what we're doing on once on the other side is like something like the Dick show where it initially

300
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,640
was like, he had like a gimmick where he was trying to find a cohost. But then it turns,

301
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:42,640
it's like morphed into just occasionally talking about Maddox drama and then Dick being mad about

302
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,840
stuff that happened throughout the week. And there's always something to be mad about. So he has

303
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,600
like an endless well that he can pull from to make big rants. And then he has people on it's just

304
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,960
like, it's a show about him and it's a show about how mad he gets at the world. And that's all it

305
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,520
needs to be. There's never a topic on anything. And then yeah, on the other side, there's

306
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,080
the stuff like the fucking, the fucking podcast, chibi barkers, the Ghibli cast, the pony cast,

307
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,280
arm retrieval, all those are way better than the procrastinators podcast because they have points.

308
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,920
They have a reason to exist. Because they're talking about things. Exactly.

309
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,440
Because every episode you're like, Oh, what are they good? What's the weird topic? They are real

310
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,360
at this time. Oh, they're just going to continue with the talking about because they have more

311
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,960
stuff to say on it. They're just going through a show. They're going through a webcomic. They

312
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:42,720
want to talk. Oh, oh, it has a point. Oh, it has a reason to exist. The PCP is ostensibly a show

313
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:50,960
about us, right? It's about the hosts. Like no one comes here. No, not a single soul has clicked

314
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,800
on this episode thinking, Oh, wow, I really like podcasts. I can't wait to see these people talking

315
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,720
about podcasts. Oh, I'm really excited for this kind of guys. No, they all come here because they're

316
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:15,200
like, I remember Ben saying, I remember Jesus. You nearly said Jesse. I nearly said Jesse. Oh,

317
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,000
no. And then I was like, Oh, I swear, I can't say that. And then I did. But anyway, the point is,

318
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,560
is that we, like, we like, to make the show make sense, it would be Hello Internet. It would be

319
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,360
the life and times of an internet creator and the stuff we go through working day and

320
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,680
out, you know, the steps we've taken in our careers and in our personal lives. Okay, what's

321
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,720
like to be an internet person? Here's the problem taking this weird awful topic system and make

322
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
no sense. Here's the thing. And this is the second thing I was going to bring up like,

323
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,720
because we're talking about like, Oh, like the old PCP in the horse cast would be continuations

324
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,600
of what we talk about in the chat. Like, I don't read the chat anymore, because every time I look

325
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,000
at the chat, it's always cynical, negative bullshit. And I don't feel like reading it. Like,

326
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,440
every time someone posts something, it's complaining about a YouTuber or complaining

327
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,080
about something or shitting on something. And I don't want to hear about that. I don't care.

328
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,760
I completely agree with you, Tom. Every time that I tune in here, it's just like a wall of tech.

329
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,040
It's just like message upon message of like, Oh, the YouTube industry fucking sucks. Oh,

330
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,840
everyone's just here to make a buckle. It makes no sense. Oh, it's all just a bunch of shit.

331
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,280
And I don't want to hear about that, because I love the internet. Right. I like making internet

332
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,160
content. I like being here. Sure. There's reasons to get grumpy. In the horse cast, everyone

333
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,240
talked about like, Oh, all the way doing the chases make fun of YouTubers. But that was kind of fun,

334
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,080
because they were all making content themselves. And they all referenced the contents they made

335
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,600
themselves. And it was just a fun, a fun time. And that's part of life in times of the content

336
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,160
creators talking about the other creators in your space or made sense. But now it's just

337
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:07,280
nonstop cynicalness. It's just nonstop. Oh, everyone sucks but us, even though what are we doing?

338
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,520
What is this right now? Oh, is this really a paragon of what YouTube should be? Is this

339
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,400
what's happening right now? I'm going to kick off the podcast. I'm literally going to get picked

340
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,600
to kick off the podcast. This episode is going to air and I'm literally going to be kicked off.

341
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,440
Do you, do you not, do you not like me, Munchie? No, no. What are you saying?

342
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm saying this, but I don't know if you know, I don't know if you've realized

343
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,880
you've been caught in a catch, a catch. This is not the podcast, this episode.

344
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,640
This is the disillusionment with the PCP episode. Oh my God, yes. Thank God. I'm so glad I didn't

345
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:57,040
miss it. Yeah. Right now we're talking about how the topic system makes no sense and how

346
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,400
we're ostensibly a personality driven show, but we pick topics that do not accentuate our

347
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,600
personalities whatsoever. And there's no sense for us to cynically pick topics that none of us

348
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,840
have an interest in like podcasts. Well, what do, what do personality driven shows talk about?

349
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,440
Stuff like, stuff like Hello Internet, where they're talking about the stuff that's happened,

350
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,560
you know, in their lives, anecdotes, stuff that's been on their mind, stuff that might not cleanly

351
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,960
fit into a one hour window, stuff that just might, you know, be casual conversations that the others

352
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,640
can build upon. You know what? I mean, do we even have that much happening in our real lives?

353
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,560
Yeah. And yeah, yeah, Ben, and you know where we, you know where me, you talk about that,

354
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,840
is Ryfurg's cop killers? The YouTube videos are constant non, like, like wall to wall

355
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
shit that has happened in our lives. And it's all fucking interesting because we pick our

356
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,560
topics carefully and they all don't have to fit into a sensible time period. It is, it is peak

357
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:03,280
content. You know what? I mean, sometimes, sometimes the topic system yields good results.

358
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,080
Sometimes, but not right now.

359
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:18,480
Okay, I fucked up and slept through the PCP today. So I mean, you guys have been, you know,

360
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,560
I'm here to save the show because you guys have been floundering with only three guys,

361
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,800
but I'm here, I'm here, I'm a breath of fresh air. I'm here, I'm here with my rude to and my,

362
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:36,480
and my, you know, and my, my, my radical leftism. Just, just to spice things up a little bit. Did

363
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,200
you guys hear about that? That there, there's, there's 10, 10 genders now and they're all male.

364
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Yeah, yeah, that's a meme. Hey, whoa, ha ha, patreon.com.

365
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,160
I'm sorry, I'll see myself out. It's been a pleasure, everyone.

366
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Let's just do a horse cast. Let's just stop doing this. Let's just do a horse cast where we just

367
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,760
talk about things that we care about. And that's happened before in our lives in the past week.

368
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:12,400
Yeah, because there's a lot of things that happened to me that I don't talk about on

369
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:19,600
podcasts, but I talk about on my patreon people thing. I mean, there's, there's, there's adventures

370
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,720
that have, that are being had. Ben, you've moved, you've moved, you're in a completely different

371
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:33,680
city now. Oh God, I bet, look, that's all bound up in some shit that I don't want to talk about ever.

372
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,640
Well, fine. I, well, I mean, about the moving, I mean, I mean,

373
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,760
my house, I mean, I'm in a sick house. It's pretty great. Where are you? I'm real happy to be back

374
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,960
in Boston. Are you back, are you back in the monkey house? Yeah, oh yeah, I am in monkey

375
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,400
house, although we don't, okay. Actually, this is interesting and frustrating to me. I come back

376
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,480
to monkey house only for them to tell me that they don't call it monkey house anymore. And I'm

377
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,840
like, yeah. And I'm like, okay, so just last night, I finally, I finally popped the question. I finally

378
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,560
was like, all right guys, when did it, when did it stop being monkey? Apparently now for a while,

379
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,640
it was Beijing house. And now it's, now it's wheelhouse, which dude, I don't know. I'll never,

380
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,520
I'll never, why was it called monkey house in the first place? Well, it was because

381
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,880
when we, when my friend found a shit, I shouldn't use people's real names, when he found the house

382
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,680
and like, got a bunch of people that wanted to move into it. We made a Facebook chat group to

383
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,280
like, you know, discuss the move. And someone sent someone set the the automatic like button,

384
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,040
someone changed the like button so that it was a monkey face. And so we became monkey.

385
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,160
And then like, and then dad, who is a print maker, he brought over this, he brought over this like

386
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,360
this little print of six different monkeys. And he like, and he took out like a fucking power drill

387
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:18,080
and use these giant bolts and like bolted this tiny thing into the wall. And they and there were

388
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:24,560
six of us. So we were six monkeys, hands monkey hat. But anyway, a lot of shit went down while I

389
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,640
was gone. Like there were a lot of like, kind of weird and or somewhat scary people lived here.

390
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,000
Because while I was gone, there was an empty, scary. I mean, at least one of them was a drug dealer.

391
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,800
I can't remember if someone, okay, the place got trash, one of our former roommates,

392
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,800
and possibly his girlfriend, who, weirdly enough, I matched with that girl on Tinder

393
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,560
the other day. And it was a very awkward exchange because because she recognized me. Well, she

394
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,720
she asked me, do we know each other? And I was like, do we. And then I realized because she

395
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,840
has a butterfly tattoo on her leg. And I remembered it. And I was like, you, you trashed our house.

396
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,760
Yeah. So that was weird. And she said, I mean, should I talk about what she said? Because it was

397
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:24,480
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Did she deny this statement? She not at first. Like, she was like,

398
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,200
okay, you like who I was like, Oh, yeah, you trashed her house. And she was like,

399
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,000
what? And I was like, monkey house. And she was like, Oh, great. And I was like, yeah.

400
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,920
She didn't disconnect. She was like, Oh, great. Like here it comes. Yeah. Yeah. She didn't. She

401
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,880
did not disconnect at that point. I don't know what happened next. You know, I could probably

402
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,600
just get it up on my phone. But shit, my battery is dead. The point is, so we were talking about

403
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,800
this guy, this ex got roommate that used to live with us. He had come back and trashed her house.

404
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Apparently he had put dish soap in the dog bowl. Yeah, like, yeah. So like poison ostensibly to

405
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,280
poison a dog. And so I mentioned that to Oh my God, we should fucking should we cut her name out?

406
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,560
You mentioned three names so far. Well, this is whatever first names don't matter.

407
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:24,080
So, so, so I mentioned that to and she's like, Oh, a vegan putting dish soap in the dog. Well,

408
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,920
yeah, right. I'm like, okay, whatever. So she doesn't she doesn't come out and say it. Eventually,

409
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,960
I asked her like, are you saying that you didn't do it and that or that he made you do it or something?

410
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,320
And she is like, No, I didn't do it. And then she starts like, she's like, I hope,

411
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,960
I hope you never I hope you never date someone who who like tries to choke you while you're

412
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,880
driving them to work. And I'm like, Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. And then she's like, Listen,

413
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,800
he was he was the love of my life. And I'll never get over this. And I was like, God,

414
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,800
leave me alone. Listen, I was just I was just here.

415
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Looking to make some friends and you and you sir have soured the mood. Yeah,

416
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:14,400
I was just looking to invite people to my fucking bounce house moon party on Saturday. And you're

417
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,560
and you're really bringing me down. Eventually, she was like, you, you people are all still haunting

418
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,320
me from this situation. I'll never get over this. Leave me alone. And I was like, I was like, fine.

419
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,960
I was like, Okay, you're like a ghost of Christmas past. But I was like, haunting her.

420
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,360
Guli over her head. I mean, I felt bad because she was clearly upset about all this. But also,

421
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't care. Even a little bit. And that's my story. Well, she destroyed your house.

422
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,200
Maybe. I mean, she might she said she didn't. But it's like, she didn't seem to like push that

423
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,800
angle, which seems like the angle to push. If you got it. I don't know. Anyway, about monkey house.

424
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,640
It turns out that like, you know, all this shit had happened, the house getting trashed, people

425
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,680
coming in and out and like, you know, people, people changing the cast of characters here

426
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,360
changing. And finally, I guess it was around like last September, when weirdly enough, it was when

427
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,200
one of the original guys who had been there for monkey house moved back in. And yet for some

428
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,840
reason, this like around this time, everyone decided, you know what, this is the end of monkey

429
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,080
house, monkey house is over. So they had a party that was the end of monkey house,

430
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,080
like the end of Ava and forever after it was the end of monkey house, even though like four out of

431
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:45,760
the six original cast is still here. Weird. So I don't know. So what was the whole saga happened

432
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,200
while you were gone? Like nothing, like, like nothing, nothing was the end. Like at some point

433
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,080
after a bunch of stuff happened and or change, they were like, I think it's time, I think we

434
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,920
should stop calling it monkey house. And then they just did. And then I come back, it's like,

435
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,400
hey, I'm going to be back in monkey house. I'm four out of four out of six original cast.

436
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,720
Don't you know, don't you know about the wars? Yeah, we're not, we're not,

437
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,960
we're not real anymore. Now we're now we're wheelhouse, because it's a pun, get it? Because like,

438
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,120
oh, that's totally in my wheelhouse. And I'm like, what a fucking disappointment.

439
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,800
It doesn't good to be, does it feel good to be back in the area at least? Yes. Yes, it's

440
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,680
fucking great. And I missed it. I know, dude. I know, bro. I missed it so much. Dude, going to

441
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,280
Boston has been an absolute delight every single time I've gone. It's been so, so great. It is

442
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,400
a delight. And yet, let me, let me tell you, on the drive back to Boston, we passed through New York.

443
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,640
And it was a little bit, it was a little bit like, what's a good analogy? Like you finally,

444
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,920
like you want something and you finally get it. But at the same time, you see something else,

445
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,080
you know, like we drove through Manhattan and we stopped in Manhattan and we hung out there for

446
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:13,680
a while at this, at this manga store. And I can only assume the econ was with you. Yes. Okay,

447
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,120
okay. All right. All right. He insisted on, on this manga store and he spent like hundreds of

448
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:25,280
dollars on manga, which was funny. But he, so we, so we stopped at this manga store. And anyway,

449
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,280
the point is that New York was fucking great. And I have thought like, man, Boston's the best. But

450
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,960
then right before we get there, I'm like, wait a minute, New York's pretty good, though. Shit.

451
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,160
Um, New York's really expensive, though. I mean, Boston's really expensive too. But I don't live

452
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,720
downtown. I live, I live a great thing about Boston is you can live on the outskirts. You

453
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,920
could live on the outskirts and still be connected. Like I live in Medford, which is like pretty far

454
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,600
north. And yet I'm like a quick bus ride from like the inner Boston area. And then it's like a very

455
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:08,640
quick subway trip to the actual like center central downtown. Everything is like, like,

456
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,640
you can get every fucking which way in Boston, even the brief time that I've been there,

457
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,800
I've been at like easily like almost every sub that's like not on the blue line or like the

458
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,520
orange thing. I mean, every stop. Yeah. If you're, I mean, if you're on the, if you're on the tee,

459
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,800
like if you're near the tee, you can go anywhere. Yeah. Like, like, like nothing will stop you.

460
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,400
Especially since like in almost like every stop, you can just like change trains. It doesn't cost

461
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,200
you more money to get back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You get on and then you make as many fucking changes

462
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,080
as well. Usually only need to change trains once. But yeah, you can go entirely from like,

463
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:50,320
you can ride like two entire subway or lines, but they're full, full distance for like $2.50.

464
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,400
You guys sound adorable talking about the trains being like that. When when in London,

465
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:04,000
it's like, it's like that times 10 in every aspect. Oh, Pshh. Oh, Pshh. You would love,

466
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,920
you would fucking love to see King's Cross St. Pancras. It is fucking, it's like an airport,

467
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,120
how big it is. There's like 70 different fucking train stations in one train station.

468
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,040
There should definitely be a hippo, munchy power hour, pow wow someday. I definitely,

469
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,840
I very much intend to go to England one day, whether you're alive or not,

470
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,840
which, which, you know, fingers crossed in London. It's called the tube, right?

471
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:40,880
Yeah, the underground, the tube. Okay. Okay. All right. I see. No, I see it. I see it. It's

472
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,600
okay. I'm looking at a map of it right now. I wouldn't say that it puts the tea to shame

473
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,080
per se, but, you know,

474
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,920
the tea has made me aware of the greatest luxury in life, which is good public transportation.

475
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:05,440
It changes everything about your life irreplically going to Boston and I mean, like, oh, I can just

476
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,640
like go downtown and then hang out and just like get back home and it won't cost me like $20 to go

477
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,200
there. Good public transportation is fucking amazing. The bus in San Diego fucking sucks.

478
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,400
The way like, like it only has like scenic routes, which means you're going to like,

479
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,480
spend like $5 to get downtown in like 40 minutes to an hour if you're lucky and there's no traffic.

480
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:39,680
It's fucking horrendous. Okay. So in, so in Atlanta, there is, there's like, all right,

481
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,120
I never really spent much time in Atlanta proper, but apparently there is like a road

482
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,840
that circles Atlanta and inside this perimeter, you are ITP and outside this perimeter, you are

483
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,800
outside the perimeter, you are OTP and like, there's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's a,

484
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,280
so there's like a, there's like a difference in kind in terms of like how easy it is to get around

485
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,440
to like whether anyone wants to hang out with you. Okay. Yeah, whether you're ITP or OTP. You're

486
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,720
on the outskirts of reality. And I was, I was OTP, which was, was not great. There was a bus,

487
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,560
there was a bus that would go into Atlanta, but it would only go in the mornings. You could only

488
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,920
catch it a couple times in the mornings. And it was really, it was long and bad.

489
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:39,120
Yeah. You sure were in the OTP, but you sure weren't in AOTP. Am I right? High five me. High

490
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:45,280
five, high five. I, that's, I'm extremely uncomfortable right now. We'll delete that,

491
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,040
we'll delete that. No, it's, no, you're right. High five, high five. All right, okay, all right,

492
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,800
okay, let's simmer down. So, um, so, I was going to ask Tom, because like, I just got to, I just

493
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,720
got to talk about the Atlanta subway because it's just a cross that runs up and down and left and

494
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,880
right. And it's not, it's not great. I mean, it's okay. It helps. And like Atlanta is not,

495
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,280
it's, it's less sprawling than Boston, I think. So like, I think for Atlanta, it works pretty

496
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,080
okay. You can get anywhere. There's just not as many places to get. Um, but the bus system is,

497
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,880
is kind of, kind of bad and, and confusing. And Boston has like Boston has very good buses. They

498
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,080
go all over the fucking place and they run all the fucking time. It's really good.

499
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,120
Yeah. All right. That's it. That's all I have to say about that.

500
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,920
Yeah. So, so speaking of like moving around, uh, Tom. Yeah. Yes. What, what's, what's the deal

501
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,560
with you? Are you still in, going to be living in a car? Is that still a thing that's gonna heal?

502
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,160
Uh, yes, yes, that is happening. Great. Probably within the next week or so. I think I'm gonna

503
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:52,720
like stay here for the fourth and then I've been, this has been like coming, like I've been hearing

504
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,320
about this eventuality for like a long time, like over a year. It's about damn time, Tom.

505
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,920
It's about, I kind of agree. No, the thing is, is that like I keep, there keeps, there's a lot of

506
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,640
like family conflicts going on and I'm not going to get too deep into it, but just know that it's

507
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,240
been threatened multiple times that the house will be sold by X date. And then I go into a panic

508
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,800
trying to get everything set up and ready to go. And then the date comes and nothing has happened

509
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,400
and, and, and, and was like, okay, well, I guess I just like lost a decade off my life for no reason

510
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,560
then. And then like a few months after that, a new date will be presented and, and I'll have to

511
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,000
like redo the whole thing over and over again, but this time it's really gonna be real. And,

512
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:45,280
Is it? Yeah. So I bought, I bought my car. I got my shit packed up and it's gonna be an adventure.

513
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,760
So I plan on first going where Digi is, we're just going to hang out for a bit and just shoot

514
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,840
the shit and like be bros for real. And that'll be interesting. I guess I'll be seeing you soon.

515
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Yeah, dude, like I'm going to be around in the area. So we should all, you want to come for,

516
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,560
you want to come for the fireworks on the fourth? Maybe. I don't know if I'm, I know I'm like

517
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:11,120
grilling some of my dad on the fourth. I'm hanging out with Munchy. Can I say, can I say,

518
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:18,880
can I say someone's name? Okay. Kazi? Yes. Okay. I didn't know who he was saying.

519
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,560
Yeah. I'm not, I'm not in control of who speaks her name and who doesn't.

520
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:30,080
Oh wait, Nate, wait, Nate, Nate talks about Michelle on here. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. I got nervous

521
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,680
because I fucked up and said real names before. Yeah. Yeah. Kazi's coming and, and you know,

522
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,160
Kazi, which is, which is her real name, of course. That's, that's right. Shut up.

523
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,640
Wait, yeah, I know her real name. I don't even know your real name, Munchy.

524
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,800
Everyone knows my real name. I actually, I don't know what that's supposed to say about that later.

525
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,080
Yeah. Anyway, we're going to, I saw the fireworks on the Charles Bridge a couple years ago and it

526
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,480
was really great and we're going to do it again. It's going to be fun. And hopefully this time,

527
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,040
the smoke from the fireworks won't blow right over her faces and choke us and make us gag.

528
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,920
That sounds unpleasant, but I will try and make it. Yeah, that would be fun. I'm so,

529
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,560
I'm so fucking jealous. I would love to do that. Also, what I'm also envious of is Ben, you are going

530
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,240
to be able to play Pokemon Go for real this time. You're going to be able to go to fucking

531
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,240
Boston Common and play on Community Day. Do you understand the magnitude of people playing

532
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,960
in the area with real people? Yeah, that's going to be way sick. That's going to be way

533
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,720
fucking sick, dude. I was not prepared for the community of Boston because the community of

534
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,120
San Diego is there's like a few people, some of them raid, basically no one raids. And even when

535
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,960
you do raid, no one talks to another. They're all just huddled. They're all looking at their phones.

536
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,520
No one's looking up. No one's saying hello. But in Boston, people, okay, first of all,

537
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,080
you meet unbelievable caricatures. And then also everyone, even like the normal people,

538
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,840
are just talking to everyone. Everyone's super friendly. Everyone's having a good time. They're

539
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,800
just becoming big groups that go on raiding adventures for the entire day together. It's

540
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:14,400
great. I feel like I've missed out on quality PCP lore bonding by dropping off the Pokemon Go

541
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,240
bandwagon. I feel like I need to get back on that. I have to. The only times I have really

542
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,520
Pokemon Go is when, I mean, I did a little bit here and there, but for the most part, I only did

543
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,320
at Radcon and Armortreeblecon. It's pronounced Pokemon Went in that.

544
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,880
I went for a bit, but now I'm not going anymore. Tom, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are you not in

545
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,800
the separate chat we made for Pokemon Go, the separate Discord server that we've been talking

546
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:47,600
in? Wait, I clearly know. Wait, send me the fucking link. No, not really, you fucking idiots.

547
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:55,040
Oh, god, shit. We should fucking make like a chat. I'm doing that right now. I'm literally in

548
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,120
the process of doing it right now. Because I have also been getting into Pokemon. It's really just

549
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:07,200
like the update that added trading and friends lists, and now it's like great that I can see

550
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,880
people playing the game in some sort of way and be like, yeah, I'm gonna download it right now.

551
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,880
I'm getting it. Dude, I'm about to post my frame code in chat right fucking now. There's nothing

552
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,640
you can do to stop me. All you fucking babies and I'm just like, oh, oh, munchies playing Pokemon

553
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,240
Go. Oh, I'll jump on the bandwagon when I'm the pioneer. Motherfucker. To ever click on Pokemon.

554
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,440
I was there. I fucking downloaded Pokemon Go illegally before it was out in the UK because

555
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:40,560
I wanted to play it so much. How did you do that? I googled it. There was a way to download it

556
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:47,200
onto like a USB and then download it into your phone from the computer and then activate it in

557
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,840
a secret way, but then it became the real game anyway. I don't know how it works, but I still

558
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:58,560
have that. Did your account transfer over? It did. So I was managing, I was like the only person,

559
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,840
well, not the only person, there's clearly a few other people who were playing, but like

560
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,360
for a few weeks, I was the only person I could see playing Pokemon Go and I was always looking out

561
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,320
for like, who else has done the cheat? Who else has done the secret cheat to get this game before

562
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:19,120
anyone else? And I don't think anyone else I met was. After, like after, like after some time,

563
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,360
we can like hang out. We can play Pokemon Go together. Maybe we can get a group together

564
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,920
and then we should do fucking Pokemon Go as the topic. Oh, of course. We were actually thinking

565
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,000
about doing that today, but you're like, um, well, it was originally just going to be me,

566
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,680
Tom and Hippo and Tom hasn't really played a lot of Pokemon Go and me and Hippo have said a lot

567
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,120
about Pokemon Go already, but I would love to do Pokemon Go episode someday. I think that would

568
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:44,960
be, because I have a lot to say about that. It's kind of weird how, uh, disharmonious our

569
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,600
Pokemon Go has been, because we all started at the same time when the game first came out.

570
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:56,160
Then you, Ben, uh, and Hippo kept playing for like a couple extra months, like like a pretty

571
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,640
long time after everyone else stopped playing. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I would go on Pokemon Go walks for

572
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,600
like a long time after. I never stopped and I never really stopped until I went all the way

573
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,520
through like that first really cold December. Like I was still going out even in the middle of the

574
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,800
night, like really cold. Like I just, I want to, I just want to catch Pokemon still. And you guys,

575
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,200
you guys were going strong and I had dropped off. And then everyone stopped playing because,

576
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,880
you know, it was like when Jota was out for a little bit or maybe even a little bit before that

577
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,800
and everyone's like, okay, enough of this game. It sucks. And then I picked up again right around

578
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:35,120
when, like, like a day or two before Rick Waze came back or when Rick Waze first came out rather.

579
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,880
You mean the third impact? Yeah, the third impact. And I turned the game and like there are these

580
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,120
things called raids and there's a ton of like new social features. I think it's completely

581
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:51,520
different. And the game is like really, really fun now. You know, there's hardly ever any glitches

582
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,680
or any like retarded shit like that. There's a few now that friends are out and friends doesn't

583
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,000
work as well as it should. But you know, whatever, whatever, it's mostly fine. And there's barely

584
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,280
any like game breaking glitches. And there's so many features that incentivize you meeting new

585
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,600
people in real life. It's fucking great. I absolutely adore it. Too bad San Diego kind of

586
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,960
sucks for the game. And it's not very funny. Here was no one talks to one another, but in

587
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,600
Boston, that should great. Oh, wait, teams, teams, hashtag team yellow, hashtag team yellow,

588
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,720
instinct instinct. Team mystic. Yeah, I was a mistake. Of course, of course, you're a mystic.

589
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,840
Yeah, Tom mystic. Yeah, we should have a fucking war. I mean, what can I say? Articuno is the best

590
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:36,320
bird. That's not even true. It is true. The other ones look like shit. And you know it. No, Articuno

591
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:43,360
has a long tall head and Zapdos is funny. He's a funny boy. Zapdos is a fucking big bird ass

592
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,360
mother fucker. Exactly. That's why I love him. That's what he is. And Moltres is a rubber chicken

593
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:54,720
that's on fire. Moltres does suck. I think I've told you before, but I routinely listen to your

594
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,000
Pokemon Go miniscule review just like regularly, just like every other week or so. I love that.

595
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,200
Yeah, I also I have watched rewatched it because you've said that and you said like Ethan really

596
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,720
likes it as well. And I've rewatched it and I agree. Like it has something like undeniably great

597
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,080
that I don't do anymore. I don't know how to recapture that gold. I don't know if you got it.

598
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:22,080
I don't know if you heard Ben, but because due to shiagans are too long to discuss, but basically

599
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:28,480
the entire world wide community of Pokemon Go has completed a set of like challenge ARG

600
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,360
challenges that Niantic has presented for us. And Ergo, we have unlocked a special bonus in the

601
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:40,160
game and next weekend shiny articuno will be out in raids. What color is shiny? Is he the yellow?

602
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:46,000
No, no, he's like he's like icy blue. He's like more light blue. He looks cool. Okay. Okay,

603
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,680
that's pretty cool. I did not have any legendaries. I've never caught a legendary. I got two articunos

604
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:01,200
from last week. I have three. I'm a fucking big boy. I think I think I'm the the what level are

605
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:11,200
you guys? I'm 32. I'm like 2026. I think I'm probably like 26 to get fucked. Oh, I'm not. Yeah,

606
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:19,120
well, get fucked yourself. That's all I have to say. I the annoying thing about like where I live

607
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,800
is there's this one park, and there's like five Pokestops. And if I want to do anything, I need

608
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,280
to like take the train into the center of London, where it's like unbelievable amounts of Pokestops

609
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,560
and there's too much stuff. But like it's still a day trip in and it's it's expensive and I don't

610
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,000
want to do it every day, but I want to do it every day because there's so many Pokestops.

611
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,360
So it's like I could even play normally just having a nice walk and not take it too seriously,

612
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,920
or I could take it incredibly seriously and take the train every day, which I kind of want to do,

613
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,280
but I can't because it's too much time investment. Look, you got to be the best like no one ever was.

614
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,160
So get your bitch ass. Oh, you're right. I will do it now.

615
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,360
That's why that you know what this this ties back to what we were saying before.

616
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,280
The reason why Boston's so good for Pokemon Go is that you can just ride everywhere you want

617
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,360
because that's good public transport. When you go and public transport are inherently linked.

618
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:19,440
Speaking of Pokemon, I hope you're all excited for the first ever Muck League tournament,

619
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:25,200
the first ever New Los Angeles City, aka New Milwaukee Muck League tournament. Are you guys

620
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,960
fucking pumped for it? I know I know basically nothing about it and I'm in it. So I can that

621
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:37,440
shows you how professional I look. I am a Muck master. I am deeply involved in the meta. I know

622
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:45,040
all the subtle the subtle nuances of raising, breeding and training mucks and battling. Did

623
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,480
I mention battling? The subtleties of the Muck trade are not to be trifled with. You are not to

624
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,000
oh you are not to underestimate the nuance that goes into training these blobs of gas and goo.

625
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:05,200
The Muck meta is subtle and nuanced. It is it is like it's a minute to learn a lifetime to master

626
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:12,960
is how I would describe. Graham is disallowed. I guess not. But why would you use one? You use

627
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,640
it just uh well they have like secret specials different moves. No there's no the Muck League

628
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,520
is all mucks. That's that's the Muck League rule. There's no little Muck League little cup though.

629
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:34,880
I mean sure I guess. The Grimy Cup. The Grimy Cup that's it that's cannon. All right well yeah

630
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,960
sure why not why not but but uh yeah the tournament it's on the it's on the 12th and we're uh we're

631
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,680
going to be commentating it on the rowdy fuckers twitch uh and I'm gonna win spoilers I fucking

632
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,440
crush it. I will probably lose but that's okay that's that's fine this is not a slime fest I have no

633
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,400
slime on the line. Guys me and Ben are about to require right first cop players after this.

634
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:04,160
Go watch right first cop players do that now do do that now. Oh god I forgot about that.

635
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:11,280
Oh are you not prepared? No I'm not prepared but I will explain why later and we'll probably

636
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,840
just have to do it anyway. Okay cool great yeah uh this is gonna sound like a basic big question

637
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:23,200
but it's not do you have do you guys have anything planned for this summer because I have an entire

638
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,200
theme this summer is themed for me this this summer this summer is is a is a new

639
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:37,040
type of experience it's the summer of pain because my mom my mom has recently retired

640
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:42,480
at least she's retired she's got a retirement bonus and and do and due to her poor money to

641
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,280
money management skills and also her extreme generosity she's offered to take the family

642
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:55,040
on several trips and these trips are numerous but also I I have many things I need to get done

643
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,720
this summer I have many a thing the projects they have they have had they have deadlines in my

644
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:06,560
brain for and so I have to manage my time between absolute decadency and pinging out on vacations

645
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,640
in various foreign countries such as Hawaii and Italy uh so I'm going there but but whenever

646
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,400
I'm not there I have to work harder than I've ever worked before in my entire life and the

647
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,840
and I've just been resulting and me waking up typing things in google docs and like and like

648
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,840
drawing little character designs and then passing out after like 15 hours of just trading like doing

649
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,840
nothing else other than that and it's been it's been a great experience it's a summer of pain

650
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:39,040
where I where I balance I balance the excruciating work agony that puts myself every single day and

651
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,640
and then the absolute decadence of like being on vacation and and seeing my friends and going

652
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:52,000
weird places that's my sorry tumour is my plan for the summer is to enter a kind of zen like state

653
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,960
where time passes without me even noticing uh during during with quality during which during

654
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:08,160
which art gets made um while I fucking don't even know about it uh yesterday I fucking yesterday

01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:40,720
feels good to to have even just a little bit of a plan of like yes during this day I will do this

681
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,600
vague thing like even that is nice to just know all right because like I've mapped out my days at

682
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:52,320
the moment I'm doing like YouTube stuff and then also like writing stuff like writing for for secret

683
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,760
projects that I don't know that I don't really kind of talk about but like uh for for like other

684
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:08,160
real big boy things such as uh scripts for tv and film lol sick so I'm sorry like I've mapped out my

685
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,840
days like okay Monday Wednesday Friday I will do this and then Tuesday Thursday I will do the other

686
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:20,000
thing and by switching to and fro I will keep things fresh but also be making progress every day

687
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,080
and not be doing the same thing for days on end you know like every time I get stuck on something

688
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,680
the next day I'm going to be doing something else anyway so like it's not a problem

689
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,800
and it's and it's been working pretty well so far the beauty of having multiple projects I don't

690
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:42,240
I do not space my time like you do I probably should that's probably the best but it's kind of

691
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,840
for me it just I know I have to work for this certain amount of hours every single day because

692
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,000
this is how much I've calculated is a good idea uh and so I'll do this uh for like you know like

693
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,600
like 10 hours or something or whatever it's just not you however many hours but the beauty of having

694
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:05,040
multiple projects is that a lot of the time in in my youth I would start something and then I would

695
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,760
have everything open and I would be working and then I would hit like like a stump or some sort of

696
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,040
block and I would be like I don't want to do this like this is really hard and like I nothing's

697
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,320
coming to me right now and I can't I can't get the juices flowing and then I would just sit there

698
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,800
twiddling my clip thinking about how hard it is for like an hour or something wasting time

699
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:28,880
but now I just realized when okay shit's not happening right now I'm I don't want to waste

700
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,560
my time I'm just gonna do my other project while I wait for my brain to refuel so I can do the other

701
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,920
thing so I never have moments where I'm just like ooh I don't want to do this it's always I'm

702
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,720
constantly making things and I can and I and I'm not afraid to switch off of something and do something

703
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:49,360
else in the meantime I will I recharge my spirit I mean the way I do it is like it's easier to to

704
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:55,280
swap after a night of sleep because like if I try to swap during the day I'm constantly thinking

705
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,040
maybe I shouldn't have swapped maybe if I waited for another couple of hours I would have figured

706
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:03,360
it out what I was trying to do and I'm still the previous project I was doing in the morning

707
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:08,240
is still in my mind as I'm trying to switch to a different project in the afternoon so like I like

708
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:14,800
to even if I can't get anything done that day because I was a bad day I I instead uh you know

709
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:20,880
I I try my best and then if I can't get anything done that's that that day is it's done but at

710
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,880
least I tried next day I know that I'm flipping I know that I'm doing something else and by the

711
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:33,440
time it comes to the day after that it's usually like oh yeah yeah I can do this and then because

712
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:39,440
I don't I don't like leaving like niggling thoughts in the back of my head of like oh maybe this or

713
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:48,240
maybe that I want to have a good old sleep for just like slice the slice my time in half slice

714
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:56,160
slice slice moments of life with sleep days I think they're called I would do that but going to

715
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,760
like like laying down in bed is always the worst experience of my entire life it's the scariest

716
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,520
thing I have to deal with a day in day out because every time I lay down in bed I'm like

717
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:11,120
did I do did I do enough today did I spend my time wisely am I am I on track am I not on track

718
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:15,840
what am I doing wrong how should I kill myself and I just have thoughts like that like like

719
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,960
routinely just over and over again until I like somehow fall asleep so I don't ever want to sleep

720
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,800
if I don't have to dude when I feel like that which is often I go outside and I have a midnight

721
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:32,800
walk and I catch a Pokemon or two on the way I I would like to do that I don't think my area is

722
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:38,400
very good I live in a little bit of a shanty town a little bit I live in the outskirts of society

723
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,640
would you get stabbed I would get maybe a rape or two one or two when I get when I get done

724
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:50,640
recording shit today I might I might go out for a little Pokemon little Pokemon John just catch a

725
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,920
couple because I know that there you can catch some around my house like around the corners they

726
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,600
appear they appear in your nightmares of the corner of your eye you can't feel in the periphery of my

727
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,320
consciousness uh uh shit I was gonna say something else uh oh yeah about sleep uh yeah I hate going

728
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,240
to okay I hate going to sleep because going to sleep is like admitting that I'm done for the day

729
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:18,720
and then I know oh yeah and it's never it's never enough I've never done enough um but you know

730
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:26,720
what uh so the other earlier this week I was uh revamping my website to make it easier to edit

731
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:33,680
in the future and also to add um Bscapades which is there now Bscapades or what what is done of it

732
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:41,040
is on stcomics.com baby anyway yeah yeah well it took me so fucking long like it took me way

733
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:46,400
longer than I thought it would um partially for like technical reasons partially just because

734
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:54,960
there was like just that much that needed to be changed um for it but also so yeah I was trying

735
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,000
to do it because I went into this project thinking there'd be maybe like two three four maybe five

736
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,640
hours to get this all done uh so and then like I'm doing it for like 10 hours straight yeah and then

737
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,720
it's like you know it's really late in the night and it's like 3 a.m and I'm like way past my bedtime

738
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:19,040
and like I've been awake for like 24 hours straight and I'm like hmm but I'm not done yet so I just

739
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,840
keep going and I just don't sleep and I work like and I work all through that night and like all the

740
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:32,800
next day and you know it ends up taking me three full days to do it and partially that's just now

741
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,720
you might say well I stayed up all night so I got eight hours to work on it but I didn't get

742
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:45,120
but I was going real slow by the end there I was like you know I was getting easily distracted I was

743
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:51,520
like losing my focus forgetting what I was doing I don't think that I saved time get this good news

744
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:58,480
flash guys incredible fucking hot take from Ben St um sleepy is good for you and if you don't sleep

745
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:04,720
you will be unfocused and unable to do things that's peak efficiency yeah that that is just like

746
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,880
hashtag just team thing who you've just said to me that is like the most relatable thing I've

747
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,000
ever felt because whenever I'm sleeping I've been working for a really long time and it's always

748
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,080
like I've gotten to the point where it's where I start to feel the experience that I've been that

749
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,560
I explained before where it's like oh I'm stuck I'm stuck here there's a there's a creative problem

750
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,880
here that I'm not thinking of the solution because it's been like 10 hours since I started working

751
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,560
on this exact one project and now I'm all burned out and then after a while I just have to admit like

752
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,000
listen it's like 3 a.m. I have to go to bed I'm not I'm not getting anything done yeah yeah yeah

753
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,320
yeah you're not getting anything done and there's no reason to be awake but that's the worst that's

754
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:47,360
the worst feeling is when it is you walk away it feels bad but it's what you gotta do it's it's

755
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,600
like like when when you like when you're on a streak and like overwatch or something like you're

756
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,280
you're doing a lot of commuter like competitive games over and over again you're on a high streak

757
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,400
and then you lose one and you're like well I guess I have I guess I should go to bed

758
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:06,960
yeah but I lost one so so I feel like I'm an asshole and like I've like I've lost my entire life

759
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,000
the worst I to to get over this sort of exact feeling I've just accepted that when I'm mad

760
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:21,280
and I'm done uh rage quitting is okay and should be done like regularly like if you if you feel the

761
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,480
need to rage quit do it don't be worried about like people calling you a little baby my problem

762
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,720
with rage quit people who don't even know what you're doing right now and that's no way to judge

763
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:36,320
you yeah well I understand that then I do I'm just saying it's you know it's funny it's funny

764
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,320
that our brains think that when I rage quit like art the problem is I just keep thinking about it

765
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:45,200
even after I've raged like I get it out but then it's still there and then I'll just go back and

766
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:51,280
keep working on it like I can't stop I have this I mean this is like it has to be fixed there's

767
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:57,360
definitely a balance for like if you you're thinking like I'm so close but I think the the main

768
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,920
thing is like if you're tired um just go to bed like if you can't keep your eyes open then start

769
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,560
I'm pretty good at sleeping I hate it but it feels good so that usually over rules I don't really go

770
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,760
to bed until I'm like having trouble keeping my eyes open and maybe that's I mean I don't really go

771
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:24,960
to bed late I just sort of I'm sleepy a lot of the time but like um I don't go to bed at like

772
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,640
my bedtime I just go to bed when I feel done for the day so I don't really have all these problems

773
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,000
I used to I definitely used to have all of these problems I don't know why or how it changed

774
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,640
but I just sort of like okay I'm tired well I'll figure it out I'll figure it out rage quit life

775
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:50,880
I I definitely I definitely like like especially nowadays in the summer of pain I've definitely come

776
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:59,680
to the cushion like you know when it hits like specifically around like 11 to 12 30 I that that's

777
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:04,720
definitely like like the graveyard of like of like my my productivity for that day that's definitely

778
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:11,040
when I'm when I start to do my worst and you know I start to feel like rage quitty so I definitely

779
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,600
like now where I want to maximize all the time the sooner you go to bed the sooner you can wake up

780
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,440
so around there yeah at my hard bedtime yeah you got you got it you got to just accept you just got

781
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:29,760
to accept that it's what has to happen you don't be it don't be a coward get some sleep it's a

782
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:36,560
harsh thing you can do but you gotta do it yeah yeah um beautiful do anything else this is pretty

783
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,360
good this this felt pretty good this felt like refreshing this felt like I was engaging in a

784
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,920
conversation that was not blind me but like you know blowing me by this felt like I like I was

785
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,880
actually participating in an evolving conversation that mattered if I was there not and like it

786
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,440
wasn't just completely dependent on a few like members steam rolling things and all approaching

787
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,720
a topic from various different angles yeah it was great um we'll send you we'll send you your

788
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:11,600
court summons tomorrow smash cut to me being kicked from the pcp next week oh no hey uh nothing

789
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:18,080
like I wanted to talk about dogs because I've got a dog I don't there's nothing to do with anything

790
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:24,400
like um he's a puppy and he's a very funny puppy boy and he likes rolling upside down on his back

791
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:30,160
and like uh I grab his paws and he does a funny little like puppy movement and he's really cute

792
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:39,200
and he's adorable and I love him and um I feel like I was wondering about like crazy cat ladies

793
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:45,280
and why it's always crazy cat ladies not crazy dog ladies oh and it's because and it's because

794
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:52,080
dogs force you to be real people it's it's like dogs train you to be like uh like a parent but

795
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,200
without having to have a kid you have to take care of it and it loves you but you have to you know

796
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:02,720
you have to go outside you have to do things it can't it can't work on its own isn't it's not a

797
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:07,760
it's not a person it's not a cat a cat is like another person cats cats are like passive ownership

798
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,480
they take care of like 99 percent of their own cats cats are like roommates you know you give them

799
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:20,400
a little bit of food and then you can stroke them and that's their their rent money and and you

800
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,120
you know and but dogs they just they're fucking stupid idiots but they're adorable and they're great

801
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:35,280
um and I I like him I don't like either one I think that I think that dogs are just like you

802
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:41,520
have to fucking micromanage a dog it's it's ridiculous like in hindsight like I owned a dog

803
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,680
I owned dogs as a kid and it's like it wasn't so bad because there were five people in my family

804
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,600
so we split like walking duties but like you gotta like take your dog out to shit like multiple

805
01:16:51,600 --> 01:17:00,480
times a day are you fucking kidding me no never um and cats are just well I don't I don't I don't

806
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:08,800
see the appeal I they're cute I guess I think like dogs definitely it's easier when there's multiple

807
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:14,720
people in the house like I don't own a dog it is the family dog and it's like I've never picked up

808
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:20,960
the poopy and put it in the bag yet I I've avoided that um by just not taking him on walks when

809
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,400
he's likely to be doing that and I've got I've gotten away with it mum usually has has the poopy

810
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:33,040
bags I'm like yeah very very very good you do it and not me and as soon as I have to do that I'll

811
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:40,080
be like fucking dogs suck I fucking hate dogs I'll come in I'll just shit all over my hands

812
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:49,520
I have numerous dogs my I mean you know my family has uh and I hate them I hate them I hate them

813
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:55,120
well they fuck a lot I I fucking hate I hate I hate pets I just I hate pets and I never okay okay

814
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:01,760
I I like pets I like animals but my dogs specifically are are demons not of their own

815
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:09,280
ill will not not they have done nothing wrong the problem with my dogs is that primarily my mom

816
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:14,080
has trained them and no ill wish on my mom but she's one of the people that's like

817
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:23,120
squirting dogs with water is abuse and like that's too harsh yeah so obviously predictably the

818
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:29,120
dogs are not trained at all like they have no training they have no sense of like you tell them

819
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:35,360
no they won't stop because they aren't trained to know that no means no they they are rapist by design

820
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:43,360
yeah yeah my my dog's my dog uh it it was starting off like that like it would chew on

821
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:49,600
everything and my mom was like um trying to like she she heard somewhere that if you treat it if you

822
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,440
give it a treat when it's doing the right thing then it will do the right thing you don't have to

823
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:58,880
punish it and I continually saw him being a cunt like deliberately being a little shit

824
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,440
and knowing that he could get away with things and I I was like the first one to punish him

825
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,520
I picked him up and I put him in his little dog cage and I locked it and I didn't let him out

826
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:13,280
even when he whined and and when he calmed down then I let him out and he immediately after that

827
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,000
like things have been like as as soon as that was like established as a thing like

828
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,400
if he tries to jump up on the table and take out plates of food you put him in the cage

829
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:29,040
and he feels and he's like wow I'm I want your food I want it I'm I entitled to that food uh it

830
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:35,280
smells nice and no and he's been he's been getting good he's a good boy now here's the thing about

831
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:41,840
fucking dogs is that they love it they love being trained they love having discipline that's what

832
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:48,560
dogs were bred for was to have like they're like they're like Pokemon yeah exactly they need a human

833
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,360
to mat to dominate them so they can reach their full potential yeah I give him some dog candies I

834
01:19:53,360 --> 01:20:00,240
power him up and then I take him to the gym yeah it's it's actually true so there's no reason to

835
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:06,000
be like oh you can't punish dogs and that's what they've been they've evolved to do that they've

836
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,560
evolved to take punishment and learn from their mistakes if they didn't take punishment you

837
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,520
tell them no and they fucking bite your hand off yeah like dogs don't do that they are like oh I'm

838
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:29,360
sure I I didn't know but they knew whenever you meet a bad dog just know that the owner has

839
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,520
fucked up and they don't want to train it right and they're doing like weird bizarre practices

840
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,920
where they're trying to hype the dog up and then they have weird power dynamics it's just retarded

841
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,480
dogs are all great if you just know how to train them if you're patient and you and you know

842
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,720
you're a good leader a lot of people don't they either like dogs because they're cute and they're

843
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,920
like yeah I could use dog right now and they just get one flippantly and they're like well hello dog

844
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:57,440
welcome to the house I don't want to train you yeah I want to treat animals like stuffed animals

845
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:04,000
are the worst like no it's not here to to be a comfort item yeah that's what I was that's why

846
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,240
I was thinking about like crazy cat ladies because the cats are stuffed animals that you just have

847
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:14,480
to feed occasionally yeah and and like if somebody owns a cat I'm like okay well let's see let's see

848
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,360
where this goes but if they own a dog then I'm like okay this person's cool this person clearly

849
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,000
knows something unless the dog is like crazy and rabid like if the dog is just like a normal dog

850
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,200
then I'm like okay I can trust this human being because they know what they're doing

851
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:32,880
they have some semblance of like like discipline and order in order to discipline the dog

852
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:41,280
my cousin in Denver who's a stoner uh that that right that rival is digi and he's high 24 seven

853
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:49,040
and he has us he he quote unquote draws but I've seen his sketchbook and it literally not a joke

854
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,880
this is not funny it literally just is a lot of like naked girls with poor anatomy and the middle

855
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:03,200
school s drawn over and over again that's pretty funny yeah uh he has like three big dogs he's like

856
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:08,640
a pit bull and like a german shepherd and some other one but it's funnily enough he actually

857
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,640
has trained them really well and they're actually really well behaved and they don't fuck around

858
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,960
with anything and they don't jump up on anything and and you know there's you know he can tell

859
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,920
him to do things and then listen to him so even a stoner can do it you have no excuse you have no

860
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,800
excuse you fucking cucks who don't want to raise a hand to a dog they need it they love it they

861
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,040
want to serve you let them be your slave they desperately want it

862
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:39,840
oh you don't think it's dogs no no interest no interest in pets of any kind they're just too

863
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:46,080
much effort I respect my time too much to waste it uh uh training an animal

864
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:53,520
yeah I don't mind people who who like don't have the time but like implicitly like in my brain if

865
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,920
I see somebody with a dog I respect them just a little bit more than like a random person who

866
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:03,520
doesn't have a dog or it's not me a cat or something wait walking the cat I see that and I'm

867
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,920
like don't you have anything better to do it's not that I it's not that I don't have the time it's

868
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:13,600
that I don't want to spend any time because I don't see what I get out of it uh you get a cute dog

869
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:20,240
that you can waggle his face great he's got fluffy ears and you can move the fluffy ears around and

870
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:26,080
then you can pick them up and you can you can that's not gonna get me any subscribers I I might

871
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,760
enjoy petting a dog maybe once a month this random person on the street will not benefit my subscriber

872
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:39,600
base in any way I see I see no reason to vlog at aka you know recognize it as reality there's no

873
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,560
reason to engage with this person if I can't blog it's not about engaging with no no it's

874
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,880
about owning I'm talking about owning a dog like owning a dog I would get I would get to pet the

875
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,000
dog what am I gonna pet the dog every day fucking I'll get bored I'm gonna get bored of that shit

876
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,720
I think I think I'll just be petting this dog I'll be petting this hypothetical dog it'll just be

877
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:11,200
like uh again and like the same as yesterday lap dogs have been so cupped from every aspect of

878
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:17,280
their fucking life they've been evolved to be these shitty little things and pugs can sneeze

879
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,920
their eyeballs out and they've been deformed and all their spines are fucked up and they're and

880
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,800
they've just been made small and smaller so they're cuter and cuter and their bodies function less

881
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,160
and less and on top of that the people who buy lap dogs are always the ones who don't want to punish

882
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:38,080
dogs so there's just these shitty little barking assholes they just roam around sneezing their

883
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:44,160
eyeballs out and barking at strangers from across the door and I hate it it's just a sign it's just

884
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,960
a sign that the person who's done this is a jerk and a meaning I don't like them because they're

885
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,720
they're supporting uh pugs sneezing eyeballs out and also they probably have no backbone or

886
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:03,120
marble fiber uh I do think pugs are pretty cute but but you're right their eyeballs at the pugs are

887
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:11,920
like they like a real life meme face that people like bread to look like that like they they they

888
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:17,840
he was the original rage face he was the original reaction image before they invented before they

889
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:24,400
invented tablets people's canvas was their dog's DNA give it a for it give it a couple decades people

992
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:19,920
by wings of strife pcb intro main entry come on everyone sit down with me you know i'm supposed

993
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:30,640
to be working but instead I'm watching pcb whoa okay okay it sounded that has a lot going on it sounded

994
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:39,120
real that that was really short it was sounds like a radio jingle yeah I like that one podcast

995
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:45,600
dilly dilly d pcp ding and here we are um that works I I really like that one I think that might be

996
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,560
top that might be top of the list for me yeah I don't have a top of the list I do like it though

997
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:56,320
I I like I like the concept of it the execution could be a little bit better okay just just I like

998
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,800
how short it is I'm reading I like how I'm reading the tweet here it says I also provided three other

999
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,200
versions for your convenience and utility you'll find them linked in the descriptions of the main entry

1000
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:11,200
wait like huh okay hold on let me let me investigate this

1001
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:18,560
there oh so there's an instrumental then there is instrumental then words one loop each then there

1002
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:24,320
is an instrumental with three loops exactly so I guess it's just it's just in case we need to be

1003
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:31,120
a looping thing that is handy that is that that's actually really nice I think this is the first

1004
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:37,120
I think this is the person that that's realized the sort of like like like like what we're looking

1005
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,200
for yeah for what we're looking for in the sense that we want how we want an intro to be

1006
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:48,640
the yeah okay I mean first like a real intro intro this is the first um I mean it's 15

1007
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:53,520
seconds long uh which is like I mean I think the ideal intro is like five seconds but this is like

1008
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:58,080
you know most are the entries we get are like a minute long two minutes or whatever which is great

1009
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,040
and everything I'm remembering that one from last time where it was like built made up of like

1010
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:09,840
news reports of people saying the word PCP and stuff yes and I'd like I'd like that like

1011
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:17,280
feeling if that was like 15 seconds it's good if if if only if only we had something else

1012
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:27,440
this is basically what I'm saying uh then we have this by by by famous uh person Ben Smeals

1013
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:34,080
Ben Smeals is here I quite like wait wait Ben Smeals is a real person yeah and and and I quite

1014
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,760
like the I thought he was just a cruel joke at my expense no no he's real

1015
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:44,880
this picture

1016
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:56,880
this is a sonic level it's curvy level bro oh no I failed it in the game

1017
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:08,160
I don't I don't know if that's a PCP intro but that's definitely I'm definitely saving that

1018
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:15,440
using that for my own devices I definitely love that uh make sure not to give credit to Ben Smeals

1019
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:21,760
because he's a slur against look at that look at that cover look at that cover pretty yeah it's

1020
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:28,640
it's gorgeous show what it show notes guy show the cover editor show the cover or something

1021
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:33,920
whatever delicious uh it didn't really have a whole wait wait is this Ben Smeals by Doon

1022
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,640
Coon or is this Doon Coon by Ben Smeals oh wait oh you nerd Ben yeah Ben Smeals is the name of the

1023
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:48,080
song wait why why wait why is that the name of the song because I apparently Smeal well okay

1024
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:55,440
that's Ben Smeals daily uh what Ben Smeals is Doon Coon

1025
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:06,560
Doon Coon Ben Smeals is is merely a statement of fact okay okay uh well I liked it I liked it I did

1026
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,920
like I did like it but I don't know about it as an intro then we have I mean I would put it in

1027
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:24,320
the pc I would use it in stuff anyway we have this by Alex Siebel it's it's it's it's Alex

1028
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:38,960
I reckon I don't watch the videos well it says PCP I've never seen anything this beautiful

1029
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,960
I wonder what happens if I touch

1030
01:41:44,960 --> 01:42:14,720
if I keep fucking around I'll never make anything decent for the contest

1031
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:28,520
here's what you do Alex you take the stems of that song keep everything

1032
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:33,760
exactly the same in that song but you change the words PCP to RFCK and then

1033
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:42,320
you send that to the RFCK yeah you'll be on album number two wait Alex you wrote

1034
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:46,920
a song and I think it is not on the discord you wrote a song and I did it

1035
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,240
did not make it on to the first Rowdy fuckers fan album but I want it I want

1036
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,920
it on there you know I don't know why I'm asking you this publicly on the PCP I

1037
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:58,760
could just fucking send you a discord message but I find this to be a more

1038
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:05,000
fun and interesting way of going about back shady back room dealings in the

1039
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,120
most public way possible yeah yeah yeah exactly those are the themes we have so

1040
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:16,280
far I think the best one of this batch was probably 15 second one follow

1041
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:24,560
closely by the I am quesadilla which one was iron quesadilla the fucking the one

1042
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:32,440
with the three cabieros oh yeah I iron quesadilla not I am quesadilla no I am

1043
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:38,640
quesadilla iron iron iron quesadilla where are you getting iron from I that's

1044
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:43,200
what you're saying you're saying iron quesadilla I don't know I don't know

1045
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:48,280
what you're going on about but I will not stand for it whatsoever alright yeah

1046
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:55,120
I'm gonna yeah wings wings of strife wings of strife is on the fucking like

1047
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:58,680
that's the kind of thing that I want and that like that's the kind of thing I

1048
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:02,240
mean look we're getting all these really great things like like like Alex's

1049
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,840
thing Alex's song and the bench meals like these are all really great and I

1050
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,600
would use them but not as an intro unless maybe like we cut out like a chunk

1051
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:17,280
of them guys I've had like an amazing idea yeah what we should do we get all

1052
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:21,960
these themes and then when the deadline for themes is ended we would we have to

1053
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:26,640
like choose one or like you know we'll put pit them against each other we should

1054
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:32,640
assign them to like a Smash Brothers tournament computer people and and see

1055
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:43,120
which theme is is the better yeah but I'm just you know like they they get

1056
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:49,360
that one day of like the PCP theme Royal Rumble so yeah but like a Smash

1057
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:54,160
Brothers tournament we make we make wrestling characters based on the

1058
01:44:54,160 --> 01:45:01,080
track art free song and we see who wins and then that person like becomes that

1059
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:06,240
becomes like the theme for the next episode but not like forever that's

1060
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:13,320
like the the funny little prize or we alternatively we do nothing here's a

1061
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:17,920
new section and by a new section I mean what I originally wanted the feedback

1062
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,400
the feedback section to be aka not a hardly defined section and just a thing

1063
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:26,800
that I was thinking about that relate to the fan reaction the last episode that I

1064
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,680
would bring up because I care about and not because I'm obligated to do it because

1065
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:34,080
it's now a new section on the show so Dane I recently I was doing like an

1066
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:38,000
overhaul of the PCP Patreon lounge because it was kind of languishing and

1067
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,560
getting dusty and don't really talking in it because it wasn't really that

1068
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,640
entertaining and there wasn't really a whole lot of room for discussion so I

1069
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:49,680
added both an off-topics chat as well as the suggestions of offer feedback and

1070
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:55,480
we actually got I did the suggestions chat in the RFCK discord but due to the

1071
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:59,000
nature of the RFCK it was all just suggestions for the game of endless

1072
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:03,480
war and a whole lot of memes suggestions really what were they supposed to be

1073
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,560
suggestions for just for like actually the show like like like you know the ways

1074
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:12,560
to improve the show and slash or the discord itself okay but I did this in

1075
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,320
the patient lounge and that sort of thing actually did happen so there was a

1076
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:21,480
lot of interesting well-thought-out points regarding the show in various

1077
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:26,280
different ways one of which by Dane good friend of mine I'm going to read this

1078
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:31,720
one specifically because it's related to the section of the theme so quote from

1079
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:36,720
Dane as you're probably aware the current PCP theme is iconic there's a

1080
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:40,640
direct correlation between everyone making correlation everyone makes

1081
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:43,680
between those notes and the procrastinators as a brand I think that

1082
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:47,320
keeping the old melody as a light motif would be a great way to ensure that you

1083
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:50,560
don't have to start over in the process of rebuilding a deep association with

1084
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,960
the brand as well as avoiding alienating fans with changes that aren't 100%

1085
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,520
necessary this would also allow experimentation for known interesting

1086
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,080
ways to set the mood for the show or situation may also be a good idea to use

1087
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,360
it in either the intro or outro theme or if there must be completely new one also

1088
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:14,000
you may want to oh they was just in like fucking retarded shit but yeah I said

1089
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,840
that I just didn't use the word like motif when I said it but yeah well that

1090
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:22,320
was you that was your biggest mistake yes that's where you put that so I did

1091
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:30,440
but yeah I agree with that yes I do as well Dane he's on the right I don't

1092
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,360
think it's necessary I don't think it's necessary for a theme but I think that

1093
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:40,620
it is not it would it would help the decision if it's like oh yeah it's the

1094
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:45,800
PCP theme but it sounds like this I didn't I didn't initially think about

1095
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:49,080
this but I but I'll probably want to read a few of these suggestions pretty

1096
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:53,240
on the show because they've actually been really insightful surprisingly like

1097
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:56,680
right off the bat there's been a few that have been like a couple paragraphs

1098
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,400
longs by various different people by various different aspects of the show

1099
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,480
and all of them were insightful in some way or another and it was really actually

1100
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:07,400
kind of great to see so I'm extremely happy about that and I'll probably read

1101
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:11,640
some that I think are interested in or that I think it should be passed along

1102
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:16,520
to the guys in episodes so look forward to that oh another one for me what's

1103
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,080
this don't go into every section on every episode

1104
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,280
but how are we going to community build

1105
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:42,200
I mean I mean the PCB themes one is like kind of because it's like finite it will end

1106
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:46,360
forever and we will have done I don't know at this rate like at this rate

1107
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:52,040
well we already have a deadline for when it stops wait yeah I forget when it is

1108
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,720
the end of this month we got a whole month to go but like four more episodes and then we're there

1109
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:04,120
we're done so that one we should continue doing until it's over but like others we don't always

1110
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:10,040
have to do the fan art section if there's not a lot of fan art or like you know we should just

1111
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:15,400
allude to it should be like we got some good fan art we saw it all there's this piece in

1112
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:20,040
in particular that I think is interesting that we should bring up and if not there's no reason

1113
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,920
to bring it up there's no reason to have that segment if there's nothing interesting to say

1114
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:30,440
about it if we're just saying this was good this was good this was good yeah uh the questions new

1115
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:38,280
segment new new old segment let's just do like like like one let's just fucking do one can we even

1116
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:43,400
find a good one no I mean let's look let's look yeah I'm looking we look for a pity question on

1117
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:47,880
the twitter are you looking on twitter should I look on twitter I didn't even ask on twitter

1118
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:52,760
they're usually not that good so I just asked in the patreon lounge what's the hashtag pcp questions

1119
01:49:53,400 --> 01:50:01,160

1122
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:16,680
uh

1123
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:35,240
yeah questions much I got a question what do we ask what do we ask for questions isn't that the

1124
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:40,920
question uh beyond sorry dude there's there's this one guy in the patreon that's literally

1125
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:46,440
asking us if we would be a cuck for money that's really funny that's he that's actually the question

1126
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:50,280
he's asking if you're doing it is it is it still cuckled or if you're doing it for money I don't

1127
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:57,480
know okay well I don't I don't want to give me uh I mean you know that that's the kind of thing I

1128
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:02,680
think about on the daily yeah yeah I mean that that's an interesting like hypothetical suck my

1129
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:10,760
suck my big pp asks prostate massage yes or no yes definitely I feel like we already got that

1130
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:16,600
question before too and wait really oh well my my eyes just went right to it so well that says a lot

1131
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:26,440
does the okay does the ends justify the means from chaotic slaw in all circumstances just

1132
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:34,840
blanket statement yes of course there's no way that question of course yes yes capital yes

1133
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:46,680
doombox two asks dad it's me it's me son it's me I'm here now

1134
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:54,680
god go to your fucking room I'm here and come up with better questions here on here on patreon.com

1135
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,600
yes because all children patron their fathers I mean that's that's how that's how you get

1136
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:13,000
money out of them why why have a kid if not to make them a patron uh see Katie asks if you had to plot

1137
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,960
the convoluted murder of another pcp member at radcon for would you how who would you kill and how

1138
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:26,200
would you do it who would be the easy to kill you probably the easiest to kill it bro I don't know

1139
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:32,760
I don't think so away I can crawl away up the walls and and on the fences okay I have an answer

1140
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:38,520
to this but it's pretty I think it'll be pretty boring like duh did you would be the easiest

1141
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:45,960
to kill because you'd be high on weed bro you just replace this weed with crack weed we just put

1142
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,840
some fucking yeah we just we just put we just swap out his weed with some poison weed or it's

1143
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:55,880
failing that we just wait until he's high and then we sneak up on him and stab him when his reflexes

1144
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:00,680
are I think all this would be easier to kill I don't think any of us really put up that much of

1145
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:06,520
fight I mean I mean no that's true we're also like vulnerable and squishy if someone just like

1146
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:10,520
like if someone just got the jump on us we'd be dead instantaneously just from fear alone

1147
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:20,040
yeah I mean all of our organs and that's that's why that's why we can never ever release we can

1148
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:25,800
never release the the location of radcon four because if anyone decided to attack us like we

1149
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,760
would just drop we would fall like dominoes we're not prepared for attacks of any kind

1150
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:37,080
assault or other we we have no fortifications we are laid bare on the land

1151
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:46,360
it's sad really uh yeah really fun did you or hippo neg would probably be the hardest

1152
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:58,440
Nate or me probably uh dude who would win a fight Nate or Monchi um Nate's uh Nate's strong

1153
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:05,720
but he's also a bitch Nate can't squat for shit Nate would follow Nate just tips over

1154
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:13,240
in the slightest breeze he's all he's all show I think Nate would probably win I think that makes

1155
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:20,360
the most sense we need to have like a real cage fight I don't know I mean I mean a royal rumble

1156
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:25,160
in real life kill each other like the winner is the the the last one alive the arena was real

1157
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:32,440
have you the royal rumble in real life Monchi have you like ever like been in a fight yeah I I've

1158
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:37,640
been multiple did I tell you did I tell you guys on air or off air yeah I told I told you on air

1159
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:43,080
about how uh one time a high school junior was bullying me and I was in fourth grade and I beat

1160
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:48,680
the shit out of them no oh wait wait yes you did yeah I do remember that that's right that's right

1161
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:55,800
um I mean I think I mean you know what like the fact of life yeah Nate works out and everything

1162
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:01,800
but like the fact of life is that just like fucking momentum like fucking just fucking like

1163
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,880
just like a height and weight advantage it's like overwhelming like it kind of doesn't matter if

1164
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:13,640
you work out I honestly I think just from size alone I could see you winning you just need to swing

1165
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:20,840
a big tree log like Whom whack him and like also Nate's never been in a fight which you know

1166
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:25,480
neither have I so you know I'm not not judging or anything but that's just that's just the

1167
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:29,000
cold hard facts that actually I don't know if that's true but I'm pretty sure it's I think I've

1168
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,120
only been in one or two like real fights and then I've been I've been in a dozen or so fake

1169
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:39,720
playfights but I still beat the shit out of whoever challenged me now I'm just imagining like like

1170
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:44,440
the same like like Radcon 3 arena with the go pros but instead we're like picking up random

1171
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:48,520
objects like smashing bottles and like like going around the house like trying to kill each other

1172
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:53,960
dude like that it's such a vivid sight in my head like seeing that like with the GoPro footage

1173
01:55:53,960 --> 01:56:00,360
everyone just like like the stakes are so much higher in round three wrestling is honestly the

1174
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:04,680
funnest thing in the entire fucking world the funnest thing to do as a kid when I was in like

1175
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,280
you know elementary school was I would bring out I would bring over some friends and we would just

1176
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:12,520
all wrestle a hardcore we would get on my bed and we would all just like wrestle as hard as we

1177
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:17,320
fucking could we would push each other against the walls we the optimal strat would always to

1178
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:21,080
be able to like like lay on your back and like get your legs up and you would be able to kick

1179
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,680
as hard as you could and then and then we'd kiss a little bit yeah and then there'd be some you

1180
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:30,120
know it just just just for a laugh just just to make up just just to make up for the you know the

1181
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:34,200
trauma that we've been you know inflicting on one another we take our shirts off well because

1182
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:37,560
that we get too hot we live we live in Coronado so you know you would you would just you know

1183
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:41,560
take your shirt off you know we get kind of sweaty so we'd like we'd wipe each other down you know

1184
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:45,400
