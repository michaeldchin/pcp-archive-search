1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
I want to bless that guy. That's on above!

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,680
OK, I'm gonna sync with myself. One, two, three, sync!

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,900
Hello everyone. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,920
It's me, the Gibbontake.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,420
I, it's a solo Gipcast, at least for the beginning, um, I've waited, I've waited for an hour and

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,620
a half for Ben's internet to work suddenly and it's not suddenly working.

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,200
So I'm doing it, I'm doing the solo Gipcast, I don't know if this has happened before,

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,620
I know I've uploaded like a solo, like a vlogcast or something a long time ago just talking

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,420
about what I do, but that wasn't a PCP episode.

10
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,780
I think this is maybe the first Procrastinator's podcast where only I have appeared.

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:13,960
So, uh, what you, what you doing, um, I should start with, I think, the Lord of Ghosts, uh,

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,740
thank you for people who have, uh, since the last episode sent me their addresses, there's

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,600
only seven people left who haven't responded in any way, uh, to emails, to, uh, public

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,680
callouts, uh, uh, so I'm gonna read those names one more time and I'll probably be sending

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,760
these at the end of April and if there's anyone left, I'll just deal with it, uh, when it,

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
when it comes.

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,200
So, the last people, and I may have spoken to these people, but I still haven't got the

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,140
addresses in my, like, spreadsheet, so, uh, if you have responded, uh, this may not apply

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:02,300
anymore, but as of recording, uh, Mimi Menzies, Oren, O-R-I-N, James Gottwig, Adam O'Donnell,

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,380
D.S., James Dollar, and Milo Rocks.

21
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,420
James Dollar and Milo Rocks are actually, like, high pledge people, they, they give

22
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,600
a big pledge, I have to draw a doodle for them, I think, maybe they get in the plush,

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:24,520
uh, so, you know, Jed, give the address, go to the, go to the Kickstarter, if you can't

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,200
remember your Kickstarter account, then just message me somewhere, uh, so that I know,

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,760
and that's that, that's my little thing, but yeah, that's, that's been fun, the Lord of

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,120
Ghosts, it's almost completely finished in terms of the Kickstarter thing, and I think,

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:50,100
I think I've learned quite a lot, I've learned, um, that I should, like, very thoroughly figure

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,460
out exactly how heavy all of the items I'm going to make will be, I think I did ballpark

29
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,660
figures for, like, the number of pages I would probably, I would have, and then, like, the

30
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,100
page thickness, and, like, how much that would probably weigh, and I got, like, a rough estimate,

31
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:15,360
but it was very far off, uh, correct, and it wasn't enough, uh, so, luckily, the Kickstarter

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,200
made enough money that I'm not, like, losing money, overall, um, I may, like, not, I may,

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,440
like, break just even because of, like, all the customs bullshit, which is, uh, unavoidable,

34
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:38,580
but, uh, what are you going to do? Um, yeah, I've learned a lot about how to do that,

35
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,380
and it was, it really just comes down to, like, make sure to, to know exactly what the

36
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,780
costs are before you set the price for, for, um, for shipping to various countries. I thought,

37
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,460
like, oh, America, and, like, Australia, they'll be similar, and no, Australia's far more expensive.

38
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:08,320
And, uh, it's Farmerx, but, oh, is that Ben St. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You appeared. I messaged

39
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:19,440
you a minute ago. Oh, and there's, there's oblivion fall as well. Oh, hey. The episode

40
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,320
has already begun. I just, I basically just gave my spiel. Uh, give, give, give, give,

41
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,680
give, give, give, gimme five, five minutes, since you messaged me. I was waiting for a

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,220
whole extra half hour after the hour, you initially said. Let's wait.

43
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,380
I s- I, I said like an hour. I said like an hour and, uh-

44
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,760
Look, I, all I did was I said the Lord of Ghosts, like, people who still haven't given

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,840
their addresses and that's it. So that's fine. You can just leave that in.

46
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,400
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, you're right. It's fine. I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a rotten

71
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:54,680
and then it did it like again okay yeah it was at 400 and now it's at 3500 wow

72
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:03,400
that's which that congrats that's a lot yeah I'm just I'm just speechless I'm

73
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,280
speechless I've been making animations on YouTube for up close to 15 years and

74
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,800
this is the first time I can officially say it's it's me I've done it I've made

75
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,400
it I'm independent boy not having to rely on doing animation forever people it's

76
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:32,040
the power of the big booby and so I'm very happy yes I guess damn well not to

77
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,720
demean not to diminish the fact that it was a very good animation that got all

78
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:46,840
that attention because it was very nice what can I say 900 it's a big number what's

79
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,160
what's your next like animation then what's what's what are all these patrons

80
00:08:51,240 --> 00:09:01,400
gonna gonna be waiting for the next project is come zone for I have I mean

81
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,640
I've been working on the instrumental since the beginning of last year I've

82
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,440
just writer's block is bad and also I've had so much other things to focus on that

83
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,160
I haven't really been able to properly sit down and you know dedicate a lot of

84
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,720
time to it until now but yeah like it's going well I'm making my own music

85
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,720
instead of stealing from infected mushroom that's nice I actually really

86
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,680
really like how it's sounding so far and once it's done I'll be like storyboarding

87
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:38,560
and figuring stuff out the plan is to work on the shots one at a time and a lot

88
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,200
of a shots I know it's gonna be at least one part of the video where it's just a

89
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,400
whole bunch of sex happening but for the YouTube version it'll just be like

90
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,120
silhouettes with like you know like quickly cutting in and out with like

91
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,960
the music and it'll just be like a you know a black silhouette with like a red

92
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,720
or white thing around that or something but I'll basically be working on those

93
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,000
shots and releasing them for patreon so that way they can get like as they're

94
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,400
as you're as they're getting you're gonna release the pieces of the video as

95
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,120
you finish the pieces yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then eventually you know

96
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,400
the whole all of bits will be done and I can combine it all and there'll be like

97
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,880
obviously non-sexo shots as well and maybe some art in between though like

98
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,680
considering how much people respond to the animation like I was planning to do a

99
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,680
lot more art but people seem to really care about the animation mostly so I

100
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,280
guess that's where I'll focus I'm still gonna spend next month mostly drawing

101
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,080
but I do have some content I can release that like I'm gonna make a I'm

102
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,240
probably gonna make like an NSFW version of come zone free I'm just gonna you

103
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,560
know take the After Effects file that I had take the Photoshop file for all the

104
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,400
layers and shit and just we got no put take your titties out I guess is that

105
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,040
not something I thought that's I thought you already had that I thought that was

106
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,680
what was on patreon no that's like sitting in a chair it's like the first

107
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:21,280
one oh three that's three yeah okay gotcha yeah the yeah come zone free was

108
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,800
for one that blew up like in 2020 yeah the new animation is on Kazonex come

109
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:36,720
zone and then comes on for the thing I'm doing next what what qualifies what

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,520
disqualifies on Kazonex come zone from being number four is it that it's a is

111
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,000
it that it's a meme crossover it's that it's short probably that it's short it

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,320
doesn't have lyrics okay the musical style is very different from the over

113
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,440
free whereas the fourth one will be more in line with that and way better I think

114
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,320
what I have so far is way better like it's musically some of the best stuff I've

115
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:13,920
made ever in my life and I don't know I think mainly it's like the lyrics being

116
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,120
a thing because that's what cracks everyone up gets everyone giggling me I

117
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:27,720
see me I see could we get Craig in here sure oh yeah also we should say oh

118
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,960
right yes maybe I just maybe I just like being on the show you know maybe I

119
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:44,240
just like to be here you think about that what maybe that's why I'm on

120
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,080
even though I'm paying for data well yeah I mean maybe I just enjoy it

121
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:58,200
I appreciate your company same to you Ben

122
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,200
I'm losing it I'm losing it this morning all right let's let's sync quickly and

123
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,000
so we can get that out of the way yes yeah okay one two three sink sink let's

124
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,400
go let's keep going that was the coldest open ever what were we talking

125
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:31,160
about comes on for yeah it's gonna be a thing did you you how I mean you didn't

126
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,720
you didn't expect it to like quit quintuple but do you expect it to quintuple

127
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:45,080
again after it comes on for there's a chance look I did my research right yeah

128
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,000
because I'm like I like doing animation there's a lot of different kinds of

129
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:58,120
animation I'd like to do but I am like primarily a degenerate I feel okay and

130
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,640
that tends to like succeed so that that's good for me but I don't know like

131
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,120
how well it'll do so I did like see like whatever people have done in order to

132
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,320
um you know make a living like I looked at some of the page like the most highest

133
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,880
earning patrons the patreon people and there's people like Sakimichan who

134
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,520
like $60,000 a month and they just do art like they like people like that have

135
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,960
like such an insane reach like their art just gets posted a million times on

136
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,600
every website everywhere like do people yeah like outside of like you know like

137
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,680
like mainstream like I look at hentai porn circles like for some reason has

138
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,440
like reached beyond that I don't know they make like a ridiculous amount of

139
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,000
money and they always have and I'm like okay but that seems to be like a fluke

140
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,360
though like most NSFW artists like will make a couple hundred or maybe a couple

141
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,200
thousand but never like a crazy amount like it seems to be a fluke in that case

142
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:14,880
Sakimichan is a weird anomaly yeah for sure yeah um and like they're a good

143
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:22,120
artist but like this better artist definitely they definitely have I don't

144
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,960
know if it's still a problem they had same face for a very long time who's

145
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,880
Sakimi yes Sakimichan yeah I mean Sakimi is like a good painter whatever yeah

146
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,640
they're not like 20 times better than everyone else and you know like she

147
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,160
has very good rendering her anatomy can definitely be noticeably off frequently

148
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,280
but yeah but like it's not like not to like a terrible degree it's just like yeah

149
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,040
the people who like I don't know how Sakimichan got to where they are are

150
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
never seeing their shit like posted by like news articles hey this person drew

151
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,760
Disney princesses is hot men and you just see like fucking BuzzFeed articles and shit like

152
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,960
that kind of attention yeah so like I yeah not gonna happen to me and also I

153
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,040
can't like that that semi-realism that gets people wet is not something I'm

154
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,800
into anyway but what I have seen as I've seen animators like fucking go from

155
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,480
small number to ridiculously huge number that's like the tens of thousands

156
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,520
very fast and it seems to mostly happen with animators it happens with yeah

157
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,360
there has to be exclusive content yeah just be an animator have exclusive

158
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:49,720
content and like be good right the primary thing like some I see like some

159
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,640
really like big artists who you're talking about NSFW specifically yeah

160
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,400
like yeah porn mainly yeah like and they're they're animators who you know

161
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,240
don't do NSFW who are just as talented or more talented than me who get like not

162
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,640
even a hundred a month it's sad I just just how though just how things be but

163
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,840
yeah like I looked at I forgot the website's called it's like a it's like

164
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,800
social blade but for patreon you can track how much people have earned over

165
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,280
time I looked at some high-earning animators you're talking about graph

166
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,680
trian graph trian yeah that was it I know I'm gonna see on that graph trian

167
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:38,120
actually I wanted to look at um Trixie's graph trian it's great I know I want to

168
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:46,320
know what was fair maximum earnings and almost 5k almost 5k okay so I've got a

169
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,000
while ago before I beat that record actually let me let me uh actually let

170
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:05,400
me look at your graph here oh wow oh wow yeah I actually haven't looked at my own

171
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,800
graph it's really funny wait I'll post it don't look don't look it's gonna be

172
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:23,920
in the crowd I can't find myself that's weird lol oh my god it's like a

173
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:33,200
waterfall in reverse that is mad oh my god and the trajectory is still going up

174
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,000
that's probably am I it's probably gonna skim close to 4k I mean

175
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:48,920
depends how long this this gravy train keeps chugging along I'm pying to just

176
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:57,040
keep the output good yeah that that that puts things into perspective yeah

177
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:06,000
apparently number one in the adult music rank there's an adult music rank see

178
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,480
that does seem like a pretty a pretty small niche oh yeah I didn't even know

179
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,680
those thing like how is this cataclysm wait rock candies in here I know who

180
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,320
that person is candy they're they're they're like an they're like an ad they

181
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:31,400
do like flash animations um let's see this person well yeah you you became

182
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:39,240
number one in adult music on April 22nd or no April yeah or April yep yep wow

183
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,240
huh that's interesting like I'm looking at some of these like the rankings for

184
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,200
top-patreon adult music not ever not I know all of these people like seem to

185
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,440
have like music listed as like a thing they do at least in there like you know

186
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:03,600
very little description like I guess mindgasm creates audio guides I don't

187
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,240
know what an audio guide is is that music Orion the Orion person says they

188
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:17,680
create music videos huh yeah audio guides for meditation

189
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,800
oh maybe it includes music the people at the bottom like have music but the

190
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,240
people never top don't mention music that's interesting except me I'm

191
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:37,920
authentic Lamau yeah yeah you're the best sex music person that they've ever

192
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,200
seen cunt and the gang creating silly music and other content for enlightened

193
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:53,760
ear holes I'm interested jinx monsoon creating gorgeous little things I don't

194
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:01,040
even know what some of these are but cosplay music videos okay it's a real a

195
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,880
real a real but what do you call it mishmash a real melting pot this this

196
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:13,920
category hmm number one though pretty good you beat you just barely beat out

197
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,240
golden tar who is creating sketches and stories also does not sound like music

198
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,600
but oh well interesting the money and the money you show me the money the money

199
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:35,280
though that's pretty good hmm I'm gonna be able to at this rate we're gonna be

200
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,960
able to afford kai's top surgery in a couple months and then all so we're just

201
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,320
saving up for that right now and after that I'm just gonna have a lot of extra

202
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,440
money I'm just gonna use it to hire people I guess hire help hire animators

203
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,640
and you know be able to get more good plug-ins for my music hire a

204
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:06,160
professional mixer that sort of thing hmm I'm gonna put it on yeah you know I'll

205
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:14,400
be curious yeah I I guess I would be curious to hear like what you how you

206
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,840
do that I don't know like what like what would you yeah outsource like that

207
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:29,320
mixing maybe like what do you call it like a fit finish finishing like a what

208
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,360
would you call it when like you have the rough sketches of an animation and you

209
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,400
send it off to a Korean studio and they and they send it back and usually you

210
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:47,360
send the key frames key yeah yeah in-betweening in-betweening it's not

211
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,880
quite the best analogy like with mixing it's like you know I'm no no I'm not

212
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
saying they're the same I'm just wondering if I don't know you would do

213
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,880
something like that oh if I would do something like that for animation I mean

214
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,760
way round I would get someone I would pay people to do rough animation for

215
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,040
I'd really them to do like a sketchy version and then I would clean it up

216
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:18,760
because that's my area of stress really are you serious yeah it's you use that's

217
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:27,400
crazy I'm bad at the fundamentals but I'm extremely doing micro adjustments

218
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,800
like I'd probably at this point I can probably like I can do like rough

219
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,640
storyboards and then I maybe I can find like so an artist you can like really

220
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,160
push him like get more like intense perspective and things to make it just

221
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:48,160
look really cool sort of thing so like better storyboarding rough animations I

222
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,960
there's a couple people I've talked to who said they would be interested who are

223
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:59,200
really good and now I can like pay like here I'll give you like like 150 bucks

224
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,320
to do like like like a shot that's like five seconds or something and if just

225
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,440
roughs you know which I think is pretty good rates you know that's that's kind

226
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,040
of what I'm thinking and hopefully hopefully comes before be really good

227
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:24,040
but it's still gonna take a while to get done sure I mean you laugh about like it

228
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:31,840
being oblivion is not good at the fundamentals then but I think like people

229
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,240
have their skills sometimes that just is how it is where you're like I don't know

230
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,680
I look at a blank page and I like some people can just sketch out like a rough

231
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:48,040
idea really easy and really quickly and other people like they they just can't

232
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,240
and they can only like refine something that already exists with with like a

233
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,000
like a fine-toothed comb yeah skill sets it's all it's all depending on because

234
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,880
like I was trying for like pumpkin alley stuff to like to like do concept art I've

235
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,200
never really done concept art in my head I know what the game looks like roughly

236
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,800
enough I'm like yeah this is this kind of level and it's like this and I have to

237
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,960
like I can't just say it I have to make images so that it can be like so that

238
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,920
when I give it to Charlie he knows like what sort of models to make and what

239
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,960
color they need to be and stuff like that and concept art sucks I don't know how

240
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,840
to do it I don't know how to like just bring something out in like a in like a

241
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,360
quick and quick and dirty like just because if because in my head it seems

242
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,200
so obvious like what it looks like I was like why would I need to draw it I just

243
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,240
say it's like it looks like this I have to draw it and it's like it's difficult

244
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:08,760
it's weird Ryan some sometimes things be difficult sometimes they true yeah yeah

245
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:16,680
like with me I on occasion when I go to sketch something it'll just turn out

246
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,160
pretty good the first try most of a time it's bad I have to fight I have to fight

247
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,480
my sketch after fight my sketch for hours and get a bunch of opinions and

248
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
then I can sort of coax it in a direction that's good and then maybe I'll

249
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,800
polish it up but they'll still it'll still have a lot of problems and the more

250
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,240
I work and the more I just hate it yeah I'm definitely not great at drawing

251
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,040
still like I can get a good drawing eventually but it takes way too much

252
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,520
fighting at the moment compared to other artists I see who and then like five

253
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,520
minutes I'll just have something that looks great something out yeah I'm like

254
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,640
what the fuck how did you do that a lot of people in the draw cast server are

255
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,880
like like phenomenal and they just like yeah they're just like making like

256
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,640
masterpiece sketches within the time limit of a draw cast I'm like fuck I

257
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,040
also feel that the longer I work on something usually the less good I

258
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,280
think it is yeah it's funny cuz cuz the reason it takes a long time is cuz

259
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,280
you're like you're I mean usually it's cuz like your sketch was your sketch was

260
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,520
was not great and then you're building on a you're building on like a an incomplete

261
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:41,480
or an unpolished foundation and then you just kind of got a like well the face

262
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,520
kind of like is it supposed to be here no that's not right this pose I'm getting

263
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,280
if I move the arm will it look a little bit no it still sucks that's what it

264
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,120
takes long long time that's it's bad there's been a few people who have seen

265
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,800
throughout my life who are like born illustrators and like doesn't matter how

266
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,600
old they are they just sort of are really good at like making an image really

267
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,920
well but they always hate their work and they're always talking about how it

268
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,200
sucks I'm like this you yeah insult me by saying that it's so annoying yeah

269
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:34,960
cuz I feel bad than what am I yeah yeah yeah I yeah some people some people some

270
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,760
people just can't take a compliment some people you'll tell them like oh this is

271
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,440
a really good drawing and they'll be like no it's bad it sucks you you have

272
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:52,560
shitty taste if you think my stuff is good you idiot yeah for forays is always

273
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,960
like fat a little bit not not to not in the annoying way like he'll just let's

274
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,280
kill him he'll just sit down like just throw some lines down and like it'll be

275
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,640
these really nice like shapes that have like really good like appeal and look

276
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,080
really good I'm like whoa that's really cool and he's like what the fuck you

277
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,520
talk about I just this is just some garbage I made I'm like it's good you

278
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,400
know yeah I do that as well sometimes it's not I don't I'm not proud of that I

279
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,840
do sometimes like draw and it's like yeah I can see that this has you know

280
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,520
potential this has some good stuff you've done some really but I'm not yeah I

281
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,160
don't I don't know how to judge my own work and so when I'm in a bad mood or if

282
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:43,200
I feel like a futile today oh it's all it's never gonna work out doesn't matter

283
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,840
how good I'm actually drawing and how much people are saying oh wow Pog it's

284
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:55,760
like just another day of being Gib being like the not good one just another

285
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:07,640
day being Gib so tragic just a little Gib in a big wide terrifying world

286
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:17,760
you know twi-pi drew just to twi-pi drew that that Virginia and then they they

287
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,400
they sent it as a voicemail on the last episode and it was great they didn't

288
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,760
tweeted at me so I could retweet it though those those and it's those those

289
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,400
Virginia having sex paintings they were so good the crutch tip it wasn't sent as

290
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,960
a voicemail I sent it in voice chat for oh right that's that's right but the

291
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,000
point is we did show it yeah yeah I I censored it so that LA's are could have

292
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,200
something to put on screen I don't know if you saw the censored version I did I

293
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:04,960
did went back and looked at the episode of that part you know if they're on if

294
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,800
they're even on Twitter maybe they're not I'll I'll ask Twi if she'll post them

295
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,120
at the time she said like I don't know if I'll post them actually and I'm like

296
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,920
okay but like maybe you should I thought they were worthy they were good they're

297
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,080
on a family trip when they get back I'll bully them I see oh wait maybe maybe

298
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,800
over time this episode's out did you you did you ever post that that video I

299
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,440
think it was a you would four eyes reacting to the yes I didn't see that

300
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,400
but I'll I I want to find your server I'm sorry I must have missed it but it's

301
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,840
okay yeah it is funny I I I know at some point I had over recordings that I guess

302
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,240
at some point I deleted for space but um because I was very intent on clearing

303
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,160
space on my computer at a certain point but yeah I'll put it there there it is

304
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:14,320
who drew that me that was so comic from a while ago I forget who drew it it was

305
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,480
like the artist was someone you it was drinking moth you linked them in the

306
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:26,040
last episode I think oh yeah oh yes yes yes I realized that drinking moth has

307
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,080
drawn a bunch of things that I remember over the over the years drinking moth

308
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:42,240
is a very cool PCP fan I like yeah yeah I am I realized as we were talking with

309
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,480
you I said wait I know wait I remember this person did the the what do you

310
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,160
call it the league of the the league of Nate fuckers is the one that jumps to

311
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,040
mind yeah it's gonna focus one that that's for panel the the thing I use in

312
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,200
the YouTube thumbnail was for panel where you were freaking out about the pig

313
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:10,600
the pig the pig is coming the pig is coming yeah yeah so scary shit man yeah

314
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,840
you know I had I don't I'm not gonna go in any detail about this I'm keeping this

315
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:26,080
a secret I have decided I have decided to stop being fucking stupid what yeah

316
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,040
that's your whole character I know not anymore I'm turning off turning on I'm

317
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,480
decided to stop being stupid and do something that might actually succeed in

318
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,920
the free market and I'm not gonna go and I'm not gonna say what that is porn but

319
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:49,760
I'm no it's not I'm sorry good guess good reasonable guess nah not

320
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:57,800
interested something even better if you can believe it I'm nice give I talk to

321
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,280
you about it I'm gonna do it oh I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to do it kind of

322
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:08,920
soon I'm just it needs a little it needs I I shouldn't dwell on it because I'm

323
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,560
not giving details and this is gonna be really annoying to be so vague but it's

324
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:20,880
gonna take set yeah what you told me was like there was a thing that I didn't I

325
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,920
didn't pry about I'm wondering like okay yeah we can't talk about it cuz it's

326
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,960
secretive I'll just say it's gonna take it's gonna take set up and it's gonna

327
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,680
take some money I'm gonna have to invest some money in getting it done and my

328
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,040
hope is to be I'm trying to figure out how to do it for little enough money that

329
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:48,040
I don't think that I think it will be turn up turn a profit is the is the is

330
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,240
the difficult thing I've been I've been making phone calls they have not led

331
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,360
anywhere yet but I'll keep I'll keep at it because I would kind of random phone

332
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:06,480
calls to random because I would like to do that when you are in in town when

333
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,960
you're visiting so I have that's in like a month so I'm just gonna try and get it

334
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,160
set up by then and we'll see how that works out but I'm excited to maybe not

335
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,720
be such a fucking failure maybe I don't know that's my goal that would be wild

336
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,120
if that happened I don't know the Ben Saints success arc but we'll but we'll

337
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,880
see we'll see one and maybe in a couple weeks I can tell you what I'm talking

338
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,160
about listeners let me not let me not dwell on this anymore let me not keep

339
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:51,840
us from the important topics at hand this week I've mostly just been like

340
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,480
trying to figure out pumpkin alley concept art for the pre-production phase

341
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:04,600
yeah how's that going and it's yeah I mean I've had these this this this level

342
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:10,360
that comes after the first level in my head and I'm like alright this is this

343
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:16,120
part and this is the next part and this is an enemy and I'll just draw down a

344
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,920
design for an enemy oh this enemy will block you a fun thing about pumpkin alley

345
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,320
is like thinking of ways that the enemies and and all the things can be like

346
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,880
designed around the ability that punk has which is burning stuff mm-hmm so yeah

347
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,760
this is like a sandy level they're sand so you use your fire breath to turn sand

348
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,080
into glass so you can you can heat up like sandy enemies turn them into glass

349
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,360
and then smash them hmm so it's like freezing them with fire yeah that's

350
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,840
neat that's very that's very neat so there's all sorts of like like thinking

351
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,600
of like a type of enemy that is just unique from all other types of enemies

352
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,440
and you have to deal with it in a certain way and just making it fit with the

353
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,000
location saying lower I will do this and that I haven't got I think the next thing

354
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:17,440
I need to do is like draw a literal like level plan layout of like the floor yeah

355
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,840
and stuff I don't really know anything about pre-production I'm just sort of

356
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:30,200
like doing things I assume will be helpful to refer to later and that's

357
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,360
it is that like I'm I just I just don't know what I'm doing it's the stupidest

358
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,320
thing ever yeah making a game making a game doesn't make any sense you just you

359
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,160
fuck around and then suddenly you're playing something like I don't understand

360
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,680
that is fucked up it's really fucked up when that happens that's really messed

361
00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:00,160
up it's bad it's bad stop stop it oh my god I'm I'm I'm happy you

362
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,880
when when people I occasionally check if people like are playing pumpkin alley

363
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,840
the demo and I watch everything I can it's just nice seeing people enjoy it yeah

364
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,280
I have seen a slow a slow a continual slow trickle of a few more people downloading

365
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,280
phantoms revenge you know a couple people a day maybe here and there and that's

366
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,880
that's nice that's not what is this I wonder I wonder how high the number

367
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:38,120
will eventually go maybe a billion on a long enough time scale maybe I mean

368
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,680
extrapolated to infinity every human being on earth will eventually play the

369
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,040
game so for the last few days it's mostly been that and then occasionally

370
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:59,680
Elden Ring streaming and nothing nothing nothing is happening that's okay

371
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,200
that's fine I've been I've been doing the book I've been doing more I'm almost

372
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:15,280
done converting the phantoms revenge story beats to book pages it is so

373
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:23,520
tedious I hate doing it it's just like oh take screenshots and then arrange them

374
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,520
and then cut them up and post them on the page and it's like the most boring

375
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,200
thing and I hate it but I have like I'm almost done with it and then I can

376
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,440
actually pick paper and then I can actually maybe order a fucking test copy

377
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,200
and then I should really just buckle down and finish that because once that's

378
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,760
done I really can like start to get that book Kickstarter underway which is a big

379
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:57,040
kind of a big deal this I should probably try and try and finish that like

380
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,240
this week it shouldn't really take me that long but that's what I was doing

381
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:09,320
like this weekend yesterday I'm getting so close to having a hundred

382
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:18,240
Hades I got the I got the epilogue I got the basically true ending I'm a bit sad

383
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,600
because um you have the you get the true ending and then all of the gods set they

384
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,000
start saying different things to you because like your relationship to them

385
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,640
has changed a little bit and now I'm like oh well now I'll never hear every now

386
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,840
I'll never hear every scrap of voice dialogue in the entire game now now

387
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:47,400
won't yeah now like like the it's forever like your safe ball is like it

388
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:56,560
seems like it because start over what if you because because before I mean this

389
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,040
is a bit of a spoiler if you care about such things before all the gods think

390
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,200
you're trying to think you're trying well they think I don't know whatever

391
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,800
it's the point is they have a big party you have a big part you have a big

392
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,880
party and everyone makes friends and forgives each other and you're a big

393
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,120
happy family and it's nice so instead of like befuddlement and confusion that

394
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,480
like why are you still why are like why are you still not like broken out yet

395
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,360
Zagreus now they switch to be in like oh hey no hard feelings man hey love you

396
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,040
guys so it's like how many more times could I hear them say like hey man your

397
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,760
dad sucks fuck that guy here's a here's a gun that shoots lightning now they're

398
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:56,880
like oh hey no hard feelings have a gun nephew I'll never know yeah there's so

399
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,800
many lines there's so much there's so much dialogue I mean my family never gives

400
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:10,000
me guns yeah they give you like here hey hey nephew hey if you now you'll shoot

401
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,680
now you shoot tidal waves haha fuck your dad bye my dad is fucked up is that

402
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,880
true I would never if I mentioned on the PCP that my my birth father is a

403
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,760
conspiracy crazy man oh god yeah a lot of that what going around these days like

404
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,240
QAnon or these days probably but like way wilder shit than that if you can

405
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:46,120
believe it like flat earth I mean it's possible I yeah maybe maybe he's

406
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,120
secretive about that one I don't know when I was growing up I didn't see my

407
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,520
birth father much I was very little when my stepdad came in and he was a good

408
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,800
guy very cool guy yeah my birth father I would see him very occasionally you know

409
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,360
you know when he decided to visit or decided to be at his house when we tried

410
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,520
to visit him wasn't too great but I know I was a dumb kid I thought I liked him

411
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,680
a lot when I was really little because he would take us to McDonald's and buy

412
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,240
me an ice cream and my my parents wouldn't do that what more do you need and he

413
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,840
would run out of movie and would watch it and I'm like whoa time with him is so

414
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,000
good it's amazing it's like almost as if he only has to make an effort once a

415
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,600
year or less yeah yeah yeah yeah but uh yeah so I was I was unaware of the

416
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:41,240
conspiracy shit until I think in 2007 we moved into his well we were basically

417
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,080
spending a lot of time in his city because my grandmother the one extended

418
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,800
relative who I have any or I had any sort of close relationship with got

419
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:58,320
cancer because all my all my other relatives I feel pretty like I don't

420
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,040
feel like an oven that well but but my Nana I really liked her she always

421
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,880
used to make pancakes and so that was sad but whereas I was seeing my I see my

422
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,440
father a lot more because we were in his town that was your your your your

423
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,440
birth father's mom was your Nana no no no Nana was stepdad's mom I don't know

424
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,920
any of the family on my birth's father's side I okay I don't know what any of them

425
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,160
look like I I know one of them is called Nana 80 I think we call her I don't

426
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,080
even I don't think I've even spoken to her since I was like maybe five I have no

427
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,280
idea but um the they just in the same town by coincidence at Hamilton New

428
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,000
Zealand Hamilton so it's been a lot more time around him and then and then at

429
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,960
this point I'm like a 12 and I'm noticing he has fucking vision boards all

430
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,640
over his house that have like like borderline porn in them because he just

431
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,440
wants sex I guess and he just has always an appropriate posters yeah the

432
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:07,160
secret he was into the secret he tried it's like it's like I'm imagining like

433
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,200
the Charlie Charlie from Always Sunny with like you know strings like

434
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,720
conspiracy strings attached no no no a vision board is like it has to do with

435
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,240
the secret and the law of attraction all that that oh so it's like it's like a

436
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,800
collage of stuff that you want in your life yes and if you just stare at it

437
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:34,400
real hard it'll just fucking happen I guess I stare I stare at pornography a

438
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:43,160
lot so I was like noticing oh this man's a little bit of a sleaze ball this

439
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,160
I was the first inkling and then he's he tried to show us for secret and then he

440
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,160
tried showing us zeitgeist and then he tried show it which was all about like

441
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,760
9-11 conspiracies and then he tried showing us like footage of like like

442
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,720
it's just like gray like it just looks like gray like satellite footage looking

443
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,320
at clouds and there's like a dark spot in the cloud that like moves and

444
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,440
occasionally there's lights flashing and he's like you see that's the

445
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,560
mothership for us is in war with the aliens right now and then showing us

446
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:20,360
audio of a woman who is clearly fucking she's she's on some fucking drugs she's

447
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:26,840
on some fucking drugs who's like yeah and then princess Diana she didn't die in

448
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:33,920
a car crash those were dummies they um it was a ritual blood sacrifice from the

449
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:41,160
lizards for shape-shifting lizards um and yeah and I'm like how do you know I'm

450
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,920
on board how do you know that like where's her evidence you're just taking

451
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,080
the word of some random girl how does she know this he's like you sure she

452
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,600
didn't just fucking imagine it she sounds high as fuck and he's like nah nah

453
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,800
she just sounds so sure

454
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,800
cool and then my parents somebody who believes it then it has to be true

455
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,920
that's exactly and then my parents like I told my parents like he's I've been

456
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,440
seeing him more he's been saying a lot of weird shit and my parents like oh yeah

457
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,960
dude like so like after 9-11 we go to phone call from him saying the Jews the

458
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,680
Jews were behind this the Ark of the Covenant was on the plane you know oh

459
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:29,560
my god wow okay um but but then I guess later so yeah Ark of the Covenant on

460
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,720
the 9-11 planes that's that was his original conspiracy for that and then

461
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,560
it was they weren't planes they were missiles and the wings were edited in

462
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,080
using a you know Hollywood movie magic you know I've never heard I've never

463
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,680
heard either of those before so wait wait is it the Ark of the Covenant opened

464
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,400
and that's what melted the steel beams like I like it melted the the Nazi's

465
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,440
faces yeah yeah like like first it's the Ark of the Covenant was on the plane

466
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,120
then it's there were no planes there were missiles you know despite the fact

467
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,920
that thousands of people witnessed it no at everyone in New York was paid and

468
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,040
all every video footage they took they edited they did movie Hollywood movie

469
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,640
magic on it and faked it to make the missiles look like planes missiles are

470
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,720
not the size of planes I don't think he realizes how small missiles are they're

471
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,280
really not that big not technology you just put a PNG on it and you have a

472
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,760
big old plane and then it's oh the work the planes are real but there was a

473
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,200
controlled demolition at the base which is not what the video footage shows the

474
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,800
building collapses from the top down not from the bottom like into itself but

475
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:48,320
whatever so it's so bizarre that people like decide like it's it's like thinking

476
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,320
about it as like a coping mechanism it's so obvious why they decide that things

477
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,920
that could be distressing have to have been like controlled demolitions and not

478
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,760
like just the world being chaotic yeah they don't want to like they never get

479
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,800
conspiratorial about something that isn't like a serious problem or like a

480
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:16,160
big chaotic thing I mean there are conspiracies there are conspiracies like

481
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,800
that but my lot of things these people care about it's always to explain like

482
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,360
horrible things happening tragedies and like shootings all fake never happened

483
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:32,480
that kind of thing yeah it can't it can't possibly be that the world is is it's

484
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:38,320
just crazy sometimes it has to have been a secret person involved in it and if

485
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,640
only I beat them up the world will be safe and nice yeah it's true he's

486
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,520
earned to aliens as well yeah the best one though this is the best one I'll

487
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,960
never I actually forgot about this for like 10 years until I remembered so it's

488
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,720
years like maybe 2007 or 2008 we're visiting them we put on Pirates of a

489
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,560
Caribbean free he's never seen it and the Pirates of a Caribbean free it opens

490
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,760
you know you have a bunch of pirates you know being executed they're being

491
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,680
taken to the gallows and they're seeing a sea shanty and like they're just being

492
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,080
like executing like five at a time and then the next lot goes up executed next

493
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,760
lot goes up executed they're just hanging a bunch of them and my dad's

494
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,760
watching this and he's like oh my god oh my god this is this is what they did

495
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,680
to the victims of 9-11 they weren't on the planes that there are no people on

496
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,040
those planes the real victims were flown to Mars where they were executed just

497
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,920
like this that's like that that is like crazier than I would have expected

498
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,160
like what how would you say that how would you say that every time you see

499
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,600
every time you watch Pirates of a Caribbean free just remember this

500
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:58,440
happened on Mars they flew the planes there to kill the people it's like the

501
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:05,160
plot of Adventure Time basically I want to know where to happen if we showed

502
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,080
him spirit science he probably believes the moon is fake never asked me about

503
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:16,440
that it really it really does sound like yeah sound like they're just any any

504
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,400
he'll just he'll just believe show him show anything that sounds a little weird

505
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,360
and like the the moon explodes and it's like Eggman's robot and it's like that's

506
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,360
true probably it is true there it is true that they just believe anything

507
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,960
because they believe contradictory shit too like well they're a hundred percent

508
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,560
like all wars fake all wars manufactured there's a one-world government the 12

509
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,480
fat the 12 Jewish families the Rothschilds and the blah blah blah who

510
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,920
control everything the 12 banks they rule the world and all politics is just a

511
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,160
distraction I'll say that but at the same time they'll be like yeah we have to

512
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,160
kill bin Laden you we we got to get them over fucker

513
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,200
even though 9-11 was fake to justify the war that would be fake but no it's

514
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,000
actually real it's just okay yeah it's like it's like just like whatever I

515
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
don't know it really is just just whatever it makes them feel better to

516
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,840
think about anything as it seems to be the through line and and generally it

517
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:26,240
makes them feel better to think that someone's in control even if like

518
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,880
nominally it's bad people that's probably why they say fuck bin Laden

519
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,960
because bin Laden is like a known person that is like oh it's the bad guy to get

520
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,960
the bad guy I gotta get the bad guy and it's like that's kind of true if there's

521
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,400
someone you can point to be like this is the guy that caused that problem yeah we

522
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:53,720
can get him just want to have someone to get make sense they should play call

523
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:59,920
duty you should play video games I agree oh my god I agree there's always a bad

524
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,720
guy in a video game I just remembered another thing he told me he's like you

525
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,640
know you know why in movies I've been studying film you know why in movies

526
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,160
like darkness is associated with evil it's because two thousand years ago back

527
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,560
in the time of Jesus at night there were monsters there were monsters roaming

528
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,640
around like giant like jackals and in creatures of a night that would eat

529
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:29,440
people and eat babies every day and we learn to associate these these these

530
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:36,400
these satanic forces with the darkness and all this shit they just used to be

531
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,080
monsters everywhere the truth is that in the dark sometimes you stub your toe

532
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,400
because you can't see it and so people thought we shouldn't walk around at night

533
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:53,200
and then the dark became became avoidable you must avoid the night in the

534
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,840
dark there's a wolf and it goes oh and it bites you sometimes it goes awoo

535
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:06,080
sometimes you fall off a cliff sometimes you get cold and there's no fire

536
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:15,560
actually every time so I'm sorry he said that there used to be like real like

537
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:21,640
darkness demons in the world and that's yeah like every RPG ever well like eco

538
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:28,160
yeah I just every RPG ever just like RPG monsters just used to roam they would

539
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,680
just like appear at night and yeah well where do you think all the idea for all

540
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,520
those RPGs came from that's that's like um what is it I I'd heard about it

541
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:46,200
elsewhere but Dan Olson talked a little about it in I think it was the I think

542
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:53,680
it was the Flat Earth video yeah how like the the the cons like the conspiracy

543
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,200
mindset like the Flat Earth and the QAnon stuff is all like it all just kind

544
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,080
of like pulls it all just kind of pulls stuff including from like fiction

545
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:11,560
including like they'll take some tidbit of esoteric like mythology and use

546
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,080
that to explain like oh yeah this explains like the story of Jack and the

547
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,000
Beanstalk or something where did Jack and the Beanstalk come from oh well

548
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,120
it's because Giants the Nephilim and you know the the world tree was the Beanstalk

549
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,320
and stuff like it's like it's like it's literally just a fairy tale but

550
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,320
sometimes they'll sometimes they'll use that as evidence for something they do

551
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,000
they do get obsessed with fiction though don't they like they'll read like

552
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,240
fiction books and say though this is real like my dad like the Da Vinci code was

553
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:45,280
like a documentary yeah I think so they're just looking for for something

554
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:51,880
to latch on to that was me that was me as like a kid that was me like only I

555
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,240
didn't think it was real but I would think like I don't know this but he did

556
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:02,240
I think it's is real I would I would think I would think oh this character is

557
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,440
described as wearing like a long red coat with a high collar I should get a

558
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:12,280
long red coat with a high collar that's real that would look cool in real life

559
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:23,240
and it was true it worked that's it's uh it's uh it's pretty pretty wacky

560
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:30,960
there's some real wackiness in the world today these days think about how

561
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,000
like everything all the stories was was written by cowards who couldn't take

562
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,640
shit they go out into the dark they go out into the dark and they're like oh

563
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,360
somebody died because they fell into a bog well they didn't just trip and fall

564
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:50,880
into a bog you see it was a bog demon monster and they'll grab you and pull

565
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,640
you under oh yeah and that's the story and the kids they gather around they

566
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,840
believe it and only the cowards tell these stories because those are the

567
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,080
only guys who survive and then they invent all this mythology and then

568
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,680
thousands of years later people make video game monsters in real life about

569
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,440
those stories and then thousands of years later JK Rowling took all those

570
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:19,760
monsters and made them a parable about why slavery is good put them all in that

571
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:28,480
book oh yeah sold a billion copies my my dad my dad is pretty smart pretty

572
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:36,560
educated guy but he is he has shown a bit of susceptibility to pretty pretty

573
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,880
normal widespread you know boomer like moral panic stuff like he thought he

574
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,760
thought video games would rot your brain he thought D&D was like a little he

575
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,960
thought D&D was a little bit satanic just a little bit I was gonna say it

576
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:58,680
sounds a little like my stepdad but not quite he played a lot of games no my my

577
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:06,440
dad my dad probably played D&D at some point I feel like he must have maybe

578
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,840
maybe he was a little bit too old there was a point in my childhood where

579
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,120
parents my parents were like magic school bus witchcraft but then they got

580
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,920
over it cuz they went to university and then they were like my dad was a

581
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,000
little bit like my dad was a little bit like I this seems a little satanic but

582
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,600
he didn't really didn't really do anything about it he just kind of

583
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:35,760
vaguely guilted you like yeah you shouldn't hmm you might go to hell well

584
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:44,560
that's the free market you didn't feel that strongly about weird actually I

585
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,440
always thought like man if you really think the devil is at work here like I

586
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,720
would I would really want to do something about that but I mean that's

587
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:59,160
that's just me maybe the maybe the devil ain't so bad yeah my parents go over

588
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,000
that stuff eventually or at least they did with me like they were very strict

589
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,760
on my sister if my sister listened to like gothic music like like metal music

590
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,840
or whatever they would like freak out and moral panic at her and tell her she

591
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,840
needs to go see Jesus and shit but I would listen to the same music and they

592
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:20,920

608
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,240

609
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:15,560
out right now with the hot new 90s tracks of what 2000s music and they were like

610
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:23,360
yeah look at this listen to this what do you like Gibb they didn't say Gibb and I

611
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:30,600
would say um you know stuff cuz they didn't they didn't know the Beatles but

612
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,400
I didn't want to be like um you don't know the Beatles I didn't want to be like

613
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:41,560
I don't want to be like a freak who likes the Beatles I was like the Beatles

614
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:47,280
that's like bug that's stupid what the fuck that was me that's a bug that's like

615
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,840
a glitch in the system why would you name yourself the Beatles is it because

616
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,080
beat like music has a beat are you dumb are you trying to be clever get out took

617
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:02,520
me a long time to realize that the name had an a in it and that it and that it

618
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:09,840
was a joke look at these bowl cut boys they're not for me I said they were not

619
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:16,560
for you they were for young girls in the 60s 50s it's crazy it's crazy listening

620
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,240
to live performances from like Elvis or the Beatles back then and understanding

621
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:28,360
oh this is where the term fangirl came from yeah like just like they were

622
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:34,880
screams so fucking loud it's nothing like today people faint in it's like they'd

623
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,840
never seen a boy before basically maybe they hadn't maybe they weren't allowed I

624
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,920
guess I would have been you're so is it is it is it nothing like today does that

625
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,240
do they not the like the way they scream is like it sounds like they're being

626
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,960
murdered it's like blood curling like where today it's just like people

627
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,840
cheering like like and they chair a lot but like it's some of the clips I've

628
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,800
seen it's like like they're shrieking that's very they're shrieking it was

629
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:09,280
loudest shrieking they're like fainting they're crying and shitting and coming

630
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,800
you know all of that at the same time ironically in the front row but you can't

631
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,520
you know like you can't hear like the music over it like almost that that's

632
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,000
why they started doing studio albums more is because they couldn't like

633
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,440
literally couldn't do live performances because they couldn't hear

634
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,360
themselves it was just like a big like screaming thing it's like okay well I

635
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,800
don't like this I liked the music I want to do music and then they stopped they

636
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,240
stopped appearing live forever exactly until they didn't until they appeared dead

637
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:47,320
as we all must I do remember like a couple times would say what's your

638
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,840
favorite band say oh Led Zeppelin oh the Beatles and they would say oh cool

639
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,120
because they knew what that was they didn't care and I didn't follow up with

640
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:01,280
anything because I didn't know what to say and that was it I should have posed

641
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,640
more I should have been like yeah I'm into whatever you're into you know what

642
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:11,920
are you into I'm like I'm into as I lay dying and they're like as I laid as I lay

643
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:18,840
crying more like haha and then yeah yeah I would have to and then I will

644
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:24,920
literally be laying there dying because of being beaten to a pulp you don't like

645
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:31,160

674
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,480
that name all gas no breaks before it's a guy who would just show up to random

675
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,760
events usually like events like flatter of conferences and like or just like you

676
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,680
know just just any place where he would expect he would find crazy people and he

677
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,560
would just walk up to randoms in the street point a microphone at them and

678
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,920
just let them say whatever the fuck and wait is that the guy from channel five oh yeah channel

01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,520
five of Andrew Callahan yeah yeah that's yeah yeah I I have seen him he made a video in

680
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:21,360
car key no not car key in Ukraine is in Ukraine somewhere yeah it was like a like an air siren

681
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:27,200
went off and they went to hide and there's a cat the family was bringing their cat and it was good

682
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:36,000
yeah this this guy this guy is cool um he he's met some fucking weird people

683
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,720
he just goes where the where stuff happens and just interviews random people and it's interesting

684
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,440
yeah proper journalism that's that's that's real

685
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,120
it is it's very well I guess Gonzo journalism what does Gonzo mean I think if you go and you

686
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,040
join the war and you report on it yeah I think I would call that Gonzo journalism

687
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:03,440
I don't know if he joined the war he just kind of showed up and just with a microphone yeah I

688
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,960
don't think he's killing anyone I think he's just on the scene oh well then I'm not sure

689
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,760
not sure if that counts then

690
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:26,880
damn war is bad it is no I like it more war please can we invade I respect another country

691
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,680
I don't I may not agree but I respect your opinion maybe it's good to some people

692
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:41,600
I think we should invade Wales and finally like kill that dragon slay that dragon somebody's

693
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:48,400
got to do it yeah St George was like the the the the the patron saint of England and he is like

694
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:54,960
the guy who slayed a dragon but Wales is right there and the dragon is alive I think we gotta

695
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,880
we gotta solve this problem we gotta end this all all of the people in Elden Ring are Welsh

696
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:06,160
so that's what I'm basically doing and what by playing Elden Ring I'm killing the Welsh

697
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,920
you're redistributing the Welsh like like cutting them up into pieces and distributed

698
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,800
in like redistributing their arms and legs all around

699
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:27,920
it's true they got some great accents in in Elden Ring I wouldn't know I've not really seen any of

700
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:37,840
the game still I think they're they're largely all Welsh Welsh accents and a few like the British

701
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:47,200
ones not sure there was that a fucking voicemail this was a long time ago I only remember it because

702
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:52,800
I used to in the pig fucker thing the pig fucker the interrupting deaf pig there there's a guy who's

703
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,280
like I really want a Welsh speaking family oh and I don't even know what I remember that voicemail

704
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,880
like what the point of it was I just remember that I had the pig come in but I remember it it's weird

705
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,920
wasn't there that one guy in I think the original Dark Souls there's like a guy who uses like a

706
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,960
like a Welsh or Scottish greeting Aishimai that guy yes the Aishimai guy who I never even found

707
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:28,240
in my no maybe I did I think maybe I found him later you you find him either he's on that bridge

708
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:34,320
in yeah he's under the bridge in Firelink Shrine or earlier you can see him just before you enter

709
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:41,520
Blighttown from the depths right down that that weird guy that weird little tinker mask dude

710
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,720
he's from Elden Ring they're all connected there's that one guy from Bloodborne in the DLC of Dark

711
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:54,240
Souls one that's what I'm thinking and there's that Samurai looking guy in the uh in the old uh

712
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,920
what do you call it Darkroot Garden bit you can talk to he's from Sekiro wait Samurai looking guy

713
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:08,320
Samurai looking guy in Darkroot Garden I don't remember yeah um when you talk to you know the

714
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,760
place where there's like all those NPC like people and the ghosts in the forest that attack you

715
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,920
it's like the the fighter the cleric the the ranger oh yeah yeah yeah with the cat yeah if you join

716
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:27,200
the cat covenant a samurai and a ninja will like appear just outside the building and you can go

717
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:32,880
talk to him and then later you can find him down in the bottom of Blighttown and like you can buy

718
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:43,440
his weapon I think oh huh don't remember that yeah he's a cool guy nifty nifty um it's been yeah

719
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:48,320
been a while since I uh since I played in these souls the only thing I've really seen I've seen

720
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:54,480
bits and pieces of Elden Ring and I've seen um is it is it named Radon I've seen Radon

721
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,000
yeah Radon I I I haven't beaten him yet but I have fought him he's an interesting

722
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,200
interesting battle yeah oh I've seen um oh and of course I've seen uh let me solo her

723
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:15,040
oh yeah that yeah I've heard of that I haven't seen I I haven't looked at like the boss because I

724
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,200
don't know what boss it is it's probably like one of the hardest ones I know what that that that boss

725
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:26,960
I've seen art of that boss I have not actually seen the that boss looks like the fucking um digimon

726
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:33,360
yeah angel looks like angel woman angel angel woman yeah yeah she does millennia got the valkyrie

727
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:44,560
helmet yeah she looks great looks awesome uh yeah I'm um Elden Ring sounds really good uh

728
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,880
you said on twitter the other day that it makes it's like the feeling of exploring

729
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,000
world of warcraft yeah I that that was like oh that sounds cool that's a good way this that

730
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,440
that's an appealing way it it really does feel like because like I mean like old school world

731
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:07,520
of warcraft specifically because like in newer versions of world of warcraft the quests are

732
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:13,040
very railroad-y and like take you on a very specific path and there are lots of cutscenes and

733
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,800
and like like you feel like you're going through a theme park or a tour and it doesn't feel like a

734
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,880
big world that you're exploring but older world of warcraft quests they're just sort of like

735
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:28,320
it go here and do this and so for a lot of a lot of the gameplay of early world of warcraft you're

736
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:33,280
just sort of walking around and killing things and moving and killing things and looking around

737
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:37,680
and killing things and being like oh look at that building look at castle look at this it feels very

738
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,480
similar in Elden Ring because that's basically what you're doing you just you kill things because

739
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,840
they would kill you otherwise and you're just got you got a horse and you're just going

740
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:54,240
I watched um I think it was kind of an older video I watched the never knows best video

741
01:14:54,240 --> 01:15:02,800
about a Final Fantasy uh which one's the online one is it 14 14 yeah yeah and then I think I

742
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:10,080
watched an older video of his about it's just about MMOs like in general and um I think it was older

743
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:18,000
and uh he pointed something out that I hadn't really thought about but it's like um old like

744
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,120
if you were playing like playing MMOs now like people know how to play them like people have

745
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,400
there are guides you can read that will just explain to you like the the optimal way to level

746
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,760
up your character like if you were playing like when World of Warcraft came out like nobody

747
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,360
knew that and no guides existed and everyone was just figuring it out and fucking around

748
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:47,840
and I got it that sounds so much more fun than like look look up a guide that like tells you

749
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:53,680
like the optimum spell rotation I mean yeah that's definitely what happened with World of Warcraft

750
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:59,440
Classic when they brought that out because you got like thousands upon thousands of super veteran

751
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:05,040
players who couldn't wait to get back to reliving their early days in World of Warcraft but yeah

752
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:10,320
but you can never really do it again yeah the player base has changed so much that even if

753
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:16,720
all of the content is the same the way the game is played is completely different yeah like everybody

754
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,560
min-maxed everything like the the old game used to be unbalanced and so everybody was choosing the

755
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:29,680
correct like class and like spec thing to do the maximum damage and if you weren't if you didn't want

756
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:35,600
to play as that you would just die because the game was just not balanced for every class

757
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,480
back in the day so it would just suck if you didn't want to play like the optimal thing and

758
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,040
everybody was playing the optimal thing because they wanted to get all of the stuff as fast as

759
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:51,200
possible because they knew how and it's just like a lot of people didn't like it but I didn't mind

760
01:16:51,200 --> 01:17:00,160
because I never was good at World of Warcraft in terms of like high level rating or pvp I just

761
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:06,160
like the place so I was just walking around and I would I played for like a couple months with my

762
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:12,960
brother we had two torrents and we were just like I was a shaman and he was a warrior and we would just

763
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:20,080
like do little quests in little places and be like oh we're backing each other up it sounds

764
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:27,600
really fun I played I played I played a few months in the summer of Wrath of the Lich King

765
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,000
and I leveled up my character and I explored the world and I and I fucked around I didn't

766
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,480
play it that optimally I was just I was just fucking around that was just some way to do it

767
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,800
yeah I was just getting like I would get a staff and I would be like oh this staff looks really cool

768
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,480
it's not as good as that other staff but like I just really like how this one looks I'm gonna keep it

769
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:52,400
uh and uh uh and then I got to the end and I got a max level and I was like oh time to raid

770
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:59,600
and then I did a couple raids I was like oh this isn't fun at all I'm done game over by uh yeah

771
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:10,080
it's really weird how the raids like they step up the the skill floor requirements so high

772
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,320
from just playing the game solo or with a small group or just like casually going through it and

773
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:21,840
suddenly all of a sudden I'm getting yelled at for playing wrong yeah all of a sudden it's like

774
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:29,040
like the game hadn't really like set you up to do a raid no by the time you're able to do them

775
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:38,480
and it's like it's so I always remember like raiding being like a surefire way to feel like

776
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:44,800
shit and know that you need to do a lot of work before you're even close to being ready

777
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,560
and I'm like you know what I don't want to do a lot of work I'm not gonna do the raids and I never

778
01:18:50,560 --> 01:19:00,000
did yeah that was like um when I when I played League of Legends I played Warwick and I kind of

779
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,040
figured out how to play Warwick I was like yeah all right I'm sort of getting it and then my my

780
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,560
friends who I was playing with were like yeah good okay now you now you have to do that with

781
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,400
like every character because like uh you need you need to know how all your enemies are gonna

782
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,920
play too so you have to know every character you don't you don't have to do that with every

783
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,600
character that's ridiculous I mean they didn't I you know the point is they were saying like

784
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:32,320
I realized that like there was too much work to be done to be good at the game and you just

785
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:39,840
to have fun like if you want to like be like real good that's not fun fun is just

786
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,800
having like two or three characters who you're good at who you just specialize in and like yeah

787
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,240
you'll get to know how to do with other characters just by playing against them you don't have to

788
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:56,080
play a character to understand them like to like to play against them necessarily um I liked

789
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:06,800
I was the fucking I was like the the tentacle thing um I was Velcaz uh the hentai one whoa

790
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:17,040
Velcaz I remember uh this this fucking so to show it I always use this skin because it looks

791
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:24,160
real fucking sick I don't remember this guy at all uh he wasn't played very often um but like

792
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,600
you have to like do geometry and shit because he shoots out a thing and then it splits and

793
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,520
shoots off at a right angle so you have to like shoot your abilities diagonally to like

794
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:45,040
hit people um and stuff like that I I just had a lot of fun with him um all my like um I forget

795
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,880
what they're fucking called the the little the little things you do that give you a little

796
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,280
outside the game where you can like speck like for extra points of damage or whatever the fuck

797
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,920
forget what they're called your your skill tree or whatever the fuck I called that hentai supreme

798
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:09,520
um I was I just I was just always joking about tentakling people and they gave him a rework

799
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,520
that just made him really strong and then he was way overpowered and then they just kept

800
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,920
buffing him for years and years they just kept buffing him they never nerfed him ever because

801
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,680
for some reason he was unpopular but I I was fucking great at him and I would always be really

802
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:30,400
well um that's funny that sounds fun it is fun um I have like I don't know why I picked warwick

803
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,240
I didn't like think he looked cool or anything I think he just seemed simple I think someone

804
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:41,280
just told me he was like simple I was like okay well I'll do that then yeah yeah my best experience

805
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:46,720
I had with League of Legends was an experience I recorded it was the first time I played IRF

806
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,280
which is ultra rapid fire it's that April Fool's game mode where you can just all your

807
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,120
your cooldowns are basically nothing you can just spam everything and you have infinite mana

808
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:01,520
and it's just a clusterfuck my first round of that I fucking destroyed everything it was so much fun

809
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,000
and I never topped that again and then eventually I just stopped playing League unless it was IRF

810
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and then even then I stopped playing after a while and then Kai sold his account that was worth like

811
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:23,280
$10,000 and only got like 2k for it wow we both like hard quit about a year ago

812
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:29,280
yeah well I hadn't really been playing for a few years but um he still was but yeah he even

813
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:34,640
sold his account finally and we're fucking done with that shit no more League of Legends

814
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:42,080
yeah I realized it wasn't something I really wanted to sink a lot of time into it's just not

815
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:48,880
worth it it's just it's just frustrating it is just a frustrating experience most of the time

816
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:55,360
I had League of Legends and Clash of Clans are exactly the same thing I don't I don't have no idea

817
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,760
what Clash of Clans even is I've never seen it or played it or seen anything I just think of it

818
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:06,800
as like oh it's like vaguely medieval fantasy wacky to kill each people and it's like you play

819
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,520
on your phone and keep thinking of League of Legends as the one of those mobile games

820
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:20,240
I've just seen the little blonde viking guy yeah Clash of Clans is the screaming viking man whose

821
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:27,200
head is like somewhat square shaped I imagine it's like some kind of RTS sort of thing like you

822
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:32,080
control your your troops on a little field or something there's a lot of like RTS mobile games

823
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:37,680
and they could be a tower defense it's just sort of like I'll never play them yeah I'm offended

824
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,680
by the art style gives me the same vibes even though I have seen footage of it and I know that

825
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:48,000
it's like a game that has more to it it's just so like oh god you is that his hair or a helmet

826
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,880
it's his hair that doesn't look like that's just how hair looks in Clash of Clans Clash of Clans

827
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,800
is offensively unappealing that's a fucking playmobil hair that's fucking clip on playmobil

828
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:07,040
that's exactly right yeah something's weird it's his it's his eyebrows too his hair just becomes

829
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:15,760
his eyebrows I feel like it's deliberately I feel like it's yeah I feel like it's deliberately meant

830
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:23,280
to look like a helmet and hair at once I think we're falling for its trap they're trying to trip

831
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:31,680
you up speaking of marzipan uh I made I'm making gummies again I tried yeah I started

832
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:37,600
that again and I I had tried this before and the results had not been good but I gave it another

833
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,640
shot and it actually worked out pretty well it was using a corn fiber instead of isomolto

834
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:52,080
ligosaccharide oh my god isomolto licoficorica I'm also isomolgo ligosaccharide I think I think my

835
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:58,720
old approach was like stupid um because what I would do is I would take the fiber before it was

836
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:04,320
imo sometimes I would I would try I tried corn fiber and didn't work and I would take the fiber and

837
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,600
I would put it in water and I would cook it and I would reduce it down into a syrup and then I would

838
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:17,760
use the syrup to make gummies and I think that's just an unnecessary step and a step that can can

839
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,680
go wrong and that it like introduces like more uncertainty into the outcome this week I've

840
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,080
just been making little tiny batches and it's not even bothering to make the syrup I just put it all

841
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:33,040
in one I just put the water in the pan and then I just combine the ingredients right in the pan

842
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:39,120
make it all in one go and like it's fine it works fine and I'm taking notes I have a piece of paper

843
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,320
on my wall here that has all the different batch it has all the ingredient amounts scroll and there's

844
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:49,760
little red notes that like comparing like okay to make this one like I reduced the corn syrup like

845
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:56,560
this one I increased the gelatin or whatever um so I'm getting there I feel like I'm already like

846
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:04,240
pretty close to a to a to a pretty a pretty successful recipe I'm doing a little more

847
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:10,320
formulaic than I was last time uh and you know what the corn fiber corn fiber is way cheaper than

848
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:16,400
isomaltoligosaccharide ever was so if it works out with corn fiber then that's just it's just

849
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:27,360
better so fuck you china for not importing anymore that stuff yeah that's china's biggest mistake

850
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:34,160
I wouldn't say so yeah and I'm making and they're paying for it now they'll never get

851
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:41,920
so these are these are no longer keto gummies they're just gummies they're not keto well yeah

852
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,280
they're not keto I'm not focusing on the keto because I'm making them with I'm including

853
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:55,040
corn syrup and pectin but and pectin contains dextrose but my goal is to get them tasting good

854
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:01,920
and then I'm gonna try and like adjust the recipe as much as I can to get the sugar content down as

855
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,680
low as I can so like how can I do it with the least corn syrup and the least pectin

856
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,680
so they will hopefully be they will hopefully be low sugar they will probably not be no sugar

857
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:21,520
but we'll see I made a batch yesterday that was cherry flavor and I put too much of the

858
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:28,960
cherry flavoring in and it kind of burns my mouth when I eat it um but that's fine the consistency

859
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:38,480
is great it's it's awesome uh do you have like molds that you're pouring them into yeah well didn't

860
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:43,440
you didn't you ever see those pictures of the worms that I used to make oh yeah no I forgot that you

861
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:50,720
made yeah I have the worm molds I also have square molds but like those those make the squares that

862
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:56,160
they make or they're too big like I don't like biting into like a big rectangle of it and I also

863
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:02,560
have gummy bear molds but those are too small and they're too annoying like it's really gummy bears

864
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:09,120
though yeah it's just I don't I don't like how small they are I like to bite off the the tip of a

865
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:15,280
worm uh and they're also just hard to clean and like they're hard it's hard to like get the liquid

866
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:22,000
into the bear and you gotta put you gotta take a little eyedropper and put it in a one bear two

867
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,920
bear three bear and you gotta do that like like 40 times yeah yeah I guess if it's like yeah there's

868
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:33,920
a lot of them make it it's the making the because you've got to do it by hand the bears are annoying

869
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,800
the worms are like okay just do it like 12 just make like pouring it into 12 molds takes like

870
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:45,600
two minutes it's fine uh so I'm sticking sticking with worms uh for the time for the time being

871
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:56,000
uh so that's exciting that's very exciting I can't wait to potentially taste one I guess maybe

872
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,400
by the time you come visit I will have a recipe and maybe uh yeah well that's that's exciting

873
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,360
um I'll give I'll give everyone some at that thing that I'm not gonna say what it is

874
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:18,160
oh everyone who attends uh now I'm talking about attendance I feel like maybe I'm giving the game

875
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:25,040
away but I'm not gonna it's a wedding wedding if you are at a I'm gonna have a wedding at a bowling

876
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:34,080
alley um sure my my new project yeah my new you're gonna marry the bowling pin the sexy

879
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,640

880
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:58,480
had an unmarried president um yeah I guess so and think of and think of the tax breaks you know

881
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,520
imagine if you're filing filing jointly that's where the real money's at

882

imagine if your president had a dry penis couldn't possibly be my America I'm gonna vomit just

883
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:19,200
thinking about it mr president sir mr president sir the american people demand that you wet that

01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:47,120
having a wet pussy is a medical condition Jesus yeah did you have you uh seen uh you know that

888
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:54,560
movie don't look up nope you know I've heard I know all that I've heard my sister gave it a glowing

889
01:30:54,560 --> 01:31:00,080
review and then I saw your movie sucks shit all over it and I'm like I don't know this could go

890
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:05,920
ever way I didn't see any I had I had heard people talking about it on twitter my my dad

891
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:13,120
thought it was great and he got me to watch it uh over um I think it was a I think it was on my

892
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:17,600
birthday yeah it was one of my birthday when I went to give them he was like let's watch

893
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:27,280
don't look up it's great and I was like yeah all right sure and it was uh it was it's about um okay

894
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:35,440
it's about uh it's it's basically about what if a meteor was gonna hit the earth and the

895
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:41,440
what what would happen and the answer they come up with is we would all die because the Trump

896
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:48,320
administration is incompetent and they would they would bungle it and maybe that's true maybe

897
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:54,320
that's true but it's very it's very it's very like lib it's a very liberal movie and I mean that with

898
01:31:54,320 --> 01:32:02,240
a capital L I mean that in the pejorative sense um it's very but I don't know there's a part where

899
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:11,600
up just look at your phones Pokemon go to the polls uh it's it's very it's very like

900
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:19,120
zoomers these days are just zoom into the grave their speed running life that's a bit true it's

901
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:25,360
very much about like we just we need to we need to trust the scientists and like it's true it's

902
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:32,800
science is good science is good I kind of I kind of agree it's very smug about it um

903
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:41,120
but uh the the uh there's a part where the the who might my dad took a careful note to point out

904
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:47,120
to me like oh yeah this this is the Trump parallel this character is the done and I'm like yes I

905
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:53,840
understand I get it but Trump is a woman in this movie and there's a part where she like

906
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,880
starts smoking in the oval office and she's like you know they told me on the campaign trail I had

907
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:04,640
to quit smoking for my image but then you know there was like a candid some candid photos leaked

908
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:11,040
of me smoking so I just started smoking in public guess what happened my my ratings went up 53%

909
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:16,800
people love that I kept it real haha and it's and and I guess and I guess you you the viewer

910
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:23,200
are supposed to shake your head and go uh no decorum this administration has no decorum at all

911
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:33,120
it's true it is true it's it's hard it's it's rough because I I had to I had to agree with a lot of

912
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,480
of the points the movie was trying to make I had to be like yep that's true but it's it did have that

913
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:44,480
it did have this at the attitude of like if only like a 40 like a bit a bit hardy and a bit like

914
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:51,760
darn if only if only if only we didn't have this clown in the White House then we'd be we don't

915
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:57,280
we don't we trust the science and then we'd we'd all be we'd all be coming up put we'd all be

916
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:04,720
pushing up daisies no that's not what I meant um you know coming up millhouse it's all very much

917
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:10,960
like it's just because one singular bad actor is the president that's why we have all these problems

918
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,760
we need to unelect trump that was like half I mean you know it's also about like you know

919
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:25,200
capitalism bad you know fucking rich inventor weirdo elon musk bezos guy is also a problem

920
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:33,920
uh you know it was fine it was fine but yeah the I saw it got the movie got like glowing reviews

921
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:39,840
but then everyone I saw on twitter was like bitching about it and I saw like Ben you have to watch this

922
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:46,320
movie I'm like oh god I saw those the the title mean like don't look up is in like don't look up the

923
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:52,160
science like don't look it up on your it means it means it means don't look up at the sky because

924
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:57,520
there's a meteor that's gonna hit us for like double meaning like don't look it up like don't

925
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:03,120
don't bother because you don't do that you don't look up the science these days I think it's just

926
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:07,760
I don't know I think you're reading more into it than is actually I think it just means don't

927
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:15,440
look at the sky I I saw like my sister talked to me about the movie at length in a call and

928
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:22,240
gave gave it she gave it a really good sell and I'm like but in the back of mind I'm like yeah my

929
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,920
sister very different like taste in movies these days so I don't know um I saw your movie sucks

930
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,880
talk about and he was like like yeah like don't necessarily disagree with the message or anything

931
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:38,800
there's just a way it's it's very heavy-handed like very heavy-handed yeah and he showed off

932
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,760
some of the editing in the movie like the way they like show like wow ha ha internet ha ha memes

933
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:49,840
I'm out and like just shoving like shit in your face it's very boomer-esque oh yeah this is how

934
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:56,720
boomers see the internet like kind of thing yeah it was it was there's a yeah there's a whole part

935
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:02,880
it's like oh this the lady goes on a talk show and like freaks out about the meteor and it goes

936
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:08,320
viral and people make memes about her yeah it's very much like and it's just like draw a fucking

937
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:15,280
mustache on her whatever it's like well this is what memes are like right kids yeah yeah I'm cool

938
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:21,760
it was it was it was a boomer's idea of like oh something went viral and became a meme on the

939
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:29,120
internet that's for sure uh it's I I overlooked that I just I just was like yeah I get it yeah I get

940
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:34,640
it I get what it's trying I get what it's trying to convey to me I'll probably watch this on point

941
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:44,560
I'm curious because it's I am interested in BA's um so it's fine it's fine and it remind I mean the

942
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:50,560
first part where they were like doing astrophysics brought me back to my old college days in the

943
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:57,360
astronomy laboratory uh those those those and I thought damn I should have fucking I should have

944
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:02,320
stayed in academia and got my master's degree I should have fucking made something of myself

945
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,880
now just watch 60 symbols and deep sky videos and sigh and think this could have been me

946
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:17,200
I don't even know what that is oh it's um it's youtube channels um

947
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:22,880
have you have you seen those there's a lot of youtube channels that do this um number file

948
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:31,040
does this um like a lot there's that blonde guy brady harrin or harrish harrish something

949
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:35,440
that's the number guy of file guy yeah he he's just this he's just this he's like oh like he just

950
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,920
like he just interviews professors and asks them questions and like it goes on number file or it

951
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:46,800
goes on 60 symbols or it goes on deep sky or um there's the professor the chemistry professor guy

952
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:55,520
who has like the funny like white curly hair um but yeah um I'll just I'll just have a quick look

953
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:03,440
I'm not not super familiar they um they're just videos where they just go to a university

954
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:09,040
and they'll find like a cool professor and they'll just ask them a bunch of questions about like

955
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:15,280
a specific galaxy or a specific star or a specific black hole or something and they'll

956
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:19,200
just talk about it it's just interesting cool stuff and like they'll they'll show off like some

957
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:26,880
of the science that they personally did sometimes um and it's just I don't know I I like this content

958
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:35,120
this is my nerdy shit that I meant to um that's interesting no I haven't seen what what is the

959
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:44,720
M number stand for is that like a Messier Messier Messier Messier objects that's yeah Messier was a

960
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:51,120
guy who had a telescope 100 years maybe 200 years ago who just pointed at the sky and it's like these

961
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:57,840
are stars but this thing's blurry I don't know what the fuck this is is it a cloud is it a shroud

962
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,520
we'll never know and then some of those things turned out to be nebulous some of them turned out

963
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:09,280
to be galaxies um yeah or other stuff so did he number them yeah yes he he just made note he made

964
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:14,640
note of just a whole bunch of things in the sky that he didn't know what they were and then they

965
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:20,720
were the Messier objects and then people eventually figured out them and so now they're called like

966
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:29,600
oh m m 72 m 88 or whatever yeah oh yeah one is the the bode's galaxy or something such and said

967
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:35,200
the the kiwi fruit galaxy I've never seen that before yeah I guess I guess I have a neighbor I

968
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:39,760
guess if there's been oh wow like some of these videos are quite old yeah I don't upload super

969
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,640
frequently which is good I like subscribing to channels there's only so many Messier objects

970
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:50,320
Messier objects I'm not actually maybe you're maybe I'm saying it wrong Messier Messier

971
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:57,040
I don't know I I enjoy channels that make good content and upload not too frequently

972
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:04,960
because then my sub box is clear but there's only good stuff yeah I like I like a good channel

973
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:13,280
that uploads uh you know four times a year but each time it's like a big good video that I want to

974
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:26,080
watch yeah these videos are very chill they're like just comfy space is freaky I was a little

975
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:32,880
disappointed to look at my uh analytics I looked at my youtube analytics just yesterday

976
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:40,880
and I looked at the I looked at the the money I looked at the money that my videos make and I

977
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:49,600
I I compared them all and I figured out like a roughly they do all make about the same amount

978
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,520
of money like per view like give or take and it was way less than I thought it was like

979
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:02,880
less it was like less than a dollar per like 2000 views is what it worked out to

980
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:09,360
huh that's that's low I thought that was low I thought it was more like a dollar per thousand

981
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,320
no not so yeah your cpm is like around 50 cents or lower than

982
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:23,760
yeah I guess so my cpm when I was doing the my little pony animations on nightfall studios was

983
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:33,040
like 20 cents it was really bad like 5000 views would be a dollar um it wasn't great I remember

984
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:40,320
looking at my thing like not too long ago and it was higher than that it's different for everyone

985
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:48,640
but why does it change what what does it mean a huge portion is watch time um yeah channels that

986
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:54,800
like are advertiser friendly and have good watch time will get as high as five cpm like 10 times

987
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,600
what I had so like they could get like five dollars per thousand views rather than like 50 cents or

988
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:06,080
less um like so channels like mystery beast for example get ridiculously high cpm so they don't

989
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:12,560
not only do I get like tens of millions of views per video but they also get like really high money

990
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:20,080
per view more than other people it's fucked how dare they okay so I'm I'm looking at my

991
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:33,360
hypocrite channel and it says 645 6.45 dollars cpm your playback base cpm wait 6.4 it's not point

992
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:46,560
six dollars is your cpm six is that super high whoa my i don't know okay my playback based cpm

993
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:52,080
it's telling me it's like seven or eight yeah seven or eight dollars

994
01:42:53,920 --> 01:43:01,280
that's wait well that's that's really high then that's not that's not right if I feel like the

995
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,280
number is like a different type of number that it's showing us and not the one you were talking

996
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:12,480
about like it looks like maybe yeah like playback based cpm what is playback based I mean what is

997
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:18,560
excluding I'll hover over that thing it says playback based cpm means effective playback

998
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:25,280
based cost per mile and tells you how much advertisers paid per thousand monetized playbacks

999
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:30,560
oh for monetized playbacks so it doesn't count playbacks if it weren't monetized

1000
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:37,040
to calculate your playback based cpm the total revenue from ads is divided by estimated monetized

1001
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:42,720
playbacks an estimated monetized playback happens when a viewer sees at least one ad

1002
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:46,720
impression when watching one of your videos okay so that's like when you have an ad how

1003
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:53,040
much you get but so like for all the people using ad blocker that number goes down a lot oh okay so

1004
01:43:53,040 --> 01:44:01,520
it's seven or eight dollars per thousand times the ad was shown not times the video was viewed

1005
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:12,800
okay yeah I usually think of um so is that what rpm is okay so yeah yeah rpm oh yeah damn rpm means

1006
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:18,880
revenue per per mil and tells you how much you earned per thousand views which for me is still

1007
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:25,360
four dollars and ninety three cents which still is not right because uh I mean let me just uh pick

1008
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:31,840
out uh okay uh so literally ad blocker taking two ferd of my right two ferds of my revenue

1009
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:44,720
that's what this shows me that's uh son sonichu 102 advanced christary has almost 200 k views it has

1010
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:57,840
192 k views estimated revenue is just a little over a thousand dollars so that's did I do the math

1011
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:06,560
wrong am I stupid uh that's a certainty oh yeah I'm asking the wrong questions okay a thousand

1012
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:23,840
dollars divided by 200 that's by 200 000 is five point is zero point zero zero five so isn't it saying

1013
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:29,600
is it saying oh yeah did you divide the wrong number by the wrong number oh I should I should have been

1014
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:36,560
oh because it because it's because it's cost per mil revenue per mil so it should it should

1015
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:43,040
have been just divided by 200 no it says no it says mile it says mile not million yeah

1016
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:49,200
yeah but it means yeah but it means that means a thousand yeah okay so instead of dividing by 200

1017
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:58,240
thousand I should divide by 200 which gives me five dollars what am I wrong do I make five

1018
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:05,600
dollars per thousand views am I a genius of revenue I mean the it's a long video so the watch time is

1019
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:13,760
probably good huh right yeah looking at my my given gaming channel where I've been like posting streams

1020
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:23,680
playback based cpm is huge I guess because it's like a really long video yeah watch yeah I know

1021
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:32,560
watch time is wow okay I guess I miscalculated I guess I miscalculated and actually uh yeah for

1022
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:42,160
two 200 000 views I made a thousand dollars so that's actually for every for every 200 views

1023
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:51,760
for every 100 views I make half of yeah make fun yeah okay I guess it's five dollars per million

1024
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:58,880
cool uh it's still not it's still not enough I want more thanks

1025
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:10,400
I was actually looking at my my twitch um revenue uh recently and apparently I made like 70 bucks

1026
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:18,000
from just bit donations just people throwing bits I mean that's enough to pay for Elden Ring

1027
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,840
so I think that's a that's a good thing that's money well spent that's time well spent streaming that

1028
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:34,640
yeah I I don't really it seems like people be streaming these days what I mean it's true what I

1029
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:41,760
mean is that I see it feels like I see lots of people that are streamers and are making money at it

1030
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:48,960
like I that number has gone up and it makes me wonder if maybe I should have streamed more

1031
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,400
maybe I should have not quit streaming so much

1032
01:47:55,360 --> 01:48:03,200
uh sure I mean why not why not just go back and do some why not do some right now I don't know it

1033
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:11,920
sounds hard and I feel like I've got stuff to do I mean I also have stuff to do but I I

1034
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:18,240
dedicate like time to it but I think did I talk about like trying to schedule things last time

1035
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:25,520
I think I did like trying to schedule working on Pumpkin Alley Elden Ring streams and like Clarissa

1036
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:37,040
Gunsmoke stuff did I talk about that uh I think you did I think I remember I never a big talk

1037
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:45,520
about closer Gunsmoke on the last episode yeah and like I've I've cordoned off my my weekdays

1038
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:52,960
and like okay I'm gonna spend this day this amount of hours uh and this with this many breaks doing

1039
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:59,840
like work either Clarissa or Pumpkin Alley and then one day a week I can stream Elden Ring for like

1040
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:05,840
as long as I feel like I did the other day for like almost eight hours well I feel like eight

1041
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:12,480
hours is too long because I got very irritable near the end when I last and I said the game sucked

1042
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:22,800
and then I got really angry again and uh but yeah it's it's possible to do streams regularly

1043
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,480
and still make progress on other things it's just I'm sure I'm not sure it is not letting

1044
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:34,400
not letting your week get away from you if you if you keep track of like the time you're spending

1045
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:41,280
on any given thing and just like saying okay this is the day I try this and that so that every week

1046
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:54,320
you're getting a little bit of all of your projects done yeah I'm I just um it always feels like it

1047
01:49:54,320 --> 01:50:01,280
eats up my whole day whenever I stream I guess there's probably things ways I could mitigate that

1048
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:11,680
if I had discipline I mean I have I was just streaming for a while like whenever I felt like

1049
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:17,280
I have a few hours in a row I'll just stream now sometimes it was early in the morning sometimes

1050
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:25,120
it was late and uh it's not a smart idea if I want like viewers because people are awake

1051
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:30,640
at certain times and it's better if I stream at certain times I just couldn't be bothered to figure

1052
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:37,680
that out so I just turned it on I streamed for a bit and people who showed up had a fun time

1053
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:45,120
and I stopped and it's like it's not the way to build a streaming empire exactly I maxed out at

1054
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:53,360
like nine viewers and it's like not a big thing but you know it's fun so and it's it's basically

1055
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:59,600
the same as if I was not streaming because I'm just playing the game and occasionally speaking

1056
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:06,640
I'm saying funny jokes and it's fun hanging out with the chat it's like it's not like a tedious

1057
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:11,760
work sort of thing maybe I should have maybe I should have streamed more of the time I was playing

1058
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:18,720
Noida or playing Hades maybe I should stream some Hades sometime yeah you could do that I could do

1059
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:26,960
that I feel like I always say maybe I should do such and such and then I never do it I feel stupid

1060
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:32,880
even suggesting that I might do something because of course I won't I mean maybe you feel more

1061
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:41,200
pressure to like perform as a streamer than I do yeah maybe I don't know maybe I feel like sometimes

1062
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:50,400
I'm a little too lax and I don't try to make it like a show and so like people often say that my

1063
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:56,240
streams are like really like chill and comforting in a way that they can just sort of have it in

1064
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:01,840
the background which is nice but it definitely means that I'm not like exciting I'm not like an

1065
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:15,520
exciting streamer what I know how I am I haven't streamed enough to figure out what I'm like

1066
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:23,920
generally yeah I think I saw your one where you played our games I think that's the only

1067
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:29,040
live stream of yours that I've that I've caught I've barely live streamed in my life so that

1068
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:38,000
makes sense okay nice for me like I need people with me on my own I feel like I would just be

1069
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,440
boring as fuck having people with you to like like one person playing the game and one person

1070
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:49,840
respond to chat is a is a good it's not always feasible but it's a good formula it's yeah it's

1071
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:55,840
it's I feel I feel very at ease when we're doing like a heckles for shackles shackles for heckles

1072
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:02,400
thing yeah yeah or it's just sort of like we're just hanging out in the minecraft server and sort

1073
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,960
of kind of I'm kind of mining but I'm not on screen so I don't have to worry about my screen

1074
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:15,600
being like entertaining I just talk for sure jokes for sure yeah it is you it is it is a good time

1075
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:27,440
I just just getting myself in the I have a big it's real it's real work for me to like psych

1076
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:34,960
myself up and like get myself in the the attitude of like I'm going to stream I'm going to do something

1077
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:40,560
even though it's like stupid and like what is what I'm actually doing is something that is not

1078
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,320
difficult at all

1079
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:56,480
yeah I don't know I feel like I have had that before I think I I just sort of I get over it or have

1080
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:01,760
gotten over it because it doesn't really happen anymore by just like setting getting it live

1081
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:08,800
before I really think about it it's like okay I'm live uh well I'm doing it now

1082
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:16,560
and then I just do it that's right it's the same way like sending emails like if I look at the email

1083
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:20,880
and it's like this isn't good they're gonna think I'm an idiot

1084
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:27,200
I won't send it but if I just send it before it's ready then it was ready the whole time

1085
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:33,520
it's not a problem I know what you mean

1086
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:43,840
and yet I don't it's it's it's it's it's it's it's jumping into like a Dark Souls boss

1087
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:52,160
before you've considered whether it was a good idea to do that it's it's it's just it's the do it

1088
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:59,280
the fucking do it thing bad idea or not like the no brain head empty sort of approach

1089
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,680
because it's it's a good way to get started on something

1090
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:10,000
I like the approach I do it often as much as I can because I often overthink things to

1091
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:18,080
ridiculous degrees it's a very uh paralyzing mindset where I'm like well I'm not ready yet so

1092
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:25,600
but then if I just fucking do something without thinking no knowing that it is probably a bad

1093
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:33,920
idea just head empty do it um it works out because I was underestimating myself usually

1094
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:39,040
yep

1095
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:47,040
I haven't learned anything I didn't learn anything you just got to utilize your

1096
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:56,400
COVID brain fog he's gonna make it work for me yeah yeah hmm uh I I just um

1097
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:03,520
whoa excuse me the cat the cat has been screaming it's probably picked up on the audio

1098
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,720
the discord won't be picking it up but it'll be in the recording probably

1099
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:13,120
I think good is for it's her food time I'm going to feed the cat and be right back wow okay

1100
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:23,680
excellent um uh hold on I'm messaging a guy about I'm messaging a guy about the dojin

1101
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:28,880
and uh I think he seems too expensive

1102
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:37,760
oh right yeah you you had that list of potential other people I found three

1103
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:46,880
dudes I think they're dudes on uh on uh tapas and I thought maybe one of these guys could do

1104
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:52,720
the rest because I think it's been waiting a while for kaiju I think that's that's probably not

1105
01:56:52,720 --> 01:57:00,800
gonna happen so uh I just I just got a response back from this one guy and he he gave me his

1106
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:09,520
rates page and uh the rates page seems to imply that he might want to charge like $100 per page

1107
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:18,000
and that's a lot and I don't know if I am willing to pay that much honestly how many pages is this

1108
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:27,440
the thing um there are 13 pages and a cover to be to be drawn I think it's something like that

1109
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:37,760
that's more than the other guys wanted so I mean I feel like a hundred bucks a pay I mean if it's

1110
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:45,360
really good like I I glanced at the people you you you posted I didn't really look too close

1111
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:54,320
yeah 100 bucks for a whole page it's not insane no I don't think it's like a terrible

1112
01:57:55,040 --> 01:58:01,840
option but I I don't know what we budget we have all the other guys that I asked

1113
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:12,240
said they would who do we ask that we asked um michi and uh kaiju and ed and they all said

1114
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:19,440
that their rates were significantly below that so I don't know what what makes this guy think he's

1115
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:28,560
so fucking special that's mean um but I don't know it's just uh it doesn't seem like a very cost

1116
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:34,880
effective option none of these guys were a perfect match I was disappointed that I just can't it's

1117
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:42,560
it's I can't find I can't find anyone who draws quite in this particular way

1118
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:52,720
it's I guess that's normal I guess no no two are like uh yeah but it's like it's sort of a popular

1119
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:59,200
ish I look at it yeah sort of thing like it doesn't look people would want to try like that it doesn't

1120
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:05,680
look too unusual like it doesn't look like something that I've never seen before and yet

1121
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:14,080
I cannot find anyone who whom who matches it and I I don't know what's I don't know what's going on

1122
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:19,840
with that well give me a give me a few years I'll go to anime school and I'll figure out how to draw

1123
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:30,000
like that I just uh you know I got I got I got half of it drawn by that guy curse him

1124
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:36,640
and now it's like well I can't just I can't just throw these out and not use them and just like

1125
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:41,840
pay someone else to do it from scratch like I I can't I can't bring myself to do that

1126
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:47,920
can I can I see like what the art looks like a little bit yeah I want to show

1127
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:55,200
sure sure sure please a brilliant full heck I'll post it you have you have the connections you're

1128
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:01,840
you're the art like I spider I can't think of what what the art like you got all of the lines

1129
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:09,040
connecting all the people I did not I did not ask Mary whether I forgot to do that I instead

1130
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:13,840
I went on tapas and just tried to like look through like recent posts to like see oh that's

1131
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:22,160
gonna be harder I know but I wanted to here these are what these are what the existing pages look

1132
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:31,840
like whoa yeah it's so kawaii it's pretty kawaii damn I like it I guess it's pretty good paint

1133
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:38,880
no this was not drawn by never paint this was written by never paint okay I see I was gonna say

1134
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:46,880
that everything's already written yeah and and it's just the drawing yeah it was never paint

1135
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:53,040
aura barista and chip wiseman I yeah we're the three they wrote the scripts for it for these

1136
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:03,200
chip is a wiseman it's true yeah so so this is what I'm looking for and I just it's it's proved

1137
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:13,040
surprisingly hard to find some of the draws quite like it there was one I found one a furry comic

1138
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:19,280
artist who was a little bit similar but I they're like they have like a kind of big patron and I

1139
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:24,000
was like this person is not gonna yeah this person is going to charge too much this person's

1140
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,720
gonna cost this is gonna be expensive because they're like an edgy they're like an edgy

1141
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:37,200
artist and I'm sure they charge out the wazoo for that shit I follow like I don't want artists who

1142
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:45,200
sort of has a manga-ish style it's not the same as visfo yeah they also draw boobs

1143
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:53,680
well they link to a capacitive page with the links broken so oh bummer

1144
02:01:55,200 --> 02:02:01,840
I don't know what's up with that at this point I'm like I'm not gonna find a perfect match

1145
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:09,520
so I don't know I'm just trying to do the best I can find something find somebody

1146
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,000
man whatever

1147
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:20,160
yeah this artist is like the closest I got out of the people I follow and yeah I don't know how

1148
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:23,600
well it would work I mean they're not like they don't let me I don't get the impression they're

1149
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:34,720
making mega monies but I don't see a patreon okay they have 30,000 followers which is in a crazy

1150
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:42,400
amount it's a lot though and this is good this is like it could fit very well into what we already

1151
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:50,640
have this is it's it's yeah I mean it's not exactly the same but it's not much further off than the

1152
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:57,680
ones that I had picked out on tapas so I might actually might actually ask this this person

1153
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:03,520
are they on twitter yeah I leave my twitter was their twitter as well I have a lot more art on

1154
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:13,120
twitter I think the question is can you convince them to draw something other than massive tits

1155
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,760
yeah these are these are not these are not what we're looking for for this particular

1156
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:23,200
project

1157
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:36,160
I mean we all have to make sacrifices the boobs did just get bigger in the second half

1158
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:42,720
and explicitly yeah yeah I'm not I'm not sure turn the page completely different I'm not I'm not

1159
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:48,480
sure if they'd be interested in uh in what I'm asking them to do here also yeah they're tapas link

1160
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:56,320
oh it's it cuts off into a dot dot dot and the link it's just like it's just broken that blows

1161
02:03:57,120 --> 02:04:03,200
you should uh would it not work to google their name or search in tapas it probably it probably would

1162
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:09,680
oh I found it right I I found the link I use google I assume what's w I'm assuming it said

1163
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:15,840
what's up and the character's called marina and from that I was able to find it yeah well they

1164
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:22,960
they should fix their link what's the fuck up they should fix their link for real

1165
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:33,120
I think I think I have a feeling that this person probably has more lucrative things to be doing

1166
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:39,840
but maybe I'll ask but maybe I'll ask I don't see a patreon maybe if you maybe money if you just

1167
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:49,680
wave it at them couldn't hurt hmm yeah I couldn't hurt to ask yeah this is pretty I would say this

1168
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:56,560
is close enough but it's worth asking uh this other guy this other guy mo I don't know if I want to

1169
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:06,800
pay a hundred dollars a page that's just yeah okay well that's uh that's one thing I was uh

1170
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:13,760
that's yet another struggle I've been having this week add it to the pile

1171
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:24,080
um all right I don't know just like in pokemon when you struggle you hurt yourself exactly

1172
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:33,040
uh I think I'm out I'm out of things to say and voice voice fail time voice

1173
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:41,200
voice fail time if you're if you're ready uh well I guess I don't really have anything to say

1174
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:45,520
I just wanted to mention Clarissa Gunsmoke because I just like her dude she's so cute

1175
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:54,000
I gotta draw her big old teddies one day oh my god wait please do and a big fucking hat

1176
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:59,120
I don't think she has big fucking hat does she have she's not big old teddies does she

1177
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:06,320
no no she she's moderately sized that's what I thought that's what I thought we'll explain

1178
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:10,640
it she shoots her gun too hard and it makes her boobs just get bigger like inexplicably sure

1179
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:18,320
that makes why not she just gets so shocked her tits go boinga that makes that makes sense to me

1180
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:23,520
there's an argument in big booby mommy milkers over something like that I posted an image where

1181
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,640
that happened someone it was I just found some abreast expansion comic where someone fired a gun

1182
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:35,680
and their boobs just became huge instantly yeah I didn't understand the context the context of like

1183
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:42,720
how it worked it seemed like they were so surprised the loud sound that their boobs got expanded yeah

1184
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:48,880
sure just whatever just startle if if if your woman's too small just startle her

1185
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,440
uh that's all it takes

1186
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:59,600
uh okay as far as I know that's true a bunch of ghosts up in your house give

1187
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,480
a little little cardboard cutouts of ghosts you'll never see it coming you'll

1188
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:12,480
but but you'll achieve your dreams true yes I'll I'll draw more load of ghosts and be scared at every

1189
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:17,120
panel I wish like freak myself out

1190
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:22,640
the arguments that happen in big booby mommy milkers are really funny

1191
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:27,920
because they're never like serious it's just like it's it's almost always entirely cosme because

1192
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:35,280
we're just is like is a is a is a stick in the mud a grump who's always moaning about whatever

1193
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:41,600
image people are excited about it's like that doesn't make sense oh it's like samus with big boobs

1194
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:47,920
samus doesn't have big boobs you can't do that it's like right you can't you can't and it's true you

1195
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:54,640
can't you can't we love them though that's pretty funny um but but they'll they'll also like contradict

1196
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:59,760
themselves because like later on they'll be like an image what they do like I never I can't read

1197
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:08,320
them I can't understand them I hope they're having a good time though uh you know what

1198
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:13,280
you know what yeah glad they're having a good time glad everybody's having fun keeping it funny

1199
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:19,840
um we're just being funny do you want to do the do the first voicemail sure

1200
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,680
okay let me let me let me get it here there is not an unreasonable amount uh this week there's a

1201
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:35,120
normal amount um finally finally uh let me see here

1202
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:45,200

1203
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:55,280
oh they're all out of order no you know I I found myself saying oh my god with like that accent

1204
02:08:55,280 --> 02:09:01,280
once and I'm like oh shit this is too much I'm losing all my britishisms I'm losing my accent

1205
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:09,280
like like entirely I should not ever say god is that an american thing well it's just like to

1206
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:16,080
to say god but with an ah instead of an oh oh I guess I just don't even think about it oh yeah

1207
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:26,240
this is it oh my god oh my oh my god oh my god e-gads e-gads it's uh professor e-gads like I just

1208
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:35,920
felt so I felt so dirty hearing an american come out of my mouth uh you'd rather have an american

1209
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:44,720
come in your mouth oh i was saying only if she's got only if she's got big balls and it has to be a woman

1210
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:55,760
okay true all right the first voicemail I posted it there it's called Gib should do a page two

1211
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:05,200
three two one go hello I just read the ben sink drawn tales gets troll page and I just want to

1212
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:13,200
call in to say it is really cool really good very awesome a lot of great arts thank you I especially

1213
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:21,520
love the piece of art of the devil sitting on his like a rocky throne and like fire all around him

1214
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:29,040
yeah fucking sick that was that was the piece job and the resistance uh yeah I uh put a lot of work

1215
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:34,960
put a lot of work on the page and I liked how it came out uh well the title is linked in the last

1216
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:41,920
episode I think they put it in the description all right I I assumed it was I thought it was I mean

1217
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:47,760
maybe it was on twitter you tweeted about it wait I'm sure now now I'm gonna hold on hold on maybe

1218
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:52,080
you did I might I didn't finish listening to that episode yet I got like most of the way through

1219
02:10:52,080 --> 02:11:02,160
I think I put it in the show notes hold on in any event now I gotta in any event the uh I I don't

1220
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:10,000
know whether I would be good for drawing uh tales gets trolled mostly because I'm not caught up

1221
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:16,880
I had to I had to catch up yeah I have to catch up oh yeah it's the first link and I feel I mean

1222
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:25,440
I I wouldn't be I wouldn't say no but I feel like the I don't know I think me being friends with Ben

1223
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:33,280
is not necessarily a way in to that um I don't know I think I think it went live without the link

1224
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:42,240
and then I quickly added it um maybe give I'll be honest they didn't I knew going in that they

1225
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:50,320
weren't gonna pay me that much like frankly they they didn't they didn't pay me uh enough to compensate

1226
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:57,040
for the amount of work that I put into that page but caveat is that I didn't really expect them to

1227
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:03,600
like oh yeah it's not a money thing I knew what I would be cool to do it I guess I just I guess I

1228
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:08,800
don't really put myself out there for these sorts of things too often oh if you I would I would feel

1229
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:17,440
weird to be like oh what if I draw like um de-whelmingly well if you wanted to you could ask Cece and uh

1230
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:25,520
I suppose I could um but that's but that's up to you oh oh you know actually on that subject uh

1231
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:35,200
funny drama happened in the tales gets trolled server oh yeah I saw a tweet from Cece on the

1232
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:39,120
the tales gets trolled thing I didn't know what it was about somebody had left it's um

1233
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:48,160
it's but yeah okay so laserbot is the guy but also embergram embergram is laserbots older brother

1234
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:55,120
and they basically wrote the story together and their younger brother shomo is also involved

1235
02:12:56,160 --> 02:13:01,840
but so they have us an outline they have an outline that the two the two of them came up with

1236
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:08,240
an embergram's job has been to go through the outline and make actually write out like the

1237
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:17,840
individual scripts for each page like I was given a craig like I was given a script that was written

1238
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:27,280
by embergram and told like make this into a page please um and so embergram had I don't know he got

1239
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:33,520
upset about something I guess someone was criticizing his like the way that he lays

1240
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:39,520
fucking fuck off craig I guess the the way that he the way that he lays his his scripts out because

1241
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:44,880
he does like format them very weirdly I was able to figure it out but he got mad at someone maybe

1242
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:52,720
laserbot like criticizing the way that he lays out his scripts he wanted to be able to kick people

1243
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:59,360
from the server for talking back to him or whatever CC would not give him permission to do that

1244
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:07,120
and so embergram like quit in a huff he's like I'm out I'm leaving the project and uh which is a

1245
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:14,240
bummer uh because he did have a bunch of there were a bunch of like plot ideas that he had come up with

1246
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:21,600
that he hadn't told anyone so no yeah so this it might affect the story a bit which is sad

1247
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:27,200
he might you know laser bothers though they are brothers laserbot left before and then he came

1248
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:32,960
back so I mean maybe embergram can be convinced to come back but I think for now uh laserbot and

1249
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:38,800
maybe shomo are doing the scripts now I'm not really sure what they're gonna do but someone's

1250
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:44,160
gotta have to do that but so yeah there was this whole stupid like fallout thing embergram

1251
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:49,680
I think laser embergram left and then laserbot left but I think laserbot he's not really gone

1252
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:58,080
he just left the server like in solidarity or something I don't know um those guys are pretty

1253
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:06,320
funny well definitely cool reading this page as I'm as I'm scrolling down towards for satan but

1254
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:11,840
the embers are rising up and it feels almost animated as I read it thank you very much

1255
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:16,320
yeah I thought it was an animation for a second they're like whoa the embers are going up

1256
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:22,640
and I know that's just me scrolling oh I see yeah yeah you kind of descend you kind of descend

1257
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:28,320
down into the darkness and as you scroll down with more embers kind of start yeah that's cool

1258
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:38,320
wafting upwards good yeah thank you um I liked uh I liked I liked uh drawing it I had fun with it

1259
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:46,400
and then um yeah maybe maybe I'll do another one at some point it was a lot of work so I wouldn't

1260
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:52,960
do one all the time but uh they gave me they gave me a little more than they usually pay

1261
02:15:53,920 --> 02:16:00,240
because I they gave they they gave um they gave me a little extra like apparently they also gave

1262
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:07,680
some extra to uh what are the guy the guy Rocco and uh Robonod I think the other some two other

1263
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:14,320
artists who like did like really fancy work they gave me the fancy the fancy rate so I

1264
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:21,520
appreciated that oh that's nice yeah um you're a fancy boy cc thank thank you cc appreciate it

1265
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:27,920
okay anyway let's uh let's get the next one here uh

1266
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:38,960
the next voicemail is called uh killer prints 9 30 there it is okay three two one go

1267
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:47,760
so I've been watching the layer half of the body cast on the top land the arc and it's

1268
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:53,920
been kind of frustrating as I disagree with most of what Gib and Nate say as you will read weekly

1269
02:16:53,920 --> 02:17:05,200
and fan subs fan subs yeah it's kind of retired I mean still the please don't cancel me

1270
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:09,840
well what's the disagree he didn't even say what the disagreement was

1271
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:19,200
yeah it was what did you mention about one piece he said he said the something land arc

1272
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:24,240
he said he disagreed with a lot of what you were saying as he was reading

1273
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:32,400
scan lations maybe he was just disagreeing with the reading of scan lations instead of the official

1274
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:39,760
he just said he disagreed with you but he didn't he didn't elaborate uh all right the next one is

1275
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:47,920
a question top 10 voicemail characters um uh I think there's conflict of interest with me I won't

1276
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:54,880
give my answers I mean I'll wait wait wait no this is this is not uh this is not don't listen to that

1277
02:17:54,880 --> 02:18:01,200
one that's the next voicemail um top 10 voicemail I mean I would have to give it to them I'd have

1278
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:07,520
to give it to them I'd have to give it to them snakes yeah okay cringis bingus I guess I would say

1279
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:14,480
the samurai is a classic of course um that's three I'm not really putting them in order I was just

1280
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:23,280
trying to think of 10 because like uh there's a lot but like I don't remember oh yeah my ass batman

1281
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:30,720
oh yeah oh sure yeah riddle my ass batman haven't heard from him in a while um ever ever since I saw

1282
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:39,200
him in real life yeah he's he's changed from a voicemail into a person yeah that's true um

1283
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:46,800
I'm trying to I'm trying I feel there's probably I probably feel bad later someone will point out

1284
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:53,520
to me a bunch of really obvious choices that didn't jump to mine immediately I mean uh I guess I could

1285
02:18:53,520 --> 02:19:01,680
like give my top five that aren't me and then my own like five that I enjoyed the most that I made

1286
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:08,080
to avoid bias spotting I do yeah please whoever the fuck I don't even know if this counts as a

1287
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:13,760
character the guy who sends in like fucking songs every other week that guy fucking rules yeah I

1288
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:19,840
consider him I consider him like just a person I wasn't thinking of him as a character but yeah yeah

1289
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:28,000
riddle my ass batman was pretty funny I'm trying the samurai definitely I like the samurai yeah

1290
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:34,800
at all the whole arc yeah um it's hard for me to think of characters because most of the ones I

1291
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:43,360
think I made yeah um uh were you the entire league of night fuckers or was that multiple

1292
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:50,160
I was most of them um initially like I started sending them in less and I eventually I stopped

1293
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:55,840
but other people kept sending them in I like stopped right before you started skipping them um

1294
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:02,800
so that worked out for me none of mine got skipped wait we started skipping them

1295
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:08,640
yeah the joke was just they were just they were just loud and they were just like loud and like

1296
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:14,640
breathing and like yeah like people would just call in and like hello I'm the the butt wizard uh I

1297
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:20,880
have riddles free which PCP do I want to pee or in or some shit and you're just like to be like

1298
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:25,680
yeah this is a night fucker I don't fucking care you just turn it off that's right that's right

1299
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:31,280
that's right I mean me and far as like created like a formula that was too easy to emulate

1300
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:38,240
and everyone was just no one was innovating um that's right you gotta you gotta iterate right

1301
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:46,480
progress it's about progress um I guess I'm glad you mentioned Ben snakes if he were alive he would

1302
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:56,640
be very grateful fuck I'm a standard him a shit uh Ben snakes is my top number one for sure there's

1303
02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:03,920
no there's no question um I'm gonna put the voice filter on for that uh audience will hear it

1304
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:09,280
all right well guess what if I didn't name you then your character sucks and I don't even remember

1305
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:16,480
it so fuck you my favorite characters I've done uh aside I guess like I like them snakes obviously

1306
02:21:16,480 --> 02:21:21,600
I like close to my kitchen I does it count if it's like a character I made that I had someone else

1307
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,880
voice like I wrote a script and directed them I don't know well sure it still counts as a thing

1308
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:32,400
you can choose lost tapes archive is my favorite thing in general I've done because I just like

1309
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:40,800
how surreal it is and like those were so weird I was so like confused and they felt so mysterious

1310
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:45,200
because I had no idea who was doing it and they were so like sporadic it would just be suddenly

1311
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:52,000
a new tape and I guess I guess that is like what the fuck is that I guess that is a character

1312
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:58,160
yeah I mean like the tapekeeper is the character so like he was played by four eyes but like I

1313
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:04,960
you know scripted him sort of how did you do all of them like all of the PCP members I didn't get

1314
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:12,480
to I wanted to but like um I my work was fucking me up after a while um of pencilmation and then

1315
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:20,320
people really ruined everything and then people started leaving the podcast so I had I had one

1316
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:27,120
planned for you Gib I had one for Jesse I was waiting for mine yeah I I had a few different ideas for

1317
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:36,000
you um uh I don't know it's maybe maybe I would have um I probably maybe I would have gone with the

1318
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,080
the Ann Moon Anions thing that I ended up doing into a Nate fucker maybe it would have been something

1319
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:47,600
like that um mainly Moon Anions and the Moon Anions I fucking love that video so much um

1320
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:54,320
ah what was I what was it Moon Anions are the mainly Moon Anions are the main aliens we finding

1321
02:22:54,320 --> 02:23:03,360
shall be yeah woasts uh great that was that was fun I love the classic Gib content um rare characters

1322
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:09,360
ones that I don't think I've mentioned uh double double Satan Satan um that almost became like a

1323
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:19,120
series um I I don't I have the vaguest recollection it's like hello hello I I am am double double

1324
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:24,560
Satan Satan he just says every word twice um and then he likes he says fuck you Ben because

1325
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:31,200
every voicemail character hates Ben that's like that's just the meta I guess um yeah sure and I

1326
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:37,120
was gonna continue it to where he like interviews triple Satan and then um Infinity Jesus um and

1327
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:41,520
like triple Joker would like be in the background and like just a bunch of like characters or like

1328
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:47,680
1.5 um like Buddha or something that's a pretty good that's a pretty good bit I would have been

1329
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:54,080
pretty yeah yeah I had a bunch of ideas um I do I do recall but I think you just made like one

1330
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:58,800
double satan email yeah there was only yeah there's only ever one I'm gonna do just an anomaly

1331
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:03,360
yeah so like there's gonna be the Vemsnakes compilation the Lost Tapes compilation cluster

1332
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:08,480
pun kitchen compilation then there'll be a general Nate fucker compilation which I'm gonna

1333
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:13,920
include other people's as well or at least the ones I think are good but mostly or maybe maybe

1334
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,240
I'll do all of mine and then like other people's or something I don't know and then maybe a

1335
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:22,960
miscellaneous there was one I wanted to do Morph as well which was the audio demon I think I did

1336
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:29,200
one of those in 2019 back when I was editing the podcast it's the the goal for that one

1337
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:34,720
is that I would like put a voice effect on a random pcp member um so I cursed Ben St with

1338
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:40,480
flanger and your voice was like for like a minute after the voicemail ended

1339
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:49,280
uh I see I see uh wait did I not listen back to that one so I never heard that

1340
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:54,720
possibly it was it was oh no it was in 2019 I'm sure I could find it um I mean if I do a compilation

1341
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:59,280
I'm with the compilation I'm debating do I just have the raw audio or do I have like

1342
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:05,280
from the pcp everyone's reactions um maybe I'll do both I don't know that's more work

1343
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:11,760
yeah maybe for that one I'll do it since like that like your everyone's reaction was part of

1344
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:18,000
the voicemail like that was like the point um but yeah I was gonna do a bunch like I'd call in

1345
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,480
someone gets incomprehensible reverb where I put reverb on their voice and then I delete the dry

1346
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:28,160
track so you just hear like faint echoing and shit um you can't understand that I was gonna

1347
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:34,560
do like a bunch but then um I was close to when I stopped editing so I'm like well if I I'm not

1348
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:39,520
the editor of this bit doesn't really work you can't do anything yeah I mean like I could trust

1349
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:44,480
I could maybe hope that the person editing does a good job but like they probably wouldn't do it

1350
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:51,360
the way I think would be funniest because I'm very picky right right true yeah it's tough uh it's

1351
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:57,200
tough one it's tough bit I guess the best if I had to pick requires a true the touch of a true

1352
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:03,200
artist I think to make it if I narrowing it all down if I had to pick the one voicemail out of

1353
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:10,640
all the things I've done that I think on its own is the best it's really tough but I think this the

1354
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:22,480
smeagle Nate fucker voicemail really it it's just so yeah I mean it's yeah it's just so

1355
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:29,520
comfortable and the impression that 4a's did was too fucking good it was variant yeah that's

1356
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:35,360
that's the word I can't really remember like this I can I remember like I remember being

1357
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:41,760
Nate fucker's generally viscerally uncomfortable no I remember the smeagle one as being like viscerally

1358
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:52,080
unsettling describes in in great detail what he's gonna do yeah it just it just sounds like it's

1359
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:58,800
straight out of the fucking movie because I put like ambience and like I found like soundtrack

1360
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:05,120
from the film to like work of it and everything could you could you put like could you edit like

1361
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:15,360
clips of the film so that it's that it looks like he's saying it oh god uh oh maybe geez like maybe

1362
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:19,840
it could as like a standalone thing for any figure compilation I'm probably gonna like commission

1363
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:25,680
unless I drop myself like an artist to show like Nate like like running away from like this this

1364
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:34,400
this like army of like unspeakable creatures and he's just running like with fear in his eyes

1365
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:43,840
or in his sunglasses I love that those were those were some that was some fucked up some fucked up

1366
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:50,960
shit once the compilations out I'm gonna force Nate to do a video where he listens to it

1367
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:57,760
you should force Nate to do that absolutely uh he needs to be he needs to be whipped into shape

1368
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:07,200
and he needs to be held accountable uh okay uh yeah I'm sorry I can't I can't even think of 10

1369
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:11,200
I can't think of 10 maybe between us even with my own I can't think of 10 I can think of like

1370
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:18,400
yeah five or six uh turns out that there's not that many good voicemailers oh no voicemails

1371
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:25,200
were bad all maybe just not memorable enough yeah um my individual voicemails can be good

1372
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:31,440
not one character is not as as frequent yeah what ones that I can like pick out and remember

1373
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:37,200
and name them and be like oh yeah that that guy I remember that specific character oh Tommy Jay

1374
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:43,040
I love that character Tommy Jay baby oh that guy who wouldn't stop voicemailing and I

1375
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:48,160
went in the voice jail everyone in the voice jail is my favorite uh favorite character

1376
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:55,680
next voicemail is called uh wait sorry did we skip this one no yeah we sorry yeah play the one

1377

1378
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:11,920
chats and they have like mixed song rules man except for all the verses thanks man I agree

1379
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:20,880
Tom got all the non-rap parts and everyone's like oh wow Tom can actually sing I could

1380
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:27,920
song they made me rap they forced me to rap it's not fair oh yours was like the 90s rap

1381
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:36,080
sort of section mine it was funny mine mine sucked I knew it sucked it was fine uh it's okay I didn't

1382
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:41,440
write it and if I did I would have made it bad on purpose so it would still be okay I don't remember

1383
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:49,600
the lyrics but my heart tells me it was hello Brad you are bad and or so wait wait oh okay

1384
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:54,320
I saw a comment on Kiwi Farms the other day that actually made me really laugh

1385
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:02,640
it the guy he was he was mocking my verse he said that I sucked and like yeah true but he

1386
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:10,080
but he he he was to make fun of to make fun of my rapping style he he like made up like oh

1387
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:17,440
Ben St sounds like this and then he he he wrote a line and the line was like um wait it was uh

1388
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:23,920
uh my name is Ben St and I'm here to say property is theft and traps aren't gay

1389
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:31,920
like yeah true I wish I wish I could write that myself

1390
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:43,760
but I can't because I'm too stupid uh so loved it well liking liking men is straight okay I mean

1391
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:49,760
if if if that's you know I agree I uh if you read this you're a woman now

1392
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:56,880
property property is theft uh it's a theft from the commons it's just belongs private property

1393
02:30:56,880 --> 02:31:03,040
belongs to to is the is should be exist for the benefit of all and that's distinct from personal

1394
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:08,800
property by the way uh but we can we can get into that later oh people people don't know

1395
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:15,600
but there's a distinction I didn't know there was a distinction yeah yeah I didn't realize um and

1396
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:20,320
then I I don't know so I saw someone explain it and I was like oh okay yeah when when Mark

1397
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:28,320
talks about private property he's talking about like factories farmland so on not like clothes

1398
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:37,760
your house it's like my microwave right uh but it's easy to dunk it's easy to dunk if you pretend

1399
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:42,400
if you don't know that there's a distinction or you pretend that there isn't so it's always a thing

1400
02:31:42,400 --> 02:31:49,280
I've said of leftists having some good ideas and then not explaining them to me in a way that I

1401
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:58,320
understand and then no wonder I don't think they're good for a long time I I yeah and it's like well

1402
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:04,080
if you well if you read marks like it's all there and that's true but I've been taught that it is

1403
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:09,280
all there mark was to mark mark just wants to murder people that's what I was told he did yeah

1404
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,640
yeah he uh he he you know he did the uh he did the holodomir and he killed uh you know

1405
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:21,200
he killed all the kulaks uh in the russian revolution carl marx terrible dictator yeah

1406
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:29,040

1407
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:35,600
assassins creed syndicate you can do many quests for him wait really that's probably very silly

1408
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:43,840
i forget what it was it was something something like liberate this bit liberate this bitch do you

1409

1410
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:54,080
assassins creed maybe do you have to go and like help protect like a union leader as they're like

1411
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:59,440
striking against the factory or something like that the the bad guys are trying to crack down on

1412
02:32:59,440 --> 02:33:06,640
this union you got to go and assassinate everyone hell yeah damn good the that was a good game the

1413
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:12,240
rights the rights of the proletariat's the arms must not be surrendered under any pretext

1414

1416
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:32,560
twitter it was a meme it was like you know the chad face or whatever and it was like one guy says

1417
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:40,240
you know uh the workers have a right to anything they produce and then some smug the smug guy you're

1418
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:45,920
supposed to agree with says like what if they produce at a net negative what if they produce

1419
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:51,520
at a net negative what if they are unproductive then you know actually capital owners protect the

1420
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:57,120
workers against you know uh business losses or something and i don't know uh that was like it's

1421
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:02,720
like okay and every i saw a bunch of people that i follow were like god this is all in marx like

1422
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:10,800
like like uh uh like make a critique of communism that isn't already addressed in the formative

1423
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:16,880
challenge difficulty impossible if you just read marx like it's literally in there and it's like

1424
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:21,440
yes no if i read marx i'm gonna take an axe and crack open jeff bezis's head like an egg and the

1425
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:26,320
yolk's gonna spill out and then i'm gonna go to prison and i don't want that and on the one hand

1426
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:32,320
i'm sure it is i'm sure it is in there i'm sure he probably did address that question somewhere

1427
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:39,120
on the other hand i haven't read it i haven't read all of capital so like i couldn't i couldn't

1428
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:46,400
have made that point i couldn't be like well actually marx has a rebuttal for exactly this uh

1429
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:54,400
this thing uh but there is one apparently uh so i get it it's hard to explain simple things sometimes

1430
02:34:54,400 --> 02:35:03,520
i mean i mean the look like me in my brain if if like all the excess like earnings you have

1431
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:09,200
aren't being siphoned off to some one guy at the top right then those earnings would be

1432
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:16,160
with the workers and then they wouldn't need a person at top to like take a temporary loss for

1433
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:21,920
you you'd have more money to tank it yourself right right they would have they would have it

1434
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:26,960
in the first place yeah you would just already have like the means because you'd be earning more

1435
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:31,200
so that it just seems like that would automatically correct for itself

1436
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:36,560
it's not like magically like the person being having a ceo doesn't mean like more money magically

1437
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:43,760
appears like i don't think so yeah somebody somebody's tank someone's got the money and

1438
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:53,520
they're tanking the loss so it's just like well who someone so yeah so it's like oh well well but

1439
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:59,200
this yeah it's kind of like saying oh but you see the fact oh the workers don't have the money

1440
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:03,680
they didn't get the profit but that means they can't take the loss so actually it's good for them

1441
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:09,200
it's like well it's like it's like i don't know about that i mean you can also just look i forget

1442
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:15,760
which country it is that does have a decent number of worker cooperatives um their survival rate

1443
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:21,200
like a typical business like i i i'm not gonna remember the exact number someone like 30 something

1444
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:26,960
percent of typical businesses will last more than three years and the rest close down but with worker

1445
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:33,280
co-ops it's like 87 survive the first three years wow they're way they're so much more resilient

1446
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:40,000
that's very interesting yeah so that probably tells me that they're probably very good at

1447
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:44,880
you know tanking those losses because it probably incentivizes the workers to like

1448
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:53,120
because like if i know whether the risk is just the risk is distributed yeah and it's exactly like

1449
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:56,800
i i haven't worked many normal jobs but i know people who do and they'll tell me like

1450
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:01,760
like my partner used to work at starbucks my partner follows the book my partner tries to

1451
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:06,320
do everything correctly and other people are just lazy but just sit around do nothing like their

1452
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:11,680
whole shift do the bare minimum work don't care leave messes behind and just don't really try

1453
02:37:12,240 --> 02:37:16,160
and i hear it from other people i have another friend who works at a casino somewhere and they

1454
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:19,760
have similar things like half the employees just don't give a shit they do the bare minimum

1455
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:27,120
not to get fired and they don't care but like i feel like in a co-op everyone's incentivized

1456
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:32,800
to do well because it means you get paid more because like your payments i assume it's more

1457
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:39,520
like a percentage of earnings rather than just a flat rate i don't exactly i think maybe that's

1458
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:44,400
how it works i don't know exactly but the point is like the business like the better the business

1459
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:49,920
does the better you do it seems to be like the situation there so it makes sense that people

1460
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:53,280
would actually give a shit and probably feel better about their work because they actually have

1461
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:58,880
some control over it or something like that i feel like what would make you feel better about

1462
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:05,200
your work is just getting a bigger paycheck i feel like just the fact that there's no big guy at

1463
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:10,080
the top taking a lot of the money out of the company means that everybody gets more money which

1464
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:16,640
means you're just happier in general and can work harder when you're a grunt you're like i mean

1465
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:22,160
maybe there's like the possibility that you might if you do well you might get a promotion might get

1466
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:28,560
a raise or something but like there's never any guarantee of that and for a lot of in a lot of

1467
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:37,280
positions it's probably just not gonna happen so like yeah why try hard what's what's the reward

1468
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:47,120
in that uh nothing most of the time a lot of the time um there are there are a lot of jobs that i

1469
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:54,320
i would be like you might as well do the bare minimum you're like you're not getting anything

1470
02:38:54,320 --> 02:39:04,320
anything out of doing more so like why would it be expected of you oh my god i had to fucking

1471
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:13,040
double take it's actually here 36 minutes ago your movie sucks the lion king part one holy

1472
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:21,920
shit it's actually here no how how many hours is part one uh two hours 40 minutes and i think

1473
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:30,160
there's gonna be free parts lemma maybe there'll be two that's great i can't wait to watch i've

1474
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:37,200
been seeing the live stream clips for this for like for years for literally over two years

1475
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:43,280
maybe coming closer for years same like and the stuff i've seen so far like i have not

1476
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:48,560
watched 2019 lanking but holy fuck some of that shit that movie just fucks up like basic competence

1477
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:55,840
like people's microphones clipping and like like bad like autotune on the singing like or like

1478
02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:01,200
audio being time stretched and having like noticeable artifacts and pops and shit it's

1479
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:06,560
it's it was always amusing seeing those things because like i'm sure the movie is like

1480
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:15,200
like fine well like not fine but like it's just it's just it's a series of images and

1481
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:20,240
people like the lion king the original so they just say hey it's good and then everyone forgot

1482
02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:29,680
about it um and adam going through and finding endless like supplies of like things that are

1483
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:37,600
wrong with it the more he dug it was like nobody would have ever like like it's it's i mean i

1484
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:42,720
obviously haven't seen this video yet i don't know exactly what he's gonna talk about but like

1485
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:56,400
like lion king 2019 is like not like the worst film in like the world in terms of like what it does

1486
02:40:56,400 --> 02:41:04,320
it's sort of like a trend that sucks of like just making like a like an old property but like new

1487
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:08,080
and like just getting a bunch of money for it or just lazily putting it together returning

1488
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:13,520
animation into live action yeah like a weird thing like that it's a stupid gimmick it's dumb

1489
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:18,400
it's like hollywood's stupid and people are just dumb droves they go into the droves the thing but

1490
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:27,120
like to deep dive on it you find so much more to hate and it's like nobody would have gotten this

1491
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:32,720
mad about this if they hadn't been trying to make a review about it i can't wait to see how

1492
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:37,680
upsetting it is i can't wait to see in front of the mouth by the end i haven't really been following

1493
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:41,680
those live streams for like a year i only looked at like some of the highlight clips but there was

1494
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:46,800
like actually like comical it's just comical like seeing like especially like seeing like the behind

1495
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:52,320
the scenes interviews with john favreau being like yeah you know wanted to look like a nature

1496
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:55,760
documentary um you know we don't want the characters to be expressive animators will

1497
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:59,920
send me like a scene and it's like expressive and i'm like tell them no animals don't express

1498
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:06,160
themselves you can't have the character emote you gotta tone it back and have their face look stiff

1499
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:10,640
oh this person sent me a character and they made the sunset look beautiful and i spent all this

1500
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:16,240
time putting these nice clouds in the sky and it was really aesthetic but in real life a cloud

1501
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:24,800
the sky's boring you can't do that oh my god things like that it's like so funny in real life the

1502
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:32,720
sky can be nice sometimes like like no nothing nothing can be idealized like pure realism is

1503
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:39,680
what we need like no idealism at all nothing none of that it's just like in video games we want

1504
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:50,160
everything brown like shit brown like poo um i guess that trend is not quite so strong these

1505
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:55,840
days but for a while it was our friend of the show sigh commented on this video 10 minutes ago

1506
02:42:56,720 --> 02:43:04,320
sigh is watching the lion king review by yms are you are you i will have to watch i don't i won't

1507
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:09,680
be able to watch this today i'll probably watch it tomorrow i'm probably i'm gonna i really want to

1508
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:15,440
watch it with um my husband but he's been so busy with the new final fantasy 14 patch i don't know

1509
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:23,680
if i can get him uh two hours two and two hours and 40 minutes i was thinking of like oh movie night

1510
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:30,160
but like that's a long movie in two hours and 40 minutes dude the fucking the fucking kimber review

1511
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:34,800
like a reminder about the kimber video that's a good video i like the kimber video was like

1512
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:44,080
a section of this video yeah it was yeah it would have been insane this this guy just this

1513
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:50,640
videos he just keeps making videos what the fuck is wrong with him the kimber review is

1514
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:56,640
incredible though it is one of the best youtube videos i've seen still yeah it's it's really nice

1515
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:03,600
the i learned a lot from it the the the the how would you describe it like the exhaustive

1516
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:10,640
thoroughness of debunking yeah the like he didn't need to go on for quite as long as he did

1517
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:17,680
but the fact that he did made it absolutely like airtight like you can't argue against it i came

1518
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:23,840
i came away from it feeling like i had a thorough understanding of the subject and that i had learned

1519
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:28,880
some things that i did not know before and i mean what more can you what more can you ask for

1520
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:34,080
like this man single-handedly flipped the entire narrative and it worked yeah and everyone was

1521
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:42,800
like oh yeah we were all wrong about this topic that's true it's kind of amazing it's kind of amazing

1522
02:44:42,800 --> 02:44:50,880
that the misconception was so widespread for him to debunk yeah i i i fully believe that like

1523
02:44:51,520 --> 02:45:00,480
disney like ripped it off you know i fully believe that until seeing his video oh yeah i just i mean

1524
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:08,400
i don't know it's just what i heard just everyone said oh yeah kimba was a was a a jab a tezuka manga

1525
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:13,760
and they kind of like took took it for the line king i was like yeah okay that tracks because like

1526
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:19,440
you know all their other movies are like adaptations of a thing so why not um

1527
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:27,680
yeah did not know did not know there was so many different versions of kimba did not know there

1528
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:34,560
was so much of it did not know that all the all the comparisons of shots that line yeah ripped off

1529
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:41,760
kimba were actually from kimber properties released after the line king that's funny that's really funny

1530
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:46,640
it's like oh that's how they fucking get you like oh of course it's so they were they're being sneaky

1531
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:51,680
this whole time that it's it's it's funny they tricked me through that whole thing you've you

1532
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:58,560
figure out why the con the misconceptions exist and then there's like like it's really down to just

1533
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:03,920
a few people's blogs there's some there's some paint in the picture there's some in that specific

1534
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:08,400
way to make it look like that and everyone just picked it up and ran with that there's some people

1535
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:14,160
that really should have known better that like should have done the research and maybe they did

1536
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:23,040
and and yet and yet they they told the this this twisted version of the story they they literally

1537
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:31,920
did like the soy jack we very female moves weak and very female like the they did the thing where

1538
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:40,400
they look at a thing like lion america and then lion japan and they're like oh line from japan

1539
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:49,360
that's way better yeah yeah well well kimba's kimba is better because he's from a long line of

1540
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:55,360
great leaders because he's white and he's gotta he wants to be like his ancestors as well as look

1541
02:46:55,360 --> 02:47:02,720
like them oh yeah that was a that was a recent pcp you just quoted all that shit at the start it was

1542
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:10,000
funny oh that sounds right i love i love that i love that it's funny yeah just oh god that the

1543
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:15,680
fucking racism too you have no rights you have no right to bully him just because he was white

1544
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:23,520
i just can't believe that when they bring up like the african tribes and they the the the

1545
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:36,800
void the dubbers literally just go because like like i remember like south park doing

1546
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:42,800
shit like that and that's obviously like taking that's obviously like trying to take the piss

1547
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:48,160
but this is like unironic this is just them doing it unironically this is this is how african

1548
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:59,680
speak they they yeah sometimes sometimes uh they don't always do it like that one that one with

1549
02:47:59,680 --> 02:48:06,640
the the tribesmen with the grenades was not like that but like a lot of a lot of the other ones are

1550
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:14,240
that was a such a bizarre one yeah like kimba sides with the the hunter with the grenades just

1551
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:20,160
throwing grenades at leopards for revenge where are they getting them from blowing the fucking

1552
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:29,200
smithereens yeah it's just uh that's it so it's good good video just stuff just fucking happens

1553
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:34,080
stuff just happens yeah yeah whatever they wanted to do that day

1554
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:42,880
that's um it's it's kind of neat it's kind of neat that they gave them grenades you know they

1555
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:48,400
didn't just go with the old that old chestnut of like a spear it's kind of you did have a spear

1556
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:58,240
okay but he had grenades too and that's and that's something um okay uh i wonder if that was

1557
02:48:58,240 --> 02:49:04,400
literally just because it's easy to animate an explosion instead of like a stab oh god like

1558
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:09,360
oh but you just get like a thing like oh like a still image flies across the screen and there's

1559
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:17,520
a flash of like two frames of an explosion easier to do yeah maybe maybe that makes sense uh next

1560
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:26,160
next voicemail is called praising lord of ghosts plus lore question three two one go so i finally

1561
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:33,600
got my physical uh copy of lord of ghosts based and uh i had read act one before but this is my

1562
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:41,440
first time reading act two and i must say this comic is extremely based great amazing so much fun

1563
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:48,960
thank you uh some amazing pieces of art inherent uh so my favorites are the very osamu tezuka-esque

1564
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:56,240
page where flower heads just like chops the entire page in half um i also really like the

1565
02:49:56,240 --> 02:50:04,960
haunting montage where it's the two pages of wacky characters haunting yeah like denizens and

1566
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:12,320
i also love the two page spread of the n-word slime that's for the ghost stories my favorite is

1567
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:18,880
probably writing lesson by nico it's very funny and cute my second favorite is probably uh flower

1568
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:27,280
journey by uh the one ben saint hell yeah i feel really bad for that poor uh cow town denizen who

1569
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:32,240
got a cactus shove in his mouth he didn't deserve that oh no he's a he's a really bad guy he just

1570
02:50:32,240 --> 02:50:38,400
didn't see anyway i got a lore question real quick so uh it's clear that the denizens of

1571
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:43,680
new big and by the sea aka new york aka real actual london are supposed to all have like

1572
02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:51,760
british and english accents but what about the lord of ghosts is he american that's a good question

1573
02:50:54,000 --> 02:51:02,640
the lord of ghosts is not from a country necessarily it's the the the world is like

1574
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:11,280
just because um endless war takes place in like a funny version of of boston that is on the shore

1575
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:17,200
of like the grand canyon which is filled with slime nevada or arizona or whatever yeah yeah

1576
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:23,840
so like that necessarily is like oh that's kind of a real place sorry um and then and then like

1577
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:30,480
endless mods in like london like it's the funny version of that but with mud instead so it's also

1578
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:37,040
a real place um i love the origin of endless but i don't i love the art sorry i just i remembered

1579
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:47,520
that the top 10 mods in video games that was good video oh thanks um like the lord of ghosts

1580
02:51:48,880 --> 02:51:56,320
the those locations are like built around like real places but the globe that they are in

1581
02:51:56,320 --> 02:52:04,960
is not the real world there is no america um there is no like countries of it's not the real world but

1582
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:10,880
stuff um it's different and lord of ghosts is from somewhere else

1583
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:22,240
gotcha it's it's it's very it's hard to like say right now because like it involves things i haven't

1584
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:31,280
quite written yet um and i it doesn't necessarily like line up with the lore as just like decided by

1585
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:37,280
whoever is in charge of endless war not that it's really in anyone's in really in charge of that

1586
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:42,560
but i like to think it's on like a planet that isn't quite earth and it's different

1587
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:52,560
fascinating can't wait i understand it's not from any real world parallel location

1588
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:57,040
yeah yeah i can't wait for my copy to arrive at some point

1589
02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:05,680
same it should be in the fucking air it should be flying around whoa there's

1590
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:09,680
you have to wait for mother-in-law to say that a package arrived at their place and then i'll go

1591
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:14,720
pick it up whenever that happens i gotta check my p.o box i think i probably have a bunch of

1592
02:53:15,360 --> 02:53:20,080
returned return to sender packages waiting for me in there then every single time mail

1593
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:25,040
comes up you say i gotta check my p.o box it's too far away it takes me like an hour and a half to

1594
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:33,920
get to medford whoa why so far because i i moved my my p.o box is where my old house used to be

1595
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:40,960
so now it's on the other side of the city uh so it's very annoying i'm more like a p.u box

1596
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:51,680
exactly that is exactly what i'm saying um next voicemail is two seconds long three two one go

1597
02:53:54,080 --> 02:54:01,920
very good uh but it has a link it has an image to go with it uh oh yes

1598
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:07,360
the king of personal responsibility prevails and it only took him over two years to edit this video

1599
02:54:07,360 --> 02:54:14,880
that's what i called based and then vixx says this guy t and then vixx says in response for the

1600
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:20,640
record i edited 99% of this on the spot of retcon right after filming i remember that this is why

1601
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:27,520
i thought this was weird it was taking so long because i remember i thought victor was going to

1602
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:33,680
to edit the the thing and then nate said he was going to right but i remember victor nearly

1603
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:40,720
completing it at radcon really how embarrassing for nate i didn't watch it i didn't watch it at

1604
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:45,920
radcon but i saw it was like okay we finished filming for the day victor was just on his laptop

1605
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:51,920
working on it it's like but yeah and he's i remember like i i could get this done at least uh

1606
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:59,600
you know a few days after but i guess he didn't complete it well i don't really remember what

1607
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:05,840
happened that i wasn't really involved in discussing that i don't remember seeing vik edit it

1608
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:13,440
and i don't remember seeing him edit it i just don't know why and i don't know and i don't know

1609
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:21,440
why it took nate i mean he just he just wasn't doing it for like two years and then recently

1610
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:29,280
i i egged him on to do it and it took him like two months after he started after he said he was

1611
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:35,920
gonna start doing it to finally do it i don't know what he was doing i don't know what what he

1612
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:41,440
actually did with it that took him along i have no idea what does nate do what does nate do i don't

1613
02:55:41,440 --> 02:55:46,960
understand does he does he spend all of his time making youtube videos and they're like really big

1614
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:57,920
and expensive and like snazzy i'm gonna say no wow i'm gonna say he used to make videos fast when

1615
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:05,280
it wasn't full time and then it was full time and then they start making videos yeah funny how that

1616
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:13,920
works well he made a um on his side channel he made a uh a little like meme video about wil smith

1617
02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:22,720
slapping chris rock oh i didn't i guess i'm not on that yeah it's best i saw that i don't remember

1618
02:56:22,720 --> 02:56:31,360
seeing it i think it's on bestie boy uh someone linked it someone linked it it came out like like

1619
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:39,760
maybe a week ago uh it's a little fanfare timely yeah uh and i guess he's like i wonder was it was

1620
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:46,240
it was like it was actually like right after or maybe right before the uh the the grad garling

1621
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:52,320
house diss track video came out i was like were you doing that instead is this what you were working

1622
02:56:52,320 --> 02:56:57,040
on yeah it's bestie boy it looks like i haven't seen this okay i'm subscribed i don't know why

1623
02:56:57,040 --> 02:57:06,400
didn't show up for me yeah i don't know i don't know i don't i i don't know why it took nate this

1624
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:13,360
long to uh to do that video i just who knows is he streaming all the time i just really just

1625
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:19,920
don't know what he's doing i don't think he streams all the time does he stream like once a week or

1626
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:28,640
something i'm not actually sure um i don't know man uh i believe vik when he says that he edited

1627
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:36,320
99 of it it checks out i don't know what i don't have a like a comparison to be like oh what did

1628
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:43,200
nate do to that footage to make it the final what did that last one percent entail i just don't know

1629
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:50,400
i just don't know maybe maybe leaving the pcp is as well is is the problem because like you know

1630
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:53,760
when you're on the pcp you talk about what you've been up to you talk about what you've been working

1631
02:57:54,320 --> 02:57:58,960
i guess yeah he's not is he just not talking about it because he's not doing anything i don't

1632
02:57:58,960 --> 02:58:05,280
understand um if he came on if he had to talk about what he did every week maybe he'd feel

1633
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:12,400
more motivation to do things i'm that's not it's not a crazy idea that's not the craziest thing

1634
02:58:12,400 --> 02:58:18,320
i've ever heard someone said actually someone left a comment on the last episode that said

1635
02:58:18,320 --> 02:58:25,760
i'm i'm gonna paraphrase it but it was something along the lines of like nate left the podcast

1636
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:34,000
and he nate thinks it's been the topicless podcast for years but actually every episode is the like

1637
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:41,360
motivation like career discussion episode and that's actually exactly what nate needed

1638
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:48,160
and it's i think it's kind of similar to what you're saying now like maybe

1639
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:55,680
yeah like less conspiratorial if you're similar at vain yeah well well just the idea that like uh

1640
02:58:55,680 --> 02:59:04,720
you know what if you talked about what you were working on might be good i'm i've been animating

1641
02:59:04,720 --> 02:59:09,840
nipples this entire time that's what i've been working on because the nsfw version of my animation

1642
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:14,800
is pretty much done it'll be out by the time this episode airs on my patreon if people want to see

1643
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:21,920
if you're talking about yeah on kazanics comes on with titties out oh that's not out already

1644
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:28,560
oh they're still working on it the the version with the the booba being all on full display isn't

1645
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:34,480
quite done i oh because there's a lot of animations that need to be touched up like some of them are

1646
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:44,080
already done one i had to work on which i'll send you guys um because you're cool but there's like

1647
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:49,920
other shots but i'm still working on i've been working on one today it's the shot of her butt

1648
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:56,320
swinging back and forth and you can see her boobs from behind um because we're just that i just

1649
02:59:56,320 --> 03:00:03,440
just gotta say just gotta say in general that's an angle i like i really like that yeah from behind

1650
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:10,640
but you can see the boobs around that's just a good angle here's a good angle yeah um there you go

1651
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:24,400
both of it sending you're away oh my god no this is gonna get me in jail oh actually i don't think

03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:37,840
freeloaders freeloaders criminals criminal scum

1663
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:47,040
okay uh next voicemail is called oh it's a youtube link uh here

1664
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:54,160
all right well is this yeah it's a 11 minute video man we're not watching when we don't watch

1665
03:01:54,160 --> 03:01:58,560
videos do you ever watch do you ever watch the company man i don't know never heard of this guy

1666
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:07,440
oh i know this guy he makes videos basically he tells the story of a company usually it's

1667
03:02:07,440 --> 03:02:13,840
like a restaurant chain or something uh and he'll be like he'll tell how it started usually it'll be

1668
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:18,720
a company that has sort of like fallen out of favor and like you don't see them anymore and he'll tell

1669
03:02:18,720 --> 03:02:24,480
like how it started how it got popular and then like why it ended up like you know eventually

1670
03:02:24,480 --> 03:02:31,040
failing or or being reduced in scope or whatever so that's kind of interesting actually i was talking

1671
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:38,640
to munchy about it one time just in private and he said that he watched the channel but he got kind

1672
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:45,200
of fed up with it because basically every like restaurant or every like store or whatever has

1673
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:51,040
the same origin story which is like two rich guys got friends with each other and decided we should

1674
03:02:51,040 --> 03:03:02,320
make a store and then they did um and it's true uh but uh i don't know anyone twitter and i we're

1675
03:03:02,320 --> 03:03:09,280
all gonna make it though we're all gonna we are right all you need is two rich guys um that's

1676
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:13,920
that's that's the beauty of capitalism everyone's gonna be a millionaire everyone's gonna create

1677
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:20,000
a chain like that and it's all you have to do all you have to do is just work hard at

1678
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:26,480
creating a restaurant chain that then you know opens up you know 30 locations nationwide what if

1679
03:03:26,480 --> 03:03:34,240
you had like a ramen like restaurant called the old bowl bowl and chain i'd rather have a

1680
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:41,680
rum and coke if you know what i mean wait the bowl and oh i get it the bowl and chain yeah

1681
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:48,640
that's clever i don't know what the gimmick is i i guess it's an idiom it's like it's like it's like

1682
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:53,520
marriage but there's a bowl involved and it's got ramen in it it's it's next to it's next to a

1683
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:58,000
bowling alley and your plate is connected to a bowling ball by a chain if you don't finish your

1684
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:02,160
meal someone's gonna throw that bowling ball and your plate's gonna go out the window ah

1685
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:08,240
yes a bowling themed restaurant where they they bowl you like your drink in a bowling bowl you

1686
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:13,920
have to suck it out of the holes there's a little cork a little cork in there

1687
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:23,760
uh sounds good to me in a bowling bowl uh so i don't know i know this twitter thing is probably

1688
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:28,400
about that stupid uh elon musk isn't gonna buy it for four hundred and twenty dollars or whatever

1689
03:04:28,400 --> 03:04:36,240
haha i really i really don't i'm really unsettled by the whole hmm we need to create real free speech

1690
03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:42,320
i'm like what is this about is this about you're just gonna unban donald trump you're just you're

1691
03:04:42,320 --> 03:04:48,880
gonna allow vaccine misinformation what's your angle what's your angle he's well he's gonna

1692
03:04:48,880 --> 03:04:57,040
crack down on the woke mind virus it is a virus if your trans die and he shoots you with a gun

1693
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:03,920
yeah probably that's it probably unfortunately uh maybe actually that he'll he'll he'll unban

1694
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:08,720
donald trump and he will ban like the trans flag emoji and that's the only things that will change

1695
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:13,280
right because it's that's stifling my free speech we need more free speech trans people existing

1696
03:05:13,280 --> 03:05:20,640
can't speak i think um i don't know elon musk is an idiot he probably doesn't even know what he's

1697
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:26,160
gonna do i don't think i don't think they're gonna let him buy it uh i mean it would be terrible

1698
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:33,280
it'd be it'd be terrible for the world like a stupid idea i feel like i'm i'm i'm almost positive

1699
03:05:33,280 --> 03:05:39,040
that twitter would just break and just like disintegrate if they actually sold it to elon musk

1700
03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:46,160
yeah i don't think it would be good for it um uh yeah i think it would probably go south

1701
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:51,600
not necessarily because like enough people hate elon musk that there'd be a boycott of it but just

1702
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:57,200
sort of i don't know if i can only see bad things happening i think he would do stupid things with

1703
03:05:57,200 --> 03:06:02,640
it like they all they already do stupid changes to the platform all the time that everyone hates

1704
03:06:02,640 --> 03:06:09,120
i think it would only accelerate um i don't know that it has like fawn like i don't know if its

1705
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:14,160
stock price is down or whatever and that's why this guy made a video about it i know that netflix

1706
03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:19,920
is cratering really hard and that's pretty funny it's first people aren't chilling anymore they're

1707
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:27,600
all riled up that's that's true no one's chilling i'm never hearing like back in like 2016 and i

1708
03:06:27,600 --> 03:06:32,880
don't think it's changed but like twitter operates at a loss that's why i remember i and that's

1709
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:38,160
probably been like that for a very long time it was youtube that was operating i mean youtube too

1710
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:41,360
yeah i heard like twitter was also like in that boat just not as bad

1711
03:06:44,080 --> 03:06:49,360
i don't know how and why do they do it like i could be incorrect i mean i'm gonna double check

1712
03:06:50,560 --> 03:06:56,480
oh man if elon musk for instance buys twitter and then he decides i'm gonna turn this ship around

1713
03:06:56,560 --> 03:07:02,080
i'm gonna change it so we're operating at a profit that's gonna that's gonna ruin it that would be

1714
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:10,080
oh my god imagine imagine what he would do if that was his goal hold on and twitter gold in 2021

1715
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:15,040
twitter's annual net loss amounted to two hundred and twenty one million dollars overall this is a

1716
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:22,320
significant decrease from the previous year that's good losing two hundred million dollars

1717
03:07:22,320 --> 03:07:27,120
that's good actually we're we're getting better that's better what the trend is in like as in the

1718
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:33,600
loss was decreased they were losing more but now we're losing less losing less money is good

1719
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:39,600
that means maybe next year you'll lose even even less and good for them honestly

1720
03:07:43,840 --> 03:07:50,640
what if he changes the twitter tweet birds into an ego icon no he can't touch the bird

1721
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:56,560
that's all i have left oh my gosh i'm trying to turn off i'm trying to disable this website from

1722
03:07:57,360 --> 03:08:01,200
oh my god this is a fucking nightmare this is a fucking nightmare this website that i'm trying

1723
03:08:01,200 --> 03:08:06,480
to like look at the twitter graph is like um if you want to look at this page you have we have to

1724
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:14,640

1725
03:08:14,720 --> 03:08:18,880
i'm not clicking it allow all so i'm going to click cookie consent manager and then

1726
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:26,720
i can't i still haven't disabled them i have to like click on the sub menus um and that doesn't

1727
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:33,680
work i have to click on see more details and then when i do that which is like one out of like five

1728
03:08:33,680 --> 03:08:40,800
menus i have to go through i can't even disable them i have to like then click on another drop

1729
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:47,920
down list and i have to oh my god scrolling scrolling i this is like seven pages deep this is

1730
03:08:47,920 --> 03:08:56,880
this is cookie wait i still i still can't disable it um this is this is cookie clicker okay so i want

1731
03:08:56,880 --> 03:09:01,840
you to compare these two images and i'm putting one in the little scroll bar on the right side

1732
03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:07,280
look how much it shrunk just for me clicking on one of the cookie details i have to scroll through

1733
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:13,440
like 10 pages and at the bottom there's no button that says disable this cookie how do i disable it

1734
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:23,840
i'm so confused it just says allow all or that's it that's nothing else oh god

1735
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:30,880
sometimes there's a there's this thing and it's like they do like a tricksy thing they a little

1736
03:09:30,880 --> 03:09:37,600
tricky little ooh you think you're clicking on uh no but it's actually no to the yes to the

1737
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:44,080
it's a reverse and we got you we make the button look good to click and now we have all your cookie

1738
03:09:44,080 --> 03:09:52,640
data um and i sometimes take the like five minutes it takes to just say no save it's like yeah like

1739
03:09:52,640 --> 03:09:59,920
but sometimes it's just like it's just dreadful and it just ruins the web the internet sucks

1740
03:09:59,920 --> 03:10:04,640
right now because of the you don't want us tracking you well complete our fucking 10 minute

1741
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:09,760
like a hundred page survey and you have to like play spot the difference to find the little tiny

1742
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:14,000
button that says don't track me please and then you can do it's like because they know no one's

1743
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:19,520
going to do it but oh we got around the legal loophole it's just fuck off man piece of shit

1744
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:26,480
i love piece of shit i hope i love legal loopholes i hope john oliver just fucking leaks all of

1745
03:10:26,560 --> 03:10:36,080
congress's data that he paid bought did he do that yeah um john oliver did something based

1746
03:10:36,080 --> 03:10:42,400
actually he um he he did a segment like a pretty long segment talking about data and how easily

1747
03:10:42,400 --> 03:10:47,760
they can track you and how it doesn't matter how anonymized for data is they they have your location

1748
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:54,480
they have your workplace where you go where your phone is um at all times um what things you look at

1749
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:58,720
and like they only need like a fraction of information to like narrow it down to one person

1750
03:10:58,720 --> 03:11:02,800
but they have like 10 times the amount of information that need to narrow it down reliably

1751
03:11:02,800 --> 03:11:11,920
like 90 of a time so basically they can find you easy you can't fucking avoid it um and you like

1752
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:15,680
gave like talked about a whole bunch of like notable cases where people had been tracked down

1753
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:21,040
times um a new studio went and bought some data from because you can just buy it for like 20 bucks

1754
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:27,440
you can buy someone's data if you want it like serial like killers or stalkers or rapists or

1755
03:11:27,440 --> 03:11:31,760
whatever the fuck can just buy the data of the people they want to victimize and then figure

1756
03:11:31,760 --> 03:11:35,360
out where they live and their whole schedule and everything you could just fucking do it you just

1757
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:40,800
chuck money at it it's fucked up um some news crew went to someone's house and we're just like

1758
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:47,200
you're pregnant right and the and the woman was like yeah how do you know and they they just

1759
03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:52,880
fucking figured that out because the computer you know based on their browsing habits was able

1760
03:11:52,880 --> 03:11:59,040
to compute that shit so that was like the segment and then John all was like okay so you know you

1761
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:02,560
can get a lot of really personal information you can also find out what websites people look at and

1762
03:12:03,280 --> 03:12:09,040
like to some extent their internet history and other shit so he basically figured out like

1763
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:16,320
everyone in congress bought all of their data all of it he has dirt on every single one of him and

1764
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:21,760
he's like if you don't want me to release this you better make it illegal for me to release it

1765
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:30,000
because right now there's nothing legally stopping me wow um huh he's like blackmail uh nifty pretty

1766
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:34,400
cool it's kind of neat but it's legal because he's allowed he's allowed to play funny they haven't

1767
03:12:34,400 --> 03:12:43,520
made it illegal to do that huh this is like when did that happen um i'll link the segment it's

1768
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:51,040
pretty cool John Oliver little bass today um it's a little bit bass sounds a little bit

1769
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:58,640
bass let's yeah it's 25 minutes but most of the cool shit is like closer to the end i think

1770
03:13:00,960 --> 03:13:05,600
like the last five minutes or so is where the funny stuff starts happening

1771
03:13:06,480 --> 03:13:09,600
yeah that blocked in the uk blocked in the uk

1772
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:16,400
that's why that yes i remember this last week tonight i've never been able to watch them

1780
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:16,400
just like my own but it wasn't me i never said anything like that did i forget is someone copying

1787
03:15:06,240 --> 03:15:12,400
pinky rose video where she's like fluttershy plays amalgas and she used my fucking vectors for it

1788
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:16,000
fluttershy would be really scared the whole time but then the twist at the end would be that she

1789
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:23,920
was the imposter she was so fucking sus it's so obvious let's see this fluttershy plays roblox

1795
03:15:54,640 --> 03:16:00,880

1796
03:16:00,880 --> 03:16:07,760
you've mentioned i vaguely recall seeing a youtube channel of a person doing a fluttershy voice

1797
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:18,480
and playing games and then recently they had like a vtuber fluttershy oh boo kill him gotta kill him

1798
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:25,600
they must be punished this person hasn't uploaded in four years apart from like two song covers

1799
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:29,920
they did maybe someone else so maybe it wasn't this person fluttershy there's probably someone else

1800
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:37,680
plays of something all right oh unless we made like a never channel for it oh vanamelon vanamelon

1804
03:17:01,840 --> 03:17:09,680
anthropology thick reading in like 2013 and she did a pretty good job um and after that i mean

1805
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:14,720
she was working a bunch of other things but like we worked with her in 2014 and then after that she

went off and somehow got a million subscribers good for her yeah very nice there what did she do

1807
03:17:22,960 --> 03:17:28,640

1810
03:17:41,520 --> 03:17:48,480
her most popular video is an animation uh i'm clicking on a random video

03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:56,080
yeah like i collected this random one this is like a vtuber puppet in like the top left corner

1812
03:17:56,080 --> 03:18:00,400
it's not there the whole time and it's just like this her it's basically just her doing like

1813
03:18:00,400 --> 03:18:05,840
reaction content when she just like reacts to like a bunch of little things um and like has a character

1814
03:18:05,840 --> 03:18:12,880

you know if you know what i mean what is this video oh this is i just quoted it earlier i was

1851
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:55,200
thinking about it for some reason i'm just a bro it's a really bad song covered by a really

1852
03:22:55,760 --> 03:23:02,960
really weird guy it's a story i might tell on the pcp someday it was it involves saberspark and

1853
03:23:03,680 --> 03:23:10,960
a bunch of other people actually interesting is this is this a parody of something

1854
03:23:10,960 --> 03:23:18,720
it's like a parody i'm just a kid and life is a nightmare is that what it is i think so yeah

1855
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:26,720
but it says i'm just a brony and i like paoni that's great i'm glad you kept the rhyme scheme

1856
03:23:27,520 --> 03:23:37,360
dude these ponies go on magical adventures the next voicemail just says ben your page is really

1857

1858
03:23:48,560 --> 03:24:01,440
the deep symbolism of the egg uh there posting it okay three two one go you see the graveyard in

1859
03:24:01,520 --> 03:24:07,760
the procrastinator's podcast symbolizes death and decay the fact that everything comes to an

1860
03:24:07,760 --> 03:24:14,960
end eventually just like this podcast the egg in the workaholics podcast is a symbol of rebirth

1861
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:21,760
and a beginning hope i see by inviting twilight sparkle their podcast grew in size this is what

1862
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:30,800
eggs mean subscribe to vaude vidya for more lore well i get it the the opposite of a graveyard is an egg

1863
03:24:32,240 --> 03:24:40,320
dude makes it looks like an egg yeah it's i guess what if you stuck a tiny little straw

1864
03:24:41,280 --> 03:24:47,680
into an egg wow don't just suck and just suck the yoke out and just drank the yoke out of no

1865
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:52,400
and like you didn't break the membrane you just kind of drained the yoke so all that's left

1866
03:24:52,400 --> 03:25:00,160
is just a thin little empty like yoke membrane inside of well if you did that then i would think

1867
03:25:00,160 --> 03:25:05,760
you're an insane person and i wouldn't talk to you the yoke tastes good you gotta put your

1868
03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:11,840
toast in it not not through a fucking slipper through a straw i need it pure i don't want to

1869
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:16,960
dilute that that yoke with disgusting toast i just want the straight i want the straight dope

1870
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:23,040
i want to have eggs on toast i've never done it i've never done it what do you mean you've

1871
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:28,960
what do you mean you've never had eggs on toast i just never had it i've never really had eggs

1872
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:33,360
growing up i hated eggs when i was a kid and i only started like them like as an adult and even

1873
03:25:33,360 --> 03:25:40,800
then only sometimes get a get a frank pan throw an egg at it i eat eggs all day eggs all the time

1874
03:25:41,520 --> 03:25:47,360
i eat egg wraps actually i'm all out of tortillas i have no more tortillas i have egg toast bacon

1875
03:25:47,360 --> 03:25:54,160
for breakfast every other day very nice eggs make me feel we're not like eggs make me feel a little

1876
03:25:54,160 --> 03:26:00,800
sick on their own like i have to like have them yeah they're good squished into a bread sounds

1877
03:26:00,800 --> 03:26:06,880
like it would be good maybe we should get some bread so i can make toast i've never had never

1878
03:26:06,880 --> 03:26:14,640
had toast before whoa wait really no i was just doing a thing oh okay yeah

1879
03:26:16,320 --> 03:26:21,920
what is this spaghetti right i had to you talk of spaghetti on toast is good

1880
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:33,280
you're what you're you're less than human i've heard of people eating spaghetti sandwiches

1881
03:26:33,280 --> 03:26:37,120
i've never really done it i know people do it i've never heard of spaghetti on toast

1882
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:43,280
do you mean like like spaghetti with a like a sauce mixed in yeah like like like tin spaghetti

1883
03:26:43,280 --> 03:26:50,880
you know um not not like spaghetti spaghetti but spagetti owes a gross they taste like water

1884
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:55,040
came to america heard so much chocolate spaghetti owes were disgusting they're terrible they're not

1885
03:26:55,040 --> 03:27:00,480
good no no but like there there is some like good tin spaghetti it's good with like some cheese

1886
03:27:00,480 --> 03:27:07,920
mixed in actually and yeah like i've never i've never had canned spaghetti actually i just um

1887
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:17,920
make it cook pasta in a in a pot yeah um wadis was like the good brand in new Zealand at least

1888
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:24,400
i'm pretty sure they make pretty good tin spaghetti you just put it in a bowl uh microwave it mixing

1889
03:27:24,400 --> 03:27:30,480
some cheese and um yeah like you have it on toast and it's fucking delicious and it's like in

1890
03:27:30,480 --> 03:27:36,080
new zealand like sort of breakfast thing um that's so messed up our places do like things

1891
03:27:36,080 --> 03:27:41,920
really are upside down and backwards down there i guess it's not too different from also a thing

1892
03:27:42,800 --> 03:27:49,200
i guess it's not too weird like different from like beans on toast in tomato sauce it's just like

1893
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:54,160
the spaghetti is a carbohydrate you're eating it on top of another carbohydrate

1894
03:27:55,200 --> 03:28:00,800
that's too many beans on toast i think beans on toast is something that americans think is weird

1895
03:28:00,800 --> 03:28:06,960
but i i've had it and i think it's all right i kind of like it yeah it's just like a protein and

1896
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:15,680
tomato flavor with a bread yeah we also make um spaghetti pizzas they're also very common like

1897
03:28:15,680 --> 03:28:19,680
it's like a homemade thing you do in new zealand she just put spaghetti on everything

1898
03:28:20,800 --> 03:28:24,880
like like tin spaghetti you just make a pizza you make make make some dough put

1899
03:28:24,880 --> 03:28:28,080
spaghetti as the base and you can add like other toppings and stuff to it and you just

1900
03:28:28,080 --> 03:28:33,120
all right i guess like i guess i get that because it's tomatoes they're both tomato sauce based

1901
03:28:33,120 --> 03:28:37,520
like mac and cheese pizza is a thing in america i mean how much of a stretch is it well i've never

1902
03:28:37,520 --> 03:28:42,400
had this i have a thought that much it's not that much of a thing i have a thought new zealand

1903
03:28:42,880 --> 03:28:53,120
is close to like asia and for some reason sort of asian thing like i've heard of like asian

1904
03:28:53,120 --> 03:29:00,320
mcdonald's having spaghetti could it be that that's like a that's like a thing that's what

1905
03:29:00,320 --> 03:29:06,800
trixie said about no well they she said it about the philippines there was that philippines restaurant

1906
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:12,720
that had spaghetti right that chain ocean and i think no i think you're right i think maybe i have

1907
03:29:12,720 --> 03:29:18,480
seen maybe i've seen pictures of spaghetti at like asian mcdonald's i think you're right so like maybe

1908
03:29:18,480 --> 03:29:24,480
that is just that quadrant of the world has spaghetti as a as a topping or like as a more of

1909
03:29:24,480 --> 03:29:32,720
a thing you i don't know because they got noodles maybe i don't think new zealand's like close to

1910
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:37,120
asia though new zealand's pretty like just far away from everything i mean it's pretty far away

1911
03:29:37,120 --> 03:29:42,240
for everything but like i mean i mean would you describe australia as being close to asia

1912
03:29:42,880 --> 03:29:48,560
it's closer but it like oh that's actually even further i mean it's a long way from italy it's

1913
03:29:48,560 --> 03:29:54,080
this thing i'm thinking of i think new zealand's one of the most remote one of the more remote

1914
03:29:54,080 --> 03:30:00,800
quote unquote western countries because if i try and think of like how many like italian like

1915
03:30:01,600 --> 03:30:05,760
like authentic italian restaurants there are in new zealand there's probably not that many because

1916
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:12,240
like it's a long trip italian food is not common in new zealand um and when you find it it's not

1917
03:30:12,240 --> 03:30:17,440
great i i usually think of new zealand as being basically like right off the coast of australia

1918
03:30:17,440 --> 03:30:25,520
but no it's actually like really far yeah yeah it's like the entire like length of mexico away

1919
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:30,400
it's like it's like flying to australia is like three and a half hours by plane

1920
03:30:31,280 --> 03:30:38,160
oh wow that's a decent distance yeah that's like that's what i know it's like traveling to

1921
03:30:38,160 --> 03:30:47,120
fucking uh grease from where i am maybe a bit further i lived near the top of the north island

1922
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:53,760
and i've lived near the bottom of the south island i've lived all over new zealand i miss a lot of

1923
03:30:53,760 --> 03:30:59,200
things about it like a hundred percent completed new zealand would you say not entirely i haven't

1924
03:30:59,200 --> 03:31:03,760
been to stewart island stewart island is like the furred island that's like small off the bottom

1925
03:31:03,760 --> 03:31:09,360
it's like really small there's like a town there but i haven't been that far down oh i can see the

1926
03:31:09,360 --> 03:31:16,080
tiny tiny tiny little island like way down below on the map i can't i can't even

1927
03:31:16,560 --> 03:31:25,600
wait is it the Auckland's oh i was looking at the i was looking at the Auckland's that's different

1928
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:31,760
i mean there's a lot of islands in Auckland but that they're at the top of the Auckland islands yeah

1929
03:31:31,760 --> 03:31:38,240
okay yeah this this is fucking stewart island and in the in the bottom left corner it like

1930
03:31:38,240 --> 03:31:43,280
shows you like where it is it's a little box yeah i was i was looking at the wrong thing but i see it

1931
03:31:43,280 --> 03:31:51,200
now yeah it's like it's a lot of islands too massachusetts has marthas vineyard which is like

1932
03:31:51,200 --> 03:31:57,520
our own little stewart island well mason bay is such a curve it's so circular how did they do that

1933
03:31:58,720 --> 03:32:06,160
probably the fancy probably like the waves would erode the ground and in a circle fashion

1934
03:32:07,040 --> 03:32:13,760
but why why only there everywhere else's jagged well ocean currents they go in funny lines

1935
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:22,400
they go in swirls and swelps and splashes on the grand on the grand line mysterious ocean currents

1936
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:30,640
exists that will take you like send you to the next island like like it would be like the rock

1937
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:37,200
there was very soft very easy to erode and so it's like a very like smooth beach probably over

1938
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:40,880
there and then the other places are like hard rocks so they're like crumbly

1939
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:50,080
damn geography or geometry now i know geology probably

1940
03:32:50,880 --> 03:32:58,640
geologist geography geometry all of these things and more on the pro

1941
03:32:58,640 --> 03:33:09,280
procrastinator's podcast uh next next voicemail is uh was my samurai fan art wrong all along

1942
03:33:10,080 --> 03:33:17,680
three two one go in that video where oblivion fall reacts to interrupting death pig he said

1943
03:33:17,760 --> 03:33:27,040
then they fuckers have canon designs but where why did i never saw these where are they um

1944
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:36,240
the canon designs have been shown on the pcp um the only i remember drinking by the way this is

1945
03:33:36,240 --> 03:33:43,280
from drinking moth i remember i'm drinking moth oh yeah i remember drinking moth drawings i

1946
03:33:43,280 --> 03:33:48,720
considered those to be the closest thing to canon i love drinking moth drawings i mean like

1947
03:33:48,720 --> 03:33:52,800
for for some of the nade fuckers like didn't have can designs i'm i'm mainly talking

1948
03:33:53,360 --> 03:33:58,240
clusterpunk kitchen wait wait no i'm i'm stupid i'm stupid that was not from drinking moth this is

1949
03:33:58,240 --> 03:34:04,480
the wrong one this voicemail was called where are canon designs of nade fuckers i will grab

1950
03:34:04,480 --> 03:34:10,080
the canon designs if i can remember what fucking folder it is and i'm pretty sure i know where to

1951
03:34:10,080 --> 03:34:19,760
find it uh when i was editing episode 295 i'm pretty sure i grabbed them all in the show notes so

1952
03:34:21,920 --> 03:34:29,360
this is uh i'll post clusterpunk kitchen uh that's his canon design okay

1953
03:34:29,360 --> 03:34:37,840
um vem snakes change your life yeah that's that canon design and uh tapekeeper you know

1954
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:46,240
so so ben yeah the vem sexes design kind of came from you two oh yeah i i drew this

1955
03:34:47,040 --> 03:34:52,880
yeah because gib gib was so i think you designed it that specific image was four eyes maybe

1956
03:34:53,600 --> 03:34:58,000
or no maybe it wasn't actually our number i think i drew this i think four eyes might have

1957
03:34:58,000 --> 03:35:07,120
drawn something that i based this on i feel yeah i think you drew something for the episode where

1958
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:13,840
vem snakes appeared and then four eyes drew fan art and this is the fan art maybe but yeah so like

1959
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:20,160
vem snakes was originally i think i yeah vem snakes was originally green maybe it is vem

1960
03:35:20,160 --> 03:35:24,320
snakes which like when when vem snakes first appeared on the podcast i remember like devoo

1961
03:35:24,320 --> 03:35:30,400
was even there um when you're like we showed the patreon.com slash vm snakes which does exist it

1962
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:36,000
had a picture of a green snake and then gib was like oh i like to think of it as like the you know

1963
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:41,520
pump uh not only run away from snakes but were the red and black and i liked that idea so i took

1964
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:50,320
i took that oh that's why did i say that back then yeah you suggested it um yeah you did and then

1965
03:35:50,320 --> 03:35:56,800
ben drew the snakes like weren't like in a shirt in a beanie looking like ben and that was great

1966
03:35:56,800 --> 03:36:01,840
and i'm like yeah this is just yeah this is canon now yeah so i remember canon designs

1967
03:36:02,480 --> 03:36:08,160
i had forgotten but yeah i remember that the tapekeeper is this guy from lesbian horse rpg

1968
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:17,120
and i don't that's not his obviously that's not his canon his name in that game

1974
03:36:48,960 --> 03:36:52,960
all the fan art i've seen is equally valid i've seen a few different interpretations and they're

1975
03:36:52,960 --> 03:37:00,800
all fun so okay so the next one is actually was my samurai fan art wait what is this that's the

1984
03:37:56,480 --> 03:38:02,960
samurai incarnated as mage's baby girl and mage lives in lythuania that was the idea behind the

1985
03:38:02,960 --> 03:38:17,760
image that's good that's good that's good no it's ma- maize baby uh ma- ma- ma- ma- ma- ma- ma-

1987
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:38,320
to be in a relationship with trixie slash digi aka the real digi bro because the the the title was

1988
03:38:38,320 --> 03:38:45,200
transferred officially at one point and never reclaimed so may is walking around out there

1989
03:38:45,200 --> 03:38:50,000
right now just being the real digi bro and nobody knows yeah even she doesn't know

1990
03:38:50,720 --> 03:38:57,120
mage is different but uh that art you drew is extremely fucking cute and good and great

1991
03:38:57,120 --> 03:39:03,680
from last episode but i get it but now i understand why she's lythuanian and that's

1992
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:11,920
extremely funny uh i guess there's two i guess there's two

1993
03:39:16,880 --> 03:39:22,400
you can't it's it's canon everything's canon um shoot me with it please

1994
03:39:22,640 --> 03:39:34,240
next uh voicemail is called um did i did i post it uh ben versus vtuber three two one go

1995
03:39:35,840 --> 03:39:40,640
you know ben you're free to express your opinions and shit you don't have to explain yourself to

1996
03:39:40,640 --> 03:39:45,760
anyone either but when you go out of your way to target people with your ire and then not explain

1997
03:39:45,760 --> 03:39:50,480
yourself you come off like a real inconsiderate asshole then you go on to badmouth people for

1998
03:39:50,480 --> 03:39:55,600
being unthoughtful like what's his face patent manning or whatever patent manning what kind of

1999
03:39:55,600 --> 03:40:00,160
hypocrisy is that who the fuck are you to tell people what they should and shouldn't be liking or

2000
03:40:00,160 --> 03:40:06,880
doing and you find to hate it but when you bring that to their attention unprovoked uh you're just

2001
03:40:06,880 --> 03:40:14,160
starting a fight you're making the world a worse place shut up shut up pussy fight me i mean i do

2002
03:40:14,160 --> 03:40:20,640
kind of agree with it though in just the sense that it's like it's totally meaningless that it

2003
03:40:20,640 --> 03:40:27,360
like is has become a thing and it's entirely because you decided to like poke the bear i guess

2004
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:34,640
like that there was that one the one twitter thing if someone makes a bad post that you don't

2005
03:40:34,640 --> 03:40:40,240
like the reasonable reaction is to reply and say i don't like this now that part is fine but like

2006
03:40:40,240 --> 03:40:46,080
it's the it's the like acting them with the episode where we talk about it like well that was

2007
03:40:46,080 --> 03:40:52,480
because she screen she did the screenshot pity thing so i feel like she opened i feel like she

2008
03:40:52,480 --> 03:41:01,040
was the aggressor i mean i guess i i made the i made the replies for look who cares whatever

2009
03:41:03,600 --> 03:41:08,320
this is the biggest fucking non issue that's ever happened i i don't like this post and then

2010
03:41:08,400 --> 03:41:14,640
they're like like i i agree ben comes across as a fucking villain all the time it's what it's

2011
03:41:14,640 --> 03:41:20,000
what he does it's what you're good at but like all all this shit is so inconsequential at the end

2012
03:41:20,000 --> 03:41:24,480
of the day because it's like cool i don't like i don't like a post by vtuber and then the vtuber

2013
03:41:24,480 --> 03:41:29,920
in character is like what are you doing and it's like i don't i don't have to answer to you like

2014
03:41:29,920 --> 03:41:35,200
imagine saying that i'm making that i made the world a worse place that part isn't like whatever

2015
03:41:35,200 --> 03:41:42,480
but yeah like like i can understand thinking it's a bad look or whatever but like sure whatever

2016
03:41:42,480 --> 03:41:48,800
bends no stranger to that like that's not new like who cares just like like like do you do you

2017
03:41:48,800 --> 03:41:55,120
think that i didn't know that like by telling this ooh i am a little baby on twitter like

2018
03:41:55,120 --> 03:42:01,440
fuck yourself do you think i didn't know that i kind of look like the asshole sure of course

2019
03:42:01,520 --> 03:42:09,120
yes it's fine though actually it's good sometimes whatever i don't i don't trust any vtuber who like

2020
03:42:10,320 --> 03:42:17,360
like plays off the ooh i'm a baby fang it's it's it's it's a little little suss little i just don't

2021
03:42:17,360 --> 03:42:23,760
i don't like the tone of it i don't like seeing it uh you know she can do what she wants i can't

2022
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:28,960
stop her and i wouldn't i wouldn't stop her if i could like whatever i just but i don't have but

2023
03:42:28,960 --> 03:42:35,840
i don't have to like it sure sure i just feel and you know i would not have like tried to like

2024
03:42:35,840 --> 03:42:43,680
instigate anything further because it's not important yeah well and and indeed and indeed it

2025
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:53,120
it's uh i don't know you know i just she like because she was making posts about it like she

2026
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:59,440
was using it for attention so like what's so like why not why not make a post about it

2027
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:05,680
and add her with it like she doesn't mind she she likes it she it was good for her like she's

2028
03:43:05,680 --> 03:43:11,200
welcome i literally did her a favor and idiots like this are like oh ben you're such a demon

2029
03:43:12,480 --> 03:43:17,680
ben how could you that's a child ben that's a child you're attacking you bully put yourself

2030
03:43:17,680 --> 03:43:22,960
in her shoes for a second if someone if i made a post and so i'm quote retweeted she she unblocked

2031
03:43:22,960 --> 03:43:28,160
me she's she unblocked me after a while she screenshotted that she had blocked me and then

2032
03:43:28,160 --> 03:43:34,240
she unblocked me and then i added her again and she screenshotted me and said i'm blocking him again

2033
03:43:34,240 --> 03:43:40,000
he's like why would you why would you unblock me it's because you fucking want it you dumb idiot

2034
03:43:40,000 --> 03:43:45,680
it's because you like to play the victim you're welcome imagine for a second and i i can imagine

2035
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:50,080
that's easily because i am a content creator imagine i post a thing post a little meme for

2036
03:43:50,080 --> 03:43:55,200
my followers and some person gets mad like screen quote retweets and be like oh this is dumb am i

2037
03:43:55,920 --> 03:44:01,520
going to like what what is the appropriate action from there i would probably just fucking ignore

2038
03:44:01,520 --> 03:44:07,840
it and move on but they decided to screenshot it and make a thing out of it and knowing that it

2039
03:44:07,840 --> 03:44:12,560
would probably get more responses from you but it's like it's like the transaction they signed up for

2040
03:44:12,560 --> 03:44:15,920
like i'm gonna yeah more attention to this and that person's probably gonna also bring more

2041
03:44:15,920 --> 03:44:20,720
yeah they they chose to bring more attention to it they made a decision that is what they want it's

2042
03:44:20,720 --> 03:44:25,520
clearly what they i think i think people that say stuff like this just don't understand like they

2043
03:44:25,520 --> 03:44:31,440
don't understand that this is that this is a content creator who is doing this to like manage

2044
03:44:31,440 --> 03:44:38,800
their fucking public profile right and i and if you maybe if you don't get that maybe you think i

2045
03:44:38,800 --> 03:44:45,920
you think i'm just bullying a baby and then okay whatever like many it's it's it's almost manufactured

2046
03:44:45,920 --> 03:44:51,840
drama that is it's like it feels like a transaction of like all right i'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna

2047
03:44:51,840 --> 03:44:56,000
have this little beef and get some attention for ourselves that's how it seems to me and like

2048
03:44:56,000 --> 03:44:59,840
right or whatever like i know i know with you you're just fucking having fun you always seem

2049
03:44:59,840 --> 03:45:06,960
like you're having fun when you do this shit so sometimes the you're you're always crowing like

2050
03:45:07,520 --> 03:45:14,320
ooh we talked about this on this pcp whoo-hoo and i'm like oh no yeah funny ben's at it again

2051
03:45:14,320 --> 03:45:19,600
being i i i i did that to be like i did that just to see what what kind of reaction it would get

2052
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:26,880
and it and it got it it got the same one again like uh ben is the mean this ben saint character

2053
03:45:26,880 --> 03:45:34,960
i try i tried to be reasonable but you're just too evil just too evil and vicious

2054
03:45:35,920 --> 03:45:42,400
it is amusing think about the the because like it really does seem like some people

2055
03:45:42,400 --> 03:45:48,000
aren't aware it's like it's not it's not actually a little baby you know they're they're not they're

2056
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:55,040
not they're not responding as if this is like two adults like making decisions about how to handle

2057
03:45:55,040 --> 03:46:00,000
an interaction this is they're responding as though i kicked over a little kid saying castle

2058
03:46:00,000 --> 03:46:07,040
and he's crying and i'm laughing at him yeah like i i wouldn't do that i don't like conflict on

2059
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:12,560
my page i like to keep my page conflict free but that's i get that's for me that's for me i get

2060
03:46:12,560 --> 03:46:19,840
i totally understand why a person wouldn't do this yeah you can handle it you're a big boy

2061
03:46:19,840 --> 03:46:27,840
and very wherever they admit it or not they're a big girl um yeah it's fine that's right um

2062
03:46:28,720 --> 03:46:33,520
my my headphones broke so i was gone for a bit there i'm using my earbuds now

2063
03:46:34,880 --> 03:46:40,640
glad glad you're back uh yeah we're we're like we're actually wait are we almost done

2064
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:48,480

2065
03:46:48,480 --> 03:46:56,240

2067
03:47:00,800 --> 03:47:06,720
i i get like ten times to find this there is not your game this has been pointed out to me before

2068
03:47:06,720 --> 03:47:15,760
there is a roller coaster called the phantom's revenge uh very unfortunate for for search engine

2069
03:47:15,840 --> 03:47:24,560
optimization perhaps perhaps uh actually yeah i think it well you can find it easily on itch

2070
03:47:24,560 --> 03:47:27,920
if you google the phantom's revenge yeah you can't find it so that's too bad

2071
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:35,520
there's google slime and punishment instead uh next one is called ben just turn off tweet

2072
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:42,480
recommendations vtuber problem solved can i do that though i feel like i still get

2073
03:47:42,480 --> 03:47:47,600
topic recommendations all the time i think there are like maybe there are options i have

2074
03:47:47,600 --> 03:47:53,120
browser extensions to do that for for twitter if not the settings themselves

2075
03:47:53,920 --> 03:48:03,040
oh browser extensions uh there's ways i assume maybe there maybe there are ways maybe there

2076
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:08,240
are ways to avoid it that i haven't looked into the next one is a question or it says it says you

2106
03:52:16,640 --> 03:52:21,040
bigger kitchen i need a bigger kitchen to make my worms and now i can i can make these tiny

2107
03:52:21,040 --> 03:52:26,240
little micro batches and like that's fine but what a waste of time i'll never forgive veggie

2108
03:52:26,240 --> 03:52:33,200
tails for like changing that episode because there's the bunny song where they're singing about who

2109
03:52:33,200 --> 03:52:38,000
i'm a i'm a villain i'm not gonna go to church i'm not gonna go to school i just want to eat

2110
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:44,720
fucking bunnies all day what the fuck yeah and they were like um um you're not going to church um

2111
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:52,320
you better change those lyrics and then it's like okay i i won't eat tofu it's a new lyric it sucks

2112
03:52:53,360 --> 03:53:00,640
wait like in the episode they tell him to change the song no no no no like the episode got re-released

2113
03:53:00,640 --> 03:53:05,840
with the lyrics change because parents complained instead of i won't go to school it's i won't eat

2114
03:53:05,840 --> 03:53:14,320
tofu yeah it's it's it sucks but he's a villain he's a villain and now it's now it's now it's about

2115
03:53:14,320 --> 03:53:21,040
eating healthy instead of like like the original the original like theme was like cancel culture gone

2116
03:53:21,040 --> 03:53:27,120
too far it's so it's just a weaker theme because the original theme is like being like too obsessed

2117
03:53:27,120 --> 03:53:32,800
with material things where it distracts you from jesus and now it's about i just eat healthy like

2118
03:53:32,880 --> 03:53:37,200
that's a that's a weaker message for what i think they would want i don't know

2119
03:53:38,320 --> 03:53:46,160
yeah uh i didn't i did not know that but that's odd that's really weird like why would they have a

2120
03:53:46,160 --> 03:53:50,880
problem with why would it be a problem that the villain says he's not going to go to church

2121
03:53:52,960 --> 03:53:57,440
i don't understand i don't know villains can understand the motivation because then it's

2122
03:53:57,440 --> 03:54:04,080
encouraging us to be bad you see but but he gets punished i think in the end maybe somehow

2123
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:07,520
or he has to change her heart or something you see at the end there's like oh it changed my

2124
03:54:07,520 --> 03:54:16,720
ways because it was bad okay okay okay next voicemail uh there's two with the same name

2152
03:57:21,120 --> 03:57:26,720
clairvoyance to this position gives me to talk down to you specifically ben seni i do not understand

2153
03:57:26,720 --> 03:57:32,960
the position you have uh not being somebody earthy uh explaining your position and assuming them

2154
03:57:33,680 --> 03:57:41,920
to just clairvoyantly assume your position and what is directly on our own uh about their their

2155
03:57:41,920 --> 03:57:48,800
shit uh you just just explain yourself like you did in the podcast to make no more sense i already

2156
03:57:48,800 --> 03:57:54,320
agreed to see but i grew through more and better after i listened to you explain the fucking vtuber

2157
03:57:54,320 --> 03:58:02,080
thing uh please on twitter.com slash it's also ugly or abitual no whatever the fuck explain

2158
03:58:02,080 --> 03:58:08,800
yourself instead of just like posting funny ha ha dunks uh i just i twitter points uh i don't

2159
03:58:08,880 --> 03:58:14,240
want to talk to that person i don't want i don't care if they understand i don't want to talk to

2160
03:58:14,240 --> 03:58:21,840
them there's also like you can't convey tone in a tweet it's going to be misread like trying to

2161
03:58:21,840 --> 03:58:27,040
explain yourself on twitter is the biggest mistake you can ever make when yeah like if you generally

2162
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:30,720
want people to understand you that's not how you get people to understand you they're going to twist

2163
03:58:30,720 --> 03:58:38,320
something you've said i yeah i i agree it sounds just the thought of trying to like explain what i

2164
03:58:38,320 --> 03:58:46,000
mean in a tweet thread on twitter just makes me like sick like i i i i i just i'm not willing to do

2165
03:58:46,000 --> 03:58:51,600
it it's it's a nightmare i mean i agree with that that's why i wouldn't like say anything

2166
03:58:53,360 --> 03:58:59,200
i wouldn't just i just i wouldn't make the point if i wasn't ready to explain it i'm willing to

2167
03:58:59,200 --> 03:59:05,680
make the point i'm just not willing to explain it and i guess the fault and i guess the consequences

2168
03:59:05,680 --> 03:59:11,600
people like this yeah i once was asked for voice acting hot takes someone said post your

2169
03:59:11,600 --> 03:59:17,760
voice acting hot takes and i'm like well i think the quality of dubbing of any kind regardless

2170
03:59:17,760 --> 03:59:24,560
of whether it's anime or not just tends to be worse quality performance compared to the original

2171
03:59:24,560 --> 03:59:30,240
and there's also like you know i just prefer to watch things in their original form because

2172
03:59:30,240 --> 03:59:33,760
it's going to be closer to the original vision of the people making it and that's just better

2173
03:59:33,760 --> 03:59:39,520
especially cross-cultural cultural where certain things get localized and it just

2174
03:59:39,520 --> 03:59:45,840
takes away from the original intent and at the same time and it goes both ways because people who

2175
03:59:45,840 --> 03:59:50,480
you know i all i think it's cringe when people watch my little pony in japanese because they

2176
03:59:50,480 --> 03:59:54,320
want it to be like an anime like that's also cringe like watch english things in english

2177
03:59:54,320 --> 04:00:01,520
watch japanese things in japanese i made that tweet i got yeah screenshot it by a fucking person

2178
04:00:01,520 --> 04:00:06,880
who i won't name but she has she had like a decent following calling me ableist saying that

2179
04:00:06,880 --> 04:00:12,240
i was attacking dyslexic people who can't read subtitles when i never mentioned anything about

2180
04:00:12,240 --> 04:00:16,560
subtitles at all i just talked about the quality of the voice acting and she like this this horrible

2181
04:00:16,560 --> 04:00:20,400
person like like is is ableist and all this shit and she made this huge friend and a bunch of her

2182
04:00:20,400 --> 04:00:26,720
followers came after me and i'm like i never said yeah even in the screenshot i didn't say anything

2183
04:00:26,800 --> 04:00:30,960
like that i don't even see the connection so like that can happen and that and that was when

2184
04:00:30,960 --> 04:00:35,680
i kind of realized i'm just never gonna post an opinion on twitter ever again no matter how innocuous

2185
04:00:35,680 --> 04:00:40,240
it's just not worth it because i had to spend like two whole days that's fair dealing with that

2186
04:00:40,240 --> 04:00:45,360
shit and somehow a bunch of my friends got convinced by it i had to like explain to them

2187
04:00:45,360 --> 04:00:49,440
that's not what i said please actually read my tweets and then they will eventually like

2188
04:00:49,440 --> 04:00:55,280
after fighting with them over huge friends they were eventually like oh i see i guess you never

2189
04:00:55,280 --> 04:01:06,640
said that yeah it's so weird that like oops it's like what sort of people would hear on the grape

2190
04:01:06,640 --> 04:01:12,880
find that oh oblivion fall is ableist now and just immediately agree with that and just assume it's

2191
04:01:12,880 --> 04:01:20,720
true oh damn instead of like checking i hate that like that's my my my hate that for oblivion fall

2192
04:01:20,720 --> 04:01:27,520
my husband fucking hates dubbing of all kinds he's dyslexic too he can fucking read it

2193
04:01:28,400 --> 04:01:33,280
fine yeah like i don't know yeah like even if that was something i said i don't even think it's

2194
04:01:33,280 --> 04:01:38,560
accurate i think this was the is the i've been told dyslexia is mostly an issue with like paragraphs

2195
04:01:38,560 --> 04:01:48,080
more than single lines is it is the idea that because you said you prefer uh dub subs to dubs

2196
04:01:48,160 --> 04:01:55,600
that yeah i prefer so well well well dyslexic people need need dubs so you are attacking us

2197
04:01:56,160 --> 04:02:01,680
yeah it's like and i i immediately my response was you can do you do you i'm just saying what i

2198
04:02:01,680 --> 04:02:05,600
prefer um and what i think sounds better but like it's up to you what you do and like they

2199
04:02:05,600 --> 04:02:08,960
are like oh so you're saying people can't watch from me saying we should stop and we're saying we

2200
04:02:08,960 --> 04:02:15,280
should boycott him it's like yeah i did i didn't say that and when i tell them i didn't say that

2201
04:02:15,280 --> 04:02:20,160
oh so now you're backpedaling it's like i never said it in the fucking first place like yeah this

2202
04:02:20,160 --> 04:02:29,120
isn't backpedaling what the fuck that was so horrible i was i was um okay i mentioned i mentioned

2203
04:02:29,120 --> 04:02:36,000
last week some some people some people that were my friends that decided they didn't like me and then

2204
04:02:36,000 --> 04:02:41,920
decided to go and spread lies not even about me so much about other people i guess out of spite

2205
04:02:41,920 --> 04:02:47,280
or in retaliation or something and i was talking to some people about the some people had heard

2206
04:02:47,280 --> 04:02:52,320
some of that stuff and i was talking to them trying to explain what that was all about and it was

2207
04:02:52,320 --> 04:03:00,720
really frustrating to hear to see a lot some people's response was i'm i'm trying to convince them

2208
04:03:00,720 --> 04:03:07,520
these these things that they said so and so did are are simply fabricated it's not it's not true

2209
04:03:07,520 --> 04:03:14,080
like it's just made up and and some people's response was to be like well okay but like

2210
04:03:14,080 --> 04:03:19,920
it's not like they technically said it was a crime or anything like they just like they're just saying

2211
04:03:19,920 --> 04:03:23,040
that they did they're just saying they think it's fucked up that they did it not that it's like a

2212
04:03:23,040 --> 04:03:28,720
crime or anything and i'm like you you dense fuck the point is it's not true in the first place

2213
04:03:28,720 --> 04:03:36,160
it doesn't matter whether like what like what the like what the what these are details that are missing

2214
04:03:36,160 --> 04:03:41,680
the entire point right yeah these are these are these are things have i said too much have i gone

2215
04:03:41,680 --> 04:03:47,760
to have i explained too much about the situation oh you're fine i hope i hope not okay i don't want

2216
04:03:47,760 --> 04:03:52,560
to get into details about it but it's like these are these are it's and suddenly it's like well now

2217
04:03:53,520 --> 04:03:59,360
you know i i don't i they're trying to make me split hairs trying to make me split hairs on a

2218
04:03:59,360 --> 04:04:04,240
subject that is not even not even really germane to the point because it's like well they've

2219
04:04:04,240 --> 04:04:09,280
we've already assumed that this thing we heard is true because we heard it and now the onus is on

2220
04:04:09,280 --> 04:04:14,480
you to well well you know if you're gonna make these extraordinary claims that that thing we heard

2221
04:04:14,480 --> 04:04:20,000
wasn't true you know you've got to supply evidence of that but like we just believed the initial

2222
04:04:20,000 --> 04:04:24,320
claim with no evidence at all just because i know just because someone said it just because

2223
04:04:24,320 --> 04:04:29,600
someone said i wonder why that is is it just sort of like a general predisposition to like

2224
04:04:30,240 --> 04:04:37,280
believe bad news i think so i think i think it's just i hear that somebody is like a bad person

2225
04:04:37,280 --> 04:04:43,840
now and then yeah the evidence comes out that it was a lie and it's still hard for them to like

2226
04:04:43,840 --> 04:04:49,840
like accept that because they were so ready to it just to believe that the bad news was real

2227
04:04:51,280 --> 04:04:55,280
i think it's it's just a cognitive thing like when you hear something and and you

2228
04:04:56,240 --> 04:04:59,840
you know it doesn't conflict with any previous information you have you're inclined to just

2229
04:04:59,840 --> 04:05:04,160
be like oh okay i've learned something i guess but then when you hear some new information that

2230
04:05:04,160 --> 04:05:10,160
does conflict with the old information you're like huh well that's that's a conflict there's

2231
04:05:10,160 --> 04:05:17,760
some there's some conflicting information here well we gotta i can't just i can't just believe this

2232
04:05:18,480 --> 04:05:23,120
because i had thought something else i don't know it's just what the jargon was called out for

2233
04:05:23,120 --> 04:05:26,800
basically with like the vaccine like someone's like oh did you hear that the vaccine has this

2234
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:30,880
crazy side effect makes your eyeballs fall out and he's like whoa that's crazy and then if you

2235
04:05:31,760 --> 04:05:35,600
that's not the case he's like um i'm gonna need some evidence that that doesn't happen yeah yeah

2236
04:05:35,600 --> 04:05:40,000
but somebody but somebody else told me but some yeah it is yeah but somebody else told me that it is

2237
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:45,760
and like yeah didn't didn't require any evidence for the initial claim but if you try to dispute it

2238
04:05:45,760 --> 04:05:53,760
it's like well prove it prove it motherfucker yeah it should never believe anything like honestly

2239
04:05:53,760 --> 04:06:03,120
true i'm sure it comes i'm sure the evolutionary reason is caution is generally good in a lot of

2240
04:06:03,120 --> 04:06:10,320
situations better better safe than sorry like works oh there might be a tiger i i heard something in

2241
04:06:10,320 --> 04:06:15,040
that in that cave there might be something in there a tiger or a fucking bear or some

2242
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:21,760
shit um uh better to be cautious than to just be like oh well you know like maybe maybe some

2243
04:06:21,760 --> 04:06:27,520
person person goes into caves says hey there's no tiger it's like um well i don't know i heard

2244
04:06:27,520 --> 04:06:33,760
noise i'm uneasy you can't prove that there's no tiger because the tiger could just be hiding

2245
04:06:33,760 --> 04:06:40,560
but i think it's a combination of those things people are more cautious they want to agree they

2246
04:06:40,560 --> 04:06:46,160
want to believe the bad news because if it if it turns out that they're correct that the bad news

2247
04:06:46,160 --> 04:06:53,920
is true um then they can save themselves from it or whatever they can they can survive longer

2248
04:06:54,560 --> 04:07:01,840
from the tiger in the cave what if a tiger what what was that cave like that parable of the people

2249
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:07,600
in the cave with the shadows on the wall plateaus yeah plateaus came what if a tiger just came in

2250
04:07:07,840 --> 04:07:15,760
there and they killed them off i then i guess they'd be 10 they'd see the shadow of the tiger on

2251
04:07:15,760 --> 04:07:21,440
the wall as it was coming towards them and they'd be like oh whoa a tiger and then but unlike all

2252
04:07:21,440 --> 04:07:28,240
the previous tigers they'd seen this one eats them yeah damn that's a really makes you think

2253
04:07:28,800 --> 04:07:31,360
that's a real heads maybe a little

2254
04:07:34,160 --> 04:07:36,480
the next voicemail is an image

2255
04:07:41,840 --> 04:07:45,760
yeah i i don't know what this dog is but i can infer

2256
04:07:46,640 --> 04:07:51,680
is it like is it is it like um the inspiration for that future rama dog

2257
04:07:52,000 --> 04:08:00,080
sort of sort of that waits for his master forever yes there was a japanese dog who

2258
04:08:00,720 --> 04:08:06,240
he would follow his master to the train every day and then he would wait for him at the train at the

2259
04:08:06,240 --> 04:08:13,040
end of the day and meet him there and one day the master died at work and uh the dog just kept

2260
04:08:13,040 --> 04:08:25,200
coming to the train every day for the rest of his life oh no watch yeah shcw videos he's you're

2266
04:08:57,920 --> 04:09:04,080

04:09:19,280 --> 04:09:22,800
who had been locked away by egg man in secret after his supposed death at the end of sonic

2271
04:09:22,800 --> 04:09:26,800
adventure two he rebels against egg man for locking him away and vows to destroy all egg

2272
04:09:26,800 --> 04:09:31,680
man robots to prove his superiority adventure two takes place between sonic adventure and sonic

2273
04:09:31,680 --> 04:09:36,880

2309
04:14:26,000 --> 04:14:31,920
people disagree on the internet you may have fights on twitter.com but it's just it's all it's all

2315
04:15:06,720 --> 04:15:16,960
uh it's not related to that other riley riley tweets is some guy i don't know i think he's

2316
04:15:16,960 --> 04:15:22,880
got a podcast i think one of the other people on that podcast asked me to be on one time and i

2317
04:15:22,880 --> 04:15:29,520
said yes sure i would and then i got really mad because i one of the right riley or that other

2318
04:15:29,520 --> 04:15:34,880
person was like simping for trixie in some comments and i was like fuck you i won't be on your stupid

2319
04:15:34,880 --> 04:15:41,120
podcast so these people are trixie heads as far as i'm concerned so they're they're they're dogs

2320
04:15:42,080 --> 04:15:49,200
so i'm not unblocking immediately unburying the hatchet yeah no he can bury his hatchet if he

2321
04:15:49,200 --> 04:15:58,240
wants mine is saying out and ready ready for action next one is called vtuber more like ppooper

2322
04:15:58,240 --> 04:16:02,720
three two one go i think i understand what ben was saying last week about small vtuber

2323
04:16:02,720 --> 04:16:06,400
communities so it's kind of hard to articulate so let me know if i'm not quite right here it

2324
04:16:06,400 --> 04:16:10,160
reminds me of the phenomenon of shout-out channels on youtube that just turn out video

2325
04:16:10,160 --> 04:16:13,680
spotlighting random let's players who don't have a following of course if you look at the

2326
04:16:13,680 --> 04:16:17,280
comments of those videos they're just filled with people begging for shout-outs nobody there was

2327
04:16:17,280 --> 04:16:21,440
actually in the market to find new let's players to watch it's just a promotional theater where the

2328
04:16:21,440 --> 04:16:25,440
only one getting anything out of it is the channel owner exploiting gullible people yeah i think the

2329
04:16:25,440 --> 04:16:29,840
thing that makes this feel so despicable is that said gullible people don't understand that they

2330
04:16:29,840 --> 04:16:34,480
don't know the first thing about developing a social media presence so instead they shamelessly

2331
04:16:34,480 --> 04:16:38,560
latch onto this idea that the only thing between them and the youtube career of their dreams is

2332
04:16:38,560 --> 04:16:42,880
just the right shout-out it's a pathetic waste of time from people who want success but refuse to

2333
04:16:42,880 --> 04:16:46,720
reckon with the fact that it's just out of their reach here and this sort of thing is all over the

2334
04:16:46,720 --> 04:16:51,120
place in every form of content creation when it comes to small vtubers it's perfectly fine if

2335
04:16:51,120 --> 04:16:55,200
you actually do just have a tiny community of people you enjoy but i've gotten the sense myself

2336
04:16:55,200 --> 04:16:58,960
that most of them are just there to use each other despite the fact that it's a zero-sum game

2337
04:16:58,960 --> 04:17:03,280
where there's no growth potential but since they never admit to any of that themselves they just

2338
04:17:03,280 --> 04:17:07,120
pretend that everything is going great and all they need to do is support each other they made a

2339
04:17:07,120 --> 04:17:11,680
comparison to the crypto we're all going to make it mentality and i feel like that's extremely apt

2340
04:17:11,680 --> 04:17:16,720
it's simply crafting a mass delusion for each other but i could be wrong i don't really follow

2341
04:17:16,720 --> 04:17:23,120
vtubers what do i know that is a much i think you said it better than i did but i agree with

2342
04:17:23,120 --> 04:17:28,720
everything see ben if you just said if you typed that out in a tweet it would have been so much

2343
04:17:28,720 --> 04:17:37,360
better yeah it's just that easy yeah i mean i i can definitely save like shout-outs absolutely

2344
04:17:37,360 --> 04:17:46,240
can make a career for you if you're already doing like good high quality shit well of course you know

2345
04:17:46,240 --> 04:17:52,240
like yeah when i mean something when it's when it's yeah when it's to an audience of people

2346
04:17:52,960 --> 04:17:59,360
who are not looking for shout-outs themselves it means something if it's just a regular audience

2347
04:17:59,360 --> 04:18:05,360
of normal people wanting to see things yeah yeah like the audience has to be people who are interested

2348
04:18:05,360 --> 04:18:10,960
in the in the in what you actually have so like when i get a retweet from krakow unlike a work in

2349
04:18:10,960 --> 04:18:16,480
progress my patreon would jump up $50 that day like that that would happen um just a retweet

2350
04:18:16,480 --> 04:18:22,320
from one guy um you know big twitter artist retweeting small artists you know just just like

2351
04:18:22,320 --> 04:18:27,520
cheesy said like it can have an effect but it's because he predicted everything but it's because

2352
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:33,840
the stuff i'm making is pretty good i think um if i was just like not making anything that interesting

2353
04:18:33,840 --> 04:18:39,200
i probably wouldn't get a boost like that so like it could definitely help but like yeah like these

2354
04:18:39,200 --> 04:18:45,440
communities it's like everyone's just fair for a shout-out yeah like the people the the the

2355
04:18:45,440 --> 04:18:49,600
number of like people who are actually like consuming their stuff is like small unless the

2356
04:18:49,600 --> 04:18:53,360
shout-out comes from like one of the big hollow life people it's not really going to do much

2357
04:18:53,360 --> 04:19:02,640
of anything yeah it reminds me of like um it reminds me of like uh a big big joel made a video

2358
04:19:02,640 --> 04:19:09,680
about small youtube reddit where like there was that one guy or something like that where there was

2359
04:19:09,680 --> 04:19:16,960
a guy who was just making i don't know there was a there was a specifically it was about one guy a

2360
04:19:16,960 --> 04:19:22,880
case study in like but it was talking about like on reddit there'd be like subreddits of people

2361
04:19:23,440 --> 04:19:27,440
that are just there to like ask like how do i grow my channel like how do i grow my channel

2362
04:19:27,440 --> 04:19:32,400
like just talking to each other just guys talking to each other about like how they're going to

2363
04:19:32,400 --> 04:19:38,800
grow their channel like i'm caring guy who doesn't have a large channel responds yes yes exactly it's

2364
04:19:38,800 --> 04:19:42,640
like oh no you got to do this you got to be doing that you got to be doing such and such and so and

2365
04:19:42,640 --> 04:19:47,520
so i like i read about it or like another guy i know did that and it worked or something

2366
04:19:48,480 --> 04:19:57,120
and it's and and it's like you know uh like like nobody goes or or on like the the

2367
04:19:57,120 --> 04:20:03,680
topastic forums like i feel like people comic creators would be there like posting about their

2368
04:20:03,680 --> 04:20:08,720
comics like hoping that people would find them and read them but the only other people on those

2369
04:20:08,720 --> 04:20:14,480
forums were other comic creators that were there to they were there to either discuss making comics

2370
04:20:14,560 --> 04:20:22,000
or to shill their own stuff so nobody was there to find yeah stuff to read i think it's a skill in

2371
04:20:22,000 --> 04:20:31,440
itself to like to know where to advertise it's like i i remember this this um there was this uh

2372
04:20:31,440 --> 04:20:39,120
reddit that i would occasionally put my hypocrite game reviews on is a game reviewer uh subreddit

2373
04:20:39,120 --> 04:20:45,600
where game reviewers would put their game reviews and there was no upvotes there was no nothing

2374
04:20:46,240 --> 04:20:52,240
no discussion nobody cared but it was just like yeah like oh yeah i guess i got to post

2375
04:20:52,240 --> 04:20:58,720
things but like this doesn't i there's no there's no one here no one is going to see this and like

2376
04:20:58,720 --> 04:21:05,680
find me so i stopped doing it it's just there's there's too many places like that too many people

2377
04:21:05,680 --> 04:21:11,920
trying to make art more people need to stop trying and just watch my content instead

2378
04:21:16,000 --> 04:21:23,280
yeah it's i think this this guy said it pretty well yeah like this voicemail better than colabbing

2379
04:21:23,280 --> 04:21:28,480
is sorry better than shout outs is collabing the problem is like not everyone's down for that

2380
04:21:29,520 --> 04:21:34,400
um yeah like some some good advice i've heard is like and again these things the stuff only

2381
04:21:34,400 --> 04:21:38,720
works if you're good at what you do because if you suck no one's going to come over yeah just be

2382
04:21:38,720 --> 04:21:44,880
really good like yeah i mean it's as simple as that no that's not the only thing but like if if if

2383
04:21:44,880 --> 04:21:49,760
you think that you're good and promise a lot of people who are bad think they are good but

2384
04:21:50,320 --> 04:21:55,040
getting getting around that hurdle like find people of a similar size to you to collab with

2385
04:21:55,040 --> 04:21:58,400
and then both of you might get a little bit bigger in fact the smaller you are the more

2386
04:21:58,400 --> 04:22:03,280
effective it is because the less chance your audience overlaps um and then that'll make you a

2387
04:22:03,280 --> 04:22:06,240
little bigger and then find someone else who's closer to your new size a little bigger and you

2388
04:22:06,240 --> 04:22:12,320
can sort of like hop back and forth up the ladder and eventually go big like that's a strategy i've

2389
04:22:12,320 --> 04:22:19,520
heard of that can work but you have to like be able to bring something to the table because just

2390
04:22:19,520 --> 04:22:26,080
messaging a guy being like hey we have similar subscriber counts want to collab it's like she's

2391
04:22:26,480 --> 04:22:31,520
not necessarily gonna work like um like what like what do you mean like what do you want

2392
04:22:32,240 --> 04:22:37,760
exactly well i want to steal something that you have in exchange for nearly nothing well if you

2393
04:22:37,760 --> 04:22:42,240
have similar subscriber counts when you'd both mutually benefit is the idea but like you have

2394
04:22:42,240 --> 04:22:47,760
to like also be somewhat good at what you do or have someone to bring to the table that they would

2395
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:53,360
actually care about um never like message to collab someone and not without like having an idea

2396
04:22:53,360 --> 04:22:58,640
already as well like you always have to like absolutely it's like let's collab it's like okay

2397
04:22:58,640 --> 04:23:03,920
on what it's like oh i shit i didn't think about that oh i don't know i thought you'd tell me

04:32:19,680 --> 04:32:22,120
I think this is the same person that drew you

2472
04:32:22,120 --> 04:32:25,800

2473
04:32:25,800 --> 04:32:27,640
Oh yeah, yeah, it might be.

2474
04:32:27,640 --> 04:32:29,680
I think this is that same person.

2475
04:32:29,680 --> 04:32:31,880
Give him an inch and they'll take my splinch.

2476
04:32:31,880 --> 04:32:33,000
It's true.

2477
04:32:33,000 --> 04:32:34,520
That is what you say.

2478
04:32:34,520 --> 04:32:39,520
That I said it, now it's gotta be like a catchphrase.

2479
04:32:40,520 --> 04:32:45,520
There's no shut your fuck Gib is what I'm saying.

2480
04:32:45,520 --> 04:32:47,840

2481
04:32:47,840 --> 04:32:50,720
No, send it again, please.

2482
04:32:50,720 --> 04:32:54,480
Try again next week, I hope.

2483
04:32:54,480 --> 04:32:55,400
I hope to read.

2484
04:32:55,400 --> 04:32:56,480
Also, who are you?

2485
04:32:56,480 --> 04:32:57,840
Do you do art elsewhere?

2486
04:32:57,840 --> 04:32:58,680
I would like to follow you.

2487
04:32:58,680 --> 04:32:59,520
Also, who are you?

2488
04:32:59,520 --> 04:33:02,440
Well, at the very top, it says by new.

2489
04:33:02,440 --> 04:33:03,840
By new.

2490
04:33:03,840 --> 04:33:06,480
Well, I'm sure that'll be easy to track down.

2491
04:33:06,480 --> 04:33:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's very helpful.

2492
04:33:09,560 --> 04:33:10,880
New artist.

2493
04:33:10,880 --> 04:33:15,960
Yeah, that's not gonna get me anywhere.

2494
04:33:15,960 --> 04:33:22,960
Next one is an image, this is the last one.

2495
04:33:22,960 --> 04:33:25,800
It's giraffe rig.

2496
04:33:25,800 --> 04:33:28,960
Psychic and normal, friendly looking, quirky, funny, cute,

2497
04:33:28,960 --> 04:33:33,800
the only fucking giraffe Pokemon, the gayest IRL animal.

2498
04:33:33,800 --> 04:33:34,920
You can search it.

2499
04:33:34,920 --> 04:33:38,840
Oh, horse Pokemon equals cool moves, stump, ground, fight

2500
04:33:38,880 --> 04:33:42,560
type abilities, horse cock, horse cock.

2501
04:33:42,560 --> 04:33:44,400
Looks like it's wearing pants.

2502
04:33:44,400 --> 04:33:47,400
One piece taught us that a giraffe is a type of cow,

2503
04:33:47,400 --> 04:33:48,640
not a type of horse.

2504
04:33:48,640 --> 04:33:52,000
So get that checks out with the little weird bubbles

2505
04:33:52,000 --> 04:33:53,160
on its head.

2506
04:33:53,160 --> 04:33:56,560
Ethically diverse coloring because it has white and brown

2507
04:33:56,560 --> 04:33:58,640
because it's a white and black.

2508
04:33:58,640 --> 04:34:01,400
Yeah, and yellow like those guys and it's like those guys

2509
04:34:01,400 --> 04:34:06,240
in Star Trek with the white and black face,

2510
04:34:06,240 --> 04:34:09,880
easily fan artable, easily anthropomorphizable.

2511
04:34:09,880 --> 04:34:12,960
No, there's that one old episode from the original series

2512
04:34:12,960 --> 04:34:16,240
where the guys whose faces are literally splitting black

2513
04:34:16,240 --> 04:34:17,840
and white like half down their face.

2514
04:34:17,840 --> 04:34:19,760
Like that Zetsu from Naruto.

2515
04:34:21,360 --> 04:34:22,480
Probably.

2516
04:34:22,480 --> 04:34:26,880
He's like a plant man and he's black and white and a plant.

2517
04:34:26,880 --> 04:34:28,920
Freakish chimera creature with two heads,

2518
04:34:28,920 --> 04:34:30,720
360 lookout view, never lonely,

2519
04:34:30,720 --> 04:34:32,800
self-masterbutory capabilities.

2520
04:34:32,840 --> 04:34:33,720
Guess what, buddy?

2521
04:34:33,720 --> 04:34:36,720
I too have self-masterbutory capabilities

2522
04:34:36,720 --> 04:34:40,200
and I can tell you they're a huge evolutionary advantage.

2523
04:34:40,200 --> 04:34:42,200
So I agree.

2524
04:34:43,080 --> 04:34:44,880
This one has no evolution,

2525
04:34:44,880 --> 04:34:46,840
even weird or doesn't lose its identity.

2526
04:34:46,840 --> 04:34:50,600
Yeah, I can see the appeal of giraffe rig.

2527
04:34:50,600 --> 04:34:52,440
I've never really looked too hard at it

2528
04:34:52,440 --> 04:34:54,360
because it's like, ah, it's just sort of an animal

2529
04:34:54,360 --> 04:34:57,360
but it does have a very odd tail.

2530
04:34:57,360 --> 04:35:01,040
Psychic normal is a good type combo.

2531
04:35:02,040 --> 04:35:05,080
I think normal nullifies both of psychics,

2532
04:35:05,080 --> 04:35:07,240
or two out of psychics, three weaknesses.

2533
04:35:07,240 --> 04:35:09,720
Psychic nullifies normal's only weakness.

2534
04:35:10,560 --> 04:35:12,320
Like that's pretty good.

2535
04:35:12,320 --> 04:35:14,000
You can't, it's undeniable.

2536
04:35:15,280 --> 04:35:16,800
Why does it say wrong at the top?

2537
04:35:16,800 --> 04:35:19,280
Were we talking about giraffe rig?

2538
04:35:19,280 --> 04:35:20,360
Did I say something?

2539
04:35:20,360 --> 04:35:22,440
Did I cast dispersions on giraffe rig?

2540
04:35:22,440 --> 04:35:24,080
If so, I was wrong to do so.

2541
04:35:24,080 --> 04:35:27,640
Or maybe this is the voicemailer

2542
04:35:27,640 --> 04:35:30,640
who asked what your favorite gen two Pokemon is.

2543
04:35:31,800 --> 04:35:33,280
And this is a response, whatever we said.

2544
04:35:33,280 --> 04:35:35,080
Oh yes, it was.

2545
04:35:35,080 --> 04:35:39,840
Actually, it is that guy, something killer 930.

2546
04:35:39,840 --> 04:35:41,720
It's the same guy, so you're right.

2547
04:35:42,880 --> 04:35:44,680
Honestly, giraffe rig is pretty good.

2548
04:35:44,680 --> 04:35:47,960
Yeah, you've sold me with the same age.

2549
04:35:47,960 --> 04:35:48,800
Yeah.

2550
04:35:50,040 --> 04:35:52,080
All right, that's it, that's the last voicemail.

2551
04:35:52,080 --> 04:35:53,360
We're done.

2552
04:35:53,360 --> 04:35:56,280
Finally, it's been four and a half hours.

2553
04:35:56,280 --> 04:35:57,120
My God.

2554
04:35:58,160 --> 04:36:00,680
It's been almost five hours, actually.

2555
04:36:00,680 --> 04:36:02,120
Oh, really?

2556
04:36:02,120 --> 04:36:04,880
Well, no, no, four and a half.

2557
04:36:04,880 --> 04:36:06,640
Four, four 40 for me.

2558
04:36:08,280 --> 04:36:09,120
Damn.

2559
04:36:09,120 --> 04:36:09,960
Yeah.

2560
04:36:09,960 --> 04:36:10,800
Well,

2561
04:36:16,000 --> 04:36:18,360
any last words, gentlemen?

2562
04:36:18,360 --> 04:36:19,200
Gentlemen.

2563
04:36:19,200 --> 04:36:21,000
General people.

2564
04:36:21,000 --> 04:36:22,640
I'm looking at gen two Pokemon.

2565
04:36:22,640 --> 04:36:24,160
Which one do I wanna smash?

2566
04:36:24,160 --> 04:36:25,720
That's gonna be my favorite.

2567
04:36:27,200 --> 04:36:28,880
Is low-pony gen two?

2568
04:36:28,880 --> 04:36:30,840
No, that's beyond an Umbreon are in there.

2569
04:36:30,840 --> 04:36:31,800
They're decent.

2570
04:36:33,800 --> 04:36:35,840
It's really an Umbreon a lot.

2571
04:36:35,840 --> 04:36:39,040
Is that a lot in gen two that I wanna smash, to be honest?

2572
04:36:39,040 --> 04:36:41,240
I know it's a legendary and that's lame,

2573
04:36:41,240 --> 04:36:43,760
but I do kinda like Lugia.

2574
04:36:43,760 --> 04:36:45,520
I think Lugia is pretty cool.

2575
04:36:45,520 --> 04:36:48,200
Is Lugia the one with the baseball hands?

2576
04:36:48,200 --> 04:36:50,120
Baseball mitt hands, yeah.

2577
04:36:50,120 --> 04:36:51,920
Big catcher mitt hands.

2578
04:36:51,920 --> 04:36:53,760
They can catch any ball.

2579
04:36:54,760 --> 04:36:59,840
Damn, any ball, really?

2580
04:36:59,840 --> 04:37:02,320
Could even Lugia make a ball so big

2581
04:37:02,320 --> 04:37:04,640
that even he couldn't catch it?

2582
04:37:04,640 --> 04:37:06,320
Ah, it doesn't exist.

2583
04:37:08,320 --> 04:37:10,920
Oh, you know, I'm not very familiar with generation two.

2584
04:37:10,920 --> 04:37:14,720
I keep mixing up a bunch of them for being in generation three

2585
04:37:14,720 --> 04:37:19,600
because I hadn't played two when I played generation three.

2586
04:37:19,600 --> 04:37:23,680
So I assumed like Natu was generation three and stuff.

2587
04:37:24,600 --> 04:37:27,880
I didn't realize Corsola was gen two.

2588
04:37:27,880 --> 04:37:29,440
I thought he was newer than that.

2589
04:37:31,760 --> 04:37:34,840
Heracross is cool, I like Heracross a lot.

2590
04:37:36,120 --> 04:37:40,120
I like Foratress because he's a spear.

2591
04:37:40,120 --> 04:37:41,760
I do like Foratress a lot.

2592
04:37:41,760 --> 04:37:42,640
Foratress is awesome.

2593
04:37:42,640 --> 04:37:43,480
You know what?

2594
04:37:43,480 --> 04:37:45,440
I'm gonna actually gonna definitively say it's Crobat.

2595
04:37:45,440 --> 04:37:47,640
Crobat is my favorite gen two Pokemon.

2596
04:37:49,280 --> 04:37:53,280
This size or octelary is an odd one, isn't he?

2597
04:37:53,280 --> 04:37:55,440
Doesn't he evolve from just a fish?

2598
04:37:56,800 --> 04:37:58,600
Yeah, he evolves from Remorade.

2599
04:37:58,600 --> 04:38:00,120
Yeah, such a weird...

2600
04:38:00,120 --> 04:38:04,360
Did you know like Remorade is supposed to be like a gun?

2601
04:38:05,440 --> 04:38:10,080
No, you can sort of see it now,

2602
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:11,800
but like Remorade's original design,

2603
04:38:11,800 --> 04:38:13,200
they did that gen two leak.

2604
04:38:13,200 --> 04:38:15,200
Remember all those unused sprites leaked?

2605
04:38:15,200 --> 04:38:16,040
Oh, yeah.

2606
04:38:16,040 --> 04:38:16,920
From like a previous very...

2607
04:38:16,920 --> 04:38:21,120
Yeah, the older version of Remorade just looked like a gun.

2608
04:38:21,160 --> 04:38:24,160
And I think the idea was that Remorade and octelary

2609
04:38:24,160 --> 04:38:26,760
were supposed to be like a gun evolves into like a tank.

2610
04:38:26,760 --> 04:38:28,080
A Gatling gun?

2611
04:38:28,080 --> 04:38:28,920
Oh.

2612
04:38:28,920 --> 04:38:32,840
An artillery platform, which is why it's called octelary.

2613
04:38:32,840 --> 04:38:34,960
Even though there's basically nothing octelary about it,

2614
04:38:34,960 --> 04:38:37,040
other than that it can shoot things out of its little mouth.

2615
04:38:37,040 --> 04:38:41,560
Yeah, it's such a like a just an octopus thing.

2616
04:38:41,560 --> 04:38:43,160
And then Remorade is just a fish

2617
04:38:43,160 --> 04:38:44,360
and they're not even the same color.

2618
04:38:44,360 --> 04:38:46,040
It's such a weird evolution.

2619
04:38:46,040 --> 04:38:49,040
Never understood it, but I guess now I get it.

2620
04:38:49,040 --> 04:38:50,640
They were going for something

2621
04:38:50,640 --> 04:38:52,160
and then they like chickened out.

2622
04:38:53,560 --> 04:38:54,400
Yeah.

2623
04:38:54,400 --> 04:38:55,440
Oh, Skarmory's really good.

2624
04:38:55,440 --> 04:38:56,760
Ooh, Skarmory's...

2625
04:38:56,760 --> 04:38:58,160
I thought Skarmory was gen three.

2626
04:38:58,160 --> 04:38:59,240
Skarmory's good.

2627
04:39:00,320 --> 04:39:02,200
I like Fan-P.

2628
04:39:02,200 --> 04:39:04,040
Oh, no, wait.

2629
04:39:04,040 --> 04:39:05,520
Is it says Fanny here?

2630
04:39:07,960 --> 04:39:08,800
Is it?

2631
04:39:08,800 --> 04:39:09,640
It's Fan-P, right?

2632
04:39:09,640 --> 04:39:10,460
Fan-P?

2633
04:39:10,460 --> 04:39:11,400
I thought it was Fan-P.

2634
04:39:11,400 --> 04:39:12,240
Well, Fan-P.

2635
04:39:12,240 --> 04:39:14,400
Oh, I don't know.

2636
04:39:14,400 --> 04:39:17,000
Bliss, I have a love-hate relationship with Blissie.

2637
04:39:18,040 --> 04:39:19,440
I wouldn't say it's my favorite.

2638
04:39:19,440 --> 04:39:22,800
No, Blissie ruined Pokemon Go for like months and months.

2639
04:39:22,800 --> 04:39:23,720
That's true.

2640
04:39:23,720 --> 04:39:26,960
That's true, but you gotta respect it.

2641
04:39:27,840 --> 04:39:29,960
I gotta destroy it.

2642
04:39:31,560 --> 04:39:32,720
Okay.

2643
04:39:32,720 --> 04:39:33,920
So we've settled on Crobat.

2644
04:39:33,920 --> 04:39:34,840
Crobat is the best.

2645
04:39:34,840 --> 04:39:35,880
Well, you like Crobat.

2646
04:39:35,880 --> 04:39:37,480
I kind of like Spinnerak.

2647
04:39:37,480 --> 04:39:39,160
Spiny Spinnerak.

2648
04:39:39,160 --> 04:39:40,880
Everybody loves Crobat.

2649
04:39:40,880 --> 04:39:42,720
I'm gonna go for Spinnerak

2650
04:39:42,720 --> 04:39:44,920
because it's a funny little squidgy spider.

2651
04:39:45,720 --> 04:39:47,960
I would buy a plush of Spinnerak.

2652
04:39:48,080 --> 04:39:49,720
I don't know if I'd buy a plush of Crobat,

2653
04:39:49,720 --> 04:39:51,120
although that would be funny.

2654
04:39:53,040 --> 04:39:53,880
Fair.

2655
04:39:53,880 --> 04:39:55,560
Fair enough.

2656
04:39:55,560 --> 04:39:56,400
All right.

2657
04:39:56,400 --> 04:39:57,240
That's it.

2658
04:39:58,560 --> 04:40:00,680
It's time to end this charade.

2659
04:40:00,680 --> 04:40:01,520
Yes.

2660
04:40:02,840 --> 04:40:06,720
So, hey, guys, remember,

2661
04:40:06,720 --> 04:40:09,160
we forgot to charge you for March.

2662
04:40:09,160 --> 04:40:11,560
Please give us some money.

2663
04:40:11,560 --> 04:40:14,120
Get in the Minecraft server for $5.

2664
04:40:14,120 --> 04:40:16,120
Get in the Minecraft server.

2665
04:40:16,120 --> 04:40:17,560
Build a cool thing

2666
04:40:17,560 --> 04:40:20,240
and we will look at it on stream.

2667
04:40:20,240 --> 04:40:21,080
We will...

2668
04:40:21,080 --> 04:40:23,120
Let's do a Minecraft soon.

2669
04:40:24,400 --> 04:40:25,240
Yeah.

2670
04:40:25,240 --> 04:40:26,080
Yeah.

2671
04:40:26,080 --> 04:40:26,920
Yeah, okay.

2672
04:40:26,920 --> 04:40:27,760
Yeah, we'll do that soon.

2673
04:40:27,760 --> 04:40:31,200
And I will probably be streaming Undertale right now

2674
04:40:31,200 --> 04:40:32,400
and this video comes out

2675
04:40:32,400 --> 04:40:34,320
playing it for the first time

2676
04:40:34,320 --> 04:40:36,040
with some people. Check out.

2677
04:40:36,040 --> 04:40:37,920
Check out Oblivion's...

2678
04:40:37,920 --> 04:40:38,840
Oh, right, right.

2679
04:40:38,840 --> 04:40:39,680
You'd not play...

2680
04:40:39,680 --> 04:40:40,520
Right.

2681
04:40:40,520 --> 04:40:41,360
You've never played Undertale.

2682
04:40:41,360 --> 04:40:42,200
Never played Undertale.

2683
04:40:42,200 --> 04:40:44,400
You've never played the best game ever.

2684
04:40:44,400 --> 04:40:45,240
Exactly.

2685
04:40:45,240 --> 04:40:47,400
The first PCP episode,

2686
04:40:47,400 --> 04:40:49,040
I actually skipped the first PCP episode.

2687
04:40:49,040 --> 04:40:49,880
I've never listened to it.

2688
04:40:49,880 --> 04:40:51,480
It's the one episode I never listened to it

2689
04:40:51,480 --> 04:40:52,800
when I got into it

2690
04:40:52,800 --> 04:40:54,160
because I'm like, I don't want to disclose

2691
04:40:54,160 --> 04:40:56,000
so we'll play this one game.

2692
04:40:56,000 --> 04:40:56,840
I know.

2693
04:40:56,840 --> 04:40:57,680
Crazy.

2694
04:40:57,680 --> 04:40:58,760
I always started with episode two.

2695
04:40:58,760 --> 04:41:01,680
Finally, go back and see where it all began.

2696
04:41:01,680 --> 04:41:02,640
Oh, God.

2697
04:41:02,640 --> 04:41:04,520
What was episode two?

2698
04:41:04,520 --> 04:41:06,760
It was like waifus.

2699
04:41:06,760 --> 04:41:08,160
Why, I think so.

2700
04:41:08,160 --> 04:41:09,000
I don't remember.

2701
04:41:09,000 --> 04:41:10,560
I think I listened to like half the first episode

2702
04:41:10,560 --> 04:41:11,680
and then like stopped because I'm like,

2703
04:41:11,680 --> 04:41:12,520
they talk about...

2704
04:41:12,520 --> 04:41:14,640
I wonder if I said Ryska even back then.

2705
04:41:14,640 --> 04:41:16,160
I can't even remember.

2706
04:41:16,160 --> 04:41:17,320
I'm sure you would have.

2707
04:41:17,360 --> 04:41:19,360
Sounds right to me.

2708
04:41:19,360 --> 04:41:22,400
You would have said Diamond Tiara back then.

2709
04:41:22,400 --> 04:41:23,320
Would I?

2710
04:41:23,320 --> 04:41:25,040
I feel like at that point,

2711
04:41:25,040 --> 04:41:27,760
I may have got into Homestuck.

2712
04:41:27,760 --> 04:41:28,600
You were talking?

2713
04:41:28,600 --> 04:41:29,440
I don't...

2714
04:41:29,440 --> 04:41:30,280
I remember...

2715
04:41:30,280 --> 04:41:31,120
No, you didn't get into Homestuck

2716
04:41:31,120 --> 04:41:33,800
until the PCP had been going for a while.

2717
04:41:33,800 --> 04:41:34,720
Are you sure?

2718
04:41:34,720 --> 04:41:35,880
Maybe.

2719
04:41:35,880 --> 04:41:38,240
I remember you got into Homestuck

2720
04:41:38,240 --> 04:41:40,400
because I was telling you about it.

2721
04:41:40,400 --> 04:41:41,240
Yeah.

2722
04:41:41,240 --> 04:41:42,920
And I'm pretty sure that was after

2723
04:41:42,920 --> 04:41:44,680
the PCP had already started.

2724
04:41:44,680 --> 04:41:47,160
I, well, I remember you telling me

2725
04:41:47,160 --> 04:41:49,640
but I don't remember when it was.

2726
04:41:49,640 --> 04:41:50,480
So...

2727
04:41:50,480 --> 04:41:51,400
I guess it could have been

2728
04:41:51,400 --> 04:41:53,600
when we were just the horseshoe crew.

2729
04:41:53,600 --> 04:41:56,240
I feel like it would have been in that time period.

2730
04:41:56,240 --> 04:41:59,600
But everyone, go back to the second episode

2731
04:41:59,600 --> 04:42:01,160
and find out.

2732
04:42:01,160 --> 04:42:03,560
All I remember is there was a conversation

2733
04:42:03,560 --> 04:42:04,400
where you talked about,

2734
04:42:04,400 --> 04:42:07,720
I'd like to get art with my waifus,

2735
04:42:07,720 --> 04:42:10,120
Diamond Tiara, Pacifica, et cetera,

2736
04:42:10,120 --> 04:42:11,840
but that I'll just be making fun of me

2737
04:42:11,840 --> 04:42:14,080
and call me a loser and it would be sad.

2738
04:42:14,080 --> 04:42:16,240
Is that what I said?

2739
04:42:16,240 --> 04:42:17,880
Yeah.

2740
04:42:17,880 --> 04:42:19,600
I ended up doing that though.

2741
04:42:20,760 --> 04:42:21,640
Yeah, I remember.

2742
04:42:21,640 --> 04:42:23,920
I had a little commission thing.

2743
04:42:23,920 --> 04:42:27,200
It's still on my background for my Gibb and Take channel

2744
04:42:27,200 --> 04:42:31,080
of me with Barger from Fire Emblem,

2745
04:42:31,080 --> 04:42:33,080
Diamond Tiara and Vriska.

2746
04:42:34,080 --> 04:42:37,680
And yeah, there they are.

2747
04:42:39,840 --> 04:42:41,680
Background for Gibb and Gaming.

2748
04:42:41,680 --> 04:42:44,880
Is it only visible in the full screen television view?

2749
04:42:45,880 --> 04:42:47,560
Oh, no, no, it's not Gibb and Gaming.

2750
04:42:47,560 --> 04:42:49,040
It's Gibb and Take, it's just the...

2751
04:42:49,040 --> 04:42:50,000
Oh, okay, yeah.

2752
04:42:50,000 --> 04:42:51,000
I was gonna say, because I know the image

2753
04:42:51,000 --> 04:42:52,760
you're talking about, I've seen it.

2754
04:42:52,760 --> 04:42:55,200
Yeah, I mean, that one's just cute, so.

2755
04:42:57,640 --> 04:42:58,520
Barger is good.

2756
04:42:58,520 --> 04:43:00,440
I've seen her around.

2757
04:43:00,440 --> 04:43:01,280
She's got a good look.

2758
04:43:01,280 --> 04:43:03,120
She's funny.

2759
04:43:03,120 --> 04:43:07,840
She's like sexually, what do you call it?

2760
04:43:09,240 --> 04:43:13,080
Forward to the player characters avatar,

2761
04:43:13,160 --> 04:43:17,600
regardless of your gender choice, which is very funny.

2762
04:43:17,600 --> 04:43:19,240
He just really likes you.

2763
04:43:19,240 --> 04:43:20,960
She's just gonna eat Foxip and Lyra.

2764
04:43:20,960 --> 04:43:23,160
Barger from Fire Emblem.

2765
04:43:23,160 --> 04:43:24,160
Oh, okay.

2766
04:43:25,160 --> 04:43:26,000
Not a player.

2767
04:43:27,200 --> 04:43:28,400
Did we even end the episode?

2768
04:43:28,400 --> 04:43:29,600
Goodbye.

2769
04:43:29,600 --> 04:43:31,800
No, yeah, okay, that's it.

2770
04:43:31,800 --> 04:43:33,040
Yeah, it's over.
