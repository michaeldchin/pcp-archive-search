1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,900
I've been trying to get into beverages of all types. All shapes and sizes. Well, okay,

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,320
I guess beverages don't have any shape or size. They are liquid. But all types, you know.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,000
As a child, I was really into milk, and I still am. But milk is like the thing I've

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,360
always been into. I always drink milk with every meal, pretty much. Very few things.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,240
I don't think go best with milk, you know. Then when I was 16, I got into water. Didn't

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,560
like water before. But one time when I was 16, I got sick. And I felt better every time

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,400
I drank water. But then I stopped being sick and found out that water still makes you feel

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,280
better. So I did that. And then when I was a little bit older, I started getting into

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,600
tea because I often have a sore throat or an upset stomach. Partly because I think I

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,480
have like acid reflux, I think, because my dad has it. So I probably have some of that.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,240
But a green tea cures sore throat and herbal tea, peppermint tea, sets your stomach. So

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,280
I just have herbal tea after like every meal. So I'm a big time tea guy. You know, then

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
I turned 21. I got into drinking a little bit. Then didn't really have anyone to drink

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,720
with though. But since moving here, I now have lots of people to drink with. So I've gotten

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,680
quite into that. Really gotten into white wine specifically. So easy to drink. It feels

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,240
all tasty. And then I get to have fun time. Yeah. And yeah, and I've also kind of been

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,760
into juice my whole life as well. You know, but sometimes I'll buy myself some juice. And

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,720
then I'll have that. So it's like, okay, you know, I drink water all the time. I always

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,440
have a cup of water with me. I drink milk with every meal. I drink tea after every meal.

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,680
And then sometimes just for the hell of it, I, you know, I drink alcohol sometimes. Sometimes

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,920
I just have a beer with me to get a little bit buzzed, you know, to focus my focus a

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,000
bit. And then, you know, I'll have the occasional cup of juice. I'm like, sweet. I'm into so

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,080
many beverages. Now one beverage I avoid is soda just because, like, you know, I'm not

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
a fan of the way it tastes. I've never really been into it. It just feels gross. And it

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,280
just feels like way too much sugar for me. And then of course, everyone says soda is

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,280
really unhealthy. So I'm like, okay, I will avoid it. I love soda. It gives me an opportunity

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,800
to feel so superior to normal civilization being like, Oh, that thing that everyone says

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,760
is bad for you. I don't even want it. I'm just naturally amazing. Although it sucks being

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,280
at a restaurant because, you know, most of the time the only thing you can get is soda

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,440
or sweet tea, which restaurants would serve milk. That'd be great. So yeah, I'm avoiding

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:56,360
soda and energy drinks. But then there's still one other beverage to get into, which is coffee.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,640
Now growing up, I'd assume that coffee probably hurts your health or like slowly kills you

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,080
or something. Because I mean, if it gives you more energy, it must be taking away from

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,360
your life for us, right? But CGP Great has that whole video about how caffeine supposedly

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
doesn't have any negative side effects at all. So I'm like, Oh, I guess I'll get into

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
coffee at some point. So you know, like a year or two ago, occasionally I drink a cup

37
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,120
and I just didn't didn't really seem to have that much of an effect on me. So I would drink

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,800
like one cup every day. But then as the days went on, I just got more and more delirious,

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,080
not more energetic, just weird, like four days of coffee in a row. By the end of it, I was

40
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,000
just like running around me like, where am I? Who am I? I felt like someone could just

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,600
come up and stab me right through the chest. And I'd be like, you are stabbing me. I understand

42
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,000
you have attacked me. What is happening? Like I just felt like I just felt like numb to life

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,320
itself. So that was starting to be scary. So I held it off. But you know, nowadays, I really

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,240
just want to work super fast. I want to make videos super fast. I love I'm super romantically

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,960
into this idea of like sitting down and cranking some some project out in one session, right?

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,880
And I'm like, I can rarely do that without getting tired, at least at some point. So

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,480
I that coffee keeps sounding attractive to me. So I tried coffee the other day. And at

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,000
some point I started cataloging a timeline of how the day went. So I will now redo the

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
timeline. Okay, so I wake up, I believe at some point, I'm not quite sure on exactly the

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
time, but I woke up at some point. And did you had a video ready for me to edit? Like

51
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,080
he had recorded the audio for it and he linked me the script. So that's my cue to start making

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,280
it. But you know, I'll wait a couple hours before I get to it. So first, I, you know,

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,480
do some C++ tutorials again, you know, I'm still in decoding the stuff. And then I make

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,480
a six page list on a notebook listing off all of the must play video games that I haven't

55
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,480
played yet. So I do that. It takes me like two hours to write that down. Because I had

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,440
adapted it from a text document that I'd already made. But I wanted to get on a notebook and

57
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,040
tighten it up some so yeah, that took me two hours. Then I spent like two hours like watching

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,360
like, let's plays and summaries of some video games, you know, just to like, I was just curious

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,560
about it. So that was another two hours. Then I recorded a vlog about how many things I want

60
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,120
to do with my time with my life. I actually recorded that vlog twice. So that was basically

61
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,120
like a full hour I spent on that vlog. Then I sat down to get the log horizon video ready.

62
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Before I can even make a video like that, I first have to convert all the files and stuff

63
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,600
to make it ready. Because when you download anime, it usually is an MKV file, but you

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,480
need to have an MP4. So you get a process of that. So I started that processing. Then

65
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,560
I spent like an hour or two like doing other stuff, uploading the video, the vlog. Then

66
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,000
I sat down to start making the log horizon video. And I got myself a cup of coffee. I

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,160
drank 500 milliliters of it like immediately, or two cups, right? So yeah, just this tall

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,200
stein filled with coffee. I drank the whole thing over the course of like probably 20

69
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,120
minutes. And I started very quickly feeling like total shit. I felt like all sickly and

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,280
gross and nihilistic as hell. And I started editing the video and I just, it wasn't even

71
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,560
feeling right. It felt like it was straight up making me not good at art. It made me feel

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,080
like I didn't even know what good clips it were in existence. I just felt like I'd lost

73
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,320
my touch even. So I just, I went away, I went into my room and started talking to a

74
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:53,440
squiggle. I have a squiggle now, and I talk to it sometimes. So, you know, started having

75
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,560
a conversation talking about how I feel like shit. And at some point, I'm like, all right,

76
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,880
better get back to this video. You know, started editing it again, kept working at it, feeling

77
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,600
weird. Ben comes into the room and I'm just like, Ben, what are you doing? Hey, I'm making

78
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,240
it. I'm trying coffee. I'm just feeling like a huge weird grumpy pants who doesn't even,

79
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,800
I didn't even feel like me anymore. So I'm just like hammering away at the video being

80
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,840
like, why doesn't this work on me? Why doesn't coffee work on me? Why doesn't coffee work?

81
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,440
Oh, it's been 10 hours. And then that's when I realized I had just been editing the video

82
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,800
for like all night long, nonstop, without even blinking, without even feeling slightly

83
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:48,000
tired. And I'm like, oh, this is where everything started to come together. Now, toward the end

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,920
of the video of making it, I started to almost pass out. I started to get totally dead tired.

85
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,280
So I'm like, oh, let's see if I can make this video in time. And so I finished the video

86
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,600
at 440pm. That's I'm able to calculate this because I can look at, you know, the file dates,

87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:13,160
the dates of files. And I had made the video in about 11 hours straight. And I'm like,

88
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,600
yeah, sweet, it's a 10 minute video made in 11 hours. That's pretty fast. I was really

89
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,600
satisfied with that. And at this point, I somehow attained a second wind. I was no longer tired.

90
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,280
So I'm like, oh, so I go back into my room and talk to my squiggle some more, have this

91
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,840
huge dramatic conversation. Then I start singing a bunch of songs to the squiggle, like I just

92
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,440
play a bunch of music that I like, but but music where I've never actually looked up

93
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,880
the lyrics and I can't entirely sing along. So I learned some lyrics to some songs I like,

94
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,840
and I'm like, yeah, super satisfying. It's something I always want to do, but I never

95
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,440
take the time to do it. So then I go and wash some dishes in the kitchen and I make some

96
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
food for myself. Then me and Digi watch a movie together that we're planning on like

97
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,000
doing a video about. And it's a three hour movie. And over the course of it, I almost

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,280
passed out like a bunch of times. But then at some at some point, I somehow attain a

99
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,320
third wind. And the video ends, I mean, the movie ends and it's 10pm now. So I've been

100
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,040
awake for well over 24 hours at this point. I go into my room again, have a third intense

101
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,800
dramatic conversation with squiggle, like three conversations in one and one waking cycle

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,600
of mine. Then I talk to Digi about the movie some and we kind of are like, you know what,

103
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,920
let's not make a video about this movie. We changed our minds, but we talked about other

104
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:44,920
video project ideas. And then I start washing more dishes at around 1250am for 70 straight

105
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,800
minutes. So over the course of the next hour and 10 minutes, I finish washing all of the

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,920
dishes. And at this point, I'm like, how long have I been awake? So I go over and I look

107
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,160
at all the dates and the times of all the stuff on my computer. And I wrote out the

108
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
whole list of sequence of events that I've been reading to you so far. And that took

109
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,800
me like 30 minutes. So at this point, I'm like, okay, the power of this coffee so exponentially

110
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,640
outweighs that initial burst of anxious spiraling crumpiness that I have to drink coffee way

111
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,920
more often. And this was on only one cup. This is only one stein, a 500 milliliters

112
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,960
stein of coffee, approximately. I'm like, I still have so much energy. I'm not even

113
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,840
tired yet. I'm not even tired yet. So then I go and I do my laundry. Then I make some

114
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,520
more food. Then I then I relax for like three minutes, just laying on my bed and crushing

115
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,840
tiredness sweeps over me. So then I stand up and decide to brush my teeth. And then

116
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:54,720
suddenly the tiredness goes away. And I'm like, huh. So then I shower, shave, dry myself

117
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,560
off, and I rest for 15 minutes. So at this point, it's four 10am. I basically just rest

118
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,720
just so I can dry myself off more. I don't know. I can't even remember exactly. So it's

119
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,480
four 10am. I do the rest of the laundry. I do the rest of the laundry. So I've cleaned

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,840
so many things. I've cleaned all my clothes, all my frigging sheets, and all the towels

121
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,200
that everyone uses. And I put away all of the dishes too. I put away all the dishes once

122
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,960
they're all dried off. And it was the first time since living here that all the dishes

123
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,920
in my room in the house have been cleaned at this house. So it was an incredible moment.

124
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,560
And at this point, I'm wondering, I actually don't think I will become a coffee drinker

125
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,520
because I don't think I ever need to drink coffee again. I think that one cup was all

126
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,960
I needed. I've broken my sleeping mechanic. I've achieved the broken brilliance. I'll

127
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,040
never have to sleep again. Holy shit, this is the greatest thing. Then I start organizing

128
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,400
my room. Because, you know, my room was a mess. Halfway through, I start feeling bad

129
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,280
about it. I start feeling all down, crying for no reason. I guess just because I've been awake

130
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,560
for so long, I've become a weird bitch. So squiggle comforts me. I get back on the horse

131
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,520
and I finish organizing my room. And then I finish organizing my room at 8.40am. So it's

132
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:33,120
like, yeah, I'm moving slowly here. I am doing things slowly because I've been awake for so long

133
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,880
and I've become a weird, fragile person. But still, I was awake for about, for about like

134
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,560
44 hours. So just under two straight days of being awake. And it was this incredible moment of time.

135
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,360
And yeah, so that's interesting. I did fall asleep though. And I guess I'm probably just

136
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,800
gonna be randomly falling asleep all week. Anyway, I'm gonna try and talk softly here.

137
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,480
Hippo is asleep in my room on a inflatable mattress, six feet away from my microphone.

138
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,560
All the rad con guys are out there talking, probably shouting, screaming,

139
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,520
laughing. Don't know how much you guys can hear that. If you can, I'm sure it's totally

140
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,040
ruining the mood of this series. But you know, Hippo being a slave deer is forcing me to talk

141
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,440
softly. So hopefully that increases it. Or maybe makes it totally creepy. I don't know.

142
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,920
So yeah, you know, still doing the programming stuff. Still having a great time with that.

143
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:46,080
So cool. I have made a couple of like C++ programs. Mostly just stupid text things.

144
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,400
I'll put a link to them in the description so you can download them. If you use Windows,

145
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,600
they're simple exes. You know, it's just me to train myself and learn in programming stuff. But

146
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,520
I think I made a couple of funny little pieces of text. And you know, as I learned more and more

147
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,520
about programming, I immediately am taking the experience and knowledge I'd built up

148
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,200
in YouTube analysis to this new field. Because like there's one important thing that I've learned

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:27,280
as an analysis person and review person is that most people in any given field are not that good at

150
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,560
it, even among professionals. Because it's like I'm, I'm watching video tutorials about programming

151
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,880
and like lectures on the nature of programming. And I'm starting to get the sense of like,

152
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,000
how many of them are people who aren't really that good at what they do, but they are technically

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,960
professional. And like even, you know, comments and forum posts around the internet, and there's

154
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,760
people who like sound like they really know what they're doing. But you know, maybe they're they

155
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,560
know what they're doing, but what they're doing is garbage. So yeah, that's kind of, it's interesting.

156
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,080
Because you know, obviously, I literally don't know shit about it. But I'm already starting to

157
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,200
like get a feel for it, get a feel for like who the who are the people who I can respect are

158
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,560
in this situation. Because you know, with YouTube reviews, I mean, 90% of people I don't

159
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,520
wouldn't take seriously with their reviews, even if they are making money from it, even if they are,

160
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,240
even if they do have 100,000 subs and stuff, you know, like all the normal boots hidden block

161
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,960
people are people who I would not really go to for any wisdom on how to make videos, or telling

162
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,320
anyone to go to and learn from, except for like, basic production values and upload schedules,

163
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
and stuff like that. I mean, not counting Jean Tron, he's obviously a totally different animal

164
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,160
from everyone else in that field. But you know, so like, because the video that I'd mentioned

165
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,600
before about programming called object oriented programming is bad. I watched that video again,

166
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,600
and I watched its sequel videos, which are object oriented programming is embarrassing,

167
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:13,200
and object oriented programming is garbage. And it's like, man, this guy, Brian Will,

168
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:23,760
is smart. And I respect him deeply. He's so sure handed and, and just so subtly smugly derides other

169
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,400
other techniques and stuff, but like, just so just so competently, and, and clear headedly.

170
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:37,760
And I'd admit, he's really, really convinced me. And I know that a lot of I'm probably get a couple

171
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,680
comments being like, that are very like, sincere and like, well informed, telling me about, you're

172
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,240
like, well, I know he said this and this and this about object oriented programming, but you know,

173
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,080
this, this, this and this. And on one hand, I'm inclined to take you seriously because you know

174
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,920
more about comp coding than me. But on the other hand, I'm not like, I have to admit, like just

175
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,960
because you've you actually are a good programmer, I have to admit, I might not take you seriously.

176
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,240
I'm not, by the way, people who've commented before on the last one, I'm not referring to any of you.

177
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,280
I don't remember exactly. But I don't know, it's just it's just a weird thing,

178
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,600
feeling like I'm already judging people's skill at a field I have no skill in.

179
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah, I'm a pretty bad person. You know, it's funny, becoming successful in life has done

180
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,000
simultaneously good and bad things to my moral character. Because, you know, when I'm a depressed

181
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,440
teenager, I'm more inclined to lash out at people and be mad and grumpy. But now I'm not,

182
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,520
I don't really have any incentive to be grumpy at people. But I'm so satisfied with my self image

183
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:06,560
now that I don't care to not be grumpy to people, you know? I just like, I'm so satisfied and content

184
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:14,480
with what I've with the cool stuff I get to do all day, that I don't need the approval of people

185
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,240
at all. Like I'm someone who's rarely needed much approval from other people who I don't care about.

186
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,440
But that dependency is at an all time low with me, like I really don't give a shit.

187
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,840
So yeah, it's just, I feel like I've been becoming a weird asshole to people.

188
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,160
And I don't know, maybe I'll fix that at some point. I'll be like, you know what,

189
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,320
I'm gonna stop being an asshole this time. But I don't know. It's strange because

190
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,440
like, you know, I know Digi was saying similar stuff in one of his decompression chambers and

191
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,440
stuff like about, he doesn't think of himself as a great person. You know, he just thinks of

192
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,040
himself as maybe a strong five to a light six out of 10 on moral quality. I'd probably wreck

193
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:09,520
myself, you know, maybe a light to decent five, depending on who you are, how I'm treating you

194
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,800
specifically. But like, I feel like this is gonna be weird, but I'm sure almost, I'm sure there's

195
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,000
a lot of people who are gonna agree, but never really thought that they should say it, which is,

196
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,080
I value interesting people more than good people in the world. I mean, obviously, the more good

197
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,200
people the better. But I kind of just don't care. Like if someone is a great moral person who helps

198
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,880
people, I'm like, yes, I appreciate you. But you're not really doing anything to help me,

199
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:48,240
since I don't have cancer. I don't have being a starving African child disease. So you go off

200
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,880
and help them. That's great. You know, like, you know, at some point, if I ever have like,

201
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,920
if the time is right, maybe I'll do something to help you, you know, I do think you are valuable.

202
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,280
But I don't care, because you don't do anything that amuses me, you know, you're off in Africa

203
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,480
helping them, you know, I'm over here, you're not doing anything for me. So I don't really care,

204
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,000
you know, people who are interesting, educated and creative, and people who I can respect is

205
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,720
something that I want, that I want from people way more, you know, those are the kind of people

206
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,480
who I want to talk to or, or understand or research or that kind of stuff, you know.

207
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,200
Like all my life, all I've really wanted is just respect from people who I respect,

208
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,000
you know, like fame is cool and all, you know, people knowing about you is fine, although kind

209
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,080
of annoying too. But really, all I've wanted is just to be someone who is mentioned in a

210
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,960
retrospective of what was important about the world, you know, like this person came along,

211
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,840
took influence from these people who came before him, and then these people took influence from

212
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,920
him in this way. That's where I want to, that's, that's, that's my goal, man, that's, that's who I

213
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:18,320
want to be. But you know, I guess if you're a more nice person than you can be more respectable to,

214
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,960
that would probably help. I don't know, maybe, I don't know if I'm either underselling or

215
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,680
overselling the amount of assholeness I am. Guess that's for other people to judge.

216
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,320
Mwamp. Mwamp, that's a, that's supposed to be a horn sound, like mwamp, mwamp, mwamp.

217
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,160
Sometimes I'll type it in a chat, like someone will talk about something that was like derpy,

218
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,720
and I'll be like m-w-a-h-m-p, and they're like, wamp, what does that mean? I'm like, it's a freaking

219
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:57,600
horn, man. You know, when I started doing the programming stuff, I brought a chair back into

220
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:06,080
this room, and I started sitting at a chair. But it started to make my back hurt. After two weeks,

221
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,440
my back started to die. So I kind of gave up on that. I mean, I am sitting on a chair right now,

222
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,800
but I'm leaning forward. I'm not leaning back on the chair. That's what kills your back, slowly.

223
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,720
You know, I had mentioned before how I really liked the idea of making a video super fast,

224
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,920
which is what I did, you know, a 10-minute video in 11 hours. I'm really, really satisfied with that.

225
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,720
But it's really because making videos is harder than a lot of other mediums in a way,

226
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,840
where I could sit down and start drawing and just never stop, or I could sit down and make a video

227
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,000
game, or at least try to, and just never stop, you know? When I got into C++, I was like, wow,

228
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,400
I can just go at this all day with no breaks, or at least very, very few.

229
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,360
Whereas with editing video, it just feels like I have the need to get up

230
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,560
and do something all the time. I always feel at risk of getting distracted.

231
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:28,240
And it's strange. It feels like my work ethic is entirely different depending on what medium I'm

232
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,520
working in, and I've been trying to get to the bottom of that. And I feel like I've made some

233
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,840
progress on figuring it out. But okay, let's say there's two categories here. One category is

234
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,200
sort of a more abstract form of art, which is like you're drawing something that doesn't exist,

235
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,920
you're programming a video game, you know, which is entirely a simulation, or you're doing like this

236
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,000
more hard media stuff, where it's more high art in a way, where everything you're making is totally

237
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,800
purely created by your own hand. Then on the other side, there's more abstract, no, no, there's more

238
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:19,760
remix type of art, which, you know, editing videos is that you're taking this show that's

239
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,440
been made by someone else, and turning it into a different form, you know, you're re-editing it

240
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:34,320
into your own video. And also in this category, I would even put blog writing, like even the

241
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,000
process of writing a video like that. It's like you're taking the things that have been said in

242
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,760
this show, and then you're reinterpreting its meaning and its message and making it your own.

243
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,960
So even the writing process is very much like a remix of the writing of the thing.

244
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,800
And like even if you're blogging, like say you're just doing journalism, you know, that's also an

245
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:03,360
art form, but you're basically remixing life that way. So those are the two categories, right?

246
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
And I feel like the first category, the more high art, I'm not saying it's better necessarily,

247
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,600
it's just it's more, I'm just gonna use the word high because it just feels like the right word

248
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,280
to use, okay? Don't judge me. No, please judge me. But those mediums, it feels like it takes more of

249
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,000
my focus, it takes more of my, it takes all of me, you know, to make something like that, to draw a

250
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,120
thing, takes all of my soul, and the whole world around me doesn't matter anymore. Everything goes

251
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,800
black around me. And it's just me and my friggin' chisel and my chunk of stone and I'm making the

252
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,680
thing chiseling away at it until it's done and nothing can slow me down. Meanwhile with editing,

253
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,400
like a lot of the, of editing and making videos like that depends on like being culturally aware,

254
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,680
you know? That's a, that's a medium that's very much about like feeling connected to the

255
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,520
life stream of the culture around you, you know? You have to feel the world at all times

256
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,520
in order to like be good at it. So I, like, I can't phase out the world around me. I become more

257
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,680
one with the world around me. And when you're in that state of mind, you just get distracted more

258
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:31,120
easily. Or at least, I say you, but I mean me, okay? Like, yeah, the whole time I've been making videos,

259
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,120
it's like, you have to take breaks. You have to hang out on the internet in order to like be in

260
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,960
the right mental state to be able to make a video like that. And I don't know why that is.

261
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,120
Because back when I was making that RPG, I could just, I could just shut myself out from the world

262
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,960
completely and never lose my touch, or at least I felt that way, you know? So that's a weird thing

263
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,280
like that. And that's, and that's why it's harder for me to stay focused when editing videos.

264
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:08,720
Hopefully coffee will be my life hack to win the world. I will destroy everything with my new

265
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,600
don't need sleep power up. You know, I've always said I like the idea of sleep and I do find sleep

266
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,320
very satisfying. I just wish I didn't have to do nearly as much of it as I do. If it could be,

267
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,800
you go to sleep once every two to three days for three to five hours, that'd be ideal. No,

268
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't know if that's medically possible, but if it were, that would be my favorite.

269
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,920
Well, that's, that's everything I had to say. I think it's been like a week since the last

270
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,880
episode of this show. So how about I just release it now? You know, it's only 30 minutes, but

271
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,600
that's what I'm going to do. Yeah. By the way, I'm going to change the titling system for this show.

272
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,560
Originally, I named the first episode like January or whatever, you know, gave it to date.

273
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,000
And then Nate came out with his solo podcast and also gave it a date. And did you was like,

274
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,880
actually, I was thinking you guys should just not have dates because that just gets confusing.

275
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,200
We can't have too many shows that are named after a date. That's just confusing. And I'm like,

276
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,360
I don't really know why, but okay, I might as well. So I think I'm just going to name these

277
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,480
episodes is like give them a title named after what I'm talking about. Not sure. I don't know what

278
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm going to do about that. But yeah. Anyway, I got copyright detected on the song I'm using

279
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,760
on the last episode. But that may just be because I played two straight minutes of the song

280
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,920
with no talking over it. So I'm going to find out if I'm still going to get copyright detected,

281
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,880
even if I don't do the fade out. So yeah, unfortunately, this video is not going to end

282
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:21,040
with two straight minutes of just music, even though I really like that concept. So goodbye.
