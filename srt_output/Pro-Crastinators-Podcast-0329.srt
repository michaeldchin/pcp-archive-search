00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,960
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, and it's me, Ben Saint.

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,960
And unfortunately I cannot share every precious moment of my life.

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,960
With you, the audience, and you, Gibbontake.site.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Ah, what?

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
That plug.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Thank you.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Just saying .site after my name.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,960
You're welcome for saying .site after your name.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,960
What happened this week?

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
What happened?

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,960
What happened?

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Well, I have a sort of topic of convo.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I've been, I've needed to, because I've been drawing the Clarissa thing, and it's been going sort of alright.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:23,960
You know, a page or so every day of like blocking out panels and figuring out how to translate a script for an outline of a scene into a, yeah, it's pretty good.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,960
But I have been beating myself up about it, and I've took to my therapist.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,960
You gotta like let yourself, you gotta be nicer to yourself.

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
What do you like doing?

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
What makes you feel happy?

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,960
And that was like, you know, do you ever feel like you have no emotions?

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Like nothing will make you sad or happy?

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:51,960
And it's just sort of like, oh, well I genuinely don't have an answer to what would make me happy right now.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Are you asking me or is that what your therapist said?

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:06,960
No, well, I mean, it's what got me thinking about it, and I am asking you if you've ever felt that sort of, wow, I just realized I don't have emotions at this point in time.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Sure.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,960
I don't know what would make me happier or whether I'm sad or not.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm just, I don't know.

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Yeah, sure.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,960
It's a big, I don't know moment.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
That's, that's my thoughts.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
What?

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
That's my thoughts.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
That's it?

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Well, I was just wondering because like, it's so weird.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,960
I thought I had interests and passions, and sometimes I just feel like I don't.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I feel like.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Oh, sure, I feel like that all the time.

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
But that's bad.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Is that bad?

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Okay, is that where you're going with that?

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
That's bad.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
It's bad.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
It's not a good state of being.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Oh, okay.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:57,960
You should be able to, to at least know what would make you happy to do it and to like treat yourself.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
It's like, what do you call it?

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Self-care.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,960
It's self-care because when you, when you have no emotions one way or the other, you're

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
just sort of dead inside.

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Yeah.

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,960
And so every day is like, I don't know, I guess I'm awake.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
So this is what your therapist said.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,960
She said, she said, you ever feel like you have no emotions one way or the other?

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
And, and you were like, yes.

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
And she was like, oh, well, that's bad.

57
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Oh, you shouldn't feel like that.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Don't the extent.

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Okay.

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Anyway, that's out of time.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
We're out of time.

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
We'll see you next week.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
It's exactly how it goes.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Yeah.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
No, no, it's just sort of, sort of, I don't know.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,960
I've like with, with gender stuff, gender dysphoria and euphoria.

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,960
I've just sort of fallen off feeling good or bad.

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm like, I need, sometimes I need reminding what it feels like.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
I need more, I need more gender.

70
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
You know, ever since you got, I got on gender.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Like I need more and more of it, like to, like to just feel that same high.

72
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:08,960
But it's funny is like a feeling of gender euphoria is like being told I look really cute or something.

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,960
And I'm like, a sort of wave of something flushes over me.

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
And I'm like, I feel giddy.

75
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
And I'm like, oh, that's an emotion.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
I get it now.

77
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I haven't been feeling that for some reason.

78
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Was I sad before?

79
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
I don't think so.

80
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
I was just nothing.

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,960
I think being more, being more emotional is a good thing.

82
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
And I should try and do it more.

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't really know how.

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Yeah.

85
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,960
But that's, that's just been on my mind lately.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Like, like crying at a film.

87
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah.

88
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Or, or, or just, you know.

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,960
That's, you're saying that's something you should strive to do more?

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
I want to.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,960
I don't know whether it's like, oh, objectively, it is good for the human to do this.

92
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I mean, I don't know.

93
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I just know that it feels great when I feel happy about something.

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,960
And I don't feel happy about much.

95
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Generally.

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I feel like.

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I feel.

98
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I feel you.

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
I feel you.

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah.

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,960
It feels sort of numb to like, maybe as a defense mechanism for like all of the shitty things

102
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
that are going on, just that I constantly read about.

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
And I'm like, yeah, well, we're all going to die.

104
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
And then very soon.

105
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,960
And it's like, as a defense mechanism, instead of freaking out about it, I just sort of block

106
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
emotional receptors and I don't feel anything.

107
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,960
And then it becomes harder to, I don't know, look into the future and be like, I want to

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
do this.

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
I'm going to strive for that.

110
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I'm just sort of like making sure I eat.

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,960
And continuing to do a project or something.

112
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
And I'm like, that sucks.

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Because I know what it feels like I can get reminded of what it feels like to be truly

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,960
happy and like, doesn't happen enough.

115
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Doesn't happen often enough.

116
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Yeah.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
But what's the solution?

118
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,960
What's the solution here?

119
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Drugs.

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Yeah.

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
You know what makes me truly happy?

122
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Doc.

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Doc.

124
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I'll tell you what makes me happy is shooting up heroin.

125
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
I see eight balls, speedball, highball.

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Put it in my bloodstream.

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I think legitimately drugs are, the reason people take drugs is to get a feeling of something

128
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
when they're feeling like nothing.

129
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,960
So you know, they're all like, a lot of them are very dangerous and you shouldn't shoot

130
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
up heroin.

131
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Probably not.

132
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I mean, I've heard it's bad.

133
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Yeah.

134
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
But like, that's the underlying cause of the wanting.

135
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,960
But how would I know unless I do it all the time?

136
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
I don't know.

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
How would I know?

138
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
I can't give it a go, said the therapist.

139
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,960
How will I know it's bad unless I try it again and again and again and again?

140
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,960
As that one guy from that one, from that one history podcast, again and again and again.

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
What's that guy's name?

142
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I have no idea what you're talking about.

143
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,960
There's just a guy who does World War I and World War II.

144
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:33,960
It's like a one man podcast where he just talks about military history and he just says it like that.

145
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Okay, anyway.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Sorry to derail that.

147
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Well, yeah.

148
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
I mean, if you're looking for a solution, I think the answer lies in-

149
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I found it.

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Okay.

152
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Excuse me.

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

154
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,960
The answer lies in self-care and whatever that entails.

155
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
That could be anything.

156
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
I know.

157
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,960
But the fact that historically self-care is sounded like, ugh, whatever.

158
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
That's dumb.

159
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Self-care?

160
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Well, to me, it has.

161
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
It sounds like meditation.

162
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
I can't meditate.

163
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't know.

164
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
I don't get it.

165
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
I don't get the benefits.

166
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:26,960
It's just sort of like it's too abstract for me to grasp the utility of it for me to take it seriously enough for it to actually be useful.

167
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,960
And so self-care seems like a similar thing.

168
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I don't understand.

169
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Meditation seems like, oh, it's so specific.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,960
It's like, oh, it's just some fancy mumbo jumbo.

171
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Whereas self-care just sounds like, I mean, you could call anything self-care.

172
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Well, you could, but it's the outcome.

173
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I mean, I don't know much about it either.

174
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,960
It's just sort of like, I mean, you've seen like, oh, this is a social media post.

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,960
People talking about self-care day where it's, I don't know.

176
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I don't know.

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,960
This is where I am right now is that I am confused.

178
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Well, self-care is just, isn't it just anything that makes you anything you do to keep yourself feeling good?

179
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
I guess, right?

180
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Keep yourself feeling positive.

181
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah.

182
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Keep yourself from succumbing to whatever problems you got.

183
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Like what I feel a self-care thing would be based on what I've read is that you say, for example, you have like your shower and you keep clean, you know, a normal amount.

184
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,960
But you don't really do it because you want it.

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,960
You just do it because I got a shower.

186
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,960
And if you, like instead of taking your regular old shower to get clean, you get like super clean.

187
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:23,960
You like get like super relaxing bubble bath and feel really good physically rather than just doing your regular old like utilitarian shower, having an extra little bit of spice, an extra little something to your normal routine that you wouldn't usually put in there because I don't have time for that.

188
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Self-care is indulging in things that take time but are physically and mentally stimulating in a way that you would usually just ignore because, I don't know, I'm in a rat race right now.

189
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I can't, I can't have fun.

190
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I can't do things that are good.

191
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Yeah, I think that's what I assume self-care is about is adding like you moments.

192
00:10:49,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Like the point of moment and action is to benefit you in a way that is different from, I don't know, other ones that are just sort of like, oh, I got to get money because I got to eat.

193
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,960
But getting a really nice thing to eat.

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Can getting money be self-care?

195
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Can hustling be self-care?

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Well, that's the thing.

197
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,960
To me, it's when I wake up, when I wake up at the crack of dawn and I start that hustling grind, for me, that's self-care.

198
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
It keeps me going.

199
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
Well, it's like...

200
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
But it could be though.

202
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
No.

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
No?

204
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,960
It can be in conjunction with hustling because hustling is sort of like...

205
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
What about grinding?

206
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:46,960
You're grinding your body against the grindstone of the commerce and labor and you're creating something of value that you can then get the money from.

207
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,960
But your body is being used up, your energy, whatever.

208
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:59,960
You are using your energy to create wealth that you can use spend on things that give you energy.

209
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:09,960
If you only care about the grind, you sort of leave your personal well-being to the side a little.

210
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:19,960
And you just sort of focus more of that wealth onto making more wealth quicker instead of fat stacks.

211
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
And so, I don't know.

212
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I feel like there's more room in my life to care about myself.

213
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
And it's not even just like taking a bath, it's just sort of...

214
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
It's a mental practice.

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:39,960
To feel good about a good day's work, even if I could easily criticize myself for not having a very good week,

216
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I should instead praise myself for having a week as good as I did, etc.

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Mental stuff.

218
00:12:48,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I had that physics professor in college who told us when you are doing physics, when you're solving problems,

219
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,960
it's important to let yourself feel good when you solve a problem, when you find the answer to a question.

220
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Make sure to let yourself feel good about it as a way to reward yourself and keep yourself motivated to keep going and keep doing them.

221
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:39,960
It is all too easy to allow negative thoughts directed at yourself into your life and to ignore positive ones.

222
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,960
And I don't know why that is, but it just so happens.

223
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,960
And it's better to have a balance or more positive than negative, or I don't know.

224
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I definitely beat myself up.

225
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I mean, I know this is pretty obvious to anyone listening, and it's obvious to me too.

226
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I beat myself up far more often than I am deserving of it, and I don't praise myself.

227
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Make sure that doesn't sound good.

228
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
No, it's not.

229
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,960
It sounds like you've identified a key problem right there.

230
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Yep.

231
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,960
The steps, like the literal steps are a little strange.

232
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I don't know exactly yet.

233
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I've been advised to buy clothes that make me feel more gender, make me feel like if I have like an androgynous sort of pair of jeans or whatever that I continually wear,

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
because I'm too scared of looking too girly.

235
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,960
I obviously, I like it when it works, when I can put something on that is girly and it looks good, and people compliment me.

236
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,960
That's like a big source of enjoyment for me.

237
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
I really like it.

238
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,960
But I just sort of, I'm scared.

239
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
I'm scared of looking not quite right, certainly in public.

240
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,960
And so I just sort of default to not wearing girlier clothing, wearing more gender affirming clothes.

241
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
And that's something I should steer away from, I think.

242
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I should do things that make me happier, even though there's a higher risk of whatever.

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Oh, I don't know, somebody looking at me and saying, da, da, you're a trans, you're not a woman.

244
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Do you get comments on your appearance in public?

245
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
I don't.

246
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,960
No, not in public, but like among people.

247
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,960
When I'm out with people, among us, when I'm out or even just in the house,

248
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,960
if I'm wearing something that is feminine and it looks good,

249
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I will sometimes get compliments from my mom or my brother.

250
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,960
And it's like, wow, all right.

251
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,960
That's how I like that.

252
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,960
You don't usually get compliments in public from strangers,

253
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,960
people you know.

254
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I see.

255
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,960
But what about me, though?

256
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,960
What am I supposed to do?

257
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Well, you've got to dress.

258
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Let's get serious about what matters.

259
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,960
You should go full goth, I think.

260
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I think you would look like a cool goth, because you've always been into that.

261
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
A cool goth, you know, that's very, you know what?

262
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,960
You've identified something there.

263
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
I don't know.

264
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Yeah.

265
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Being goth is cool.

266
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah.

267
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Being goth is cool.

268
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,960
What if you just made it a point to start wearing black lipstick or something?

269
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
It's like.

270
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
I don't know about that.

271
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
I don't know.

272
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I mean, I don't know what you're into.

273
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,960
But something that would be like, oh, I look cool like this.

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I should wear this more often, even if it's more of a hassle,

275
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
even if it's expensive to get into that.

276
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
And it's more difficult than just throwing on a t-shirt.

277
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
It's worth it because it's self-care.

278
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,960
You're spending that energy to make yourself happier.

279
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
You know, it's worth it.

280
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Actually, I have been meaning to buy new clothes.

281
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
I haven't bought clothes in a while.

282
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I've been meaning to go and like, well, let's just think.

283
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
I know that I need a new wardrobe.

284
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I know that all my clothes suck and I've had them all for like 10 years and I like need some new ones.

285
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,960
But I don't know where I want to go to get any and I don't exactly know what I want.

286
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I have some idea of some things I could get.

287
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,960
I don't know where to go to get them and it's hard and it's just so hard and it's such a hassle.

288
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
It's hard and it's a hassle.

289
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I think that's the key.

290
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
It literally feels like a job.

291
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,960
It literally feels like it's like a job that I have to work in order to one,

292
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,960
determine where clothes are to be obtained and then to go and obtain them.

293
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
It is hard work making yourself feel happy.

294
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
That is true.

295
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:22,960
I think that's the key is that getting self-care doesn't just mean doing whatever you feel like in the moment,

296
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,960
which is usually just going to be, I just want to laze around today instead of working.

297
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Like that's not self-care.

298
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,960
That's just sort of not caring.

299
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Self-care is an active participatory thing.

300
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,960
You do something deliberately to make yourself feel better or to improve your whatever,

301
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
how you will feel in the future.

302
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Yeah.

303
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Because for me, another thing is like wearing makeup is something I've been afraid of trying

304
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,960
because makeups, one can easily be looking bad,

305
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
but I can get the hang of that, I'm sure.

306
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,960
But then there's the cost and the time investment for putting on makeup every morning.

307
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,960
And it's like, I don't even want to get into that, but I know that it would make me look nicer.

308
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,960
And so I should spend that mental energy to just get into it, figure it out.

309
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,960
It's going to take hard work, but it's a good thing to get about doing.

310
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I wore that.

311
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Actually, it's the jacket that I wore in the Radcon for lectures, the Tuxedo jacket.

312
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I wore that the other day and I was like, this thing rules.

313
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,960
I wish I had like three more similar ones, but that's such like a specific piece of clothing.

314
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,960
That's such like a weird item.

315
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You can't just find those, certainly not like ones that fit and ones that look good,

316
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,960
just worn as like a jacket.

317
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Usually they're part of a set or something.

318
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Yeah.

319
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
That's like the kind of item that I wish I just knew where to go to get one.

320
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,960
I would go and I would find somebody don't.

321
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:19,960
I mean, you could just blindly search for a little while and like thrift stores might have something.

322
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Yeah.

323
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Every time I've gone to the garment district, I've been disappointed.

324
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I always go there thinking I'll like find some like weird stuff and I never do.

325
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Or I never find any weird stuff that's like that I like or that I want.

326
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I always go and I'm always like, I'm going to do it.

327
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm going to get some, I'm going to expand my wardrobe.

328
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I'm going to find some stuff.

329
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I'm going to find some cool stuff and then I always leave like, well, I got a shirt.

330
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
What was the point?

331
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Shopping is terrifying.

332
00:20:51,960 --> 00:21:00,960
I hate shopping even though it's just sort of like, I feel like I need to stay there and mull over these things

333
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
for like way longer than the store is going to be open for.

334
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Yeah.

335
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
And I'm like, oh God, I got a hurry.

336
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I only have like six hours before the shop closes.

337
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I got to choose something.

338
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh, but what if I don't like it?

339
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Then I spend like some money on one thing and I'm like, well, it's all right.

340
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,960
And I sometimes wear it and it's like, what a waste.

341
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:31,960
But I feel like, I feel like the alternative of just having whatever you have and just wearing that and not feeling anything

342
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,960
because you don't feel like cool or cute or sexy wearing it.

343
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
That's worse, I think.

344
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Well, I guess what I'm saying is that the result in the past is often that I will go out in an attempt to fix that problem

345
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
of I don't have anything that I want to wear.

346
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't have anything that I like how I look in and then I go out and I don't solve the problem.

347
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I've just wasted my time and I end up no better off for it.

348
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
It's very discouraging.

349
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
It is.

350
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,960
But there's only so many times it can fail because clearly...

351
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Are there though?

352
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Well, yeah.

353
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,960
I mean, it's like getting a date.

354
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,960
You're going to go out and it's going to suck most of the time and then it's going to work.

355
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Yeah, it says you.

356
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Not if I have anything to say about it.

357
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Hard work in the face of...

358
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Sort of meaning to get back on Tinder or something.

359
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I think I've been talking about this for months.

360
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I should go on dates again.

361
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
But the same exact thing.

362
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
It sounds so hard.

363
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
It sounds like so much work.

364
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
It is.

365
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Jesus.

366
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
But hard work in the face of adversity is...

367
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
I don't understand.

368
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
It makes it why it's hard.

369
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I don't understand how anyone does anything.

370
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
They have emotions.

371
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
That's dumb.

372
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
I have it so easy.

373
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
In the grand scheme of things, I have it so easy.

374
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
I don't have a job.

375
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I have nothing but free time.

376
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,960
And yet I feel like it's all consumed all the time by the projects that I have in the works.

377
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,960
I feel like I have so much more time than the average person and yet it's like...

378
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I feel like I have no time for anything.

379
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Most people have a 9-5.

380
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Not me.

381
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,960
And yet I feel like I do less than most people.

382
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Most people go on dates.

383
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Go clothes shopping.

384
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Me, I'm just like...

385
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Damn.

386
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Gotta keep messaging Alibaba.

387
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Gotta get that book printed one of these days.

388
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,960
You know, some people, they could do the sort of thing that I do.

389
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,960
The average person, I feel like they have to squeeze that sort of thing out in their spare time.

390
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Yeah.

391
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
And I just don't know how anyone does it.

392
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
I think it's hard.

393
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Well, it's entirely because they're more mentally capable to do it for various reasons.

394
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I think the structure of a job and the fact that you have to go, if you go physically somewhere,

395
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,960
you meet people, it's like slightly, you know, it's a social experience.

396
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:41,960
It's like there's aspects of regular work that give you more energy to do things.

397
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,960
I mean, obviously people come home exhausted all the time.

398
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,960
But when you hit like with us, we don't have like a traditional job.

399
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
We make our own hours.

400
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Yeah.

401
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,960
And going out is not necessary for a lot of it.

402
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,960
There's not like a group of people that we are, the work people that we go to see when we're at work.

403
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
So it just sort of feels a little isolating maybe.

404
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,960
It's just, it's a series of things that make it harder to feel like anything is worth it.

405
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:30,960
And I think it's because we're not doing the hard work that makes everything seem so much harder.

406
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,960
The hard work of self-care, the hard work of...

407
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Like if you're in a bad mental space, it's harder to do anything.

408
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
You know, depression does that.

409
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Yeah.

410
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:52,960
And I think it's a similar sort of thing if you're in a bad, I don't know where I'm going.

411
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I feel like I had a good point.

412
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:06,960
You're saying, you're saying, you're saying if we, are you saying we're caught in some sort of death spiral?

413
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
No, no, no.

414
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,960
I'm saying that it seems so difficult to do all these things.

415
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,960
And I think the fact that you feel like you have so much free time is another...

416
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Well, I simultaneously feel like I have so much free time, but it's all just gets...

417
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,960
But it's all eaten up by things so quickly.

418
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Sure, but the fact that you feel like you should be able to make more of your time is like a guilt trip thing.

419
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,960
You're saying that despite not having a nine to five, you're doing less work.

420
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,960
And so that weighs on you.

421
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
That's how it feels.

422
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
It makes you feel worse about life.

423
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,960
I think I mentioned last week I said like, I'm just like, where does the day go?

424
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I spent the day like, I had meant to edit that day, but instead, what was it?

425
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,960
I had done a little bit of reorganizing.

426
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
I had messaged some printers.

427
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,960
I had checked my emails or whatever.

428
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
And then the day was gone.

429
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,960
I didn't even get to do the thing.

430
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,960
I think that the point I'm generally getting at is that it's harder for you than you're giving yourself credit

431
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:43,960
and you're beating yourself up by comparing yourself to people who just somehow magically seem to be able to do so much stuff.

432
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,960
I think it's not that you're in an advantageous position actually.

433
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,960
And it's a mental problem that is blocking you and making you feel like nothing matters

434
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,960
and that you don't have passion for anything, which makes it harder to do stuff,

435
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,960
which is why you look at the amount of stuff you do and you're like, well, that's not a lot of stuff.

436
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
And I don't even have a nine to five job.

437
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
I must suck.

438
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Something is terribly wrong and it just sort of spirals like that.

439
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,960
And that's why the self-care is important.

440
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,960
It's sort of a fight against that sort of negative spiral.

441
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Even though it's like on the grand scheme of things, you could objectively say, well, I do less work than some other people.

442
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:43,960
The point is not to then shit on yourself for that is to congratulate yourself for when you do get stuff done

443
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,960
to build up a more positive outlook on life, which makes you happier generally,

444
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,960
which makes it easier to do things, which improves the amount of stuff you can do anyway.

445
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Yeah, I think I get what you're saying.

446
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I've mostly been fine and been passing days and getting stuff done.

447
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,960
There's just some days when it feels like, oh, geez, my day was eaten up.

448
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,960
There's just some days when I feel like, where did the day go and like, wow, how much worse would it be

449
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:45,960
if I was like the typical person who has no choice but to give over eight to 12 of the 16 hours a day

450
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,960
that they have to themselves to a boss man.

451
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,960
It's not to say that having a nine to five means you're more capable,

452
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,960
because I know definitely people struggle the same way you do, but also have a job.

453
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,960
So it's just sort of doubly depressing.

454
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:18,960
There's something to be said for not comparing yourself to others

455
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,960
and just considering that whatever path your life is on, you're the only person on that path.

456
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:33,960
You just got to work at it yourself, bit by bit.

457
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
You got to be the best me I can be.

458
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Yeah.

459
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Sure.

460
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
I got you.

461
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
I don't know.

462
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
I got you.

463
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
No, I get you.

464
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
No, I hear you.

465
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:52,960
But speaking of beating myself up for not working hard enough.

466
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Last week when I said that I thought maybe that video would be done by the time the episode came out,

467
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,960
that was foolish and I should have known at the time that it was foolish.

468
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,960
But I said it anyway and I can never take it back.

469
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Yeah.

470
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Sure you can.

471
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,960
I was thinking about like what if I did the least work on it possible?

472
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Like yeah, the laziest possible version of it could have been done last week,

473
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
but of course in hindsight I realized no,

474
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,960
that doesn't allow time to do such and such and so and so,

475
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,960
adding little visual touches that I was thinking of and I wanted to do.

476
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,960
So I've been going through it and I've been doing that.

477
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,960
And I am through.

478
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
I hope the pace will pick up.

479
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:52,960
At this point I have gone through and I have finished about an hour and a half out of like seven hours of it.

480
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
So it's slow going but I hope it will speed up.

481
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I had to spend, this is another thing, another thing that it's like how does this take so long?

482
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,960
How am I so incompetent that I spent the whole day?

483
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:14,960
I spent an entire day, like more than an entire day just right click saving images

484
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
that I knew I was going to want to like put in as visual aids.

485
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,960
That took me an entire day just doing that.

486
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,960
But this is exactly the thing, you did all that work and you're shitting on yourself for it.

487
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,960
But it doesn't feel like work because every individual action, every right click save is like infinitesimally small.

488
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
It's nothing, it's not work.

489
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
It should take zero time.

490
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,960
The work involved in it rounds down to zero and then I did it like 400 times or whatever

491
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,960
and then it's like well that's 400 times zero should be zero.

492
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Moving your mouse is, you're just moving a mouse and clicking.

493
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,960
You're also thinking about what images and then finding them, right?

494
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Like it's not just zero brain energy work you had to consider like the best version of the image for the thing.

496
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
That's what I'm talking about.

497
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,960
That's the kind of thing that's like it is work and I'm doing work and I'm getting it done.

498
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,960
But then when I look back on it, I'm like I have done nothing.

499
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,960
You're being a shitty boss to yourself.

500
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Yeah, I hear you.

501
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Boy.

502
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:39,960
But the fact that I spent that time hopefully means that it will not take me another week to get the other six hours of content made.

503
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,960
I hope that it will now be like okay maybe you can, ugh.

504
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:56,960
I mean for me, things that shouldn't, like when I just think of it without looking too deep, I'm like oh that shouldn't take too long.

505
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:07,960
It always takes the longest because it's like right now the Clarissa stuff, I do feel kind of stupid at how slow I'm doing it and how easily I'm getting distracted.

506
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:25,960
And I'm beating myself up about how I'm not able to condense these pages into smaller enough, like efficient enough pages such that it's on par with like one piece which I'm reading every week.

507
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,960
And various other like comics that just sort of I see them and I'm like oh yeah panel layout.

508
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Oh that's a diagonal.

509
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I haven't put a diagonal panel for like 20 pages.

510
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
What am I doing with my life?

511
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,960
I'm just sort of like I'm just I'm freaking out a little about how long it's taking to do all that.

512
00:34:44,960 --> 00:35:10,960
But it is like kind of the most like brain intensive part because I'm trying to translate an idea into a visual image and also trying to like set out a page so that it reads well and then I'm beating myself up for doing that but maybe not being as efficient as one piece.

513
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,960
And I'm like that's like in hindsight that criticism doesn't make any sense.

514
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I can just go over the pages later and adjust them but it's like during in the moment I'm like I'm doing all this work and I'm like this isn't good enough.

515
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
I'm just sketching.

516
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
I'm not even I'm not even sketching.

517
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm just blocking out like here's where the character would be.

518
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,960
This is they're going to have their arm coming out from this side of the panel and I'm not I'm not sketching it.

519
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm going to go over it and search it and then do the line art.

520
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,960
It's like if it's not a sketch if it's not line art, it should take much less time.

521
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,960
The fact is the line art is the thing that takes the least time because the sketch lines are already there and I can turn my brain off and just draw lines.

522
00:35:51,960 --> 00:36:00,960
And I don't even need to think the thinking part is the stuff that actually takes the you know the considering the pondering and the considering is the hard part.

523
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
That's true.

524
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
That's that's my experience.

525
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Yes, it's the thing.

526
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
It's the thinking that is hard.

527
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,960
I've said that I've said that before about about comics, but I mean about anything really.

528
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Yeah.

529
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I forget what I was said last time about how many pages more it would probably take.

530
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
It's going to be way more.

531
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
It's probably just going to be way more.

532
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
It's going to be more than you said.

533
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:41,960
It's going to be more than I said just because I have in that moment, I had a very, very strict or conservative like estimate of how many pages each scene would take.

534
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:54,960
And as I draw things, I'm like, well, it needs another panel to show this and it needs more actually and just the page numbers go up.

535
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,960
And I'm like, oh no, I'm making so much work for myself down the line.

536
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
There's so many pages.

537
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Surely I could condense this down lower and potentially I could if I go over it later.

538
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,960
But it's I don't know.

539
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I think I was being too optimistic with how little pages I would have to draw to get the story to the end.

540
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I see.

541
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
I see.

542
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
Yeah.

543
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Because it's little things like you write the script and you're like, oh, this character says this.

544
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:36,960
But like screen real estate is taken up by the speech bubbles and you still need to show like establishing shots and characters reacting to things.

545
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,960
You could theoretically cram more onto a page, but like you would still have to draw the same amount.

546
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Yeah.

547
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I mean, sure.

548
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,960
There's ways because like one piece is so efficient.

549
00:37:48,960 --> 00:38:00,960
The amount of stuff, the amount of plot points that can be going on in one chapter of one piece, even with multiple different fights going on in like 20 pages is incredible.

550
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:09,960
If you actually like think about how much stuff, how many lines of dialogue and action are going on in a single chapter.

551
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,960
It's like a definitely they've they've narrowed it down to like a like a fine science of how to do that.

552
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Yeah.

553
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Because one piece would be so much longer if it had the pacing of Bleach, for example.

554
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Bleach was very much a more like artful, large panels, panels that take up entire pages.

555
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,960
The amount of pages that show a certain amount of stuff happening is much longer in Bleach, but it's so artful that nobody cares.

556
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
It's really lovely to look at.

557
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,960
But one piece manages to look cool and extremely efficient with its storytelling.

558
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
It's like it's unfathomable.

559
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
I shouldn't be comparing myself to it.

560
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
It's a little too high of a bar.

561
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I mean, that is, yeah, that is like the most popular manga in like the history of the world.

562
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Yep.

563
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Right, sure.

564
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
So I understand your point there.

565
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you can only you can only condense it.

566
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,960
I mean, I'm sure it's it's good to be efficient when possible, but you can only you can only do so much.

567
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,960
You can only cram as much as you can cram onto a page.

568
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Yeah, I can always improve.

569
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
I'll make Clarissa.

570
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:42,960
And then the next thing I do, I will I will be better at it because I'm constantly thinking about like every panel being necessary for the for the for the story.

571
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm telling, which is something I've always liked because the more important the more the the if every panel is important, if every frame of animation is important.

572
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Then you can save time by not wasting time drawing frames that don't do anything.

573
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
I mean, sure.

574
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,960
You can have as as least frames as possible as least work as possible for the same effect.

575
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
That's what I like.

576
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Yeah, definitely.

577
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
That's what I that's what I go for.

578
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Man, I remember thinking like I think I feel like I became a lot more efficient.

579
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Like I showed myself that I could be faster and more efficient at drawing comics than I had ever been before when I was doing Phantoms Revenge.

580
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,960
And I remember thinking like, oh, I'll be really I'll be I think I'll be faster on the next thing.

581
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
But there has been there has been no next thing.

582
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,960
I have not drawn anything since then.

583
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I assume at some point in the future, I will.

584
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:59,960
That could that could always be like I've had this thing as well where I know that I can on occasion draw super quick and get a lot done.

585
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:09,960
But during that time, I don't realize that I'm burning myself out and putting more energy in that I'm giving myself to like rest up.

586
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
And so I burn out.

587
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,960
And that's why I managed to do so much is because I was doing too much and I couldn't keep up and then I had to stop for a long time.

588
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:38,960
And so trying to reach that pace again could be foolish because I'm just setting myself up to burn out because the the burnout is like for anything is the the the harder you push yourself the like exponentially longer the recovery processes.

589
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,960
If you work just like a little less hard, your rest time that you need will be a lot less.

590
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:54,960
And so overtime will work will get get done keeping up a super high pace for like a number of years.

591
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,960
It's not not advisable.

592
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
I would think.

593
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Well, I don't know maybe I'm saying like I was getting more done with less effort than I thought previously.

594
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Okay.

595
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,960
There were times where that was the case.

596
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Yeah.

597
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:25,960
I mean that that could just be like a more comfortable like drawing hands like you've built up muscle memory and certain things are easier.

598
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
So that could also be the case.

599
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Yeah.

600
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I don't know.

601
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,960
It's, it's, you know, it's just like, geez.

602
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Once again, it just feels like that's another thing like, oh, I'm not.

603
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,960
I don't have like a real job and I'm not even really working on like a comic right now.

604
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:53,960
I'm sort of in just in between things and yet just trying to sort just trying to sort things out in between things.

605
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Feels like it takes up.

606
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Oh my, I guess I'm not just sort of, I'm working on that video.

607
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:06,960
I'm working on that video right now, but at the same time I've got all these other like unfinished things that I have.

608
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I realized, I realized the other day that like, oh shit, I never even finished drawing the cover.

609
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I never finished drawing the cover for slime and punishment.

610
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:24,960
Like of course I've got to do that, but I like got so, I got so disgusted with the state of the book with the whole like the lady not messaging me that I just, I just put it through it all down.

611
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
It's a mid, mid cover drawing.

612
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
I was like, I'm not doing this anymore.

613
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,960
See, see to me, that seems like justifiable.

614
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Like, all right, I need to break, I need a break from this bullshit because of this back and forth that isn't happening with the printer.

615
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Yeah.

616
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,960
But the, you shouldn't be shitting on yourself for having needed that break.

617
00:43:48,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Well, what I, yeah, what I need to do, I realized that what I actually need to do before I do anything else is I need to finish that cover and I need to finish.

618
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,960
I need to actually finish the layout because I, because I had, I did not actually finish everything.

619
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I was simultaneously trying to get the book printing sorted out and then at the same time I was trying to, you know, get the PDF files and get the layout all done.

620
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,960
And so I can't actually print until I have that done.

621
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,960
And so I think what I need to do after the video is done, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to like, fuck, I'm not going to message anyone.

622
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I'm not going to do anything with that.

623
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm just going to sit down and actually finish it.

624
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:44,960
And then I can get back to doing what I talked about last week, which is making a new Alibaba account and trying to catfish the old printer into, because that's how it's, that's what it's going to take.

625
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I'm going to have to approach her with like, hey, I do not need to discuss anything with you.

626
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
I don't need to ask you questions about anything.

627
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Just I have a, I have a project.

628
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Please just print it for me.

629
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,960
And that's going to be giving you the highest chance of like, she'll actually do it and just make it as, make it as, as painless and as possible.

630
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,960
So that's the order in which I'm approaching things.

631
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I've continued to order bags of green rock to eventually serve as things to serve as like a bonus podrans to put in packages when I eventually, whenever this Kickstarter actually gets around to happening.

632
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I have many bags of many different kinds of green crystals.

633
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,960
They have a drawer full of them.

634
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Many bags.

635
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
Some of them, yeah, they're all different though.

636
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Some of them are smaller.

637
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Some of them are bigger.

638
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Some of them are greener.

639
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Some of them are less green.

640
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Some of them are lighter.

641
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Some of them are darker and they all have different consistencies and it's very much like, it's so hard to choose.

642
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,960
It's so hard to choose which one I should go with.

643
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,960
If you should have them in like a raffle page and then twist them around.

644
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,960
I think tumble them.

645
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,960
Yeah, I think there were some.

646
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,960
Okay, obviously like prices is important.

647
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,960
Like I would rather get, I would rather buy more of the kinds of rocks that are relatively cheaper.

648
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:30,960
So looking at that, like, like I think I picked out a couple that were like, there was one that was fairly cheap, but it only came with like five of them.

649
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
The color was good.

650
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,960
The color was like kind of like, it was like a light pale green.

651
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,960
I was like, that's pretty good.

652
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:48,960
The consistency is good, but there was another one where like the rocks were smaller and they were darker, but they were greener and there were lots of them in the package.

653
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:59,960
So like they were smaller overall, but not that much smaller, but like I would got like 20 of them in a package for like $15 instead of getting like five in a package for like $12.

654
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,960
So I was like, they're not quite as big as I would like, but everything else about them is superior.

655
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
So I think that's the rock I'm going with is that one company.

656
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:18,960
I ordered like a dozen different ones to just compare and contrast like which guys should I go with for buying rocks?

657
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Which is the best green?

658
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
And I think I found them.

659
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:37,960
I don't compromise on some things, but I think I've found the best compromise that maximizes all the different factors that are important to me in podron selection.

660
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
That was another thing.

661
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
That was another thing.

662
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:49,960
I spent a day like I laid out all my different rocks and I compared different green rocks and that took like half my day and then I'm like, where did my day go?

663
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
That wasn't work.

664
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
I didn't do anything.

665
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,960
I just picked one rock out of a list of rocks.

666
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,960
That's not...

667
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,960
You considered them.

668
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Yeah, it took me a while and I had to...

669
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,960
It was a project gathering them all to the point that I was like, I think I've exhausted all my options.

670
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,960
I have all the options before me now.

671
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Now it's time to lay them out, make lists of pros and cons, choose the ultimate rock.

672
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
The ultimate rock.

673
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,960
The ultimate crystal.

674
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:35,960
This is where in the platformer game, that a wind would blow them all over the world and then you have to go collect them.

675
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:42,960
Then, Saint, you have to collect all of the green rocks for your plugeurs, your Kickstarter people.

676
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,960
I hope to see people pluge in one of these days.

677
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:54,960
Yeah, just like in real life, I hate when a sudden gust of wind blows all my rocks away.

678
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,960
You know what I mean?

679
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,960
It's like such a bummer every time.

680
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:07,960
I go out for a picnic and I lay out my rocks and my picnic basket and then a gust of wind just scatters them all to the four corners of the earth.

681
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Yeah, I hear you.

682
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,960
And then there's the secret pages you can also collect, which make up Phantom's Revenge.

683
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Oh, sure, obviously, obviously.

684
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,960
Well, not Phantom's Revenge, Slime and Punishment.

685
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
Right.

686
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Phantom's Revenge is just merely a chapter.

687
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Merely a chapter in the saga.

688
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Oh, I have, I got new glasses.

689
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,960
I had to go through a whole fucking rigmarole to get new glasses from this company.

690
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,960
They were technically like a Christmas present or a birthday present or something.

691
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Like my, no, it was a birthday present.

692
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,960
My mom wanted to get me new glasses and I was like, yes, I need new glasses, but she wanted me to pick the frames.

693
00:49:51,960 --> 00:50:01,960
And so there was this whole rigmarole of like, I had to make an account on this website and then I had to pick a bunch of frames and then they sent me like several frames and I had to try them on.

694
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:10,960
And then I had to go and like, I had to submit a bunch of paperwork like to let them know my prescription and something and I had to get an appointment to the optometrist to update my prescription.

695
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,960
And so I finally got them and I think they were a little off.

696
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:23,960
I think they feel, they look fine, but they, I feel a little weird wearing them like just they make me ever so slightly dizzy.

697
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:30,960
And I think the prescription or like the pupillary distance is off and it's a little,

698
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:38,960
like I can read in them fine, but when I'm like walking around and like I turn my head and like looking at distant things, I feel like my,

699
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,960
something feels a little weird. I think I'm going to have to send them back and that's, that's frustrating.

700
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Is it because they're too in focus or just some other thing?

701
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,960
I don't know. It's not like the clarity, like everything's clear through them.

702
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:07,960
It's just when I move, there's something about distant objects when I move my head, it feels a little bit disorienting or like something is a little bit off.

703
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,960
I can't really explain it any better than that.

704
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Are they like circles? Are they Harry Potter glasses?

705
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:28,960
No, they're rectangles much like my old ones, except they're like sort of a different, they're sort of like half, they're sort of like brown on top and it's kind of greenish on the bottom.

706
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,960
They're called, they're called like emerald garnet was the color of the description.

707
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:40,960
I don't know. They have sort of like a brown, they have sort of like a tortoise shell to greenish fade coloring to them.

708
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,960
I like them. I think they look cool. They're not, they're not a huge, a huge change for my old frames.

709
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:54,960
But my old frames were just kind of like dark brown and these ones have a little subtle coloring to them.

710
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:02,960
But the fucking, but the old ones were like crack, they were falling apart. I had to glue them back shut several times.

711
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
I haven't had new glasses in a while.

712
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Once I'm wearing, I've been wearing these ones.

713
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,960
My old ones I got in Poland, like almost 10 years ago, I think.

714
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,960
Holy shit. How can you have glasses for 10 years? Doesn't your prescription change?

715
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Actually, no, I went, I went to my optometrist and got my first appointment in, well, it was a new optometrist, but I went to an optometrist and got my prescription checked.

716
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,960
And they said that like my prescription had barely changed since the last time.

717
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
Wow.

718
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:50,960
So that's good. My eyesight seems to be holding strong, you know, put that on the pros list, I guess. Things to be happy about.

719
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Um...

720
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Anyways, I'll probably have to make a fucking phone call and then I'll probably have to put them back in the box and address it to them and send it back and then wait like two weeks and receive a new...

721
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,960
A new prescription or a new set of lenses with a pupillary distance adjusted or something like that.

722
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Oh, God, speaking of rigmarole. Hey, let me gripe.

723
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:24,960
Okay. I was talking on Twitter about how my new thing is Treasury Bonds. Do you want to hear about Treasury Bonds?

724
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Uh, sure.

725
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Sure you do. Sure you do. Everybody wants to hear about it.

726
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:40,960
All right, listen. Here's the deal with Treasury Bonds. There is, um, my, my, my parents turned me onto this. There is a thing you can do.

727
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,960
I think you might have to be a U.S. citizen, but you can buy, but you can buy these things called Treasury Bonds.

728
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,960
There's specifically a kind of bond called an I bond because they, they're, they're lettered. They have different letter types of bonds.

729
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Well, this is the I bond and the I stands for interest that is pegged to the interest rate.

730
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:07,960
And so, um, right now the interest rate is really high or it was as of like a few months ago because the interest rate on the I bond is set every six months.

731
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Every six months it updates to like what is the current rate of, sorry, inflation.

732
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,960
And it said interest. I meant to say inflation. It's pegged to inflation.

733
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:24,960
And so it's like four or five months ago, the interest was, the inflation rate was at like 9.86%.

734
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,960
So the I bond earns an interest rate of 9.86%.

735
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:41,960
And so what I read, what they were telling me, and what I realized, yes, this is what I need to do is at any point within that six month period between whatever, like June and October or whatever it is.

736
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:50,960
If I buy an I bond then, then for the next six months after I buy it, it will accrue interest at a rate of 9.86%. And 9.86% is insane.

737
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,960
So I really needed to like put as much money into that as I possibly could, like right now.

738
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,960
So I'm like, okay, I have until the end of October.

739
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:09,960
So like a week or two ago, I a couple or a couple weeks ago, I get online, I get go to the website and I make an account.

740
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:23,960
And they're like, we have we're having trouble verifying your information, you need to do some paperwork for us, fill this out, get this notarized, and then send and then send it to us and we will verify it.

741
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:35,960
And I'm like, okay, so I waited around for a while for a couple weeks until I had reason to go into town to go to a bank to find a notary public to get my frickin form notarized.

742
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,960
It means I have to find a guy who's professionally qualified to give it like a certain stamp.

743
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,960
So I did that finally, and then I sent it maybe a week and a half ago.

744
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
I sent it in the mail.

745
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:57,960
And so the other day I check my account or I check it and I'm like, okay, it's I hopefully that's been processed by now.

746
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Time for me to buy some of these sweet eyeballs maybe trying time for me to lock in that sweet sweet 9.86% interest rate.

747
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Are you are you joking?

748
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Are you kidding me?

749
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,960
That's like a dream.

750
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:16,960
That's like that you can't fucking get that my bank account is earning like 0.015% some dog shit.

751
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,960
So it's a miracle.

752
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:29,960
So I go and I check the account and I and I and I check the email or whatever that I got in response and it tells me that it might be up to 13 weeks before they verify my documents.

753
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Wow.

754
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Yeah, it might be up to 13 weeks with so of course the window will have passed by then the window will have passed and the the the interest rate will have updated again and it will probably go down a bit.

755
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:50,960
I don't know what I'll go down to but I was I was I was it was gonna it was gonna be so perfect.

756
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,960
I was gonna lock it in right before the I was gonna lock it in right before the interest rate updated.

757
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:07,960
So I was gonna get six months at 9.86% then it was gonna update and in the next six month window I was gonna it would probably be a little bit lower but it would but only a little bit it would maybe be something like 8%.

758
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:19,960
So I was gonna get six months at 9% six month at 8% and I assume it will probably go down after that which you know whatever but that would be that would be a whole year at this great interest rate.

759
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:32,960
And I've I don't know I'm sure I've lost out on I'm sure I've lost out on at least hundreds of dollars at least hundreds of dollars by not fucking hitting this this window and you know what that's the kind of thing.

760
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:41,960
That's the kind of thing that bums me out and just makes me think what's it all what's it even worth getting up in the in the morning.

761
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:56,960
You know what I mean this for this fucking nonsense this for this complete this complete completely out of my control completely like arbitrary system to just fuck me over this way.

762
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:10,960
I couldn't have even I couldn't have even done it even if I'd acted immediately even if I hadn't waited to make the account and I hadn't waited to get it no to rise even if I'd sprung into action as soon as possible 13 weeks is still too long I still wouldn't have made it.

763
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,960
It was doomed from the from the from the beginning.

764
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:19,960
I mean, you could have started when you were born you could have started putting in bonds.

765
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,960
Well I could have heard millions of days ago.

766
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:34,960
I could well there's well that's I mean it was out of my control when this information was brought to my attention so I'm assuming that I would have found out I'm assuming that in every possible universe I would have found out about it at the same moment.

767
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Okay so it's not even like so it's not.

768
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,960
I understand that it sucks.

769
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,960
So close.

770
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,960
I was so close to hundreds of dollars of free money give.

771
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,960
True.

772
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
Hundreds.

773
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:58,960
But if if every universe you would have been notified the same time you would have always missed it.

774
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,960
I mean yeah.

775
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,960
I mean yeah.

776
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:17,960
Truly it is your parents or your fault who did not tell you just like with everything else there is it is my parents it's my parents fault for not knowing about this ahead of time that's true they should have known sooner and told me they should have anticipated that interest would be this high in 2022.

777
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,960
So okay what what is this the thing like you put money in a bond.

778
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
Yes.

779
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,960
And over an entire year the interest rate that you put it in at is accrued.

780
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Well it's every every it compounds every six months.

781
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,960
Every six months so half a year.

782
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:57,960
So yeah for six months let's say the interest was 10% just to be just to be for ease of math like you would you would buy the bond at a rate of 10% and then over the next six months it would accrue you know 5% of its value because half the annual rate.

783
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:13,960
It would accrue 5% of its value in interest and then it would add that to the total and then it would compound and then the interest rate would be updated to reflect the new inflation rate and then the cycle would repeat again.

784
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,960
Okay.

785
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,960
And what are the what is a bond made by who benefits from you putting the money in.

786
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:27,960
It's it's literally it's literally the United States government like taking out a loan from you.

787
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:34,960
You're literally just loaning the United States government money and they're paying you back with interest.

788
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,960
Seems like a no brainer.

789
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,960
Can it go negative percent can you lose money by putting it in.

790
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,960
No.

791
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
Wow.

792
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,960
It is it is.

793
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Yeah it is basically guaranteed to not.

794
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:58,960
They guarantee that even if the interest even if the inflation rate were to go negative they will not like reduce money from you it can't go below zero.

795
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960
No.

796
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960
Right.

797
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:11,960
The thing about bonds the thing about bonds is that they are like they are basically the standard for like as safe as an asset can be like anything that you invest your money in.

798
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:24,960
Has the potential to lose money for a for a U.S. bond to fail or to lose value somehow like the United States government would have to collapse.

799
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:35,960
So yeah this is actually literally this is what do you remember that thing about like the Biden wanting to mince like a trillion dollar coin.

800
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,960
Oh yeah I forgot what that was about.

801
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:51,960
It's yeah it was it was an economic thing because the Republicans weren't like approving the budget and until the budget was approved the government it was literally this it was literally because the government needed to pay back its bonds.

802
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,960
And if it couldn't do that it had to default on them and if the U.S. government defaults on its.

803
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:14,960
Loans a.k.a its bonds that is like a fight that is like the tipping over the fucking World Trade Center sized domino in like a in like a catastrophic economic.

804
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,960
Cataclysm.

805
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:26,960
Well so because like everyone who has a bond will be like oh shit my bonds because because I'm going to take my money out yes because suddenly because suddenly the U.S.

806
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:39,960
U.S. debt which is like the safest asset that exists suddenly like confidence is shaken and it's like oh the United States dollars.

807
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,960
Suddenly doesn't look like such a sound investment anymore right.

808
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:55,960
It seems so I mean I know this is very unlikely to happen but it is sort of weird how if something happens everything collapses.

809
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:03,960
Well like if if confidence is shaken by whatever means then the entire economy would explode.

810
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:11,960
Well I mean it's because because it is such a because it is such a secure asset.

811
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:21,960
That's why the United that's why the U.S. dollar is like the fundamental currency that like so much of not just the U.S. economy but like the global economy is based on.

812
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:32,960
So yeah and suddenly if you shake confidence in the currency that like so much of the economy is built on then yeah like everything else suddenly is shaken.

813
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,960
Yes it's just like that's Rick and Morty episode.

814
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:50,960
Yeah which where Rick change Rick changes the value of an alien currency to be from one in to zero and then all of their money is worth nothing and so they all kill themselves.

815
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,960
I don't remember that one.

816
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:02,960
It's like at the beginning of season three or something where like at the end of season two is put in prison and then in the beginning of season three breaks out real quick.

817
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,960
And he has a scene like that.

818
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
How did he change the value to zero.

819
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,960
You hacked the computer.

820
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,960
You just did a big you just did a computer thing.

821
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,960
But but money is worth whatever people think it's worth.

822
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,960
Yeah but these guys these bugs they don't know.

823
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,960
They just like oh shit bug people.

824
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Yeah the bug people like.

825
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,960
No that sounds like that sounds how who sees him.

826
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,960
But if you're paying me then our money means nothing and then I'm not going to do what you say and it's like a very like.

827
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,960
Yeah no no I do remember that I do actually it's coming it's coming back to me.

828
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,960
Yes it's exact it's exactly like that.

829
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:53,960
Anyway I'm just I'm just fucking I'm just shaking I'm just shaking and crying over here and I'm seething and I'm hoping and I'm like.

830
01:04:53,960 --> 01:05:10,960
Oh god I'm gonna 12 weeks from now I'm going to look at the at the US Treasury page and it's going to be like oh the interest rate has updated it has gone from it is now like a pathetic 7.6 percent and I'm like it's not even worth it.

831
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:18,960
I'll just stick with a Bank of America 0.15 percent like it's this it might as well be the same for get it.

832
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,960
I wonder if there's like a there's definitely some British equivalent or.

833
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,960
Oh yeah every government has like bonds.

834
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:39,960
Yeah but like I'm wondering if there's like a royal bond like you can invest in whatever royal family is there's there's a little bit of a catch but it's actually not as bad as I thought you can't withdraw it for a year.

835
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:47,960
So if you invest it like you can't you can't have it back for at least a year but.

836
01:05:47,960 --> 01:06:00,960
Okay so you have to leave it for a year but after a year you can withdraw it but whenever you withdraw it you lose the last three months of interest.

837
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:10,960
So if you left it for a year and then you withdrew it immediately you would only get nine months worth of the interest and that continues to be the case until five years.

838
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,960
And then after five years you can withdraw it with no with no penalty no loss of interest at all.

839
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:25,960
And then you and then after five years you can you can leave it to continue to accrue interest for up to 30 years after 30 years it stops accruing interest.

840
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,960
But I mean even so even so.

841
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:44,960
Could you the rate is the rate is the rate is so much better than it's earning in the in my Bank of America savings account that like even even if I took that three months interest hit it's like it's still you know vastly superior.

842
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,960
So.

843
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,960
You'd have it be like special money that you can afford to not have in your bank.

844
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,960
Yeah you have and it would be like a nice bonus every year or so.

845
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,960
Basically it's like whatever whatever.

846
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,960
Yeah.

847
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,960
If I had like all all the money that I know I won't need for a year.

848
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:19,960
Or more it's like if I just if I if it were just all in I bonds it would be it would just be like accruing itself it would be like I would be so much better off.

849
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:31,960
If I had it in that form especially because like you know maybe you buy you buy a bunch like every year right like you buy a little more every year and then every year that goes by it's like OK well some of my old bonds have matured.

850
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,960
And now I can take them out now I can take them out if I need them.

851
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,960
And then mean but meanwhile I've saved up some more money well OK so this year I'll put some more into bonds.

852
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:54,960
And then you know five years from now those will mature but then also next year the ones that I invested in four years ago those will mature so I'll be set for next year too.

853
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,960
That's that's how you that's how you do it.

854
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:08,960
Oh you know I'm just looking I typed in UK bonds and I am reminded of the thing that happened very recently with quasi-quarting.

855
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,960
What the new it's an it's a new guy in the he made up a little budget.

856
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:30,960
Saying there's a cost of living crisis and my solution as the money guy of the new government is to say taxes are going down across the board which means the rich benefit the most.

857
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,960
Yeah.

858
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:36,960
And it's a terrible terrible idea and apparently bonds UK bonds are plummeting.

859
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,960
Oh because of this.

860
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,960
So probably not a good time for me to get into it.

861
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,960
Unless that means it's more money.

862
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:49,960
I don't understand exactly but it says plunge plunge probably means down.

863
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,960
Probably means less money.

864
01:08:51,960 --> 01:09:06,960
I mean like I say there's many different like there's these are I bonds so there's also I assume there's A and B and C and D and E and F and G bonds and those all those all work a different way they have some different like mechanism of calculating.

865
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:16,960
The interest rate just the I bonds just happened to be a really a really juicy one right now just because you know the last time the interest rate or the.

866
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:25,960
The last time the interest rate updated it was pegged to inflation and the inflation was like at a record high like nine point eight six percent.

867
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:26,960
So.

868
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:33,960
The pound sterling is at a thirty seven year low because of the announcement he made about tax cuts.

869
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,960
It's very annoying.

870
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
That's been that sucks.

871
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,960
Damn.

872
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,960
Yeah it's funny.

873
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Yeah tax cuts tax cuts that benefit the rich people but then also like okay but then in doing so you've you've tanked the value of the pound sterling which rich people have the most of so they actually lost the most by it also so great great job.

874
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,960
They want to generate economic growth.

875
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,960
Sure.

876
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,960
Being a fucking Tory menace.

877
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
Right.

878
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Right.

879
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,960
Get him out of there.

880
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,960
What's his name.

881
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,960
Quasi Quartang.

882
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,960
Quasi Quartang.

883
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,960
Chancellor of the Exchequer.

884
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,960
That's the new guy.

885
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,960
And this is a really offensive this is a really offensive thing to say but that sounds like a name that J.K. Rowling would make for.

886
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,960
I don't know.

887
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,960
Some goblin banker.

888
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,960
What.

889
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,960
I don't know where he's from.

890
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,960
He's of African heritage.

891
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,960
I don't know what country.

892
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,960
I see.

893
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,960
Goblin banker or something.

894
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,960
I don't know.

895
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,960
He has a fun name to say.

896
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,960
I like saying it but I hate everything.

897
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,960
Is it spelled Q.U.A.

898
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,960
No no it's a K.W. like Kwanza.

899
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,960
Quasi.

900
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,960
Quasi Quartang.

901
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,960
Maybe I'm saying it wrong.

902
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,960
I've not heard it said.

903
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,960
Yeah.

904
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,960
You never know.

905
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,960
You never know.

906
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,960
Well that's my gripes about treasury bonds.

907
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,960
I should say anyone listening.

908
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,960
Anyone listening who.

909
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,960
This all happened because when I made the treasury direct account they said like we can't verify some of your information.

910
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,960
We need this form.

911
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,960
And then like approving the form is what will theoretically take up to 13 weeks.

912
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,960
So anyone.

913
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,960
Who is listening.

914
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,960
Who maybe manages to make an account and doesn't have to submit like additional verification in the form of a notarized.

915
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,960
Piece of paper.

916
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,960
You know take take my lesson.

917
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,960
Take my lesson.

918
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,960
That I've learned.

919
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,960
Get those eyeballs.

920
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,960
Do what I can't you know.

921
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:48,960
Enjoy.

922
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,960
Enjoy that 9.86 interest rate.

923
01:11:50,960 --> 01:12:01,960
Until the end of October until the end of October you can lock in a nine point six nine point eight six percent interest rate on up to ten thousand dollars in in bonds.

924
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,960
If you have ten thousand dollars lying around that you won't need for a year.

925
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,960
Why not get why not get that nine nine percent.

926
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,960
Why not.

927
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,960
Think about.

928
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,960
So what would be the the results nine percent of almost a thousand dollars.

929
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Well it would be almost almost five hundred dollars accrued in six months.

930
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,960
Five hundred dollars in six months and then.

931
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,960
If you put if you put it in five hundred and more.

932
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,960
Yeah.

933
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,960
If the interest rate doesn't drop.

934
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:38,960
It will probably drop a little bit so then maybe be like four hundred for the next.

935
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:50,960
You might end up with like eight eight eight to nine hundred dollars in free money just for basically putting aside putting ten thousand aside and leaving it for a year.

936
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,960
Which is.

937
01:12:52,960 --> 01:13:02,960
If if if if the fuck if the stock market had like a guaranteed return of ten percent if any asset had like a guaranteed return of ten percent that would be insane.

938
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,960
That would be unheard of.

939
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,960
And guess what.

940
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,960
This is a guaranteed.

941
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,960
This is an asset with a guaranteed return of ten percent at least for the next six months.

942
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,960
So like.

943
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,960
Yeah.

944
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,960
It's fucking.

945
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,960
Just with the one just without one caveat that you have to leave it for a year.

946
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:26,960
It could be that because it's such a good interest rate at the moment that they're getting a lot of submissions which is why yours will take 13 weeks.

947
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,960
Yeah.

948
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,960
Yeah.

949
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,960
Possibly.

950
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,960
Yeah.

951
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,960
Possibly maybe.

952
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,960
You know I have a little bit of hope because they said up to 13 weeks.

953
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,960
So maybe that means it could take less than 13 weeks.

954
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,960
So maybe they'll get around to it in the next month.

955
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,960
That would be nice.

956
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,960
But I feel like I shouldn't hold my breath.

957
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,960
Hmm.

958
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,960
Oh I almost wish I almost wish I didn't have I almost wish I knew for sure that it wouldn't happen so that I could just forget about it.

959
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,960
But now it's like I should keep checking my email.

960
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:05,960
I should keep checking that email for the rest of October just to see just to see if it happens.

961
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,960
Oh well.

962
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
Money.

963
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,960
I like money.

964
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,960
Patreon.com.

965
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,960
Yeah.

966
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,960
Yeah.

967
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,960
Yeah.

968
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:22,960
I said I was wrong before the most secure asset class is not actually the United States treasury bonds but actually it's stock in patreon.com.

969
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:30,960
Because for the low low price of $5 a month you get access to up to what is it like 59 or 58 bonus episodes.

970
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960
A lot of bonus episodes.

971
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,960
And that's just that's value.

972
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,960
That's value.

973
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,960
Yeah.

974
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,960
You can't withdraw the money but you can withdraw it in the entertainment value you get from the show.

975
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,960
Right.

976
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,960
Unlike an unlike a try unlike the treasury bond you don't have to leave it for a year.

977
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:51,960
You can get that sweet entertainment right now at the moment as soon as you pledge and it will keep you entertained for that whole year.

978
01:14:51,960 --> 01:15:07,960
While you're waiting while you're waiting for your bonds to mature there's more than 50 episodes so you can every single week go to the US Treasury buy a bond and then every week listen listen to a bonus PCP episode every week for the next year.

979
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:15,960
And by the time you've listened to them all you can get that you can withdraw you can get that interest.

980
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:19,960
So that's that's my advice.

981
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,960
I started making coffee made coffee making coffee.

982
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,960
Yeah I usually take caffeine pills you just take my caffeine and pill form.

983
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:34,960
Oh I thought you meant are you I thought you was going to say you're starting to like handmade like grind your own beans.

984
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:42,960
Oh God did you did you see the flare up recently of like barista discourse on Twitter.

985
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,960
There's no I didn't.

986
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,960
It's a thing.

987
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,960
Okay it's a thing that happens every now and then.

988
01:15:48,960 --> 01:16:06,960
Every now and then some reactionary psychopath in like nominally leftist Twitter like they claim to be a socialist that you know what one of these fucking like one of these fucking like a patriotic socialist or whatever quote unquote right.

989
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,960
They'll always be like.

990
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,960
Or just every once in a while one of them has a take that's like.

991
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:22,960
A barista is not a worker a barista is not a part of the working class right because they have blue hair and pronouns because they have tattoos and because they and because being a barista is like.

992
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:31,960
An easy job that like people with people with you know humanities degrees get in major cities right.

993
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,960
Wow.

994
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,960
Yeah very left very very yes very material analysis.

995
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:46,960
Hmm yes much much a relation to to to the means of production hmm very very good.

996
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:57,960
There was a flare up of it like a couple weeks ago so it's like and and you know some idiot is like baristas aren't baristas don't actually make anything.

997
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:07,960
They don't produce anything they're just they're they're they're PMC you know they're they're they're basically they're basically a bougie or close enough.

998
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,960
And they make the coffee though.

999
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:25,960
Yeah that's the response it's like that no someone said like they don't actually make the coffee man like like the growers in like Columbia make it right like the people that package it in South America make it the barista doesn't actually make anything.

1000
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:32,960
You just like it's like oh here's your here's your cup of beans sir.

1001
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:46,960
It's like yeah I thought you you were it's like yeah what I what I yes what I meant by I made coffee is that I have become a Colombian farm hand that is like producing the beans because baristas don't actually produce any value actually.

1002
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:56,960
Yeah no I brew I've been brewing coffee because I ran out of pills and I don't want to I don't I don't get more I don't want to walk to CBS.

1003
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:06,960
So I see so I'm doing it the old fashioned way and you know what extracting the caffeine from the coffee and then evaporating the coffee just eating the caffeine.

1004
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,960
Snorting the snorting the powder that remains yeah.

1005
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,960
It was it was funny I was having I was like oh god.

1006
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,960
No that was my last caffeine pill and I'm out of energy drinks.

1007
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,960
I'm like oh no where am I where am I going to get more caffeine.

1008
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,960
Oh no whatever.

1009
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,960
And then I remember like oh like normal focus normal coffee.

1010
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:35,960
Yeah normal normal people drink it in coffee form and there's coffee in my house and there's a coffee maker so I can just use that actually.

1011
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,960
I was having a crisis.

1012
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,960
That's not like a good coffee.

1013
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,960
I'm not really a huge coffee fan.

1014
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,960
I'm not a huge coffee drinker but like it's fine.

1015
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,960
And so and it's yeah yeah.

1016
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,960
It's it's electric dirt.

1017
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,960
Yeah I've got a small mason jar of it right here.

1018
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:00,960
I'm going to take another.

1019
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,960
Actually I have this jar is just the right size that.

1020
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:12,960
If I fill this jar it's about three or four cups worth which means that that's about as much caffeine as I would get from a caffeine pill.

1021
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,960
So that's convenient.

1022
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,960
Same amount.

1023
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,960
It all it all works out.

1024
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,960
Did you ever I've never taken caffeine pills.

1025
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:32,960
Do you get like desensitized to caffeine quicker through pills or is it easier to just take too many of them.

1026
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:46,960
Honestly the worst like caffeine jitters I've ever had were from coffee for from like drinking an entire pot really fast and then I would be like jittery and like feel weird for the rest of the day.

1027
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,960
I never got that with pills but it's just because I space space them out.

1028
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:58,960
I think I probably am pretty like desensitized to cat to caffeine.

1029
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,960
I think I probably am like probably have a pretty high tolerance to it if there is such a thing.

1030
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,960
I think it's definitely a thing.

1031
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,960
Yeah.

1032
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,960
Like the first time I drank coffee is like what.

1033
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:17,960
And now sometimes you drink a cup of coffee and you just feel okay feel normal.

1034
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,960
Something has changed.

1035
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,960
Yeah.

1036
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:32,960
I'm probably pretty deep into like caffeine you know dependency addiction whatever you want to call it but like whatever.

1037
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,960
That's fine.

1038
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,960
Yeah.

1039
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,960
It's readily available.

1040
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,960
It's readily available and at this point is not much I can do about it.

1041
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:48,960
Like you can't you can you can go like caffeine free and like swear it off.

1042
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:55,960
But it takes a long time and apparently you will never be able to be awake again.

1043
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:00,960
You'll never be fully alert in the same way if you don't have the caffeine again.

1044
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,960
I think I've heard but I could be making that up.

1045
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,960
There's no way that's true.

1046
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
What does that mean?

1047
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,960
You'll never be awake again.

1048
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:17,960
I mean I said it in a silly way but like the the if you never take caffeine you wake up and you go to bed

1049
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,960
and your energy levels are like normal unblemished or whatever.

1050
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:32,960
But if you have caffeine in tea or coffee or energy drinks and you gain a sort of dependence on it.

1051
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:39,960
You can quit and you will crash like you would with lots of other like substances.

1052
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:43,960
But I don't know you'll never uncrash.

1053
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,960
You'll you'll get OK.

1054
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,960
But you'll never like waking up will be hard forever.

1055
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:56,960
I mean I I think it's I don't know whether that's like a hard because that doesn't sound right.

1056
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,960
It seems like it could be a myth because it could just be like people getting older.

1057
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,960
Make having it that's finding it more difficult to wake up in the morning.

1058
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,960
Yeah that's like that.

1059
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,960
Ever seen that is what I heard.

1060
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,960
So I don't know.

1061
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:15,960
There's that that scene from Dexter's lab where when Dexter and Dee Dee drink all the coffee in the house

1062
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,960
and then their dad wakes up and he's like you drank all the coffee.

1063
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,960
We adults need coffee in the mornings.

1064
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,960
You kids don't need it.

1065
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,960
No you've got you.

1066
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:35,960
So not my youth is gone so I need the coffee now.

1067
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,960
So but fortunately I have it so it's fine.

1068
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,960
I would not recommend coffee to a youngster.

1069
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:50,960
I feel I've seen people like think it cool and and like epic to have their kids drinking coffee at a young age.

1070
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,960
I think it's cool.

1071
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,960
Hmm.

1072
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,960
Like that is a that is a NASA child abuse right there.

1073
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,960
They should be we should be having really like the parents parents that think it's cool to give their kids coffee

1074
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,960
because they like coffee.

1075
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,960
I don't know.

1076
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,960
It's just sort of like you should not really think children should be having.

1077
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,960
I mean they have energy.

1078
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,960
They don't need it.

1079
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,960
I mean it's probably fine.

1080
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:20,960
Like I don't think I'm of the I'm of the my my I'm of the opinion that caffeine is not like particularly bad.

1081
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,960
Like yeah kids can have it and it's OK.

1082
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,960
But like yeah.

1083
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:32,960
Why it's it's there's no reason but it's also like if you get like a dependence on caffeine

1084
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:43,960
and you'll need it and then without it like you get tired more easily and children usually don't have those problems

1085
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,960
but you can introduce those problems at an early age for no reason if they drink coffee early.

1086
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,960
It's just like a strange silly thing that I've seen somewhere.

1087
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,960
Didn't like it didn't like.

1088
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:03,960
I'm pretty sure that if you just don't drink caffeine for a while you will just return to baseline eventually.

1089
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,960
I'm pretty confident that that's that that's the case.

1090
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:14,960
But yeah if you don't need it why why bother with it.

1091
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,960
But I'm I'm deep.

1092
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,960
I'm deep in the cycle.

1093
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,960
I'm I'm I've become one of those.

1094
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:32,960
I've become one of everyone that is to say somebody who starts their day with caffeine and that's OK.

1095
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,960
It's normal.

1096
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,960
It's not in our society.

1097
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,960
It's normal.

1098
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,960
It's normalized.

1099
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,960
That just makes me normal.

1100
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:38,960
Yep.

1101
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,960
Taking a big swig.

1102
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,960
All right.

1103
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:47,960
Well that's my that's my coffee spiel.

1104
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,960
Man.

1105
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,960
Oh yeah.

1106
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,960
Go on.

1107
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,960
I've been playing Outer Wilds recently.

1108
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,960
You heard of that game.

1109
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,960
Outer Wilds.

1110
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,960
Yeah I've definitely heard of it but I don't know what it is.

1111
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,960
It's really good.

1112
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:10,960
It's a game where you are a little alien on a little planet and you are you have this new technology.

1113
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,960
They've just invented that can translate ancient alien language.

1114
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,960
Go off on your little spaceship.

1115
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,960
No man's sky ish.

1116
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,960
Very surface level.

1117
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:23,960
OK.

1118
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,960
But nothing's randomly generated.

1119
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,960
Oh OK.

1120
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:32,960
It's a solar system with mysteries to uncover of an ancient alien race that used to live there.

1121
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:40,960
And you go out with your little space shuttle and land on these planets and the scale of

1122
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,960
the planets is more similar to like Mario Galaxy than it is No Man's Sky where you see

1123
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,960
a planet and you zoom in and then you're in the atmosphere and you land and it's as

1124
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,960
if you're on just any old video game.

1125
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,960
But in this in this game if you jump and you use your jet pack most of the time you can

1126
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,960
get out of the atmosphere.

1127
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,960
You can see the curvature of the Earth.

1128
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,960
Yeah.

1129
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,960
It's really trippy and cool.

1130
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,960
That's awesome.

1131
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:07,960
Yeah.

1132
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,960
You you go around.

1133
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:20,960
The thing I really like about it two things one the space traversal is like really intuitive.

1134
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:28,960
You have like the the joystick forward like up and down is using your jet pack or your

1135
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,960
ships thrusters forward and backwards left and right is left and right and then to go

1136
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,960
up and down is to the the two trigger buttons.

1137
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:44,960
And using that it's it's very easy to get a grip of like how to move in a specific direction

1138
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,960
no matter what orientation you're looking at because you're always looking straightforward.

1139
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,960
It's a first person game.

1140
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:57,960
So it always makes sense and one like you can lock onto a planet when you're in your

1141
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:04,960
spaceship and it'll tell you like how much further you need to be using the thrusters

1142
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:12,960
to the left or the right or up and down to like be in the right like traveling velocity

1143
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,960
is matched.

1144
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,960
There's like a button you can hold to match the velocity of the thing you're locked onto

1145
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:25,960
and then you're traveling through space with that thing and then you can sort of like park

1146
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:31,960
your ship in a place where if there's no like large bodies like pulling you around with

1147
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:37,960
gravity you can sort of park your ship next to something such that the velocity is perfectly

1148
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:42,960
matched and you can get out of your ship and fly around with your little jet pack and you

1149
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,960
just go back to your ship perfectly perfectly match your velocity to to what to whatever

1150
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,960
you've locked onto.

1151
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,960
So if you point your crosshairs at a planet you lock onto it you get close to it you

1152
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,960
match your velocity.

1153
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,960
The sun in the center is always going to be pulling on you a little bit but if you're

1154
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,960
far away enough from things.

1155
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,960
Wait to land on a planet you have to like match its orbital velocity.

1156
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,960
Yeah.

1157
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,960
So like you're spinning around you're spinning around the sun with this planet at the same

1158
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,960
rate that it is and then you start you you can you know thruster down land on the planet

1159
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,960
and then obviously once you're touching the planet you're moving through space because

1160
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:29,960
it's like it's a very compacted area you can zoom from one side of the entire solar system

1161
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:36,960
very quickly and it's very exaggerated like I say you can jump on off some planets.

1162
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,960
As any good video game solar system should be.

1163
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,960
Yeah and it's you can like jump if you jump at the right time from one planet you can land

1164
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,960
on another one with your jet pack.

1165
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,960
Oh my god.

1166
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,960
That sounds awesome.

1167
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,960
That sounds so cool.

1168
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,960
It is really good.

1169
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:02,960
It's it's probably my favorite like space traversal like like system and then beyond

1170
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:09,960
that the the mysteries that you can uncover are a really fun and not too cryptic.

1171
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:15,960
They require you to think about like what you're learning and where you can like use

1172
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:24,960
the information you gain from like logs of information from one area and then bring it

1173
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,960
to another to solve a mystery so you can get into a specific location.

1174
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,960
So is it just one sorry it's just in one solar system that the game takes place.

1175
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:35,960
Yeah it's one solar system.

1176
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,960
Okay.

1177
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,960
And like if you know where to go it doesn't take long at all but sure figuring out where

1178
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,960
to go gathering clues it's sort of like a point and click adventure game I would say.

1179
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:48,960
Yeah.

1180
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:56,960
Where like like an old school one where you're not given a goal other than explore.

1181
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,960
We are a race of exploring aliens and we just want to see what's out there and then you

1182
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,960
find what's out there and you just keep going.

1183
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,960
It's like really cool.

1184
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,960
That sounds really cool.

1185
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,960
I would highly recommend Outer Wilds.

1186
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,960
Oh that's that's that's a little that's enticed me a little bit.

1187
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,960
Yeah I might check that out.

1188
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,960
Please do.

1189
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,960
I'm very close to the end of the game actually.

1190
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:31,960
I didn't want to I don't not spoiling anything with my with my intro here.

1191
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,960
Cool.

1192
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,960
So so I should be finished.

1193
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:40,960
There's only one mystery left I have to figure out is the place I haven't been able to get

1194
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:41,960
to.

1195
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,960
So in the comments don't spoil.

1196
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:45,960
No spoil.

1197
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,960
Yeah.

1198
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,960
Stupid commenters.

1199
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:58,960
Stupid commenters always spoiling spoiling spoiling spoiling my milk spoiling the my milk

1200
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,960
what else can spoil.

1201
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,960
That's it.

1202
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,960
Bread just just milk.

1203
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,960
Bread goes moldy.

1204
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,960
Meat meat can spoil.

1205
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,960
Oh yeah.

1206
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,960
Cheese I wouldn't say cheese cheese doesn't spoil but it gets moldy.

1207
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,960
It does.

1208
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,960
Meat meat spoils.

1209
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,960
Milk spoils I think that's pretty much it.

1210
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,960
That's like the only two things I would use the word spoils for.

1211
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Yeah.

1212
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,960
I have not been playing.

1213
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,960
I've not been playing anything.

1214
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,960
I've just been there's been pretty much just nose to the grindstone just like editing

1215
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,960
editing editing until I can't fucking stand it anymore.

1216
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,960
I can't for fucking stand it for fucking.

1217
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:48,960
It's funny when I hear myself stutter in my in my vocals I'm like what an idiot.

1218
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,960
It happens sometimes I think it I think it happens the normal amount of times everybody

1219
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,960
stutters now and then.

1220
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,960
Yes.

1221
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:06,960
There was a man I owned a guy on Twitter yesterday.

1222
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,960
Oh fuck yeah bro.

1223
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:16,960
It was this guy who he is is not important except it kind of is but the gist of it is

1224
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:22,960
that he had the most he just unironically in the year of our Lord 2022 unironically

1225
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:27,960
just like if I were Shinji I would have just gotten the Ava and like thought it was really

1226
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,960
cool to fight aliens.

1227
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,960
Oh yeah I saw that I saw that guy.

1228
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,960
That's a stupid bitch.

1229
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:38,960
It's like what was it I rewatched Ava and I don't relate to Shinji.

1230
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,960
What a pussy and words to that effect.

1231
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,960
Just sort of missing the point.

1232
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,960
Why is he so why is he so all I can't relate to the fact that like he's handed the chance

1233
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,960
to save the world and all he can do is wallow in self pity.

1234
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,960
Like oh my daddy doesn't like me boohoo.

1235
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:04,960
It's almost like it's more it's like metaphorical of stuff and it has themes that are more human

1236
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,960
than literal like let's kill the bad guy.

1237
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:13,960
Even if you take it literally he's still the character is like being asked to fucking put

1238
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,960
himself in mortal danger and like every time he does it he experiences like horrendous pain

1239
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,960
and suffering.

1240
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:25,960
It's like he shouldn't know this wouldn't feel good you moron but imbecile.

1241
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:33,960
Yeah it is it is kind of baffling like that he would come to such stupid conclusions like

1242
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,960
if I were Shinji then I would be better and I would win.

1243
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:44,960
I mean it's it's it's baffling and yet it's like it's like a cliche like the like I would

1244
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,960
have just I would just get in the robot and fight the aliens and fuck the girls like why

1245
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,960
didn't Shinji just do all those things like that's what I would do like oh cool cool bro

1246
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,960
happy for you.

1247
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,960
He was getting out was like aren't these like I remember one of them.

1248
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,960
That's like Mark Wahlberg saying that if he was on the plane he would have prevented 9-11.

1249
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,960
Yeah if I was on that plane the terrorists wouldn't have won.

1250
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:18,960
It was like he said like I get that it's like I understand the show but and then he says

1251
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,960
he doesn't understand the show.

1252
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:26,960
Yeah it was a tweet that was just sort of like I get it but but he doesn't get it.

1253
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,960
He definitely does not get it.

1254
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,960
I'm gonna find that.

1255
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:37,960
It's a take that you we've all seen it before it's just surprising to see it I don't know

1256
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:43,960
people are saying like damn this is this is like a it's like I'm back on Tumblr in 2008

1257
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:48,960
like in someone's post and like I would just get in the robot if I was Shinji I would I would be like

1258
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:55,960
hell yeah hell yeah I'll get in that cool robot like damn this guy's behind the discourse.

1259
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,960
I think I've seen this I've seen this guy before by the way this is not the first time

1260
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,960
I've seen a tweet of his this guy has had bad takes before but this one might take the cake

1261
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:11,960
honestly could yeah I guess if he's done it before I was gonna say it could be like oh

1262
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,960
a new generation of idiots are coming up and we've all seen these stupid things before

1263
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,960
but they haven't and now they're doing it again the history is repeating itself and we were all

1264
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,960
here to witness it for a second time.

1265
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:29,960
Oh did oh did I ratio him almost I've almost I've almost achieved ratio parity with his

1266
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:40,960
original tweet with my reply here I'll post the link for Eleazar I guess the this guy yeah

1267
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:46,960
I've seen this guy before this guy is like no joke this guy is like a French like Christo

1268
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:53,960
fascist who like works for a DC based like lobbying group that's like wants to implement the

1269
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:58,960
Christian equivalent of Sharia law in like American government like this guy's like yeah

1270
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,960
haha this guy had a funny Evangelion take and he's stupid but like he's a he's a literal

1271
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:08,960
demon and he doesn't deserve to continue to draw breath is is is I mean I could have

1272
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,960
told you that by the fact that he's got the little check mark oh yes and even worse and

1273
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:24,960
worse than all that he's verified on Twitter yeah so you know I hate I hate this guy and

1274
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:29,960
he's just here's just one more excellent reason I'm sorry if I'm treating you because you

1275
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,960
watched it at an age where you were like he's just like me for real for real but it's just

1276
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:40,960
not a great piece of filmmaking oh yeah and then like I mean filmmaking it's a character

1277
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,960
like he's criticizing the character and now he's saying the film he's saying that he's

1278
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,960
saying it's a bad it's a bad show he did a he did a thread about it and then he made

1279
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:56,960
like an eight or nine post-thread and then when he saw that like he was getting ratioed

1280
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:03,960
he added like 20 more posts to the thread yeah his takes on it are like it's just objectively

1281
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:07,960
bad filmmaking though like like you're supposed you're supposed to relate to the

1282
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:12,960
protagonist and the fact that I didn't relate to the protagonist because he has a problem

1283
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,960
right because he feels negative emotions in a in a scary situation like that made it

1284
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:24,960
unrelatable to me and therefore it's just objectively bad filmmaking right like and and

1285
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,960
all and all and all the she her pronoun people are telling me otherwise are just triggered

1286
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,960
he immediately went to like oops looks like I've triggered I've triggered the libs with

1287
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:40,960
my with my shitty Evangelion tape oh yeah this is parody he says I get I get that it's

1288
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:47,960
about being an angsty teenager right it isn't though it's not about being an angsty teenager

1289
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:53,960
that's not what the show is about I mean I don't I don't see why I mean even if it is

1290
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:59,960
about that I mean Shinji is that but like I don't I don't see it's more about abuse than

1291
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:04,960
it is about angst like lots of characters can have angst but Shinji is fucked because of

1292
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:11,960
his horrible bad and various other things right yeah it's about a lot more than just

1293
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,960
remember being a teenager remember when you want your teacher said you had to do your

1294
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,960
homework and you didn't want to shit Shinji Shinji is not like a normal kid there are

1295
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:26,960
there are other normal kids that you can compare him to in the show and like you can see you

1296
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,960
can very clearly see like no this is a kid with some with some specific shit that he's

1297
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:39,960
trying to work through you can bet that if I had been plucked from obscurity at age 13

1298
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,960
by a secret government organization to become a badass alien fighting pilot I wouldn't

1299
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:50,960
have been like whoa is me just unironically I would have just I would have been like hell

1300
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,960
yeah I would have been a much better child soldier than Shinji why I wouldn't have been

1301
01:38:54,960 --> 01:39:01,960
a pussy like Shinji I would have fought those aliens man I don't know I would have been

1302
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:06,960
like fuck yes I'm finally being recognized like he's just that's a little sad that's

1303
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:13,960
just sad like he I think he's he's like maybe he's seen anime where the main character is

1304
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:20,960
a nerdy loser who gets transported isekai and then he's the coolest bad guy badass ever

1305
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,960
and that's a you know an obvious power fantasy thing neon Genesis Evangelion is not a power

1306
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:34,960
fantasy it's just such a stupid like expectation that he has he in one of these he says like

1307
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,960
yeah yeah I would yeah I would have been like fuck yes I'm finally being recognized isn't

1308
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:45,960
that isn't that the whole point of these types of fantasies like like there's only one thing

1309
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:51,960
that an anime can be and it's a self-insert fantasy for like the fact the fact that Evangelion

1310
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:58,960
is not a straightforward power fantasy self-insert thing is like well well it didn't work you

1311
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:04,960
know it was it was trying to be this thing and it and it didn't do it so it wasn't good

1312
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:11,960
and and like I just I just don't know how to as I say as I say this person is this person

1313
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:16,960
is not only a moron this this person is evil this person is objectively evil in a terrible

1314
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:22,960
human being so it's not surprising that a terrible take flowed forth from them but they

1315
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:29,960
are also they are they are also stupid because their reasoning behind it is like just fucking

1316
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:42,960
like child child level child level media literacy going on here anyway I hate it yeah yeah fortunately

1317
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:49,960
like ton is fortunately he's French so most of his tweets I can't read is he French he

1318
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:56,960
is or he lives in France yeah he's French he seems to speak a lot of history and yeah

1319
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:01,960
he speaks in I mean you can tell in the original tweet he gets like the the tense wrong on a

1320
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:09,960
couple of adjectives or whatever he they don't decline correctly and like that's fine yeah

1321
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:16,960
he's French you see on his on his timeline most of more than a you know a significant

1322
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:23,960
amount of his tweets are in French so that's whatever and yet he works for a DC based a

1323
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:35,960
like a Christian lobbying collective or whatever which is weird well I thought DC like the

1324
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:45,960
comics no no like Washington DC yes yeah Washington DC comics yes my favorite that's all my

1325
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:52,960
that's all my hastily written notes about things that happened this week yeah you know what I

1326
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:58,960
have one last thing that is it's a very stupid thing it's it will only take a second I don't

1327
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:04,960
know where Philadelphia is in what state it is I know Philadelphia is a place where will

1328
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:10,960
smish will smish will smish will smish will smish was born and raised on the playground is where

1329
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:15,960
you spend most of his days but in West Virginia but like Philadelphia but where is it I think

1330
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:21,960
it's in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania you probably don't know where Pennsylvania is either I mean

1331
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:32,960
it's east coast not coast but close east area it's like it's like not okay I mean yeah there's

1332
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:39,960
the there's America and then there's the east coast and like the northern part the northern

1333
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:46,960
most part of the east coast is New England that's like Maine and New Hampshire and Vermont

1334
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:53,960
and Massachusetts and Rhode Island and Connecticut and I think that's it and then if you go sort

1335
01:42:53,960 --> 01:43:00,960
of west from there you eventually hit the Great Lakes and sort of the area like on south of

1336
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,960
the Great Lakes and just to the east of the Great Lakes that's what's called the Rust Belt

1337
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:09,960
and Pennsylvania is kind of in that in the region between like New England and the Rust Belt

1338
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:18,960
because because I hear I hear like Las Vegas, Nevada, Chicago, Illinois like but nobody ever

1339
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:23,960
says nobody ever says Philadelphia Pennsylvania because it's got too many syllables I guess it

1340
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:30,960
does have a lot of syllables yeah no you're right I think I think I feel you on that one

1341
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,960
I think I didn't know what state it was in for a while

1342
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,960
all right thank god that I'm not stupid

1343
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:44,960
no I even like passed through it like when I my commute or not my commute my trip to and from college

1344
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:52,960
back in the day I used to go through Philadelphia and I still was like I didn't you know how do you

1345
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,960
know you're in Pennsylvania you don't honestly honestly yeah the whole like Rust Belt New

1346
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,960
England like area it's like all these states just kind of go together and it's like am I in New

1347
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:09,960
Jersey am I in New York am I in Pennsylvania am I in Connecticut at Rhode Island at whatever

1348
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:16,960
it's all just fucking it's all just fucking there man it's all just mashed together who gives a

1349
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:24,960
shit it's all just woods all just landmass soon to be destroyed by hurricanes no borders

1350
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:39,960
abolish abolish ice from going to from from New Hampshire to to Maine what do they have up there

1351
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:47,960
Maine is yeah yeah Maine is the the top the top or most the top or most one where all the

1352
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:55,960
lobsters live and the moose the rain in Maine falls mostly on the Spain the that's how you know

1353
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:59,960
that's how you know you're in Maine as you go and you see moose well I guess I guess they have moose

1354
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:07,960
in like Vermont too they have maple syrup in Vermont they have lobsters in Maine they have beans

1355
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:16,960
in Massachusetts they have Dells lemonade in Rhode Island they have cookies in Maryland cookies

1356
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:22,960
because the Maryland brand cookies are popular over here so I know Maryland cookies I don't

1357
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:27,960
even know I don't even know if you have I'm not even familiar with that no let me type that

1358
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:36,960
that's an export oh from exotic from exotic I mean the the British probably hear that

1359
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:45,960
like oh like Queen Mary I love the Queen yeah remember her remember remember Queen Mary no

1360
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:55,960
image of the original Maryland cookies what the fucker what the fuck are these the hell is this

1361
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:01,960
they're fucking Maryland cookies I don't even know their chocolate chip cookies they're from

1362
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:12,960
Maryland they're probably made in in Beijing no it can't be I don't know no no not not all right

1363
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,960
well now we got to find out because if they're not even an American thing that would be very funny

1364
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:23,960
and they're they're probably there might be more than one place called Maryland might be

1365
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,960
other yeah may well Maryland cookies are a brand name of cookie produced by Burton's biscuit

1366
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:36,960
company in the United Kingdom that's so funny Burton's biscuit company is a British biscuit

1367
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,960
manufacturer but why but yeah why are they called that why are they called that they started

1368
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:49,960
making chocolate chip cookies cold Maryland cookies in 1956 but why but why it's literally

1369
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:53,960
just like this is this is cultural appropriation this is like when that white lady made a cookbook

1370
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:58,960
about dumplings and noodles and it was really racist of her this is this is like your that's

1371
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:04,960
what you're doing to me there's only one sentence of background information I was under the impression

1372
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:11,960
that the reason we call like cookies we consider the word cookie to be chocolate chip cookies

1373
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:17,960
is because the popularity of Maryland cookies being specifically chocolate chip and then the fact

1374
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:24,960
that you call all biscuits cookies was confusing to us but they were always done this to yourself

1375
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:31,960
we've done it to us and we've gaslit ourselves into being stupid this is this is a massive

1376
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:36,960
revelation and why is there no information about it I think you've mentioned this before

1377
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,960
and I think I have you know what you I think you I didn't know what you were talking about

1378
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:43,960
I guess we just didn't get into it at the time I just maybe you just assumed it was a brand you

1379
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,960
weren't aware of yeah if you search Maryland cookies some of the suggested result is our

1380
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:55,960
Maryland cookies American answer no right our story I'm on there I'm on Burton's biscuit company

1381
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:01,960
since the very beginning our story has been about baking really great biscuits that people love

1382
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:12,960
here I found a CBS news article called there's a UK cookie named after oh my god what I thought it

1383
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,960
was gonna make me not I thought it was gonna add block me so I couldn't read the article but no

1384
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:23,960
yeah there's a popular cookie in the UK and it's named after Maryland

1385
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:31,960
there's there's no explain no there's no explanation as to why it's just like hey did you know this

1386
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:42,960
exists okay bye I guess it could in Mexico in Mexico there's a great flavored soda called

1387
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:53,960
Delaware punch what the fuck exotic Delaware our brands tell me about your brands tell me

1389
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:05,960
just all the things you can sell well it's not it's not carbonated so it's not why do they call

1390
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:11,960
it soda Delaware okay the brand is currently owned by Coca-Cola company but it has been

1391
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,960
discontinued the Wikipedia article Delaware punch doesn't show like the branding or anything

1392
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:25,960
it just shows it like a cup of it I want to see like what the bottle looks like bro weak I'm

1393
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:33,960
so I it's not just that it's like oh it's English it's that there's no reason I thought there

1394
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:40,960
would be like a like oh the I got the recipe from there I'm a resident like it's hot there

1395
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:45,960
there must be a story behind it or like the if there's no story behind it then like the

1396
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:50,960
only explanation must be like there must have been something that made them think that calling

1397
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:56,960
them Maryland cookies would make them appealing and like I mean Maryland is a cute word I suppose

1398
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:05,960
I suppose but like I have no idea what that it was an American place okay okay check this out

1399
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:12,960
Delaware punch is named for the Delaware grape so it's like sort of named after the fruit that

1400
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:19,960
it's flavored from so like okay there is there is a reason for that it's not named after

1401
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:24,960
Delaware the state it's named after the Delaware grape a cultivar derived from the grape species

1402
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:35,960
whatever blah blah blah blah blah yeah I found the same yeah but okay I'm gonna I'm gonna

1403
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:45,960
directly ask Google why are they called Maryland cookies you've found that like a lot of news

1404
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:51,960
articles are barely more than a tweet these days they're just nothing in them there's no journalism

1405
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:57,960
going on they're just mentioning something I found out with the BBC recently just sometimes the BBC

1406
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:05,960
mentions that there's things happening and that's it there's no like why is it happening at all

1407
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:14,960
it's like okay why why you what there was this thing that was going on where like there was

1408
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:23,960
disturbance there were people being disturbing and Lester and police were making many arrests

1409
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:32,960
and I couldn't get any information from the BBC as to what was being fought over who was fighting

1410
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:38,960
why were they fighting and I had to go elsewhere and it was like oh there's like a war there's kind

1411
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:48,960
of a complicated ethnic like like fight between Hindus and Muslims in the area and it sort of

1412
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:55,960
got sparked from a cricket game that went that turned into a riot of some kind or like a punch

1413
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:01,960
up and it's like it's a lot more complicated but the BBC had no information about any of that

1414
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:07,960
they didn't even seem to care to to look into it they just said the police have made many arrests

1415
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:17,960
the police say the disturbance will be contained the end excellent how reassuring it's just like okay

1416
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:22,960
where's the journalism I kind of like journalism when it's interesting like like I want to find

1417
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:30,960
out stuff I want to know I found another article that's about Marilyn cookies but it's not about

1418
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:36,960
it mentions they were made in the UK but it's not like it doesn't explain it it just it goes on to be like

1419
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:43,960
here's how we handled a like you like the the marketing the launch of like a new flavor or something

1420
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:51,960
so nothing no help there's a new mystery there's a new mystery that needs solving

1421
01:52:52,960 --> 01:53:02,960
oh well some some things man mankind is just not meant to know some things I was gonna go to

1422
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:09,960
Maryland and I was gonna say where's the cookie factory and they say what's a cookie we don't know

1423
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:14,960
that they're like official website I did I'm gonna go to oh you did okay that there was nothing

1424
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:20,960
there it's just sort of like here's the different we got the Maryland cookie hazelnut the the mini

1425
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:28,960
cookies isn't it cool wouldn't you like to buy them oh they make jammy Dodgers as well oh they do

1426
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:37,960
didn't realize they have it on there have it on their brand those dammy Dodgers I made wagon wheels

1427
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:45,960
yeah dude you have dammy Dodgers and wagon wheels oh I saw a post I saw a post maybe it was this week

1428
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:53,960
it was from Java Giga and it was about like I don't know it basically just posted like a like a wall

1429
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:59,960
of like different hostess products and was like can't believe none of these tastes good now that I'm a grown

1430
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:10,960
up and like I actually hadn't tried a lot of them like I've never had donut sticks I've never had

1431
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:21,960
there's there's a lot of them that I don't know it's dicks yeah donuts donuts dicks I think some I think

1432
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:27,960
some of them though I think some hostess stuff would probably still taste good but a lot of them yeah

1433
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:33,960
I probably think would taste like shit now cosmic brownies or shit there were there were a lot of cosmic

1434
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,960
brownie defenders in the comments and those people are stupid cosmic brownies have always been shit

1435
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:43,960
they've never they were never even good even when you were good actually that's just an objective fact

1436
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:49,960
I don't really because I just don't I just don't relate to cosmic brownies like why are they why are they such

1437
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:55,960
hostesses why do they have to why do they have little little stars on them like I would just I would

1438
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:01,960
just I would just pilot the the cookies I would just I would just jump in your mouth stars or no

1439
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:09,960
I'm looking more at the Burton's biscuit apparently they own the rights to Marmite or they make Marmite

1440
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:17,960
biscuits gross like like a savory mark I can't imagine what that tastes like but they have a funny did you

1441
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:23,960
know section I said Marmite is the number one most confiscated food product at London City Airport

1442
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:33,960
why I don't know they they're just isn't that interesting people bring in Marmite and it gets confiscated

1443
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:39,960
they can't get enough they can't get enough of it they want to get confiscated it says that on their website

1444
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:51,960
yeah what I mean is that yeah I see it Marmite is the number but like I mean is that good maybe it's like

1445
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:58,960
people really want to bring Marmite on the plane but it's in a container of liquid that is too large

1446
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:04,960
and you can't have liquids that are that large in a container I've never had Marmite but I've had

1447
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:12,960
Vegemite and I feel like it's kind of the same thing it's it's similar ish I think I've had Vegemite once

1448
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:22,960
and it was just sort of like yeah that's that's that's the sort of like weird tangy sticky flavor yeah Marmite is

1449
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:32,960
probably stronger I think I see well yeah I had Vegemite once and I was like you know they told me like only

1450
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:41,960
use a little bit of it so I only used a little bit and I was like hmm yeah kind of like salty tangy fermented flavor

1451
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:48,960
wasn't wasn't super into it you gotta have Marmite but maybe I could get but I thought maybe I could get used to it

1452
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:54,960
on a crumpet yeah crumpet a butted crumpet with Marmite on top that's the best place for Marmite for me

1453
01:56:54,960 --> 01:57:01,960
I did have a crumpet once and I liked it I thought it was very funnily enough I thought the crumpet was very similar to

1454
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:08,960
an English muffin which I guess they don't have in England um oh yeah you've got Maryland cookies we've got English muffins

1455
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:15,960
yeah I was gonna say that but I think we did I had an English muffin for like for breakfast so I guess they do sell them here

1456
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:19,960
I don't know where they're from though it would be funny if they are from America

1457
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,960
well we got to find out now we got to find out this is a huge network

1458
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:32,960
I think oh it's not a brand it's just a thing so where is it from yeah um

1459
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:37,960
origin is there is there a Wikipedia article yes there is

1460
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,960
oh it's a very old thing

1461
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:51,960
the bell ringing of muffin men became so common that by 1839 the British parliament passed a bill to prohibit bell ringing by muffin men

1462
01:57:51,960 --> 01:58:00,960
but it was not a deal to my sellers in 1861 good quote unquote good sized muffins from street sellers were commonly sold for a half penny each

1463
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:08,960
crumpets were about a penny okay so a crumpet costs twice as much as an English muffin

1464
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,960
what the fuck which part did you oh bell ringing

1465
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:19,960
yeah they're orange muffin men were bell ringing is prohibited for muffin men

1466
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:29,960
you know it makes sense the muffin man like an old timey and then okay and it wasn't it wouldn't have been like they're extremely sugary muffins that we know of

1467
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,960
that I think of because that's sugar is quite expensive so

1468
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:50,960
yeah I guess I never I never thought about it okay so I didn't even know this that yeah a muffin man was just something you call just like a guy who sold like cakes little little confections

1469
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,960
little little muffins street a street vendor yeah okay

1470
01:58:53,960 --> 01:59:02,960
English muffins are sometimes referred to simply as muffins in the UK well that's not true American style muffins are occasionally referred to as American muffins

1471
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:11,960
no not for me when I think of muffin I think of the American style sugary like like sploado out the little cupcake thing

1472
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:17,960
from the from the Seinfeld episode with top of the muffin two year top of yeah

1473
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:20,960
you've seen that you've seen that one I haven't I haven't seen Seinfeld

1474
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,960
I think it's I think it's a late you've never seen Seinfeld like at all

1475
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:30,960
no I've never gotten around to it was never like on TV when I was young we had friends on all the time and like

1476
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:39,960
and I guess I never really watched much friends I'm pretty sure Seinfeld is better than friends I think I'm confident friends is is boring

1477
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:49,960
I didn't I never was into friends that much I just when I was young it was just so like I love that theme song and then people talk and there's a love track and I assume it's funny

1478
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:59,960
God Fresh Prince was actually good I love Fresh Prince the increasing popularity of flatbread muffins is attested by the existence of muffin men a type of

1479
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:08,960
hawker who would travel door to door selling English muffins as a snack bread before most homes have their own man before most homes of their own ovens

1480
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:18,960
I imagine someone today like going door to door like would they come up and knock on your door imagine getting a knock on your door and it's someone like hey you want to buy some muffins

1481
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:24,960
I mean I guess like Girl Scouts still do that kind of thing yeah that would annoy the shit out of me

1482
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:39,960
um I mean you're not you're not a muffin boy you don't like muffins I guess I it's not that I don't it's just it's one of those like people coming to your door

1483
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:47,960
is just a thing that doesn't happen unless you've ordered something and to be delivered yeah yeah I guess back in the day maybe it was just more

1484
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:56,960
it's more communal especially if it's like in a city and everyone's like in like tiny apartments really close together

1485
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:06,960
yeah it's just like it's me the muffin man down the old cobble street get your muffins

1486
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:15,960
a well-known reference to English muffins is an Oscar Wilde 1895 play the importance of being earnest

1487
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:22,960
um I'm still not seeing like why why these muffins in particular are called English muffins

1488
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,960
well hang on something the man

1489
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:30,960
I guess they're just called it to distinguish them from the American style I guess

1490
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:35,960
Samuel Bath Thomas I guess that's the same reason that everyone else calls it American football

1491
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:41,960
using his mother's recipe began making English muffins in 1880 in New York selling them to hotels

1492
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:47,960
they were soft and spongy before baking like traditional muffins appears to be fork split prior to toasting blah blah blah

1493
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:53,960
they became popular as an alternative to toast something something muffin house

1494
02:01:53,960 --> 02:02:00,960
all I'm saying is just that when I think of a crumpet I think of like oh it's just an it's an inside out English muffin

1495
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:04,960
English muffin with no crust that's what I think of a crumpet is

1496
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:15,960
the answer to the question then is it was from an Englishman who emigrated to the US that the term for the current understood English muffin product

1497
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:19,960
he branded them as English muffins because muffins were already a thing

1498
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:24,960
yes and apparently that today the company is owned by Bimbo Bakery's USA

1499
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,960
no way

1500
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:29,960
Bimbo Bakery's USA let me see

1501
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,960
that's like is that like fanboy Hooters Bimbo Bakery

1502
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,960
yeah I don't know

1503
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:41,960
is the American corporate north of the border armor of the Mexican multinational Bakery

1504
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:43,960
Grupo Bimbo

1505
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:46,960
I want to go to Bimbo Bakery that sounds awesome

1506
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:52,960
so there's a Mexican multinational Bakery product manufacturing company called Grupo Bimbo

1507
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:58,960
and they now own the English muffin north of the border

1508
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:02,960
you're jerking me around here

1509
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,960
Grupo Bimbo

1510
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:10,960
you're telling me that Maryland cookies are British and English muffins are Mexican

1511
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,960
English muffins are owned currently by a Mexican company

1512
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,960
oh look at this Bimbo Bakery's Spanish pronunciation Bimbo

1513
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,960
so it's the same

1514
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,960
yeah Grupo Bimbo

1515
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,960
Grupo Bimbo

1516
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,960
hell yeah

1517
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,960
well what can I say other than fantastic

1518
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,960
how do we get on this subject from crumpets

1519
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:40,960
I have no idea

1520
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,960
you said you mentioned a crumpet

1521
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:46,960
oh it's called Maryland cookies and I forget why I brought those up

1522
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,960
oh well

1523
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,960
well we sure have learned

1524
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,960
we sure have learned a lot

1525
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,960
the Bimbo Bakery's is probably my favorite

1526
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,960
what do they make anything else besides

1527
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,960
soccer sponsorship

1528
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,960
Sarah Lee acquisition

1529
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:11,960
wait it agreed to acquire the North American fresh bakery business

1530
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:16,960
okay so it acquired part of the Sarah Lee corporation

1531
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,960

1532
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:21,960

02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:41,960
under the Bimbo umbrella

1540
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:44,960
oh wow okay

1541
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:46,960

1550
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,960
and yeah it turns out Bimbo owns Thomas's

1551
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:08,960

02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:11,960

Ethosphere Institute recognized Grupo Bimbo

02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,960
there used to be all like

1600
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:01,960
wait a minute I have it set to 100 per

1601
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:03,960

02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:08,960
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

1604
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,960
you do 3 to 4

1605
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,960
5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9

1606
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,960
there's 30 but like a lot of them are just spam

1607
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,960
okay

1608
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,960
alright so I think the first one is called

1609
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,960
cell are you ready

1610
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,960
uh yes

1611
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,960
alright 3 2 1 go

1612
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,960
uh

1613
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:28,960
pro-grastinatus

1614
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:30,960
it is I

1615
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,960
perfectly continent cell

1616
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,960
I have been engineered by Dr.Gerot

1617
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,960
using the fecal matter of the most elite warriors

1618
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,960
in this universe to be the next

1619
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,960
step in evolution

1620
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,960
the perfect life form

1621
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:44,960
you foolish podcasters

1622
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,960
have a long and stubborn

1623
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,960
history of refusing to shit

1624
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,960
this holy

1625
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,960
icon

1626
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,960
freely from my lower abdomen

1627
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,960
is not a sign of shame

1628
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,960
but the indicator of my complete

1629
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:00,960
and not a superiority of

1630
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:02,960
your entire species

1631
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,960
hmm okay

1632
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,960
very impressive

1633
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:15,960
no

1634
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,960
you know

1635
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:19,960
I've never seen the cell saga

1636
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:21,960
I've seen early

1637
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,960
DBZ and I've seen like the boo

1638
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:25,960
saga ending of it

1639
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,960
I've never seen the gohan

1640
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:29,960
cell stuff

1641
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:31,960
I quite liked cell

1642
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,960
I liked him less when he was perfect cell

1643
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,960
and they did the tournament

1644
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:37,960
and then they fight and they win

1645
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,960
the whole android stuff

1646
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,960
with the

1647
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,960
and the red ribbon army

1648
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:45,960
things

1649
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:47,960
it's quite good

1650
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:49,960
and then trunks coming back

1651
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,960
and using a sword

1652
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:53,960
I didn't have cable

1653
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,960
as a kid so when we finally got cable

1654
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,960
that was the first time I could watch

1655
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,960
DBZ and it was

1656
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:01,960
it was all the way in the boo

1657
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:03,960
era so that was when I started

1658
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:05,960
watching it

1659
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:07,960
and like I heard about the older stuff

1660
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,960
but I went back and I

1661
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:11,960
rewatched just the very beginning of it

1662
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,960
the Frieza bits

1663
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,960
next one is called hey Ben

1664
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:17,960
new fan here who is

1665
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:19,960
Trixie and why is it funny they

1666
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:21,960
sorry

1667
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:23,960
didn't finish your question so

1668
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,960
I can't answer

1669
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:27,960
next one is called

1670
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,960
hashtag bring

1671
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,960
Trixie back I assume it's from the same person

1672
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:33,960
who doesn't know who she is

1673
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:35,960
but nevertheless wants her back

1674
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:37,960
next one is

1675
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:39,960
sim card no sim card

1676
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,960
no service okay

1677
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:43,960
next one is called hypothetical NFTs

1678
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,960
here's a real one

1679
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:47,960
3 2 1 go

1680
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:49,960
an artist I followed was approached and asked to make an NFT of one of their works

1681
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:51,960
the artist explained to the perspective

1682
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,960
by that it was a dumb idea

1683
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,960
wouldn't really provide value wasn't a good investment

1684
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,960
and would be bad for the environment

1685
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:59,960
the perspective by acknowledges this and still offered

1686
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:01,960
tens of thousands of dollars so the artist

1687
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:03,960
accepted the money created the NFT

1688
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,960
and spent a good chunk of the proceeds over

1689
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:07,960
correcting for the carbon emitted through carbon offsets

1690
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:09,960
this isn't an offer but as a hypothetical

1691
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:11,960
would you be comfortable creating and selling an NFT

1692
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:13,960
in a situation like that

1693
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,960
I'm sorry tens of thousands of dollars

1694
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:17,960
for

1695
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:19,960
for one NFT

1696
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:23,960
I guess

1697
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:25,960
I mean I know that they have

1698
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,960
if

1699
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,960
hypothetically

1700
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:31,960
if hypothetically you could offset

1701
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:33,960
the

1702
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,960
the negative

1703
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:37,960
the carbon emission stuff

1704
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:39,960
I think the difficulty

1705
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:41,960
is just that it

1706
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:43,960
existing

1707
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:45,960
legitimizes NFTs further

1708
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:47,960
which does generally more damage

1709
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:49,960
than you can just pay for

1710
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:51,960
this is not

1711
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:53,960
a scenario that I've ever heard of

1712
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:55,960
I've never heard of like

1713
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:57,960
an NFT guy comes to an artist

1714
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:59,960
and says hey artist I will give you

1715
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:01,960
tens of thousands of dollars right now

1716
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:03,960
if you will let me

1717
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,960
mint your

1718
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:07,960
piece

1719
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:09,960
one piece of yours

1720
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:11,960
I've never heard I don't believe it

1721
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:13,960
I just don't think that happens

1722
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:15,960
if anything they would steal the art

1723
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,960
and just make the NFT anyway

1724
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:19,960
the money in NFTs

1725
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:21,960
is from doing the big

1726
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:23,960
drops of like the big sets

1727
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,960
of you know the

1728
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:27,960
algorithmically generated

1729
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:29,960
the character sets

1730
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:31,960
yeah

1731
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:33,960
but they say it's a hypothetical

1732
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:35,960
so in the hypothetical scenario

1733
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,960
I would still feel a little iffy about it

1734
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,960
because the

1735
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:41,960
the overall effect is not merely

1736
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:43,960
the one transaction

1737
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:45,960
the transactions will continue

1738
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:47,960
if the thing gets traded a lot

1739
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,960
for its lifetime an NFT

1740
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:51,960
will rack up

1741
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:53,960
gas costs

1742
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:55,960
it's just like I'd rather it not exist

1743
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:57,960
I mean

1744
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:59,960
okay

1745
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:01,960
but like I don't think one

1746
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:03,960
NFT

1747
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:05,960
is like

1748
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,960
tens of thousands of dollars in damage

1749
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:09,960
to the environment

1750
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:11,960
I think honestly yeah I think

1751
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:13,960
if someone gave me tens of thousands

1752
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,960
of dollars to make one NFT

1753
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:17,960
yeah I think I could live with myself

1754
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:19,960
yeah

1755
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,960
it would be their problem

1756
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,960
I don't think they meant that the environment cost would be 10,000

1757
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,960
but like you would get money

1758
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:27,960
and some of that could be used to offset the

1759
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:29,960
carbon

1760
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,960
damage

1761
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,960
I wouldn't feel bad about minting one NFT

1762
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:35,960
like I wouldn't think that that was like

1763
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:37,960
a terrible crime that I had committed

1764
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,960
or anything yeah I would accept

1765
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,960
I would accept thousands of dollars

1766
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:43,960
for someone to mint one NFT

1767
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:45,960
because like it's not because it's not going to keep selling

1768
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:47,960
like

1769
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,960
I know it's a waste of resources

1770
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,960
but like

1771
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,960
these things are not

1772
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:55,960
going to continue to circulate

1773
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,960
nobody's going to give a shit

1774
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,960
yeah

1775
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:01,960
I guess you'd have to balance like

1776
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:03,960
I would just think that that buyer was wasting their money

1777
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:05,960
I would think they were a sucker

1778
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:07,960
and a sap and I would let them

1779
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:09,960
pay me for essentially nothing

1780
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:11,960
sure why not

1781
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:13,960
I

1782
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,960
that's just not how it works

1783
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:17,960
that's just not how it works in practice

1784
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:19,960
no it's not how it works

1785
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:21,960
I think there's more damage

1786
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,960
I don't know whether it's like worth

1787
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,960
like the damage to your reputation

1788
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,960
is it worth thousands of dollars

1789
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:29,960
if people think you're an NFT shill

1790
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:31,960
would you lose thousands of dollars worth

1791
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:33,960
of new potential work

1792
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,960
I don't know how to like gauge that

1793
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,960
well in the described scenario

1794
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:39,960
I wouldn't go on Twitter and advertise

1795
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:41,960
NFT because I'd already have the money

1796
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,960
and I wouldn't need to do that

1797
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,960
but like the thing would be an NFT

1798
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,960
would they not like

1799
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:51,960
say from Ben St

1800
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,960
Ben St original

1801
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:55,960
NFT official

1802
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:57,960
I would just say

1803
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,960
okay

1804
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:01,960
maybe this guy

1805
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,960
he goes to his

1806
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:05,960
social media and he proclaims

1807
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,960
guys I have minted

1808
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:09,960
an artwork made by Ben St

1809
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,960
that Ben St piece that everybody

1810
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:13,960
loves so much it's on the blockchain

1811
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:15,960
you can buy the NFT of it

1812
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:17,960
I would I mean

1813
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,960
I would just say like yeah

1814
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:21,960
I let him do that because he gave me

1815
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:23,960
tens of thousands of dollars and like

1816
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:25,960
I don't

1817
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:27,960
I like for for nothing

1818
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,960
I don't know

1819
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:33,960
that's that's it

1820
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,960
I mean I don't think it would sell

1821
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,960
but even if it did

1822
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:39,960
like okay whatever

1823
02:14:41,960 --> 02:14:43,960
I don't know I don't

1824
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:47,960
I wouldn't I would not I would not become

1825
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,960
an NFT shill because I don't believe

1826
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:51,960
in the NFT business model

1827
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:53,960
but if someone

1828
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:55,960
but if someone big gave me a bunch of money

1829
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,960
to make to make an NFT

1830
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:59,960
like what one and done

1831
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:01,960
thing that I never have to

1832
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:03,960
think about again sure

1833
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,960
I mean I think

1834
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:07,960
the root of this is like this guy's

1835
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:09,960
asking could

1836
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:11,960
NFTs be good if

1837
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:13,960
hypothetical like scenario

1838
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:15,960
is favorable to you

1839
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:17,960
I'm like well yeah

1840
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:19,960
if there were no problem

1841
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:21,960
with like the

1842
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:23,960
carbon emissions

1843
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,960
and all of the other things that make NFTs

1844
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:27,960
stupid I wouldn't mind honestly

1845
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,960
you've described a very specific

1846
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:31,960
scenario

1847
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:33,960
where the where the deck is stacked

1848
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,960
such that like this NFT transaction

1849
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:37,960
is very favorable

1850
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:39,960
and it's just it's just doesn't

1851
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,960
really buy

1852
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:43,960
and large it doesn't go like that

1853
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:45,960
I think that answers the question

1854
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:47,960
yes okay

1855
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:49,960
next one is an

1856
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:51,960
Imgur album

1857
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,960
every squad got

1858
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:59,960
and it's a bunch of it's the PCP

1859
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:01,960
the

1860
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,960
the dyke the racist

1861
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,960
the Italian

1862
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:09,960
this motherfucker

1863
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:11,960
the funny one American serial killer

1864
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:13,960
every squad got American serial killer

1865
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:15,960
endless jest

1866
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:17,960
the fat bitch I look cool here

1867
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:19,960
the Sasuke

1868
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:21,960
the motherfucking

1869
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:23,960
a roach

1870
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,960
what the fuck

1871
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,960
this must be based on something else

1872
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,960
something else

1873
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:31,960
oh no it's it's definitely a meme I've seen

1874
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:33,960
not with these specific terms

1875
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,960
but just sort of like every squad

1876
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:37,960
every squad has the list of completely

1877
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,960
insane things that

1878
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:41,960
not every squad actually has

1879
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:43,960
I've seen the every squad got

1880
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:45,960
the I've seen that format before

1881
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:47,960
but like these choices are so specific

1882
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:49,960
they must be

1883
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:51,960
based on a specific like iteration

1884
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:53,960
of that

1885
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:55,960
other like why would they why would they put

1886
02:16:55,960 --> 02:16:57,960
why would they put Jeff

1887
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,960
why would they put Jeff

1888
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:01,960
well I mean

1889
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,960
if I were to vote

1890
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:05,960
nine PCP members I would go with

1891
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:07,960
this must be because it matches

1892
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:09,960
some whatever

1893
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:11,960
was here in the original version

1894
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:13,960
yeah maybe

1895
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:15,960
I like how I look in this

1896
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:17,960
that's a good eye

1897
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:19,960
I like how I look as well I think that looks awesome

1898
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:21,960
look at that slime

1899
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:23,960
delicious

1900
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,960
like Nate's

1901
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,960
shiny forehead

1902
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:31,960
yeah you've kind of got like

1903
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:33,960
one of those big

1904
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:35,960
like reggae

1905
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:37,960
beanies

1906
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:39,960
is that what that is?

1907
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:41,960
it just sort of like it bloops backwards and then

1908
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:43,960
there's a whole other lump underneath

1909
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,960
like a big big big

1910
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,960
I don't wear a hat like that

1911
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:49,960
in real life but I mean

1912
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:51,960
I could

1913
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:53,960
next one is called hey Ben new fan here

yeah bro

1918
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:03,960
your recording was too short

1919
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:05,960
we couldn't hear the end of it

1920
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:07,960
next Ben's weekly reminder

1921
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:09,960
play delta ring chapter two okay

1922
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:11,960
Ben's weekly reminder catch up to one piece

1923
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:13,960
okay

1924
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:15,960
next one is I love that Trixie

1925
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:17,960
blammed youtube for her channel

1926
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:19,960
failing

1927
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,960
let's do one go

1928
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:33,960
is that called corona

1929
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:35,960
mmm

1930
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:37,960
I mean we all know cold corona

1931
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:39,960
was transformed by the trans beam

1932
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:41,960
in the events of

1933
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:43,960
road to radcon

1934
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:45,960
and became corona Chan

1935
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:47,960
aka the corona virus so

1936
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:49,960
yes who knows what could have happened

1937
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:51,960
since then

1938
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,960
um

1939
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,960
did Trixie blame youtube for her channel

1940
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:57,960
failing I didn't watch that video

1941
02:18:57,960 --> 02:18:59,960
uh she did she did

1942
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:01,960
meant

1943
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:03,960
I wouldn't say that she like exclusively

1944
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,960
blamed it but she did say that like

1945
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,960
yeah youtube doesn't promote

1946
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:09,960
my videos anymore and that's why I can't

1947
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:11,960
uh she did she did mention

1948
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,960
it as a reason yeah

1949
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:15,960
it's just really like

1950
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,960
man a

1951
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:19,960
do you know who jack saint is

1952
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:21,960
uh twitter man I don't know

1953
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:23,960
what he does well he is a twitter man

1954
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:25,960
I mean he was a youtube man I mean he

1955
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:27,960
still is a youtube man he was away for a while

1956
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,960
but he's back to making videos yeah I saw

1957
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,960
I saw him um saying

1958
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:33,960
like youtube is suppressing my new video

1959
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:35,960
I

1960
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:37,960
thought it was cringe I thought it was a little cringe

1961
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,960
I like I like that guy and I

1962
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:41,960
have liked his videos before but

1963
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:43,960
uh yeah it is it is

1964
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:45,960
kind of a video yeah his new video

1965
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:47,960
was first of all he said so like

1966
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,960
literally like one hour after the video

1967
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:51,960
went live he was like I'm looking at the

1968
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:53,960
metrics and I'm sure that the youtube is suppressing

1969
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:55,960
it and it's like

1970
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:57,960
I mean it might

1971
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:59,960
be it might be not pushing it as

1972
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:01,960
hard as usual because it doesn't like

1973
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:03,960
the the title or the keyword or something

1974
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:05,960
like that sure that kind of thing does happen

1975
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:07,960
I mean a lot of the time it could be because

1976
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:09,960
of lack of frequency of uploads

1977
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:11,960
and doesn't push the new

1978
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:13,960
one quite so much I mean I know

1979
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:15,960
that it's funny because these things

1980
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,960
are true to a certain extent

1981
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:19,960
but it's so weird to blame

1982
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:21,960
them when you don't actually know why

1983
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:23,960
you can you can you can make inferred

1984
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,960
guesses but it seems

1985
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,960
kind of like pointless

1986
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,960
to blame the algorithm for a video

1987
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,960
not working when it could just

1988
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:33,960
be that people aren't interested

1989
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:35,960
I yeah I look

1990
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,960
in looking at that

1991
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:39,960
I

1992
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:41,960
kind of thought that like there were probably

1993
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,960
other explanations for why that video

1994
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:45,960
wasn't doing well then why

1995
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:47,960
then that like some sort of

1996
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:49,960
yeah he's he seemed to say

1997
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:51,960
that like youtube was deliberately

1998
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:53,960
suppressing it because it was about

1999
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:55,960
youtube creator burnout and like

2000
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:57,960
I kind of think that what's more

2001
02:20:57,960 --> 02:20:59,960
likely there is just maybe

2002
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:01,960
maybe youtube

2003
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:03,960
maybe youtube doesn't like it when you call

2004
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,960
a video something about

2005
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,960
youtube burnout like it might not like that

2006
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:09,960
title the algorithm might think that

2007
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:11,960
that's like bad I could

2008
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:13,960
believe that that I could also just believe

2009
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:15,960
that like people aren't that interested

2010
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:17,960
in watching a video about a youtuber

2011
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:19,960
explaining like how they got

2012
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:21,960
burned out because like who cares

2013
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:23,960
it yeah

2014
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:25,960
yeah so a lot of people

2015
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,960
do it a lot of people fall into

2016
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:29,960
that trap and it's

2017
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:31,960
kind of dumb and like there's a little

2018
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:33,960
truth to it but there's a little

2019
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:35,960
truth it's just not enough truth to like

2020
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,960
I think it's true

2021
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:39,960
so much less

2022
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:41,960
like it's true so much less often than

2023
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:43,960
it's claimed

2024
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:45,960
yeah I would

2025
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:47,960
I would assume

2026
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:49,960
I would assume that is

2027
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,960
complained about more

2028
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:53,960
and well the thing is that

2029
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:55,960
even if it's justified

2030
02:21:55,960 --> 02:21:57,960
I'm not interested in people

2031
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:59,960
complaining about it

2032
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:01,960
it just annoys me a little

2033
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:03,960
yeah

2034
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:05,960
the thing about it does not make the youtube

2035
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:07,960
algorithm like you more

2036
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:09,960
it is not a solution to this problem

2037
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:11,960
whining to youtube will never do anything

2038
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:13,960
we know this

2039
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:15,960
just continually make videos

2040
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:17,960
I mean youtube is harsh

2041
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:19,960
the algorithm is harsh

2042
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:21,960
it's a little bit but people can still

2043
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:23,960
I mean honestly yeah people can still

2044
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,960
find your videos and honestly

2045
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:27,960
whenever I see that it's like

2046
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,960
this is definitely the case

2047
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:31,960
for when Trixie did it it's like

2048
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:33,960
hey I'm being suppressed by the algorithm

2049
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:35,960
like my videos are not

2050
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:37,960
being shown to people like what that actually

2051
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:39,960
means is just the algorithm

2052
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,960
is not boosting me anymore the algorithm

2053
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:43,960
is not helping me and pushing me the way it used

2054
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:45,960
to right the algorithm can

2055
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,960
push you and boost you and put your video

2056
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:49,960
in front of other people but it can't

2057
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,960
it can't stop people from

2058
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:53,960
finding your video if they want to

2059
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:55,960
watch it right

2060
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:57,960
so like

2061
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,960
it just it's not

2062
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:01,960
like youtube is hiding your video

2063
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:03,960
it's that youtube isn't

2064
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:05,960
promoting it which is not

2065
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:07,960
the same thing

2066
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:09,960
I think it's wrong

2067
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:11,960
to see it like

2068
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:13,960
oh youtube is artificially suppressing me

2069
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,960
it's more like youtube is no longer

2070
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:17,960
artificially boosting me

2071
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:19,960
that's the difference

2072
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:21,960
and that's what I hear when I see people complain about that

2073
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:23,960
I mean I have heard reports

2074
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:25,960
of like certain

2075
02:23:25,960 --> 02:23:27,960
keywords being said in a video

2076
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:29,960
will cause it to be like

2077
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:31,960
blacklisted or certain creators

2078
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:33,960
to be blacklisted like

2079
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:35,960
Alex Jones or something for things he

2080
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:37,960
says and then they target them and I'm like

2081
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:39,960
okay I can see that it's probably

2082
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:41,960
what do you mean by blacklisted?

2083
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:43,960
blacklisted meaning that it's hard to find

2084
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:45,960
even if you type in their name

2085
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:47,960
there'll be videos that come up

2086
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:49,960
that are not of them but are about

2087
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,960
them by other people

2088
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:53,960
and I'm like okay well that's

2089
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:55,960
potentially a thing I think

2090
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:57,960
it's usually annoying to me because

2091
02:23:57,960 --> 02:23:59,960
it's an individual complaining about their

2092
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:01,960
specific situation rather than

2093
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,960
a video talking about

2094
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:05,960
all of the available evidence and what we

2095
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:07,960
actually do know for sure

2096
02:24:07,960 --> 02:24:09,960
and what is most likely

2097
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:11,960
and least likely on a larger

2098
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:13,960
scale I think I would be interested in a video

2099
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:15,960
about the algorithm

2100
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:17,960
with that but

2101
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:19,960
largely we just can't know

2102
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,960
cause it's this

2103
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:23,960
insane black box

2104
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:25,960
and that's deliberate

2105
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:27,960
like the algorithm is deliberately

2106
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:29,960
mysterious they don't want us to know how it

2107
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:31,960
works I think you can

2108
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:33,960
in hindsight find out

2109
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:35,960
what the algorithm was doing

2110
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:37,960
you can't really figure it out currently

2111
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:39,960
you need a lot of

2112
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:41,960
reference points

2113
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:43,960
a lot of data

2114
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:45,960
to come up to a conclusion and individuals

2115
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,960
saying that they think their thing

2116
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:49,960
is being suppressed I'm like I just don't know

2117
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:51,960
whether you know what you're talking about

2118
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:53,960
what's more likely

2119
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:55,960
that that's

2120
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:57,960
really happening

2121
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,960
or just that the algorithm

2122
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:01,960
has de-favored you

2123
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:03,960
in a way that makes you think it's happening

2124
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:05,960
and the latter is just more likely

2125
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:07,960
most of the time

2126
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:11,960
it requires extraordinary evidence

2127
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:13,960
to really demonstrate like yes

2128
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:15,960
this is a deliberate conspiracy by YouTube

2129
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:17,960
to

2130
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:19,960
suppress my content

2131
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,960
yep

2132
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,960
okay

2133
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:25,960
next one is called happy birthday Ben

2134
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,960
okay thank you

2135
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:29,960
the next one after that is called an innocent request

2136
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:31,960
for the host Ben Sains

2137
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,960

2151
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:03,960

Winnie the Pooh

is growing up

2159
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:21,960
do you think it's like

2160
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:23,960
going through

2161
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,960

2167
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:37,960
do I think that Winnie the Pooh is going up

2168
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:39,960
through poo bear

2169
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,960

after his kidney stolen

2196
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:35,960
he yielded many clones

2197
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:37,960
pain

2198
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:39,960
they proceeded to rape and pillage our lands

2199
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,960
governments fell apart

2200
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:43,960
the world collapsed

2201
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:45,960
pain

02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:47,960
world order is in chaos

everyone

2209
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:01,960

02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:11,960
he's on his throne drinking bang energy

2215
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:13,960
and we just get monster zero

pa pa pa pa pa pa

2231
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:53,960
he didn't do it

2232
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:55,960
i mean what can i say

2233
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:57,960
other than i agree

2234
02:28:57,960 --> 02:28:59,960
yes

2235
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:01,960
next one is called

2236
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:03,960
mikey tyke

2237
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:11,720
one go all right so my the math book and I wasn't sure if the message quality

2238
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:19,800
was great so I'm gonna record this one again this is a thread this is not a

2239
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:28,800
voicemail well if you don't not let my if you don't let my fucky bastard

2240
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:35,840
don't have the weed out fucking minion message just constantly man that's

2241
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:39,200
just not about it

2242
02:29:39,200 --> 02:30:03,280
I mean these are these are you know there's artistry to these but like they

2243
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:10,480
don't say anything no they're like well the YouTube poop like audio logs that

2244
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:15,240
you would find in a in fallout something like that I think there's another one

2245
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:23,800
here cuz the next one is called duh oi duh three two one go hello it is I

2246
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:31,320
don't Jesus again and I think I might have messed up a little bit ever since I

2247
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:37,440
released the mate messman this track which is completely destroyed best guy

2248
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:44,400
ever he will never recover in shambles it seems that the PCP voice fail and also

2249
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:54,200
the Kiwi farms have gone down and that's not very good also my son the baby

2250
02:30:54,200 --> 02:31:01,080
he died Jesus and that's also not good so I was wondering I would say those are

2251
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:03,080
equally bad

2252
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:23,320
god the audio quality on that was horrible did you hear it like ringing yeah

2253
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:27,880
he was inside a cave he was inside it like a long tube it was like that whatever

2254
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:33,240
he was speaking there was like a just barely audible like like like like like

2255
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:38,840
dog whistle like high-pitched sound accompanying it sounded like horrible but

2256
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:46,440
anyway how do I deal with not having a child very carefully oh yeah it can happen

2257
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:55,320
at any moment good sorry about your loss did you the Kiwi farms is down I we

2258
02:31:55,320 --> 02:32:00,120
not mention that when that happened I don't know if we did mention it I admit

2259
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:04,200
I admit I do miss it a little bit because I would occasionally check up of the

2260
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:10,280
Trixie thread and just see what I know I didn't post in it but I did check it

2261
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:14,200
occasionally I acknowledge that it's probably you know a good thing on the

2262
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:21,880
whole that it's gone but yeah I have I have I did now I have one less thing

2263
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:27,640
that I read now so it's it's never good to like fester I would say

2264
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:34,440
yeah it's probably better this way for me even for just for me personally it's

2265
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:40,920
probably better a clean a clean break yes not that there was going to be any news

2266
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:46,200
about that ever again I mean well now they've got wee wee farms the new site

2267
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:50,360
is that true no I don't know I mean they're doing something

2268
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:56,440
last I checked there was still no it was still gone but I heard some people saying

2269
02:32:56,440 --> 02:33:02,280
that it was just moving somewhere so they definitely would want to because what else

2270
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:09,880
Joshua moon seemed confident that it was gonna come back actually wait I mean let me let me

2271
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:11,320
just check no

2272
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:19,480
yeah it doesn't seem to be working so I guess it's still down that's good no it's good it's

2273
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:25,000
good it's definitely good let there be no doubt that I think kiwi farms is bad and it's good that

2274
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:33,000
it's gone uh I just I'll just need to find something else to something else to do with

2275
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:37,480
you know whatever whatever amount of time I might have spent I might have spent reading it

2276
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:47,640
uh he's got to wean myself off that so that's fine um next one is where was I am

hey Ben congratulations on shaving your head this may be the first time but I hope that

2279
02:33:58,680 --> 02:34:03,400
it won't be the last time oh yeah may every week bring you bliss with every hair removed

2280
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:10,760
congratulations welcome to the bald club oh yeah I've met son of Marowak he's bald as well

2281
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:16,680
so you're in the bald club now you know it's been it's been like maybe three or four days since

2282
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:24,920
I reshaved my head and it's it's so it's it's actually it's actually quite a bit it actually

2283
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:32,680
requires maintenance to maintain the like smooth bald and instead of just having like yeah you got

2284
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:40,920
you really got to keep on it it grows back quite fast um all you got to do is uh add like tons of

2285
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:45,960
stress into your life to get all those hairs to fall out for good now now we're talking now we're

2286
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:57,880
concentrated stress pills um the um yeah self self the thing you want to avoid is self care

2287
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:02,920
actually yeah you want to avoid self care you want to get cancer that'll that'll speed oh yeah that's

2288
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:08,280
the I mean if you can get that then like yeah probably you can probably just take chemo without

2289
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:14,760
having cancer and just get the effects of the hair falling out anyway I think so I don't I don't

2290
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:21,000
see why not it would just be like very expensive and for no reason sure sure and like but you know

2291
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:26,360
whatever doctors doctors have to do it if you tell them you want it they have to give it to you

2292
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:34,040
they they took an oath so uh there you go easy it's problem solved next one is Son of Marowak

2293
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:40,440

2310
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:14,600
that when I said that uh it was um

2311
02:38:17,640 --> 02:38:24,520
I have yet to have one of these that is like oh I remember that voicemail these are all just like

2312
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:31,240
I don't remember when any of these came from no yeah there's there's just been so many

2313
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:39,080
next one is okay well there's a bunch of youtube links and then whoever posted them says glad I

2314
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:45,560
can finally send youtube links again I missed it hey man appreciate it thanks for that uh

2315
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:51,080
you're just making you're just making this list you faster to go through I guess is one way to look

2316
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:59,320
at it next one is called more mega man stuff three two one go hey Ben so we already know

2317
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:05,560
mega man legends is pretty base pretty base play command mission it's not like the most amazing

2318
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:12,280
rpg but it's mega man I've heard so yeah I've heard negative things about command mission

2319
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:18,600
although I I thought it looked interesting but uh I haven't played it I have heard that it's not great

2320
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:26,360
but I I would I would give it a chance except except it just seems like it's really long and I

2321
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:34,600
don't know if I'm really feeling starting up like a long rpg at this point in my life I don't know

2322
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:39,400
I don't know uh I've seen some of the cutscenes

2323
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:48,280
they look fine like cutscenes more like cutscenes also it's it's weirdly positioned in like the lore

2324
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:55,640
it's like it looks like it's part of x but it's actually a like alternate timeline of x

2325
02:39:56,200 --> 02:40:02,200
because as we all know x the x timeline eventually leads into the zero games but

2326
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:07,880
command mission supposedly takes place at the same time that the zero games would be taking

2327
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:17,000
place in 21 xx no in 22 xx rather uh but like just in a different continuity for some reason

2328
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:24,200
even though things don't seem that different it's weird that seems dumb but anyway I no I haven't

2329
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:31,240
played it although I'm a little curious about it honestly next one is hi ben how does Nate feel

2330
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:38,280
that you shaved your head well I mean honestly he's probably not aware of it so there you go

2331
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:44,680
next one is called good good good three two one go so I was recently talking about

2332
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:54,120
my friend oh come on there's too many too many in one week yeah and just from like talking

2333
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:59,880
this is something that I know that I felt in the past he really stressed this inherent value

2334
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:07,400
of having like a movie or a tv show based and all the thing you like and at being good and it seems

2335
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:15,240
to like almost undervalued the actual work of the original manga uh mark girl I just think that

2336
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:24,280
that's a really common one attitude and like normie culture kind of and I was just kind

2337
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:31,640
of curious if you guys have noticed this too and if they're actually any good

2338
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:40,520
limitations or something or superior adaptations that you've experienced because you know I really

2339
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:47,520
I really can't think of him.

2340
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:49,520
Yeah, it's...

2341
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:52,520
That one just wasn't very funny.

2342
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:56,520
Well, I think it's overexposure.

2343
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:59,520
Like you said, none of them have a point.

2344
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:01,520
They are just like weird sounds.

2345
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:05,520
But too much of weird sounds, it just sort of stops being surprising.

2346
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:08,520
I think the piano man was the best one.

2347
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:13,520
Yeah, the sentence mixing that, the comedy of the piano coming back,

2348
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:15,520
the do unrealistic...

2349
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:20,520
The piano man one made me chuckle, but that one did not.

2350
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:23,520
The next one is called Dean Dan Dodon,

2351
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:26,520
and I think it's probably going to be another one,

2352
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:28,520
3, 2, 1, go.

2353
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:29,520
Hello PC, PC, PC, PC, PC...

2354
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,520
Yeah, Muudan.

2355
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:35,520
Okay, yeah, the next one is called Joel's Goals,

2356
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:39,000
three, two, one, go.

2357
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,160
Hello, Pissapia, it's your boy Polin.

2358
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:43,680
No, okay, no, no, good try it.

2359
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:47,960
Next one is an Imgur album.

2360
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:52,520
It's called Funny Ben, Then Long Discretions.

2361
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:53,680
Don't hurt your throat reading

2362
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:56,460
if you can help it at ben.com.

2363
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:01,160
I'll just post the link here,

2364
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,380
even though you can see it and you don't need me to,

2365
02:43:03,380 --> 02:43:04,200
but I'll do it anyway.

2366
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:05,020
Nice.

2367
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:09,300
Okay.

2368
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,100
Good calling, Ben Stinky reminded me

2369
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:13,620
I found a green piece of paper.

2370
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:16,860
Ben Stinky, so stinky, he turned to the page green.

2371
02:43:17,780 --> 02:43:18,620
There you are.

2372
02:43:18,620 --> 02:43:22,100
There, I did, I'm like, I guess I did.

2373
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:24,060
Too weird to live, too rare to die,

2374
02:43:24,060 --> 02:43:26,580
Ben St. Athanlaka Khan.

2375
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:29,460
Panic at the Disco is too weird to live,

2376
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:31,580
too rare to die, album cover, except with Ben St.

2377
02:43:31,580 --> 02:43:33,220
I couldn't think of a more clever,

2378
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:35,320
a more cleaver rename for it.

2379
02:43:35,320 --> 02:43:37,640
I was blanking on endless war memes.

2380
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:41,320
And then there's me playing basketball.

2381
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:45,600
Ha ha ha, he will, he will never be ballin'.

2382
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:48,100
And then you see this.

2383
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:53,920
I like my chest hair, it's copious, that's true.

2384
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:58,840
This was at a request for Ben bowling.

2385
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:02,240
If you squint, you can see the water is sparkling water.

2386
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:05,140
Oh, I do see, a request from who?

2387
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:06,580
Where's this guy getting requests?

2388
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:07,660
Where is this guy getting requests?

2389
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:10,980
I mean, they're in my discord, they joined.

2390
02:44:10,980 --> 02:44:12,380
So maybe it's in there.

2391
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:15,420
He's in my discord too, actually, so maybe there.

2392
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:20,620

02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:26,540
I'm an idiot.

2396
02:44:26,540 --> 02:44:29,260
I'm already in the process of growing it back.

2397
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:31,520
And then-

2398
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:33,840
You grow your eyebrows out, curl them around

2399
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:35,960
to make a new beard.

2400
02:44:35,960 --> 02:44:36,800
Easy.

2401
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:41,000

Yeah, that's what I want, that's my weed goals.

2408
02:44:55,580 --> 02:44:58,980
I don't want my weed to be chaotically good aligned.

2409
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:03,420
Weed gummy worms, oh, it's me riding the bike around

02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:09,740

of the one week's episode,

2430
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:58,920
but I didn't.

2431
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:01,440
Frank Ocean is the guy Cheezy's stand is based on.

2432
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:03,320
It's a thing in JoJo that you stand to manifest

2433
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:04,800
with a gimmick or theme,

2434
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:07,680
but then hero Hiko Araki would sometimes throw a reference

2435
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:09,560
to whatever pulp culture Frank Ocean

2436
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:11,840
sings Cheezy's favorite song.

2437
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:12,680
Cat face.

2438
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:14,720
Cat face.

2439
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:18,400
A little more of the comic I'm doing.

2440
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:19,640
It's a bit of a read.

2441
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:22,160
Oh my God, it's so long.

2442
02:46:22,180 --> 02:46:24,420
I don't know if we can read the whole of this.

2443
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:25,420
I like the image though,

2444
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:28,380
that the fire, the wolf's breathing is very nice.

2445
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:29,540
Let's, you know what?

2446
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:32,940
Let's post, I'll post a screenshot.

2447
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:34,180
In addition to the image,

2448
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:37,740
I'll post a screenshot of the description

2449
02:46:37,740 --> 02:46:40,540
and you can pause it and read it if you're interested.

2450
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:47,420
TLDR guy becomes werewolf to fight pumpkin-headed zombies.

2451
02:46:48,300 --> 02:46:49,140
Okay.

2452
02:46:49,140 --> 02:46:51,220
I sure hope Pumpk isn't there.

2453
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:53,120
She'll be killed.

2454
02:46:53,120 --> 02:46:57,840
I like the teal and pink fire is kind of a neat looking.

2455
02:46:57,840 --> 02:46:58,680
Yeah.

2456
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:01,360
The blue teeth, the blue eyes.

2457
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:02,680
Blue eyes, white dragon.

2458
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:04,560
Think about it.

2459
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:08,800
Pumpkins that grow across the land.

2460
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:11,800
Use the bodies of the dead to walk upright

2461
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:13,200
and cross rivers up in mountains

2462
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,120
and plant their seeds everywhere.

2463
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:15,960
Neat.

2464
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:18,000
So it's like the last of us had pumpkins.

2465
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,200
So like a head crab.

2466
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:24,100
Like a pumpkin takes over a dead,

2467
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:25,780
an already dead person though, okay.

2468
02:47:25,780 --> 02:47:27,340
Oh, well that pumpkin isn't one of those.

2469
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:28,860
Pumpkins all pumpkin.

2470
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:33,460
Werewolf is, oh God, tearing this guy.

2471
02:47:34,660 --> 02:47:37,580
Taring his skeleton out of his body.

2472
02:47:37,580 --> 02:47:38,620
Ew.

2473
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:41,980
The werewolf thinks he thoroughly destroyed the pumpkin king.

2474
02:47:41,980 --> 02:47:45,540
He does, but a really dead boy.

2475
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:47,500
Maybe, maybe not.

2476
02:47:47,500 --> 02:47:48,680
Who knows?

2477
02:47:50,660 --> 02:47:52,460
We'll have to wait and find out.

2478
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:57,660
Very nice, very nice.

2479
02:47:57,660 --> 02:47:58,500
Looks good.

2480
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:02,180
I like the different colored ballpoint pens.

2481
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:06,820
It reminds me of, you ever see what the fucking,

2482
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:12,540
oh that stupid thing about the girl with the big boobs

2483
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:15,740
and Nate thought it was like, oh so bold of an anime

2484
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:19,020
to be about like girls with big boobs

2485
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:21,040
shouldn't be discriminated against.

2486
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:21,880
Galcochan?

2487
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:23,520
Yes, Galcochan.

2488
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:25,520
You ever see the manga that it's?

2489
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:27,200
I've seen a bit of the manga, yes.

2490
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:29,240
It's got that different colored ballpoint pen.

2491
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:31,200
Different colored line art.

2492
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:32,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2493
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:35,160
Next.

2494
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:37,480
Girl with the big boobs.

2495
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:38,960
I mean, it is true.

2496
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:40,600
I mean, it's true though.

2497
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:43,240
There's just so many things that I can refer to.

2498
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:46,480
Yeah, but Galcochan is like sort of specifically

2499
02:48:46,480 --> 02:48:47,720
about it though.

2500
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:49,500
Is it?

2501
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:51,340
I thought it was about like, well,

2502
02:48:51,340 --> 02:48:56,340
it's about femininity or like being like the real,

2503
02:48:56,580 --> 02:48:58,740
like what is really like being a girl.

2504
02:48:59,580 --> 02:49:00,420
Yeah, it is.

2505
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,260
All these things.

2506
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:03,380
It is that, it is that.

2507
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:08,500
But also, I mean, Galco being a big booby lady

2508
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:12,940
is kind of, it's like an important to her character.

2509
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:16,060
It is part of the character and the story, yes.

2510
02:49:16,060 --> 02:49:16,900
Yeah.

2511
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:21,200
Okay, the next one is another Imgirlink.

2512
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:22,200
And then.

2513
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:24,120
It's Ben Sainz's final form.

2514
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:25,440
It's just Walter White.

2515
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:27,680
It's just Walter White.

2516
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:31,560
Okay, well.

2517
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:34,000
I mean, you wear glasses.

2518
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:34,840
Oh, I'm.

2519
02:49:34,840 --> 02:49:36,160
I shave my head.

2520
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:38,080
I cook, I cook math, yeah.

2521
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:41,320
You were a teacher.

2522
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:42,840
You're literally.

2523
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:43,680
Oh, that's true.

2524
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:44,520
That is true.

2525
02:49:45,220 --> 02:49:46,500
Well, he taught chemistry.

2526
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:49,260
I taught physics, but I mean, close enough.

2527
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:51,980
What would be the physics equivalent of Breaking Bad?

2528
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:55,380
Like a physics teacher gets into drugs

2529
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:57,580
and uses physics to make a good drug.

2530
02:49:57,580 --> 02:49:58,620
Making illegal.

2531
02:49:59,620 --> 02:50:00,780
Not even a drug, actually.

2532
02:50:00,780 --> 02:50:02,940
Just a crime that involves physics.

2533
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:07,940
Black holes, manufacturing illegal neutrinos.

2534
02:50:10,300 --> 02:50:12,420
Manufacturing illegal electricity.

2535
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:17,360
With a copper wire and a magnet.

2536
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:18,360
Gee, I don't know.

2537
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:24,640
I mean, okay, I guess that's the last one.

2538
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:25,600
We're done.

2539
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:28,080
We're fucking done here.

2540
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:28,920
Okay.

2541
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:33,240
Oh, actually there's a, did you listen to the,

2542
02:50:34,160 --> 02:50:36,440
Vinny's Imgirlink album actually has

2543
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:38,640
a little one second voicemail attached.

2544
02:50:39,720 --> 02:50:41,240
It's just a noise.

2545
02:50:41,260 --> 02:50:43,300
It's going, or something.

2546
02:50:43,300 --> 02:50:44,420
I think it's deliberate.

2547
02:50:44,420 --> 02:50:48,380
So I'm gonna call that a real voicemail, actually.

2548
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:53,660
Well, that's the end of the voicemails.

2549
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:57,580
And we're almost at the three hours.

2550
02:50:57,580 --> 02:51:01,580
Wow, three hours just fly by every single week.

2551
02:51:01,580 --> 02:51:06,500
You know, I got messaged by an old head PCP fan

2552
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:08,380
who had not listened.

2553
02:51:08,380 --> 02:51:10,140
I mean, this guy claimed,

2554
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:11,640
I had my suspicions about this guy,

2555
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:14,120
but he claimed to be an old head PCP fan

2556
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:17,160
who had not listened to the show in years.

2557
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:21,480
And he messaged me on Twitter.

2558
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:23,360
He just wanted to like ask me a bunch of questions

2559
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:24,400
about stuff.

2560
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:27,040
And it was really fun.

2561
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:31,080
He was using, he was casually using the N word

2562
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:32,480
despite not being black.

2563
02:51:32,480 --> 02:51:34,560
And I was like, okay, man, that's a little gauche,

2564
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:35,400
but all right.

2565
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:38,380
And he wanted to know,

2566
02:51:39,340 --> 02:51:42,900
he did not seem to know about people's genders,

2567
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:45,020
which is like, okay, all right, all right.

2568
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:46,740
But like the guy had not listened,

2569
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:49,380
so like I couldn't blame him, I guess.

2570
02:51:49,380 --> 02:51:52,820
And then he was just asking me about like

2571
02:51:52,820 --> 02:51:55,340
stuff about mumkey drama and stuff about like,

2572
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:57,100
what do you think of Jeff Thu?

2573
02:51:57,100 --> 02:52:02,100
I was like, wow, what a revelation.

2574
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:05,600
This guy's like an open to time capsule,

2575
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:07,240
and this guy stepped out.

2576
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:10,200
Well, I mean, what was he at?

2577
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:11,520
What did he want to know?

2578
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:13,440
It sounds like it's just like all of the things

2579
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:16,840
that would show that he's a person from before.

2580
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:19,360
But like, is it sincere?

2581
02:52:19,360 --> 02:52:22,040
Well, I'm mentioning those because they were example.

2582
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:25,280
But I mean, he was just asking me like,

2583
02:52:25,280 --> 02:52:26,720
how are you doing?

2584
02:52:26,720 --> 02:52:28,920
Like how's munchy doing?

2585
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:29,960
Like how's so-and-so?

2586
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:32,260
He was asking me like, how everybody's doing?

2587
02:52:32,260 --> 02:52:34,420
Or like, what's going on with these people?

2588
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:35,860
Do you ever talk to Mage anymore?

2589
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:36,700
What's Mage doing?

2590
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:37,700
Da, da, da, da.

2591
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:42,980
It was interesting, it was weird, it was kind of neat.

2592
02:52:42,980 --> 02:52:47,380
It was all right, just odd, just funny.

2593
02:52:49,420 --> 02:52:50,260
Why did I?

2594
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:55,260
Yeah, oh, he said, he did say to say hi to you.

2595
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:58,900
He did say to say hello to you and also to munchy.

2596
02:52:58,900 --> 02:53:01,400
So I'll tell you now and I'll tell munchy later

2597
02:53:02,320 --> 02:53:03,360
that this guy said hi.

2598
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:04,200
Where the hell?

2599
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:05,040
Yes.

2600
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:08,640
He said, DeVoo is better than me.

2601
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:09,840
At what?

2602
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:11,200
In general.

2603
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:12,400
DeVoo's a general.

2604
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:15,840
And I thought, this guy must be a fake.

2605
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:17,080
This must be a catfish.

2606
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:18,320
I thought this must be a DeVoo.

2607
02:53:18,320 --> 02:53:22,120
This must be DeVoo on an alt account doing an op.

2608
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:24,640
Catfishing me because nobody is a DeVoo fan.

2609
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:26,680
That's no way.

2610
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:34,040
Okay, well, anyway, I just thought I wanted to mention that.

2611
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:36,680
It was a funny thing that happened just yesterday, actually.

2612
02:53:40,480 --> 02:53:45,480
Anyway, if you're a new head PCP fan,

2613
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:48,240
patreon.com slash the procrastinators

2614
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:50,360
for a million bonus episodes

2615
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:52,880
while you wait for your treasury bonds to mature.

2616
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,000
And that's the straight dope.

2617
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:58,840
That's yes.

2618
02:53:58,840 --> 02:54:00,380
And that's what's happening.

2619
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:03,100
That's the song of the south.

2620
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:04,500
The way the news goes.

2621
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:05,980
The way the news goes.

2622
02:54:07,740 --> 02:54:10,140
You got anything else to say before we wrap it?

2623
02:54:14,780 --> 02:54:15,940
Nope.

2624
02:54:15,940 --> 02:54:16,780
Me either.

2625
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:18,740
All right.

2626
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:21,180
Bye.

2627
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:24,500
Goodbye, that's the end of the show.

2628
02:54:24,500 --> 02:54:25,340
It is.
