1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I see they've added some fancy new options for Craig. How delightful. Their fucking bot doesn't work, but they decided to make it all fancy.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ooh, they changed it to slash commands. Ooh, it opens up a menu in your Discord now.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's just like Endless War. Bot doesn't work, but we'll add new features. That's not true. Endless War works perfectly all the time.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I might as well start. No intro required.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Looks like we're having a Ben cast today. Gibb is nowhere to be found. That's okay. I'm sure she's just experiencing 10 day plus jet lag.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Eight days, whatever. That's okay, though. I kind of wanted to keep this episode short anyway, because it is Father's Day, and I do have to catch a train to my parents' house in, well, three hours from now, so I have to allow for travel time to the train and such.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, that's alright. Ben casts tend to be on the shorter side anyway, and that's good.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me see here. Speaking of Father's Day, I know I want to talk about something that's very near and dear to my heart.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think I mentioned last episode, and I've been mentioning a little more often lately, my gummy experiments. They have borne fruit, so to speak. I think I have perfected a recipe.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I put a picture on Discord. You know what? I'm going to post it at Eleazar. Show this on screen.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yesterday, I didn't know what I was going to get my dad, so I decided, hey, I figured this shit out, so I made a big batch of these. This is like a pound of the stuff right here in this image.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And these are special. These are my low sugar formula. They are about volume, by mass. They are about one-third the sugar of a regular gummy bear. They are mostly made of corn fiber, and they're pretty good.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The texture is good, the consistency is good. The one thing that I think is not perfect about them is that they weep a little bit, like they exude a little bit of moisture. Not a lot.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And I covered them in sugar. I rolled them in sugar to avoid them sticking together, and it works. They don't stick together, but they're a little bit moist.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They should theoretically be shelf-stable forever, or indefinitely, because I added potassium sorbate, which is supposed to inhibit mold.

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, yeah, the weeping is not great. I think this just means that these will be... These are for me. I will make these for myself, and maybe my loved ones, so I made a big batch of them for my dad as a father's day gift.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll give those to him later. I'm pretty excited. I'm pretty proud. Pretty excited that the recipe has come together.

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think I would call this done. The only thing I might fuck around with it is seeing if I could get away with even less water. Even less water base at the beginning to get an even denser, chewier final product.

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But these are pretty good. They're not as dense and chewy as a starburst, but they are as chewy as a gummy, I think.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you're wondering in this image, here, I'll tell you, the flavors are fucked up. The pink ones are rose-flavored. The orange ones, which do not look quite so orange in real life, in real life, they're a little hard to tell from the pink ones, TBH.

22
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The orange-ish ones are watermelon. The blue ones are passion fruit. The purple ones are strawberry. And the green ones are guava. I think passion fruit and watermelon came out the best, but they're all pretty good.

23
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Alright, I just had to brag about that. I think I'm gonna have two recipes. This is gonna be my low-sugar recipe, and it's just for me, because it weeps a little bit.

24
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I think if I had one that I wanted to give to people, or sell, or something, I think I would use a separate recipe, which I have a separate... I should take a picture of my notebook.

25
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know what, hang on, Eliezer, cut the silence out. I'm gonna go take a picture of my notebook and post it. Cut the silence out while I get that.

26
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so there's my notes. Basically, I started with one recipe, and then I made modifications, and then I sort of branched them out on evolutionary paths, and this is one of them.

27
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So I have a separate evolutionary track for more stable ones, where I'm not so worried about keeping the sugar low.

28
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was fucking around with corn fiber, I was fucking around with pectin. I think I've decided... I tried it with just the most basic sugar and gelatin, and it worked fine.

29
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It worked great. I think I'm just gonna do that for the regular ones that I would sell to people. Those ones will not weep, those ones will not have any... It's the fiber.

30
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think the fiber makes them not retain the water completely. I think it interrupts the gel matrix that the gelatin forms, that holds the water in, because the fiber is, you know, whatever.

31
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's whatever, shape of the molecules and whatever. Anyway, anyway, that's what I've been doing with that. I've been doing a lot of that.

32
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's been like my main hobby. Aside from fucking around with PCP upload shit, there's been a lot of that, a lot of gummy work, and then a lot of...

33
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, I have not dedicated the time, aside from those things, I've not dedicated the time to finishing the slime and punishment footnotes, which is very stupid.

34
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That really should be my priority number one. Oh, and then there's that video project that I've been working on, which I will still not reveal what it is, and which me and Gib talked about that last week.

35
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I'm not sure if I'm going to try and film that before I find a new place. I probably should, because I think I could, and it's probably not necessary to move before I do it.

36
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I ordered another piece of equipment for that yesterday. I already have the tripod I ordered. Let me check my Amazon. What was the thing that I bought yesterday?

37
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And now I'm waiting for the Amazon returns and orders.

38
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, it was another stand for something else.

39
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, I'm not going to go into it. Sorry. I think one or two people might have made some guesses that have been pretty close to the mark, so some people might...

40
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've dropped a few hints here and there that some people might have figured out, but if you have, that's fine. Don't try and guess it. It doesn't matter.

41
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Either way, it's fine.

42
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, so that's what I've been doing.

43
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Father's Day, hold on. Let me open up my topic list here.

44
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What else did I want to touch on?

45
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh yeah, okay.

46
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Adjacent to that video thing that I've been ordering equipment for. One thing I ordered was a new microphone.

47
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And, oh no, now I forget. Oh no, now I forget if I talked about this thing that I want to say on the last PCP.

48
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh my god, I hope I didn't talk about this already. If I did, I'm going to sound like such an idiot.

49
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I definitely talked about it on the stream, on the Shekels for Hekels stream that we did on Wednesday or Thursday, which I will also mention in a second.

50
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, so I don't think I did talk about it on an episode, so I'll mention it again.

51
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I got this microphone, this new XLR microphone, an AT2020, which let me know if I sound any better.

52
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:23,000
On the stream, Gib said that I sounded, she said that she could detect more of the high notes or the high register in my voice, which I don't know if that's good or not.

53
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But anyway, I should sound better because I switched from a pretty mediocre USB snowball ice to a real XLR microphone.

54
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Anyway, partially this was for the video project, and the other reason I got it was because I saw, I'll tell it as though I hadn't said it before,

55
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I saw a casting call for voice actors for something that was looking...

56
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
One of the requirements listed was you need to have an XLR microphone, and I was like, you know, I really should have an XLR microphone.

57
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why am I using this shitty snowball ice?

58
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So I was like, fuck it.

59
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I googled, lots of YouTube recommendations for affordable, good microphones, and if you recommended this one, I was like, yeah, fuck it.

60
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I found a cheap one.

61
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This one was $70 used on eBay.

62
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Came with a holder that attaches to an arm.

63
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I got a microphone arm, a fancy robot arm that it moves around on.

64
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's very cool.

65
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So I have a little bit more of a real mic set up now.

66
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Even though my room is fucking completely fucked and my desk is in the wrong place because I had to move my desk near my door because my power has been going out once a week for the last month.

67
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I had to move my desk near my kitchen door so I could run a power strip from the refrigerator outlet.

68
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Power my computer in case of power loss because the refrigerator doesn't lose power.

69
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The kitchen doesn't lose power.

70
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Just my room, for some reason.

71
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So everything is arranged in a completely fucked way that will probably have to change several times.

72
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And definitely when I move, which I don't even want to think about that right now.

73
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Anyway, the thing I read this casting call for and did an audition for, a voice audition for, was just very stupid.

74
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's an animation that Daft Pina was putting together.

75
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He was making like a 13 minute pilot, I guess it's a pilot episode for a series and sounds fucking dumb.

76
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Looks fucking dumb.

77
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Looks, doesn't look good or anything.

78
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I mean, it's some stupid sitcom about, oh god, there's like a, there's like an optimist and a pessimist and their friends.

79
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's great.

80
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Classic setup and they like work at a convenience store or something and there's a wacky sidekick.

81
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There's a wacky guy that works there with them and there's some more stuff, but it doesn't matter.

82
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It seems dumb, but it's the kind of thing that I think I would enjoy maybe working on or doing occasionally.

83
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So, you know, on that note, I don't even know how I found this.

84
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Maybe someone posted it in my Discord.

85
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Maybe I just scrolled past.

86
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't, I literally, I don't even remember how I saw the notice that like they needed a voice actor for this, this dumb thing.

87
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But if anyone knows of any other things that I could like record a little voice sample for and send it off to someone and see if they want to hire me.

88
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's something that I would like to do more of and I don't have any like clear idea of how to find gigs like that.

89
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I think it would be fun.

90
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think it'd be fun to have, I think it'd be fun to voice act stuff.

91
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think I could do an okay job of it.

92
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

93
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not like trained or anything, but like whatever.

94
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's just talking, right?

95
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No problem.

96
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Nothing to it.

97
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, so that's, that's that.

98
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's the deal with the microphone on the subject of the stream I mentioned a second ago had problems streaming shekels for heckles.

99
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay, this is very frustrating.

100
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So we were going to stream because we had not done in a while because it gives trip and I think we just hadn't done it in a while before.

101
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it had been probably like a month and a half or maybe longer since our last stream.

102
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And we were like, okay, Gabe, when you get back from your trip, we should definitely do that.

103
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I tried to join the Minecraft server and I was getting an error that I have gotten it before and nobody and nobody else ever gets it and nobody knows why I get it.

104
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It was like, oh, fuck, I forget exactly what the it was a text.

105
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It would boot me every time I joined the server, I would join for like a second and then it would boot me out to like the like this, the like join server screen and the message was like something exclusion conflict between host and server or something like that.

106
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I could join.

107
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It seemed sometimes like it was a problem like I would load into a place where it was like too busy.

108
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So sometimes I was able to like join in like like warp to my slime cave, join and then the slime gives you but then sometimes I could run out into like the will or wilderness or jump up onto like a mountain.

109
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And then it would work and I would be able to stay in and then once I was in, it would be fine.

110
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But if anything, but if I warped anywhere warping would kick me and then once I was out joining again, I have the same problem.

111
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And I tried to join like 100 times and I got it to work maybe like twice the whole stream and then I foolishly warped and that kicked me and then I was like I tried another 50 times and I was like it's not working.

112
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So had to had to had to cut the losses had to cut the losses on that one and decided to just play Mega Man instead of Minecraft, which was fine.

113
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But I did, you know, there's stuff to do in the Minecraft because like remarkably like like like Marin and others like Demodunk that work on that have done some work in the Minecraft server and they have put stuff in there.

114
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There's like there's content to be consumed in the Minecraft server, if you can even believe that.

115
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
patreon.com slash the procrastinators join the Minecraft server.

116
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Once I get to work.

117
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Also, if you could just play it yourself, you can just ask Marin like hey, where do I go to fight some of these gyms that I have battled on the stream.

118
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There's themed gyms and stuff.

119
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay, anyway, I couldn't get this fucking thing to work.

120
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So I tried switching, so I tried switching my network for my regular network to my Wi-Fi hotspot for my phone.

121
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And this was kind of stupid, but I was like just to see if maybe there's something about my network that's wrong.

122
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I tried switching to my Wi-Fi hotspot and that obviously didn't work.

123
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And it introduced a bunch of new problems because I tried to switch back, but it like automatically kept me on my Wi-Fi.

124
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why do I have so much trouble saying it?

125
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
My Wi-Fi hotspot network.

126
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then once I was streaming through my Wi-Fi hotspot network, obviously that was bad, obviously that didn't work.

127
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The stream like crashed several times and I didn't realize it was because I was on this other hotspot.

128
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So then I thought that my main network was having all these problems.

129
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
In fact, it was only having the one problem.

130
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So I tried streaming for the first time in more than two years.

131
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I streamed on my Twitch channel.

132
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think it's at twitch.tv slash bensaint.

133
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I think it's just bensaint is my ad on there.

134
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I was dismayed because all of a sudden it was streaming. It was so bad.

135
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It was so bad the stream was unwatchably laggy.

136
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The stream was dropping frames, blah, blah, blah.

137
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I realized after a bit that, oh no, it's because it's still on my fucking mobile hotspot.

138
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So that's why it's that bad.

139
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So I switched back to my regular network and my stream quality is still not amazing.

140
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But it does work. It is watchable at least.

141
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And I remembered that when I moved into this house, I don't have a landline.

142
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I only have Wi-Fi in here, which is bad. That's not good.

143
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But when I moved in here, I was having significant internet problems.

144
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I could use the internet, but every couple days I would have a long period where it would not be usable.

145
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I was like, that's a problem.

146
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So me and another guy that lived here decided to split the cost of a Wi-Fi extender.

147
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And he installed that and it worked.

148
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I was, you know, the major problems were solved by that.

149
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And he moved out like a couple months ago.

150
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I guess he took the Wi-Fi extender with him, but I didn't have any more problems regardless.

151
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like the Wi-Fi has been adequate.

152
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have not had that problem, even though that extender is gone.

153
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So it should be back to how it was before, but it's not.

154
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I have not had those long periods of can't access the internet or like signal to week or whatever.

155
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So I don't know what's going on with that.

156
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I was thinking about buying another Wi-Fi extender.

157
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know if it would really matter.

158
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm not sure if that would really solve the server issue.

159
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like, I don't know.

160
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't see why it would.

161
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Because the signal is okay.

162
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Even though it's not the best and Wi-Fi is not great.

163
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I wish it wasn't restricted to using Wi-Fi, but in this house I am.

164
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I need to get a new house so I can have a better connection for that reason and others.

165
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But I could buy the extender.

166
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's not that expensive.

167
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Wait, no, I think I did.

168
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I bought the cheapest extender Amazon offers for like 25 bucks.

169
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So I don't know.

170
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There might not even be a purpose to it since my internet is already good enough to stream successfully.

171
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
A Wi-Fi extender.

172
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll still be streaming on Wi-Fi.

173
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like my connection still won't be good.

174
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So I'll probably just waste the 20 bucks there.

175
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oops.

176
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But I'm trying to make the best out of my situation for the moment.

177
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, that's my internet situation.

178
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If anyone has any suggestions about that server issue, I guess maybe message MarinPan.

179
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know.

180
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Nobody in the stream had any suggestions that fixed it.

181
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
People said, oh, reset your router, which I tried doing.

182
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Although I wonder if resetting the router...

183
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Okay, now I'm wondering if when I reset the router, I'm almost positive that yes, I did reset the router and then switch back from the hotspot to the other thing.

184
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Now I'm wondering if was I still on my Wi-Fi hotspot when I was trying to rejoin after resetting the router?

185
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't think so, but maybe.

186
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm not sure.

187
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't know.

188
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I could try joining it just on my own time and see if it works.

189
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Only I'm pretty sure that the exclusion tends to happen when I'm also streaming.

190
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, I was getting it when I was testing the connection before I started the stream too.

191
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So it wasn't just because I was also streaming.

192
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It wasn't just that.

193
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know.

194
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A lot of variables.

195
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Maybe I should just try to join again and see if maybe resetting the router did solve it.

196
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And I just haven't noticed yet because I wasn't using the right network.

197
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So frustrating.

198
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Very infuriating.

199
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I hate computers.

200
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, hello.

201
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
CeCe, you have an announcement, right?

202
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

203
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Volume two of Tails gets trolled.

204
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Physical is out.

205
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Base, base, base.

206
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I saw you notified me on Discord and I thought, hey, that's noteworthy.

207
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's notable.

208
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah.

209
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's a coincidence that it came out like right before PCP records.

210
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, yeah.

211
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I guess so.

212
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Lamar.

213
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

214
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Tell us about Book Two.

215
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Book Two contains chapters seven through 14.

216
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So the last one ended at right before Mario and Troll King were about to battle.

217
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then chapter two goes through the, or excuse me, volume two goes through the famous

218
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Neutrals flashback where you find out how the Neutrals got their powers.

219
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Okay.

220
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Wait, you said it's seven through 14?

221
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

222
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah.

223
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Flashback, the Tom face.

224
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah.

225
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Chapter 14 is, what happens in chapter 14?

226
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's when they start to like invade the Troll Fortress because they have to rescue Elmer Fudd.

227
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes.

228
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's, okay, I'm seeing, oh, it's, this is Coyote versus Demaro.

229
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm seeing the red, the red sky, right?

230
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, and Rob versus Hindo.

231
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes.

232
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes, yes.

233
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Wait, does this part have like Tails gets gay in it or?

234
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No.

235
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Tails gets anime or?

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The, the next volume might have that, but if you do it like chronologically, it, he didn't

237
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
make Tails gets gay until like chapter 15.

238
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, well.

239
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Okay, sorry.

240
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So I saw the part where Rob like dies, but it's like just a trick and I thought there

241
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
might be like a.

242
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's also in chapter 15, I think, or chapter 16.

243
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No, no, I'm looking at chapter 14, chapter 14, page 18.

244
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Hindo says time to die and the electrocutes Rob and Rob explodes.

245
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Says I knew he was weak.

246
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I almost thought for a second he was going to give me a challenge.

247
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What a shame.

248
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And then there's like a long monologue on the next page and then he pisses on Rob and then

249
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the black sound is, I just had the worst daydream ever.

250
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I need to, okay, okay.

251
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, it was just a daydream.

252
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh, I guess I fucked up then because it's chapters seven through 13.

253
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Like it ends at the beginning of chapter 14.

254
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So yeah, I fucked that up.

255
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I guess you fucked that up.

256
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, I need to change, change the description.

257
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I mean, yeah, it's not that big a deal, but okay, fair enough.

258
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Right.

259
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
At the end of chapter 13, I'm seeing Gary versus Damara.

260
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Wait, no.

261
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Rob versus Hindo.

262
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No, that's the end of chapter 12.

263
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah.

264
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, okay.

265
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm just clicking around.

266
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
My page was in chapter 24, right?

267
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
25.

268
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
25, okay.

269
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I actually made a part from your page to the thumbnail on the website.

270
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, the chapter?

271
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah.

272
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, wait, that's based.

273
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah.

274
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, yeah, it is.

275
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's so cool.

276
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

277
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Here, here I'll post a screenshot.

278
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, this is what the website looks like right now.

279
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Hey, that's awesome.

280
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

281
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Sick.

282
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Cool.

283
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

284
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Oh, you go ahead.

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
No.

286
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You.

287
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Okay.

288
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay.

289
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I was going to, I was going to say in a, Tails gets told news, a big event that happened.

290
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Is that a Ember Graham left?

291
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I, I know about that.

292
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,500
I think, I think, I don't know if you were on to talk about it, but I was, I was like

293
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,000
in the chat when that happened or not in the chat, but I saw that on the, in the Discord

294
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
server.

295
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

296
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah.

297
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So he's still gone.

298
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah.

299
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Bummer.

300
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't think he's coming back.

301
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Uh, lame.

302
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, but at least laser bot and his other brother are there in charge of all the shit

303
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
going on now.

304
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

305
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I mean, the show must go on.

306
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I guess.

307
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah.

308
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,160
I mean, I mean, I know, I know Ember Graham was pretty, pretty instrumental in a lot of

309
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:51,000
it beforehand, but I don't know if he doesn't want to work on it and what can you do?

310
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Um, well, I, anyone who picked up chapter one should definitely pick up chapter two

311
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
of the book.

312
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Anyone who has not, did not pick up chapter one should probably do that so that they can

313
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
start working on their, on their book collection.

314
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah.

315
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
How many, how many pages is a, is one chapter or one volume rather?

316
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Chapter one was like 140 pages and this one is 160.

317
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Okay.

318
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So it's pretty like.

319
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Good thing.

320
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think, um, Gib, Gib just gave me a copy of Lord of Ghosts and that's like a hundred

321
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and something, maybe 120.

322
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So it's a little longer than that.

323
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That's pretty, that's pretty sizable.

324
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Like it's, it's a pretty like, like for a, like for a comic, it's a pretty, it's like,

325
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
it's like a thin softcover book.

326
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah.

327
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

328
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's not like a, like a staple bound volume.

329
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's a sizable book.

330
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah.

331
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
When I made volume one, uh, you couldn't make hardback, uh, books, but now you can.

332
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,500
So maybe if, if Tails gets trolled, if Tails gets trolled, gets, uh, like a million dollars

333
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,000
and like gets a show on an adult swim or something, you can make a hard, hardcover book with all

334
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
50 chapters or however many chapters it'll be.

335
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh yeah.

336
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,500
Like, um, like, like, what, what, what would you call it?

337
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Like the, the, like the-

338
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
The omnibus.

339
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,500
The ultimate, ultimate, oh yeah, omnibus.

340
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Yeah.

341
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
The compendium or whatever.

342
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Yeah.

343
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Hard, hardcover guy.

344
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
That's good.

345
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
That's good.

346
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
But I, but I imagine that would be pretty expensive.

347
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Uh, yeah.

348
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
I mean-

349
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Cause even, even the, even these volumes take like, uh, I don't remember the exact price,

350
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,500
but I think they're like around like 12 to 15 dollars to produce.

351
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,500
You're using, uh, are you using like a print, you're using like a print on demand, like,

352
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,500
like Lulu or Amazon books, right?

353
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Yeah.

354
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Yeah.

355
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Yeah.

356
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Well, what, what a hypocrite.

357
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,500
He criticizes Jeff Bezos, but uses his, uh, uses his service.

358
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,500
You live in a, you, you criticize Bezos and yet you participate in him.

359
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Um.

360
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Yeah.

361
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,500
The, well you, do you mind if I ask like how many copies volume once sold?

362
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Um, a lot.

363
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I mean, I can check right now.

364
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
I don't know the exact number from the top of my head.

365
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
You, but-

366
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
You want to give him like a ballpark, like, set, like several hundred?

367
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah.

368
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
At least, at least several, several hundred.

369
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Fuck.

370
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
So several hundred.

371
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Well, hmm, I mean, hmm.

372
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,500
I can check right, I, I can check right now.

373
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,500
If you expect, if you expect to move that many copies, uh, I don't know.

374
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
I guess that like, you're selling one on Amazon.

375
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:57,500
You probably want to sell them all through the same vendor, but did you, did you consider

376
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,500
the possibility of maybe like, instead of selling them print on demand one, one at a time, you

377
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:10,500
could like pre-print like a batch of them through like something like Mixam or, uh,

378
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
uh, or Kablam or something like that.

379
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Cause it was usually cheaper to print like a bulk batch ahead of time, you know, per

380
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
copy.

381
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Maybe, maybe they already do that.

382
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
I don't know.

383
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm, no, I'm telling, I'm telling you, I'm saying to you.

384
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,500
I mean, the downside would be if you did that, that you would have to like have boxes of

385
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
books that you would have to like hang on.

386
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Oh yeah.

387
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,500
And you would, and you would also have to like ship them yourself, which actually is quite

388
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
a hassle.

389
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
And I understand if you wouldn't want to do that.

390
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Yeah.

391
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Even if it costs more, the convenience of it is worth the money.

392
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
You know what?

393
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
In my opinion.

394
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
That's, that's totally fair.

395
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:01,500
And also, uh, and also a volume two as, or volume one has sold 798 copies.

396
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
700, almost 800.

397
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Wow.

398
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
That's pretty good.

399
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Yeah.

400
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
That's, that's, damn.

401
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Uh, count, countdown to a thousand, I guess.

402
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Yeah.

403
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,500
You guys should throw a party or something when you get that.

404
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
That's a lot.

405
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
That's more than I, that's more than I expected.

406
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Uh, congratulations on that.

407
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Yeah.

408
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,500
And of course, the large majority, well, not the majority, the plurality of them was sold

409
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
in the first month.

410
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Oh, sure.

411
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Yeah.

412
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Yeah.

413
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Uh, and I was, I was really surprised because it sold like way more than they thought it

414
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
would.

415
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Yeah.

416
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Well, um, I don't know, maybe, maybe the existence of book two will get some people to

417
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:59,500
wake some people up from there, from their torpor, wake up the sheeple and let them know

418
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,500
this is real, this is collectible and I got to get in on the ground floor because this

419
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
shit is going to the moon, baby.

420
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Yeah.

421
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,500
They need to be like more woke because, you know, that's a big issue these days.

422
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
I would, I would agree.

423
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I'm so tired of the woke CRT grooming.

424
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I, I don't know.

425
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I'm kind of a fan.

426
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,500
I'm kind of a fan of grooming in schools.

427
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm kind of a fan of, I'm kind of a fan of, uh, trans, trans, what's, no, what was the

428
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
phrase?

429
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Not drag queens, but, uh, trans, not transgender.

430
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
What's the other word?

431
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Uh, transvestite strippers, transvestite strippers in schools.

432
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Yeah.

433
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Much better.

434
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Yeah.

435
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Um, and tell us what's trolled is.

436
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Is it part of that?

437
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Yeah.

438
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Tell us what's trolled is part of the radical left brainwashing initiative.

439
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Yeah, they should, it should be required reading in all schools.

440
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Put, put ask your school librarian to put tales gets trolled in the school library.

441
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Start grooming your fellow students.

442
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Yeah.

443
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Uh, you know, some, some conservatives would unironically think the thing, the joke about

444
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
they're deader than a black guy in a town of racist red necks.

445
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
They'll be like, Oh, that's CRT.

446
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
You can't do that to kids.

447
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Oh, that's true.

448
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
That's true.

449
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Well, very, very good.

450
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I also, uh, just this is just like one thing I wanted to say, like real quick.

451
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I don't want to get too, too political, but it's funny how there's like the meme of, you

452
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,500
know, I support the current thing and like the meme of, uh, the big red hand.

453
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Yeah.

454
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Put the chip meme.

455
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Exactly.

456
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Put the chip, put in the chip.

457
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
And PC, but they're, they're the exact same way.

458
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
First it was like CRT.

459
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Oh, sure.

460
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Now it's grooming.

461
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,500
You know, I was, it, I mean, it is, yeah, there's some stupid thing.

462
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Uh, the, the, do you remember Muslim grooming gangs?

463
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Oh yeah.

464
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,500
That was a big meme in like 2015 in the, in the, yeah, like around Gamergate time.

465
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,500
It was, it was, I remember, like just the word grooming, like triggered a neuron activation.

466
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:18,500
And I remember like, wait a minute, they used to say grooming about people like Sargon of

467
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,500
God used to claim that there were like quote unquote Muslim grooming gangs.

468
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Like there were gangs of guys going around, I don't know, like befriending young girls

469
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,500
and preparing them for sex when they reached legal age or something.

470
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Yeah.

471
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, they, they, they, they lost that battle.

472
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,500
So now it's, now it's the gays who are the groomers.

473
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Yeah.

474
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
But someone's grooming, someone's always grooming.

475
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Yeah.

476
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm looking for it to gay marriage being illegal because that's the Supreme Court is going to,

477
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,500
it's just going to take away all our rights.

478
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Finally, the sanctity of marriage will be restored.

479
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Yeah.

480
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,500
I wonder, I wonder if they'll like annul all the gay marriages that already happened.

481
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Oh, like they're going to annul them retroactively?

482
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Yeah.

483
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
That'll be, that'll be fucked.

484
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Yeah.

485
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I mean, but I guess it's already fucked.

486
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Yeah.

487
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
They're already repealing Roe versus Wade, it's already fucked.

488
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Yeah, that's, that's what I was referencing.

489
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Like the exact same argument they used to repeal, that could be used to repeal like any rights

490
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,500
that they gave people, including interracial marriage.

491
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Well, the Constitution doesn't say anything about interracial marriage.

492
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,500
So, you know, it shouldn't be legal.

493
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Hey, next, next one, that's next up.

494
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Yeah.

495
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
It's next up.

496
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,500
I truly do not understand what is going on with America right now.

497
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Yeah.

498
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Well, it's just, we're all fucked, get used to it.

499
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
That's what I say.

500
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
I mean, it's probably true.

501
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
It's probably true.

502
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Hey, I'm, as a white cis male, I'm very concerned with, I'm very concerned with all these,

503
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
all these, all these things that are happening.

504
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
What if I'm next?

505
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,500
That's perpetually asking, well, this doesn't affect me, but what if I'm next though?

506
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,500
First they came for the Jews and I didn't say anything, then they came for the white conservative males

507
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
and I didn't say anything.

508
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:32,500
First they came for the Jews, then they came for the trans, then they came for the white cis males

509
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
and no one, what's the last line?

510
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
No one was left to help me or something?

511
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Yeah, and I didn't speak up and no one was left up to speak up for me or whatever.

512
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
I don't know the exact thing, but it's something like that.

513
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Yeah, anyway, anyway, they'll get me.

514
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Yeah.

515
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
One day they'll get me.

516
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Yeah.

517
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
They'll find someone.

518
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Probably.

519
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:01,500
So, Tales, so the Tales book, I want to see, I want to look at the two covers side by side.

520
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Tales, is there like an announcement on the website?

521
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Yes.

522
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
It's on the front page.

523
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Oh, I see, I see.

524
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
First volume is Tales, Sonic, Shadow Knuckles.

525
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Second volume is Silver, Silver, Demaro, Gary, Rob.

526
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Yeah.

527
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

528
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Looking good.

529
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Oh, Laserbot, like, he designed the cover sort of.

530
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Like, yeah.

531
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Oh, there's Tom, Tom in the top right.

532
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:45,500
That was actually my idea since it was, you know, the famous thing that nobody even knows

533
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,500
is from Tales gets told every time I say that people are like, oh, I thought that was from

534
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
a real Tom and Jerry cartoon.

535
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I don't know how you would think that was from a real Tom.

536
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Like, you would have had to never see a real Tom and Jerry cartoon to think that.

537
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Yeah.

538
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Well, I mean, they probably haven't.

539
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Zoomers, yeah.

540
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Maybe if you've never seen a Tom and Jerry cartoon and you think that it's like SpongeBob

541
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,500
and it has like bizarre, sudden, like, disgusting close-ups.

542
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Yeah.

543
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Like, maybe you think that.

544
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Yeah, that makes sense.

545
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Yeah.

546
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Anyway.

547
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Laserbot designed the cover.

548
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,500
I was going to say the JPG quality would tip them off too, but Zoomers like to send

549
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,500
JPG, like, shitty quality memes to each other.

550
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
That's true.

551
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
That's true.

552
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Okay, I want to ask, like, if, well, I say, I'm not, not to say if, like, I'm sure there

553
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
will be a volume three, but on volume three, who do you think the four on the front would

554
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
be?

555
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Laserbot, like, already designed, well, the way he quote unquote designed the covers is

556
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,500
basically he just sent me the background and sent me a bunch of character heads.

557
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,500
And I just, I just picked which ones to put on there, at least for volume two and three.

558
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,500
So let me, let me look at the ones he did for volume three.

559
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Hold on.

560
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,500
Let me, hang on, let me speculate.

561
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm thinking, I mean, I think it would probably have to be Coyote would have to be one, maybe

562
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
like Coyote.

563
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Actually, I'll just send them to you now.

564
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Though I, hold on.

565
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Who else is, I mean, who else is like, the first one was her intended for volume two

566
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,500
and the second one was intended for volume three.

567
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Though I use some of the ones from volume three for volume two.

568
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,500
And of course I didn't use Mario because you know, Nintendo.

569
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Oh, yeah.

570
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Well, I mean, you used Sonic and Knuckles and Tails and Shadow.

571
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Oh, with their, yeah, yeah.

572
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Sega isn't like, Sega isn't like, you know, hard-ass about people using their characters.

573
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,500
Yeah, I guess that's fair.

574
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
That's true.

575
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I mean, hmm.

576
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
I might, I might.

577
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Sylvester and Tom, I mean, Sylvester and Tom don't really get like more important past chapter.

578
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Yeah.

579
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
And the same with Blaze.

580
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
So I'll probably ask him.

581
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
I'll probably ask him to draw like more characters.

582
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Like I'm thinking like maybe like Cheeto Man and Amy or something.

583
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Oh, yeah.

584
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Definitely.

585
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Actually, yeah, definitely Cheeto Man.

586
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Yeah.

587
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,500
These are really, these are just really funny.

588
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
I like them a lot.

589
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Yeah.

590
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
I kind of wish I'll go ahead.

591
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,500
I was going to say you could make pins out of these or something.

592
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Oh, that's a good idea, actually.

593
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Yeah, like enamel pins.

594
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Some of these might be a little too complicated, but you could definitely make one out of like Gary, probably Sylvester Tom.

595
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:13,500
You could probably, you could probably work, simplify the design a little bit to make Silver, Coyote, Elmer.

596
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Yeah.

597
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
And here's the one, here's the one for chapter one.

598
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Oh, whoops, it's a BMP shit.

599
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Hold on.

600
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I can't read.

601
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I can't read that shit.

602
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Yeah.

603
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
He always sends BMPs for some reason.

604
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Is it because he draws them in MS Paint?

605
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Yeah.

606
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
So good.

607
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Okay.

608
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Yeah.

609
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,500
So you took this and you put it on the swirly purple background.

610
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Yeah.

611
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
And he made the background too.

612
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Oh, okay.

613
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I kind of wish he actually drew like the cover and like the correct aspect ratio so I could just use the cover that he drew, but he keeps sending it in like this really long wide or this really like long aspect ratio.

614
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,500
So I have to like rearrange the heads and stuff.

615
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Helicopter going by overhead.

616
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Does he, does he not know how to use like any art programs that have layers?

617
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Oh, no, he can use Gimp.

618
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Okay, that's, that's fair.

619
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,500
That's fair enough.

620
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Have you, have you seen, have you seen his art tutorials?

621
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
No.

622
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,500
I should send them like on, like on YouTube.

623
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,500
He made their pictures.

624
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Hold on, let me try to find them.

625
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Let's see.

626
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
No, I don't think I even heard about those.

627
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
The tails, the tails face I think would work.

628
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,500
You could make a tails face like the tails face and the Tom face too.

629
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
You could totally do that.

630
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Yeah.

631
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,500
You know what, you know what, if you wanted, I would help you, I would help you simplify.

632
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I would help you make like a version of the image that matches the specifications.

633
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Yeah.

634
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:01,500
We already have a tails gets trolled the face stickers on the store.

635
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
That's good.

636
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
Yeah.

637
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
That's good.

638
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Well shading in Gimp really depends how much opacity you put on it.

639
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Yeah.

640
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Okay.

641
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,500
And here's the, here's the older one he made about how he draws an MS paint and then copy

642
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,500
and paste it into Gimp to add the shading.

643
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Different brush used in this example.

644
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Another thing to note is you can give your picture a trippy effect with too much motion

645
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Blair.

646
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I guess that's how he made the cover.

647
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Yeah, it looks like it.

648
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Hang on.

649
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
What is, what is this like blood moon eclipse?

650
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Here's a way I color on both Gimp and paint that helps with dramatic scenes.

651
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I pick a color like red.

652
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,500
I go to edit colors.

653
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Where is this going?

654
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Grab a black area and lower or higher it by a little.

655
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,500
You add the new shade to the picture.

656
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Oh my God.

657
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
This is in paint.

658
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
This is in paint.

659
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Oh yeah.

660
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Paint is based.

661
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Sure.

662
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,500
I use paint all the time too.

663
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
The next thing I do.

664
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Oh my God.

665
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:27,500
This is how he makes gradients.

666
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Holy cow.

667
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
This is so much work.

668
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Yeah.

669
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,500
This is so much work to make a gradient.

670
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Oh, the poor man.

671
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I think you can make gradients like automatically in Gimp so I don't know why he does that.

672
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
You can.

673
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,500
You definitely can make gradients automatically.

674
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,500
There's got to be a gradient button.

675
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,500
He must just be, I mean he must just be familiar with this process and he just likes to do

676
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
it this way.

677
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Yeah.

678
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Which I can kind of understand that mindset.

679
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Although, oh man.

680
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:14,500
He has to draw these like parabolas and fill each one in with a slightly different shade.

681
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
And then go over it with the blur brush.

682
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
To be fair.

683
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
Oh no.

684
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,500
I don't think he does it that often but.

685
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
Yeah.

686
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
I mean, yeah.

687
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Like I don't see anything like that in the chapter 25 cover unless I'm blind.

688
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Well then again, I'm not looking at the final one.

689
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Hold on.

690
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
This is, I'm sorry.

691
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:42,500
This is the funniest, this is the funniest like gradient method I've ever seen.

692
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,500
It's probably funny too because you're a professional artist.

693
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:54,500
I mean, it's just, you could simply use one button.

694
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
You could do this with one click if you wanted.

695
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Yeah, but then it doesn't look Kino.

696
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,500
I mean, it would look a little different.

697
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Also, I, you know, you know what, I could go on.

698
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:19,500
I could go on about ways to improve the look of this shaded orb, but I would be misguided

699
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,500
because at the end of the day, it's perfect.

700
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,500
It's terrible, but it's perfect.

701
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Yeah, that's how it, that's how it be sometimes.

702
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Absolutely, absolutely.

703
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Did you look, oh that.

704
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,500
Oh go ahead.

705
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Oh god, oh god, there's more.

706
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Yeah.

707
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,500
I can't, okay.

708
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
I can't read through all of these right now.

709
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,500
These are the older ones he posted about how he draws it in MS Paint and then puts it in

710
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,500
Gimp to add the shading.

711
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
You don't really need to like read it.

712
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
It's just a picture.

713
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Yeah, it's a series of.

714
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,500
You can just look, you can just look at the thumbnail and you get the idea.

715
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:05,500
He's, he's like drawing in like sparkling jewels underwater.

716
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
I didn't even recognize this scene.

717
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,500
It's a flashback from when Sonic met Amy.

718
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Oh, okay.

719
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Oh, right.

720
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
There's Amy's little head there.

721
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Yeah.

722
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:23,500
And the gems are the Chaos Emeralds or Emeralds, which is how they're spelled.

723
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Emeralds.

724
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Well, they're not, well, they're not shaped like the Chaos Emeralds.

725
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Actually, yeah, you're right.

726
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
They're not shaped like them at all.

727
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
No.

728
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,500
They're more elongated than their actual.

729
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,500
I don't know what the name, I don't know what the name for this shape is.

730
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,500
One, two, three, four.

731
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
There's jewels everywhere.

732
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
This is a nice scene, actually.

733
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Yeah.

734
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:58,500
This is a beautiful little, little idea, river full of jewels embedded in the river bed.

735
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,500
That's nice.

736
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
I like it.

737
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Oh, illuminated by the moonlight.

738
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Oh, that's great.

739
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Yeah.

740
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Beautiful.

741
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Beautiful.

742
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Yeah.

743
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:12,500
People underestimate his artistic ability.

744
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,500
It's a, it's a, he had a vision.

745
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:23,500
He had a vision for this scene and I understand it and I appreciate it.

746
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Yeah.

747
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Oh, got a message from Gib.

748
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Apparently Gib has informed me that the reason she is not here is due to Father's Day stuff,

749
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
which is understandable.

750
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
You doing anything for Father's Day?

751
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,500
I said Happy Father's Day to my dad.

752
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Cool.

753
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,500
And I posted a, I posted a tweet about it.

754
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Hold on.

755
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
I posted that.

756
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,500
You know, the Troll King really does look out for Troll Face.

757
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,500
He, he really is a, you know, he's given him every opportunity in life.

758
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,500
To murder and rape people.

759
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Yeah.

760
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:09,500
My son was the cutest babby you would ever see.

761
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,500
The, I'm surprised.

762
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,500
I thought that the, I thought that the UK and America had different Father's Days.

763
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
Me too.

764
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:28,500
You're thinking of like how Canada and things, or Canada and the US have different Thanksgiving's.

765
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
And I'm thinking, I'm thinking of Mother's Day.

766
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
They have different Mother's Day.

767
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,500
Mother's Day is a different day in the US versus the UK, but Father's Day is the same day for some reason.

768
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
That's weird.

769
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Wow, that is weird.

770
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
That's weird, but sure, I guess.

771
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Whatever.

772
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
Um, yeah.

773
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Uh, everybody go buy, tells us Troll Volume 2.

774
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,500
You know what?

775
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,500
I should, I should, I should pick, I didn't, I never picked the Volume 1.

776
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
I should get both.

777
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
I do want to own them.

778
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,500
Yeah.

779
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
And I lowered the price of Volume 1.

780
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Since it's old.

781
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,500
How much is it now?

782
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
25.

783
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
How much is volume 2?

784
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
30.

785
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
That's, that's respectable.

786
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:19,500
I think, I'm hoping, I haven't, I haven't figured it out yet.

787
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm hoping that I can get slime and punishment to be like 35 or less.

788
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
I don't know if it's possible.

789
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Depend, it will probably depend on the page count.

790
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Final page count on that.

791
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,500
What will the page count be?

792
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
The page count, you know what?

793
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Uh, I, it will be, um, it's going to be about a hundred, uh, well, the pages themselves,

794
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,500
there's like 185 pages, but then I have to include the footnotes at the end.

795
00:50:53,500 --> 00:51:01,500
And I don't know exactly how much text will fit onto the pages in like a, the way that

796
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,500
I want to format it.

797
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,500
So.

798
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Yeah, it's hard.

799
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,500
It might be like, might be like 200 pages, maybe 200 and maybe a little more than 200.

800
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,500
I have no idea what, I have no idea what I'm going to do with the later chapters of

801
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Tales of Skid Skull because the page links are like really fucked up.

802
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
Oh yeah.

803
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:26,500
I'll have to like, cut each, I'll have to like cut each page into a different page.

804
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Yeah, probably.

805
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Yeah, you got to, you got to do what you got to do with that.

806
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,500
It's a little bit, yeah, you'll have to, uh, you'll have to make some editorial decisions

807
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
there.

808
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Yeah, the, um, the first two chapters were pretty easy because they're mostly the same

809
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
size.

810
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Uh-huh.

811
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Volumes, shit, I keep fucking up.

812
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Yeah, I made the same, I made the same mistake.

813
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:00,500
Um, uh, well I have, how, uh, shit.

814
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,500
I wonder if they're the same size as Lord of Ghosts.

815
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Probably similar.

816
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Like, like page size dimensions so I can fit them all.

817
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
You know, I don't actually have like a bookshelf.

818
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
I should get a bookshelf.

819
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,500
I just put, I just put the, I just put, I just put the books that I have on the same

820
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:22,500
like shelves that are, my games are on and my movies are on.

821
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,500
I only have a few games and they're just in a box in my closet so.

822
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Yeah, that's, that's how some of my games are.

823
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,500
That's how some of my games are too because I haven't unpacked from when I moved a year

824
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
and a half ago.

825
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,500
Yeah, everything I have is in boxes in my closet because I was convinced that I would

826
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:47,500
be moving out of this shitty house, uh, immediately and it's been like nine months.

827
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
My lease is already running out.

828
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Yeah, well congrats, congratulations on your baby.

829
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,500
Because it's been nine months.

830
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Yeah, true, I guess.

831
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Um, all right.

832
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Well, not to, not to kick you, but if you have anything else to say, I do, you know,

833
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:21,500
I will probably, um, I'll probably move on to doing voicemails in a minute.

834
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,500
I don't know if you care to hang out for that.

835
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Oh, sure.

836
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,500
I'll probably not.

837
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
I'll hang out for that.

838
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
God, you want to really?

839
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
Yeah.

840
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,500
But, but if I, if I don't have anything to say, then I'll just, you know.

841
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Well, let me, um, I have one, I have one other unrelated subject I wanted to touch on

842
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,500
before, uh, before I go on to voicemails.

843
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:58,500
And that is that, uh, my, my game, uh, Phantom's Revenge, it is getting featured in a little,

844
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,500
uh, indie, um, game.

845
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Well, he calls it a zine, but it's really more of a, it's more of a digital download

846
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:22,500
that you can buy on itch, uh, that is, um, hang on, let me, let me find it.

847
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
It's called Indiepocalypse.

848
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,500
It's, I guess you, I guess you could call it a digital zine, and it's basically every month

849
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:35,500
he publishes a little thing that you can buy if you want to, um, on itch, and you get,

850
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:41,500
uh, it's like, it like, features a bunch of indie games, but I think he does like 20,

851
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
I think he does 10 a month, actually.

852
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:49,500
So anyway, Phantom's Revenge is getting featured in Indiepocalypse, uh, number 28.

853
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:56,500
I think it should be coming out maybe this week, uh, or pretty soon.

854
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Anyway, the guy who runs it is called Pizza Pranks, all one word, he's on Twitter at Pizza Pranks.

855
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:08,500
Uh, so I think that'll probably be out by the time this episode goes live, so go check,

856
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
go check that out, I guess.

857
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Uh, I got a feature, I think that's pretty.

858
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:20,500
No, I think it's number, it's number 29 or 28?

859
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Fuck, hang on.

860
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,500
I gotta find out which, find out which one I'm even in.

861
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I hope he's paying, I hope he's paying you.

862
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,500
Cause, cause they have to, they have to buy it from him.

863
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,500
You know, he is paying me, actually, he's paying me very generously for what it is.

864
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,500
I mean, that's not to say that he's giving me a lot of money, but I'm sure he doesn't make,

865
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,500
I'm sure he doesn't make like crazy money doing this.

866
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Yeah.

867
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,500
He is, oh no, it's gonna be number 30.

868
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,500
It's gonna be a number 30, and I don't exactly know when it'll come out, sometime this month.

869
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Or maybe at the beginning of next month.

870
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,500
Anyways, coming out soon.

871
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Um, he, he's paid me, apparently like everybody gets, everybody gets $20 up front just for being accepted,

872
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:18,500
and then there's like a, every creator gets like a, like 8% of every like sale that the zine generates or something,

873
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:27,500
which means that like most of it is going to the people featured in the zine, which is very generous.

874
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:35,500
Honestly, I would have let him feature me for nothing, cause I don't, I don't need, I don't need $20, but it's fine.

875
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:42,500
But I appreciate, but I appreciate that he's dedicated to making sure the money goes to the creators.

876
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
I think that's swell of him.

877
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
He seems like a swell guy.

878
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Yeah, that's nice of him.

879
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
And you said you wanted to know how big the book was.

880
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,500
Sure.

881
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,500
It says, it says on the store page how big it is.

882
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Does it?

883
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,500
Yeah.

884
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,500
No, it doesn't.

885
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,500
I'm looking at talesgetstroll.org slash store.html.

886
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
No, on the Amazon page.

887
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Oh, okay.

888
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,500
It is, fuck.

889
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Yeah, I'm sure it's here somewhere.

890
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:31,500
8.27 by 0.33 by 11.69 inches.

891
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,500
I'm not sure.

892
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:40,500
I was, I just wanted to compare it to the size of the Lord of Ghosts book, which I'm also not sure it's dimensions, but that sounds about right.

893
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Probably.

894
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,500
Yeah.

895
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,500
No, no.

896
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,500
That was the biggest I could make it.

897
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Oh, wow.

898
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,500
38 global ratings on the Talesgetstroll book.

899
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,500
All of them five out of five ratings.

900
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,500
Yeah, it's the best rated book I've ever seen on Amazon.

901
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:06,500
It is a perfectly 100% score book on Amazon.

902
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Actually, let me, let me read some, let me read some.

903
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Here's one.

904
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Reed says, I like the part where the bugs asked him to put the coaster.

905
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Five people found this helpful.

906
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:28,500
For what felt like a terrible trudge of a comic book year, I was pleasantly surprised to come across this majestic marvel of a book.

907
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:34,500
It's an electric experience that tackles the existential crisis humanity and trolling.

908
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:41,500
A cut and dry encounter quickly escalates into a worldwide crisis that endangers the safety of all fictional and non-fictional characters ever created.

909
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:50,500
With high stakes and bombshell breakthroughs, you'll experience a tale of sacrifice, loss, betrayal, self-reflection, destiny, and trolls.

910
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Easily an impulse buy if you are seeking a good read with God to your art.

911
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Thank you, Laserbot and Ember Graham for showing this world still has talent, and I look forward to volume two.

912
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
Fat guys buy in volume two.

913
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Yeah.

914
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Danny, Danny Bork has said that he will buy volume two.

915
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
That's his name.

916
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,500
Oh yeah, Danny Bork.

917
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,500
He said he posted it and posted it publicly.

918
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,500
Danny Bork.

919
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Yeah.

920
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Okay, it's 11.30.

921
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,500
I have to catch a train.

922
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,500
Oh, I should actually.

923
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,500
All right.

924
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,500
I want to get going by before noon.

925
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
I catch a train at like one something.

926
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Where are you going?

927
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,500
So, I'm going to my parents' house Father's Day.

928
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
Oh, Happy Father's Day.

929
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Happy Father's Day.

930
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
There's actually not that many voicemails today.

931
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:51,500
I guess everyone got sick of sending voicemails, sending like too many voicemails during our three week absence.

932
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,500
And that's fine.

933
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Oh yeah, that's true.

934
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Why was there an absence?

935
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
Oh, Gib was on a trip.

936
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Gib was visiting America and we were hanging out in real life and we didn't record a podcast for three weeks.

937
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,500
You could have done like a live podcast with you guys in the same room and shit.

938
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:16,500
We could have, but guess what we didn't.

939
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:21,500
You could have done like a video podcast where it's like you guys at a news desk or some shit.

940
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
I know.

941
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:28,500
We could have, well, Gib didn't want it.

942
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Yeah.

943
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,500
Me neither.

944
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,500
Yeah.

945
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Yeah.

946
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
All right.

947
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Found it.

948
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,500
I found the voicemails.

949
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
All right, I'm going to post them.

950
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:45,500
This first one is called, it's just called Roro from Roro on Discord.

951
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
It's a minute 30.

952
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Okay.

953
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Three, two, one, go.

954
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,500
In 2008, the economy functionally collapsed.

955
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
The basic chain reaction was fixed.

956
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,500
I know, it's Dan.

957
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Banks came up with a thing called a mortgage-backed security, a financial instrument that could be trained or collected that was based on a bundle of thousands of individual mortgages.

958
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:16,500
Based on the general reluctance of banks to issue mortgages, the risk aversion and lendings of 100s of thousands of dollars that they'll pay off over the course of potentially decades, these bonds were seen as especially stable.

959
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,500
However, they were also immensely profitable for the banks to both pay off their mortgages.

960
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,500
Got it.

961
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,500
Got it.

962
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
You quoted that video.

963
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,500
Thanks for the voicemail.

964
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Next.

965
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
You seen that video?

966
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Nope.

967
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,500
It's called the problem.

968
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
I think it's called line go up or line go down.

969
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,500
The problem with NFTs, it's from the Folding Ideas channel.

970
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,500
It's by Dan Olson.

971
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,500
It's got like eight million views.

972
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
Wow.

973
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:47,500
It's the best video I've seen explaining why NFTs are bad.

974
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,500
Well, I already know NFTs are bad, so it's redundant, at least in my case.

975
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
That's, I mean, fair.

976
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,500
I mean, fair.

977
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
That's because it's good.

978
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
It's good video.

979
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,500
I'm not saying, I'm not saying you got to watch it, but it is a good video.

980
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
Yeah.

981
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Next.

982
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:16,500
It's, I think it became kind of the video that like, when people wanted to explain to someone why are NFTs bad and it's like, it's actually really complicated.

983
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Reason.

984
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
It's actually hard to explain why.

985
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,500
I think that sort of became the one that people were like, here, just watch this video.

986
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,500
Just watch this two hour YouTube video and you'll understand.

987
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,500
Yeah.

988
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Well, when I first heard of NFTs, basically the way I understood it was people spend like thousands of dollars on like a link to an image.

989
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
And I was like, that's stupid.

990
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
So yeah.

991
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
That is true.

992
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,500
Would you, would you believe that there are even more reasons why they're bad?

993
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Yeah.

994
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
I heard something about the environment or something.

995
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
There's the environment.

996
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:08,500
There's, there's just the whole, the whole like business model of NFTs is basically in service of consolidating wealth even further.

997
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,500
Yeah.

998
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,500
It's pretty much the goal of them, et cetera, et cetera.

999
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,500
Yeah.

1000
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Anyway.

1001
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Yeah, shit, whatever.

1002
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
It's a long ass fucking video.

1003
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
I can't summarize it here.

1004
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,500
Yeah.

1005
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:26,500
Next one is called, well, hang on.

1006
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,500
Okay.

1007
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,500
It's two image links.

1008
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,500
Anyway, I'm going to, I'm going to play the audio three, two, one go.

1009
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Look at my fan art.

1010
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Okay.

1011
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
I'm going to look at the fan art.

1012
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Let's see this shit.

1013
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
Is this Mega Man?

1014
01:03:41,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Oh, this is, um, yeah, because like I mentioned, when, when the Minecraft stream wouldn't work, I started playing Mega Man X5 and I was complaining about how the dial, the Mavericks all, the Mavericks and X5 are also fucking stupid.

1015
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
This is, this is Duff McWailin.

1016
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,500
That's the, that's the one where the English localizers decided to name them after fucking a.

1017
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Yes.

1018
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Yes.

1019
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,500
Uh, Guns N' Roses musicians.

1020
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
Yeah.

1021
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
And they weren't even called that in the Japanese version.

1022
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,500
Did, did, did you hear me complaining about this or is this just something you know?

1023
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,500
Oh, it's just something I know.

1024
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,500
It's a, it's a.

1025
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Oh, very nice.

1026
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,500
It's a well-known thing in the Mega Man community.

1027
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Nothing.

1028
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
I didn't know you were, I didn't know you were a Mega Maner.

1029
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,500
Well, I played Mega Man, but I wouldn't say I'm part of the community.

1030
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,500
It's just like, it's just like a well-known thing to people who play Mega Man.

1031
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,500
I had never played, um, I had never played past like X3.

1032
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:47,500
So I had never, I didn't know about, I didn't know about Duff McWailin and Axel the Red.

1033
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,500
Yeah.

1034
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,500
Uh, et cetera, et cetera.

1035
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,500
I never played past X3 either.

1036
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,500
It's just, I heard about it.

1037
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:57,500
I, actually that's not, I did play a little bit of X4.

1038
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,500
It's at one point, but like I never got that far on it.

1039
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,500
Yeah.

1040
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,500
I didn't like the, I didn't like the art change.

1041
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
I was, I was, I was, I complained a lot.

1042
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:11,500
I complained a lot about Mega Man, uh, on that stream and on the next one that I did on my Twitch.

1043
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,500
Uh, there's a lot, there's a lot to complain about.

1044
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Yeah.

1045
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,500
Okay.

1046
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Okay.

1047
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,500
So Duff McWailin says, listen, you know we are friends.

1048
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,500
I want to help you.

1049
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,500
This might look unreasonable, but, uh, okay.

1050
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:31,500
And then the next one is Mega, Mega Man, McWailin has hit you.

1051
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:37,500
Uh, damn, he hit, he hit your ass.

1052
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,500
Lit, I like it.

1053
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,500
It's me.

1054
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,500
It's me with the helmet.

1055
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,500
Yeah.

1056
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,500
I'm bleeding.

1057
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,500
The, the, when you fight, when you find Duff McWailin, after the most, after the, literally

1058
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,500
the most annoying stage in the entire X series up to that point.

1059
01:05:52,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Um, he says like, hey, I'm a good guy and I know I, and I have something that you want.

1060
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,500
You want to use my ocean to save the world.

1061
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:09,500
Well, I am a good guy and I'd like to help you, but I'm a man of the sea, so I have

1062
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
to fight you instead.

1063
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,500
And then he does.

1064
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:17,500
That comes off as like a bad translation of something because it doesn't make any sense.

1065
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Because he's a man of the sea.

1066
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,500
Uh, okay.

1067
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:28,740
A Grizzly slash at least explains, he's like, I know I should be on your side, but I'm an

1068
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:33,740
honorable warrior and I, and you're the strongest reploid and I just want to fight you.

1069
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,740
Like, I just want to do it.

1070
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:40,140
And it kind of makes sense, even though it's not like reasonable, but Duff McWailin is

1071
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,740
just like, I'm a man of the sea.

1072
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,740
And that means I always have to fight under all circumstances.

1073
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,740
Yeah.

1074
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,740
It's just nonsense.

1075
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,740
Yeah.

1076
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:53,740
It might be like something that's lost in translation because I don't know what the fuck that means.

1077
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,740
Maybe.

1078
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,740
Yeah.

1079
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,740
And then the other Mega Man games, weren't they have like a virus or something?

1080
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,740
But for this one, they're trying to come up with different reasons.

1081
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:10,740
Well, sometimes in one through three, all of the robot masters, not robot masters, all

1082
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:16,740
of the bosses, they're infected with the Maverick virus slash Sigma virus.

1083
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:24,740
And that's why they're crazy and evil in for some of them are infected with the Sigma

1084
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,740
virus.

1085
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:31,740
But most of them are just members of Repliforce who are just cops rioting because they were

1086
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,740
accused of doing something bad and they decided that instead of like turning over the body

1087
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,740
cam footage, they're going to like stage a coup.

1088
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,740
That's literally the plot of X4.

1089
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,740
Wow, based.

1090
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:46,740
That's literally the plot of X4.

1091
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:50,740
And then in five, in five, it's like the virus is going crazy.

1092
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:54,740
Some of them have the virus and some of them don't have it yet and it's kind of all over

1093
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,740
the place.

1094
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,740
Yeah.

1095
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:01,740
The plot of X5 is basically everyone gets, like the entire world gets infected with the

1096
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:06,740
virus and Mega Man's like, well, we got a shit's fucking dire now.

1097
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,740
Yeah.

1098
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,740
Anyway.

1099
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,740
Do you see?

1100
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,740
Fucking Duff McWailin.

1101
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:15,740
Do you think the cops from X4 or the Valde police department is worse?

1102
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,740
I should clarify.

1103
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,740
The cops in X4, actually, you're the cops in X4.

1104
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,740
It's the military in X4 that is rioting.

1105
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,740
Oh, same shit, whatever.

1106
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,740
Yeah, same shit, basically.

1107
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:37,740
It's the cops versus the military and the cops actually look good by comparison.

1108
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,740
So that should tell you something.

1109
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,740
Damn.

1110
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:45,740
I would say that the cops in X4 are better than the Uvalde military.

1111
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,740
The Uvalde military.

1112
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:54,740
At least in X4, the cops went into, Mega Man and Zero go into Sky Lagoon as it's crashing

1113
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,740
down on whatever city it was destroying.

1114
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:01,740
They're there and they're like, well, I can't do anything about it.

1115
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,740
At least they went in.

1116
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,740
Yeah, sure.

1117
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,740
Even though they weren't able to prevent the tragedy.

1118
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:09,740
Yeah, and they released the body him footage.

1119
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:16,740
They just like, hey, Repliforce, you were here.

1120
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,740
Why did you?

1121
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,740
We kind of think it looks like you did this terrorism.

1122
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:26,740
Could you please deactivate so we can conduct an investigation?

1123
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,740
And they're like, no.

1124
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,740
What about our pride?

1125
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,740
We'll never lay down our weapons.

1126
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:35,740
We will kill every, quote unquote, human.

1127
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:40,740
We'll kill every Reploid that thinks we did anything wrong.

1128
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:44,740
Turns out it was, in fact, a Repliforce member that crashed Sky Lagoon.

1129
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,740
Magma Dragoon did it.

1130
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:47,740
Damn.

1131
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,740
And like, yeah, he was infected with the Sigma virus, possibly, but he was still a legitimate

1132
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:53,740
Repliforce member.

1133
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:57,740
So they were just wrong.

1134
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,740
Fucking...

1135
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,740
Okay, that's enough.

1136
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,740
That's enough about this.

1137
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:03,740
Yeah.

1138
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,740
ACAB.

1139
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,740
ACAB includes Repliforce.

1140
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,740
Yeah.

1141
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,740
Yeah.

1142
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:19,740
Okay, I'm looking at this next Imgir link, and it's the PCP at Radcon 4, and there's a

1143
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:20,740
lizard.

1144
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,740
And I got to be honest, I don't know who this lizard is.

1145
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,740
It's one of the members of the PCP.

1146
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:31,740
Oh, Gragel Bestman.

1147
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,740
The forgotten...

1148
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:33,740
Oh, I see.

1149
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,740
I see what they're doing.

1150
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,740
Who remembers Gragel Bestman?

1151
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:41,740
Man, the good old days in Radcon 4 seems like so long ago.

1152
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,740
Most people, real heads know about Gragel.

1153
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,740
Yeah.

1154
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,740
I get it.

1155
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,740
I get it.

1156
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,740
Let's see.

1157
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,740
What was I doing here?

1158
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,740
Where am I exactly?

1159
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,740
The voicemail.

1160
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:03,740
Right.

1161
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,740
Next one is called Interrupting Death Goat.

1162
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:08,740
There's the audio.

1163
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,740
Three, two, one, go.

1164
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,740
Hello, PCP.

1165
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:17,740
No voice changer, no instrumental.

1166
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:24,740
I am recording this.

1167
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,740
Damn.

1168
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,740
You really, you really went all out.

1169
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:35,740
I don't know if that was like a clip, or if he just like screamed off mic.

1170
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,740
Either way, it sounded good.

1171
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,740
Good job.

1172
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,740
Yeah.

1173
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:46,740
Next one is called Beefing with a Voicemailer from last week.

1174
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,740
There it is.

1175
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,740
Three, two, one, go.

1176
01:11:51,740 --> 01:12:00,740
Hey, Ben said, did you know, remember that stupid fucking useless drama on

1177
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,740
Twitter from two months ago that everyone is sick of hearing about?

1178
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:15,740
Well, I thought that I would bring that back up to tell you that being bad is

1179
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,740
bad and being nice is good.

1180
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,740
Thank you for saying it.

1181
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,740
Brave.

1182
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,740
Kind of cringe.

1183
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:26,740
Very good.

1184
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,740
Very good.

1185
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,740
Very good.

1186
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,740
What do you think, CeCe?

1187
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:35,740
Is being nice or is being bad cringe?

1188
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:39,740
I think good things are good and bad things are bad.

1189
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:40,740
Wrong.

1190
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,740
There's no difference.

1191
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,740
You absolute buffoon.

1192
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,740
Well, it depends on what we're talking about.

1193
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,740
In what context?

1194
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,740
Yeah.

1195
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,740
This guy's right.

1196
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,740
Last week, some guy.

1197
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,740
Is that the Vtuber thing?

1198
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:59,740
Last week, some guy sent in a message asking about some Twitter drama that was

1199
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,740
old even before our three week hiatus had gone on.

1200
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,740
So there was no excuse for it at all.

1201
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:05,740
Was it the Vtuber thing?

1202
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:13,740
This guy has skewered him, lampooned him in a resounding fashion.

1203
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,740
Was it the Vtuber thing?

1204
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,740
It was.

1205
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:17,740
Yeah, it was.

1206
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:18,740
Yeah.

1207
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:19,740
That old chestnut.

1208
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:25,740
Actually, I think parasocial relations are bad, but that's just my opinion.

1209
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:32,740
I think, I wouldn't say that they're all bad all the time.

1210
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,740
Yeah.

1211
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,740
I wouldn't say they're all bad all the time, but yeah.

1212
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:40,740
I mean, I can relate since I don't have any real friends either, but you know.

1213
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:44,740
You don't, you don't want to, you don't want to take it to an unhealthy level.

1214
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:45,740
Absolutely.

1215
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,740
For sure.

1216
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:48,740
Okay.

1217
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,740
Next one.

1218
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:50,740
Oh man.

1219
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:51,740
I'm looking forward to this one.

1220
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,740
Next one is death note fun fact number three.

1221
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,740
I remember last week's fun fact was extremely fun.

1222
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:00,740
So I'm ready to be entertained.

1223
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,740
Three, two, one, go.

1224
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,740
Hey, PCP.

1225
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,740
It's the death note fun fact guy.

1226
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,740
Here's a death note fun fact.

1227
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,740
Did you know that although it's framed as an alias within the series, L is actually

1228
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,740
L's real first name.

1229
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,740
I didn't know that series itself.

1230
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:19,740
An official guidebook released after the manga concluded called death note how to read in

1231
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:20,740
this book.

1232
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,740
L's full name is revealed as L.

1233
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,740
That was another death note fun fact.

1234
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,740
See you next week for another death note fun fact.

1235
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,740
I regret to inform you.

1236
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,740
I did know that.

1237
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,740
Yeah.

1238
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,740
Me too.

1239
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,740
My fun.

1240
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,740
My fun was diminished significantly.

1241
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,740
What was the, what was the one from last week?

1242
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,740
Oh, fuck.

1243
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,740
The last one was, oh, shit.

1244
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,740
I hope I'm not misremembering.

1245
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:46,740
I think it was that like, oh, I remember.

1246
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:51,740
Mellow and near were like in the original draft of the story.

1247
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:57,740
Mellow and near were supposed to be L's children, but the author like changed his mind and they

1248
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:02,740
didn't write it that way because they could not imagine L having sex.

1249
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,740
Oh yeah.

1250
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,740
That makes sense.

1251
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,740
Yeah.

1252
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,740
So that was great.

1253
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,740
And also he was like, isn't L like 22?

1254
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,740
So he would have had to have, they would have.

1255
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:13,740
Yeah.

1256
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,740
He would have had sex when he was like 17 and they'd be five years old.

1257
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,740
I don't know.

1258
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,740
Well, I'm not sure.

1259
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Maybe it was like an earlier draft where L was older or maybe there was originally a longer

1260
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,740
like time skip in between part one and part two or something like that.

1261
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,740
Yeah.

1262
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,740
I'm not sure.

1263
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,740
Yeah.

1264
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,740
But it's a fun fact and it sounds true.

1265
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,740
Retweet if it sounds true.

1266
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,740
Yeah.

1267
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,740
I'll have to tell them.

1268
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,740
You see that thing?

1269
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,740
You see, do you know what I'm referencing there?

1270
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,740
Retweet if it sounds true.

1271
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:43,740
It sounds familiar, but.

1272
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:46,740
Some fucking, some fucking Democrat.

1273
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,740
Oh yeah.

1274
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,740
Oh yeah.

1275
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:49,740
Oh yeah.

1276
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,740
Now I remember it's the.

1277
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:54,740
The Lauren, the Lauren Boebert was like a sex escort and had two abortions.

1278
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,740
Retweet if it sounds true.

1279
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,740
Yeah.

1280
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:58,740
That sounds, that sounds true.

1281
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,740
All right.

1282
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,740
Well, why?

1283
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,740
I guess.

1284
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,740
Why?

1285
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,740
I think it would be true.

1286
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,740
Yeah.

1287
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:10,740
To, to be fair, like people like that, like make me really like confident in my ability

1288
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:15,740
to run for office because they can win an election.

1289
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:20,740
So can I, but not really because, because I'm on the spectrum and I don't know how to,

1290
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,740
like I'm not persuasive enough to tell people to vote for me.

1291
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:31,740
I have, are there any, like, are there any like autistic, I don't know, like house members

1292
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:32,740
or governors or anything?

1293
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,740
Or is anyone like openly on the spectrum?

1294
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:39,740
I'm genuinely curious to know if there were.

1295
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:45,740
I don't think so, but there's a, you know, Kirsten Sinema, the greatest senator of,

1296
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,740
from Arizona, my state.

1297
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,740
She's the only bisexual in Congress.

1298
01:16:50,740 --> 01:17:00,740
I am aware of Kirsten Sinema's fabulous slay queen, beautiful by representation.

1299
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,740
Yeah.

1300
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:03,740
Yeah.

1301
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:06,740
I'm looking forward to not voting for her in 2024.

1302
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,740
Are you in Arizona?

1303
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:09,740
Yeah.

1304
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,740
Good for you.

1305
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,740
Yeah.

1306
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:16,740
All, all I get to do is choose between Ed Markey and Joe Kennedy.

1307
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,740
Oh, Joe Kennedy sucks ass.

1308
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:23,740
He does suck ass, but not as much as like Sinema.

1309
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,740
Yeah, obviously.

1310
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,740
I mean, that goes without saying.

1311
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,740
Pretty much.

1312
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,740
Yeah.

1313
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:35,740
Uh, next voicemail is called declaration of war.

1314
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,740
Uh, three, two, one, go.

1315
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:39,740
You know what?

1316
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,740
It had to be said.

1317
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:47,740
I fucking hate that fucking British Australian, whatever the fuck he is guy who always fucking

1318
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:51,740
leaves voicemails where he's like, Oh, whatever.

1319
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,740
Fuck that guy.

1320
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:54,740
I hate that guy.

1321
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,740
He's my officially my arch nemesis.

1322
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,740
I will fight him to the death on the top of the highest mountain.

1323
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:04,740
I will fucking destroy him.

1324
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,740
Can you be more?

1325
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:06,740
He will die.

1326
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,740
Can you be more specific?

1327
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,740
Declaration of war.

1328
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,740
Fuck you.

1329
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,740
I don't.

1330
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,740
I feel like I should know.

1331
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,740
Ben Stain on Block B on Twitter.

1332
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:17,740
I feel like I should know that guy's name.

1333
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:21,740
Who's the Australian guy he's talking about?

1334
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,740
I don't.

1335
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,740
I don't know his name.

1336
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,740
I feel like I should, but I know the voice.

1337
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,740
I know the, the, the voicemailer.

1338
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,740
Yeah, he does.

1339
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,740
He, he sends in voicemails.

1340
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,740
No, I mean, I mean, which, which person is he talking about in the voicemail?

1341
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,740
No, that's what I mean.

1342
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:42,740
Like it's a guy with an accent who sends in ones and he'll be like an episode, an episode

1343
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,740
116.

1344
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,740
You said this, but actually there's something.

1345
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,740
Oh, okay.

1346
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:48,740
Yeah.

1347
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,740
He's talking about a voicemailer.

1348
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,740
I don't know.

1349
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,740
He's sending a lot of voicemail.

1350
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:55,740
I don't, so I think some of them have been annoying and some of them have been fine.

1351
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,740
So I don't even remember.

1352
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:00,740
I don't remember if he said anything like particularly irritating.

1353
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,740
Um, okay.

1354
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,740
The next one, the next one is not a voicemail.

1355
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,740
There's no audio or it's like one second audio.

1356
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,740
It's just a question.

1357
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,740
Is Nate okay?

1358
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:19,740
Um, I mean, can you, you're going to, you're going to have to explain it to me if there's

1359
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,740
reason to think Nate's not okay.

1360
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,740
You're going to have to give me a reasoning and then maybe I can respond to it.

1361
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,740
Nate's saying the brother has been saying.

1362
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,740
All, yeah.

1363
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,740
All I can really do with this is just say, yeah, I think so.

1364
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,740
I don't know.

1365
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,740
Be, be more specific.

1366
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,740
Do you know what he's doing?

1367
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,740
Uh, the next one.

1368
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:36,740
Huh?

1369
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,740
Do you know what Nate is doing up to these days?

1370
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:43,740
Actually, I believe he is visiting our sister.

1371
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,740
For Father's Day.

1372
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,740
Yeah, I guess.

1373
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:50,740
Uh, I think he's, I think he's visiting our sister.

1374
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:54,740
Him and, him and Michelle are doing that.

1375
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,740
I heard from Michelle that was happening.

1376
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:01,740
Um, other than that, I don't really know.

1377
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,740
Um, yeah.

1378
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:06,740
Next, next one is a question.

1379
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:10,740
Does the death note fun fact guy sound like Digi?

1380
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,740
Uh, let me.

1381
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:16,740
I thought the last guy kind of sounded like Digi, the guy complaining about the Australian.

1382
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,740
You think so?

1383
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:26,740
I thought the last one sounded like, the last one reminds me of someone, but I'm not sure who.

1384
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:27,740
Yeah, maybe.

1385
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:33,740
Uh, the next one, sorry, the death note fun fact guy, uh, let me listen again real quick.

1386
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,740
Wait, are they the same person?

1387
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:39,740
I think, I think, I think, I think they're the same person.

1388
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,740
Yeah, they sound, they sound similar.

1389
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,740
They do sound similar.

1390
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,740
They don't, I guess they don't really sound like Digi bro to me.

1391
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,740
I don't really hear it.

1392
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:51,740
I mean, maybe, maybe before she transitioned.

1393
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,740
I don't know.

1394
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,740
Yeah.

1395
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,740
I kind of, sort of hear it.

1396
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,740
I have to, I have to stretch to hear it.

1397
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,740
I don't, I don't, kind of.

1398
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:06,740
Um, next one is called does the death note.

1399
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:07,740
No, sorry.

1400
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:09,740
Next one is called also where.

1401
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,740
Oh, wait, really?

1402
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,740
This one is where is Digi?

1403
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,740
Why is he not on?

1404
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,740
Uh, bro.

1405
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:21,740
He's, he's, he's even more like out of date with the PCP Lord than I am.

1406
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:24,740
And that's saying, I will tell, I will tell you.

1407
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,740
Okay.

1408
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:28,740
Did Digi bro.

1409
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:39,740
He, he Digi bro Demi boy is married to Ethan Ralph and has given birth to a child with Ethan Ralph.

1410
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,740
That's where, that's where Digi bro is.

1411
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,740
Because remember CC, I don't know if you're aware of it.

1412
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,740
Yeah.

1413
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,740
Digi bro, Digi bro and Trixie switch names.

1414
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:52,740
They didn't, uh, it was before Trixie, but, uh,

1415
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,740
Wait, what, what, what, what, what?

1416
01:21:54,740 --> 01:22:01,740
At some point post-transition and pre-breakup, uh, Digi bro, or she was not Trixie at that point.

1417
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:03,740
I think she was still Digi nay.

1418
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,740
Right.

1419
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:09,740
But Digi nay stopped being Digi nay and may became Digi nay.

1420
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:14,740
Or Digi bro, no, may became Digi bro, uh, and famously said that, uh,

1421
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:19,740
She doesn't like little black girls, uh, but she is attracted to children.

1422
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:20,740
Wow.

1423
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,740
She, she really said.

1424
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,740
Just not black ones.

1425
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,740
She really, she really said that.

1426
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:27,740
She really, I mean, have you, have you heard the clip?

1427
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,740
I, I, oh yeah, cause they're both like lolly con pedophiles.

1428
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:31,740
I forgot.

1429
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:32,740
Yeah.

1430
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:36,740
It's, it's not, it's not, uh, there's a, there's a clip.

1431
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:41,740
It's called, it's called Digi bro's, Digi bro's opinion of Netflix cuties.

1432
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:47,740
And it's may standing there, sort of like attempting to yell.

1433
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,740
I am not interested in black little girl.

1434
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,740
Trying to do like a stupid angry video game, like yelling voice.

1435
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:53,740
Yeah.

1436
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,740
And she said she's not interested in black little girl.

1437
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:01,740
Explaining, explaining, like explaining that she is attracted to children, but not black one.

1438
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:08,740
I, she, she point, no, she points to like a lolly, she points to like a lolly thing on

1439
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:11,740
the wall and says, this, this is what I'm into.

1440
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:14,740
Not black little girl.

1441
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:15,740
Yeah.

1442
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,740
That's a great video.

1443
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,740
May I love you.

1444
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,740
Unblock, unblock me on Twitter.

1445
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,740
You're my best friend.

1446
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,740
Anyway, uh, what was I talking about?

1447
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,740
Uh, something something.

1448
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,740
Digi bro's opinion.

1449
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,740
Anyway, Digi is married to Ethan Ralph.

1450
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,740
That is, that is the answer.

1451
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:39,740
Um, because the title of Digi bro was passed on to me and then never transferred again.

1452
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,740
So Ethan Ralph is married to Digi bro.

1453
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,740
That's just cannon.

1454
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,740
Anyway, that's, that's the answer to the question.

1455
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,740
We've got like two more voicemails to get through.

1456
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,740
The next one is called happy birthday, Ben.

1457
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,740
Uh, there's no audio.

1458
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,740
Uh, thanks.

1459
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:58,740
Uh, one after that is called, well, it's a YouTube link.

1460
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,740
Uh, let's see what it is.

1461
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,740
What the fuck is this?

1462
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:05,740
Sylvain Hunter, what is modern dance dance revolution?

1463
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,740
This is probably like a three hour video, right?

1464
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:09,740
13 minutes.

1465
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,740
Why would you send me this?

1466
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,740
Who would do, who would do this?

1467
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:16,740
Anyway, the last one is called happy birthday, Ben.

1468
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:17,740
Uh, thanks.

1469
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,740
Happy birthday, Ben.

1470
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,740
Okay.

1471
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,740
Happy birthday.

1472
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,740
When was your birthday?

1473
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,740
April.

1474
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,740
Uh, happy.

1475
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:29,740
Two months late birthday.

1476
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:35,740
The last, you know, when I logged into Twitch to stream, to test my stream strength.

1477
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:43,740
Um, the last stream that I did on my Twitch channel was my birthday two years ago in

1478
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:46,740
2020, shortly post radcon four.

1479
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:49,740
I have not like touched the Twitch channel since then.

1480
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:55,740
And that was probably a huge mistake, but that's what happened.

1481
01:24:55,740 --> 01:25:00,740
Uh, so you stream on a different channel?

1482
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:06,740
When I have streamed since then, it has mostly been either, um, on the PCP YouTube channel

1483
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:11,740
with Shekels for heckles, or it has been RFCK related.

1484
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,740
Okay.

1485
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:18,740
Like mostly judging the RFCK art contests and, and such.

1486
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,740
Man.

1487
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:24,740
I used, I had a little bit of, I had a little bit of Twitch traction for a while there for

1488
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,740
a little brief stretch there.

1489
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:31,740
I was getting like a hundred viewers a stream, uh, although I think it had dipped a little,

1490
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:38,740
that was, that was during a, like a pre-radcon period of buzz, I think.

1491
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,740
Uh, I don't know.

1492
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:42,740
I don't know if my numbers would have stayed like that forever.

1493
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,740
Um, I don't know.

1494
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,740
Maybe I should start using that.

1495
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:49,740
I've been, I've been, I've been like gaming a little bit more.

1496
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,740
You know, I've been, I've been gaming more because after, after I played, uh, Mega Man

1497
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:58,740
on the Shekels for heckles, I played a little bit more of it on the, uh, on my Twitch.

1498
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,740
And I think I want to play some more Mega Man in the near future.

1499
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:07,740
So, uh, twitch.tv slash ben saint, or no, is it saint comics?

1500
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:08,740
Hang on.

1501
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:11,740
I don't even know my own, no, it's saint comics.

1502
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,740
I'm an idiot.

1503
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,740
Twitch.tv slash saint comics with an X is my Twitch.

1504
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:23,740
Everyone follow me over there and, um, watch me play some Mega Man if you want to.

1505
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,740
Yeah.

1506
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,740
Watch, watch him play Mega Man.

1507
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,740
Thank you.

1508
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:32,740
Uh, okay, that was the last voicemail.

1509
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:33,740
Good job.

1510
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:34,740
Thanks.

1511
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:40,740
And it's noon and I think that's good time for me to start getting ready to catch the

1512
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:45,740
train to go give my dad his, uh, Father's Day gummy cubes.

1513
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,740
They're not cubes.

1514
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,740
They're rectangular prisms.

1515
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,740
Oh, that thing you posted earlier.

1516
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,740
Yeah.

1517
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,740
Yeah.

1518
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:54,740
What did you think about those, by the way?

1519
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,740
Oh, they look good.

1520
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:56,740
They are good.

1521
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:57,740
They are pretty tasty.

1522
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,740
Um, they're quite chewy.

1523
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:03,740
I wish I could, I wish I could make them even denser.

1524
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,740
I wish I could make them, I feel like if I could reduce the water content even further,

1525
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:10,740
make them like really dense, they might be like chewy, like a now and later, which would

1526
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,740
be like, oh, beautiful.

1527
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,740
You made them from scratch.

1528
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,740
I did make, I did make them from scratch.

1529
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,740
Yeah.

1530
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,740
Wow.

1531
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:23,740
They are made of, um, they are made of, uh, corn, corn, corn fiber, gelatin and sugar.

1532
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:24,740
Wow.

1533
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,740
Oh, and some, and some acid.

1534
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,740
Yeah.

1535
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,740
And like, you know, flavors and stuff.

1536
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,740
Looks good.

1537
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:37,740
Anyway, I'm, yeah, I, that was like the first thing I talked about on the episode is how

1538
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:40,740
I've, I've mostly perfected a recipe for them.

1539
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,740
So when, um, so when no one else is on the podcast, you just talk to yourself?

1540
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,740
Yeah, that's the Bencast.

1541
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:49,740
I don't know.

1542
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:55,740
I've done like, I've done like three of them, maybe this might be, this might be the fourth,

1543
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:59,740
if you count, if you count it, even though you joined me halfway through.

1544
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,740
Yeah.

1545
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:01,740
So, so it depends how you count.

1546
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:05,740
I think I've done two that were like just me and nobody else.

1547
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:06,740
I see.

1548
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,740
Uh, it's a, yeah, it's dire.

1549
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,740
It's grim.

1550
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:11,740
Yeah.

1551
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,740
I could do, I could do that because, you know, it would be really easy.

1552
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,740
I don't have to collaborate with anyone.

1553
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:19,740
I could just talk to myself, which is what I usually do anyway.

1554
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:25,740
It is, I can do it, but I usually run out of things to say, like within an hour or so.

1555
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:30,740
So they usually go shorter than a regular episode, obviously.

1556
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,740
That's still pretty long though.

1557
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,740
Yeah.

1558
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:34,740
Yeah.

1559
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:39,740
The, the, the voice, the voicemails are there to pad the runtime if necessary.

1560
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,740
Oh yeah, that's true.

1561
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,740
Okay.

1562
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:46,740
Uh, but yeah, I gotta, I gotta go and take a shower and then catch a train.

1563
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,740
So let's, uh, let's wrap this up.

1564
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,740
Do you want to say anything before we conclude?

1565
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:56,740
Uh, yeah, by the, um, by the tails gets told volume one and two.

1566
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:01,740
Definitely by volume two and probably by one.

1567
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,740
Why not?

1568
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,740
Why not also by one and also while you're at it?

1569
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:09,740
We'll put a, we'll put a link in the description to the tail gets rolled store page, I guess,

1570
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:17,740
which links, which from there you can find links to the Amazon by pages or whatever.

1571
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:18,740
Yeah.

1572
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:24,740
And also, uh, follow the tails gets told Twitter for updates on the comic chapter 20 and 26

1573
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,740
will be there soon.

1574
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:29,740
I have a, I have a insane idea.

1575
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,740
What?

1576
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:31,740
Okay.

1577
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:34,740
You know, you know about affiliate links like Amazon affiliate links?

1578
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,740
Yeah.

1579
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:41,740
Could you, could you get an affiliate link for your own product?

1580
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,740
I have no idea, but that would be cool.

1581
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:48,740
Like what, like what if you, cause like affiliate links, like it gives like a percentage of

1582
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:52,740
the sale price to the person who link, use the affiliate link.

1583
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:58,740
So what if you got an affiliate link for your own books and then you use that affiliate

1584
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:03,740
link on, so would you get like an additional percentage of the sale?

1585
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:09,740
I have no idea or would it just like take the percentage of what I get and then give

1586
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,740
it to them, which was, which is also me.

1587
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,740
So it wouldn't change anything.

1588
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,740
Yeah.

1589
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,740
I don't know.

1590
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:16,740
Maybe.

1591
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:17,740
I don't know how it works.

1592
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:19,740
That's a, it might.

1593
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:20,740
Maybe all might work.

1594
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,740
Maybe I'll look into it, but I don't know.

1595
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:27,740
But yeah, honestly, I would be curious, I would be curious to know whether that would

1596
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:30,740
be, or if you find, if you find out, let me know.

1597
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,740
Yeah.

1598
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:32,740
Yeah, I will.

1599
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:37,740
And also follow the, follow the tails gets trolled Twitter to see updates on whenever

1600
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:41,740

01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:42,740

What?

1610
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:53,740
Nothing.

1611
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:58,740
I was going to say follow my main Twitter also since I don't have any followers.

1612
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,740
Chaff and Heimer.

1613
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,740
It's CC Chimer.

1614
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,740
CC Chimer.

1615
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,740
Yeah.

Is it not Chaff and Heimer?

1617
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:06,740
Am I crazy?

1618
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,740
It used to be that, but I changed it.

1619
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,740
Oh, okay.

1620
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:13,740
