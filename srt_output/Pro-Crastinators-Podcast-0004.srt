00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello and welcome to episode 4 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Happy to have you back with us again this week, and we are here once again to talk about something.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My name is Guy, the best guy ever, and I'm here with my panel of esteemed internet personalities.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Digi, who are you?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Digibro. I wear sunglasses at night.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Jesse Wood, who are you?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm Endless Jess. There's a horse in my house.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hippocrit.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm Hippocrit, and I make videos. No, I don't.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You do sometimes. I've seen them at Ben.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ben?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
SaintComics.com.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm really hungover.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He makes comics. Well, good man.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, now, moving on.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Today, we are talking about a topic that's near and dear to my heart.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, what we're discussing this week is when you're in the bathroom and you're taking a piss,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
it is completely appropriate to pull your pants down all the way exposing your ass to ease the stream of urine from your dick.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, I just sit down.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's what we're going into.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Whoa, does that happen?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's wrong.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's wrong.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's wrong.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But I wanted to talk about that.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, we'll save that for next week.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What we're actually talking about this week is too deep for you.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The concept of things being too deep for you, what it means, how it relates to art appreciation, how it relates to pretentiousness, all that shit.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And so, to start us off, I'm going to do what's becoming a tradition and read the Know Your Meme definition off it.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, wait, no, no.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Urban Dictionary definition.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, fuck.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't have that one open.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Three deep five me dogs.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's right.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So this is a timely topic because I think that everything is too deep for me.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Interesting.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, we really need to figure this out.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is a big problem.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is actually something that comes up with me a lot, but we'll talk about this later.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, so here.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you got the green on you before listening to this podcast, you should get two dank 420 you.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, I'm saying.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I do know what you're saying, dog.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Urban Dictionary definition of too deep for you.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When someone or something's artistic value goes beyond a person's perception, leaving that person lost and confused.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then on the flip side, this may be used to sound like a total douche-tard because you think you're better than everyone else, often used by hipsters.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean, it's been a long time since I've heard douche-tard.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, me too.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When you say something is too deep for you, you don't actually mean that it's too deep.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're saying it ironically to say that the thing thinks that it's deep.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, that is the ironic usage of the term.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a dismissive thing.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I've seen it in both ways, though.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Usually in lobby that fans of something.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Unfortunately, there's like half and half between people who are mocking the work by saying it's too deep for you and people who are mocking people who don't understand it by saying it's too deep for you.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But either way, I don't think it's usually that they actually think the work is too deep.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Right.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You know, even taking a step back from that, let's talk about what it even means to be too deep for someone.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What is depth of art and what is the correct versus wrong way to perceive something?

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Like Eva, right?

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Eva is the big anime thing people always bring up is being too deep for you.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Eva.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Evan Gellion.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What the fuck is Eva?

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I guess I called Eva so far.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I get shit constantly for saying Evan Gellion, but I haven't heard Eva yet.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Evan Gellion, the correct way to pronounce it.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In Ebon...

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ebon Gellion.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, no one fucking says that shit.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's gook shit.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, let's...

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In Fully Coolie, Meltos says that his dad wrote a whole book on the deep mysteries of Eva.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And that is one of the best dubs of all time.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I trust their judgment.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There's also a dub for the actual show in which they also say Evan Gellion.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They say Eva, they say Evan Gellion throughout the whole series.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But in the movie, they say Eva for some reason.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And then in the rebuilds, they go back to Eva.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, I don't know.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Anyway, the point is...

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just explained it to you, you dumb shit.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Gibbs Wright, who cares?

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The point is, why is that show called Too Deep for You?

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's got a lot of symbolism, right?

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And we can talk about what Anno himself says about the show.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But it's got all this symbolism.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's got all this weird imagery where it's that thing where you really have no idea what's going on.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's the episode where Shinji gets trapped in that two-dimensional angel or whatever.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And has this whole big crisis of what the fuck's going on.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nobody even knows.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And, you know, how do you properly appreciate something like that?

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is it an issue of...

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think the reason things like Eva are considered too deep is because some people see it and it's weird.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But they say that they get it, whether they do or not is irrelevant.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The fact that they say they understand it.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then a lot of other people say, I didn't get it.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This thing's too deep.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know, it just starts that sort of conversation.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If it was just weird and nobody got it, nobody would say it's too deep.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They just say it was weird, I think.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's true.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And Anno's been on record as saying all the Christian symbology he just put in there because he thought it looked cool.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So all that stuff, people...

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I feel like a lot of people roll that into their understanding of the work and what it means.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't think the symbolism is what gives Eva depth.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think it has played a depth.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
People drop that fucking quote out to try and dismiss Eva as not deep.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because, oh, Anno said that the religious community doesn't mean anything, so it's not deep.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But that's not even the fucking point of what makes it deep in the first place.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And everyone who says that it's not deep, I will take every goddamn one of you.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll remove your fucking skin from your bones.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will put your skin on my dick like a condom and rape your mother.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I couldn't agree with you more.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Fuckers.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I couldn't agree with you more.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Because, you know, whereas Eva is a show that sometimes, I guess, suffers, maybe is not the right word,

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but gets a slightly worse rap because it has something like that Christian symbolism

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that ultimately doesn't really mean as much as you might think it would by watching it,

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
that there's something on the other side, like High School of the Dead,

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that I think is a fantastic story and has fantastic character developments.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It gets shit on for the opposite reason, because it just shoves tits in your face the whole time.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I would argue that that only makes the show stronger for what it was going for

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and in no way detracts from the depth of the narrative and the characterization.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think what comes down to is that the depth of the piece of media or art in question

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is irrelevant compared to the fact that people are shallow.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And people like to say that they understand things sometimes

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
when they themselves are kind of concocting this meaning in their own heads.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, I think all meaning is, like, partially concocted in your own heads.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, totally.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like, there's no objective, like, deepness to anything.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's just what you can take out of it.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to cut to the heart here of, like, why this whole concept bothers me.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This too deep for you, right?

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Because on the one hand, I do think that a work can legitimately be too deep for you.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think that that makes you wrong or makes the work wrong.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It just means that it's too deep for you to comprehend.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Could you?

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Or even maybe deep isn't the right word.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Maybe it's just that it's too specific for you to understand.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Like, if I were to write a story that was full of references to my own life

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that don't make sense to anyone else, and then I posted it up and no one understood it,

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
then, like, it would be too deep for you.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But that depth has no meaning to you, so it doesn't matter for you that it's too deep for you.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right, and I feel like that's a lot of what comes up in, like, deep stories.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Because, like, ultimately, things that are deep, I feel like a lot of the time

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
what people are saying when they call it deep is, like, everything has the same underlying,

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
human experience, right, is ultimately at the root of pretty much every story ever told.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it's the way that that's masked or the way that that's communicated.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's where the complexity and, I guess, the depth comes in.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can watch the asterisk war sucks part four.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Winning depths about that concept.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But yeah, but what bothers me about this so much with the too deep for you thing

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
where people are, like, derisive of stuff for acting deep or whatever,

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm gonna pause at a question.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If Evangelion isn't deep, or whatever other show you think isn't deep

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
or is pretending to be deep or is pretentious, if that show's not deep, what show is deep?

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's a good question.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Can we ask this? What is actually deep?

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Can we each go around and say something that we think is deep?

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I think that doesn't be a good exercise.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think Ava is extremely deep.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Like, I think if we're talking about the complexity of the narrative,

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
the amount of, like, different things that everything means in the show,

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
like where, like, the number of meanings that each moment or action has

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
or that each character has, I think it goes about as deep as any anime has ever gone, for sure.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And also as deep as, like, most literature.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Like, what books are everyone reading that are so fucking deep,

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
unless it's fucking Ulysses, that Ava is just too deep for you, dog?

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right, right.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Like, what is it? Where's this deep media that's supposedly out there?

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know, I wish I had concocted a list of, like, things that popular media

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
or, like, the popular culture says is deep, just to go into it.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's not there, though.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because public perception is what, yeah, right, it's all, it's all a fugazi.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I mean, I think, go on, Hippo.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, I was gonna say, a lot of the time, like, things that are considered deep

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
are often also considered pretentious.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right, right.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So if you've got a list of, like, the most pretentious stuff

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
made by a dumbass, then you'd get all the deep shit.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If something is deep, but you don't understand the depth, then you have two choices.

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can admit that you are not smart enough or knowledgeable enough or whatever

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to grasp the depth, or you can deny that it's depth, that the thing is deep,

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and say that it's just fake deep, and call it, oh, it's just pretending, it's pretentious.

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And say that's the root of it, podcast solved.

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, on the other hand, though, I don't think that I don't believe in pretentiousness in media.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Of course, of course.

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like, because this argument does come up a lot where people say, like, how can a show be pretentious?

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I'm like, well, I do think that you can approach something with the mindset of,

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm gonna make this as deep as possible, and then, like, go out of your way to load it

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
with as much symbolism and as much shit as you want.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I don't know if I'd say that it absolutely isn't deep, but it's pretending to be, you know?

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I feel like you can kind of know it when you see it.

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When you see something that's really putting on airs.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, I think we know it when we see it.

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because we're smart.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Everyone else is wrong all the time.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's true.

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wait, Ben, I'm with you on this.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think Bioshock Infinite is a good example of being pretentious like that.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because it's got all these, like, like Matthew Matosis lays out.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm pretty much just gonna be paraphrasing him.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But, like, it presents all these things about racism and whatever, and time travel and whatever.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But it doesn't say anything about them.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It just, like, puts them out there and, like, uses them as elements in the story.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And everyone said, oh, advanced storytelling or whatever.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, something like, even something I watched just two days ago, I forget what,

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
erased this new anime this season, I think it does more interesting things with time travel already.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
In that it really does...

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think the race is pretentious as fuck.

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But we can talk about that on tomorrow's podcast.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, we'll do that tomorrow.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But, like, the way it's using it, whether you think it's succeeded or not,

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to me it seems like it's using it as a conduit to tell the story

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and has real ramifications on the characters.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And it's going to explore the way that they're reacting to it

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and, like, exploring the choices they made in their life.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And, you know, that's the vehicle to do that with.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And I think it's effective, but, you know, that's to be...

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I think that Bioshock Infinite is a pretty good thing to bring up

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
because it's very easy for us to say that we've seen these themes done better elsewhere

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and this is not as deep as it's pretending to be or presenting itself as.

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But I know people who are, like, more casual gamers who played Bioshock Infinite.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And when you first go to the city of Bioshock Infinite,

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
when the game starts and you see the city laid out before you

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and it's all beautiful and amazing,

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
that alone is deep and that alone gives the game its artistic merit, regardless of...

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Can art...

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I wouldn't say it's deep.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I would say it's impressive visuals are not deep in and of itself.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Even though I might not be impressed with the narrative of Bioshock Infinite,

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to the many people, I'm sure, who are impressed by it,

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
who am I to say that they are not valid.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's a great point because I have heard so many times people I've talked to

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
say that they absolutely love Bioshock Infinite.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I, myself, liked it.

255
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And the more I thought about it, the more I liked it less and less.

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I had read Homestuck beforehand.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And because I understood everything,

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I wasn't nearly as blown away by the things in the story

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and could focus more on the things that really didn't impress me.

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, let me talk about a thing that's funny about media.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If someone just drew a picture of that city,

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
there was no game, there was no anything, there was just a picture someone drew,

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and it was as good as how the city looks in the game,

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you'd probably be like, that's an 8 out of 10 drawing, that's great.

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But then in the context of the game, you end up liking it less

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
because of the other things that are related to it.

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But I do agree with Jesse that I think that that image of that city alone,

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
just walking out and seeing it does speak to the human experience,

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
because there's a reason, there's a mental reason

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that has to do with where you are in society and everything,

271
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that you would see that city and think that about it.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That it would take your breath away means that it captures some kind of

273
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
very deep-seated human emotion.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But when you then walk through that city,

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and it's just one long hallway until you get to a scripted sequence,

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
then it becomes a different thing.

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Where even though as great as the art design is,

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and as much as that by itself would be a 10 out of 10,

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
then to walk down what is a badly designed game,

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and then to come at it from the perspective of someone who cares about game design,

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
then you're like, okay, well this is a 1 out of 10 game now.

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And then you put the 10 out of 10 together,

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and you get this 5 that suddenly you're really sour towards.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But I do think that, I think pretentiousness in cases like this

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is really in the eye of the beholder, because we can't really say,

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A, we can't say what the creator wanted out of it,

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
like maybe in their minds, rather the people who made the game,

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
they weren't making something that special,

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
it was just a game they worked on out of their huge illustrious career.

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They had a bunch of cool ideas that they threw together,

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
it didn't necessarily come together perfectly,

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but they got all the ideas they wanted to share out there.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But see, what makes it pretentious to me are the attempts to do one thing,

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and like the putting on airs that you've achieved that goal,

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and then when you have failed in many other ways.

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Like for example, why the fuck is the mom like a ghost?

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because she's dead in this world and alive in another.

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Isn't that true of literally everyone in the multiverse?

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And like, why can Elizabeth only do these tiny little summoning things

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in these certain places when she has literally infinite control over the universe?

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I forgot about ghost mom, that's horrible.

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What you're talking about Nate is just plot holes.

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No, I think they're more than plot holes,

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I think these are specific misunderstandings of the mechanics of their own games.

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Those things necessarily imply if something's not deep though.

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right, those are failures.

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It shows me there's a misunderstanding of what they're trying to communicate,

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and that severely hampers my enjoyment.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't think it becomes pretentious until it's literally saying this is deep,

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and then that if there was a guy, if fucking Ken Levine or whoever came on,

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that's who made it, right?

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If Ken Levine came on screen afterwards and was like,

313
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
did you enjoy my masterpiece, you know?

314
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But I'm saying it feels wrong because he says it's a masterpiece

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and yet I see all these issues with it.

316
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But he doesn't say it's a masterpiece.

317
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If it was a 10 out of 10 perfect, if it was great,

318
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
well okay, if he doesn't say it's a masterpiece,

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm judging it by playing the game, and the game feels,

320
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean that's what pretentiousness is.

321
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It feels like it's better than it is.

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't think by playing the game you can only know how the game turned out,

323
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
but you can't know what their mindset was making it.

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm not judging them, I'm judging the piece of art,

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and the piece of art feels pretentious.

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But how can you say that pretentious without knowing the mindset behind it?

327
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Pretentious is, I'm saying pretentious is now an emotion that you feel.

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's not a property that the game has or that the developer has,

329
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
it's something that you feel the game is.

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I think it's similar to good or bad game.

331
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like yes, you have to interpret it and decide how it makes you feel,

332
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
whether it's pretentious or not,

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
but I do think there are some standards that pretty much most people can agree on.

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't agree. I don't agree.

335
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't think that whether something is pretentious or not can come.

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I think when you say something's pretentious,

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you're saying something about the work and about the person that made it.

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, I think that's why the word pretentious itself is dangerous,

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
because it's literally saying that it's pretending,

340
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it's implying action on their part.

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't understand, you guys really don't think that the work by itself

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
implies that you think it has to involve the creator directly?

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think you can say...

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know, maybe you can imagine some scenario.

345
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm not saying that it's necessarily untrue that the work thinks

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or that the creators think that it's better than it is,

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but I don't think that you can make that assumption about it.

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think it could just as easily have been

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that they had a lot of good ideas and a lot of bad ideas

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and putting them next to each other made it look like they thought it was amazing.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's kind of like if I made a video where I make some incredible point

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
at one point in the video and then at some other point,

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I make a terrible point that kind of shits on the other one,

354
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and it sounds like I'm trying to make myself sound really smart,

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
but I don't know what I'm talking about,

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
when it could just as easily be true that I just threw out all the ideas I had

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and I knew some were good, I knew some were bad,

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and I just threw them all out there.

359
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
To me, it seems like if you had something like, let's say,

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
like Romeo and Juliet, to me, is pretentious only in a certain sense,

361
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
that it acts like at the end.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a big monologue about how the star-crossed lovers,

363
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
there's nothing that could have been done,

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and yet the events of the story are these really hammy,

365
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
like, oh, he woke up, killed himself, oh, she woke up, killed herself.

366
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's anime coincidences are what drive the plot of Romeo and Juliet

367
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
in the latter portion.

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, yeah, that's why they were star-crossed,

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
because fate conspired to cause their downfall.

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay, but I don't believe in fate, so I guess that story just doesn't appeal to me.

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But when you see something like that,

372
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
if someone tells a big romantic story,

373
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and let's just say at the end they do a thing like,

374
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
oh, and love, this was the greatest,

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
they do a big, small-ending, celebrating itself.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was about to bring up interest-seller.

377
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Interstellar is a great example.

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I haven't actually seen it, but I know it has all these weird messages about love.

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It does.

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
An interstellar would be a great pick for talking about this, though,

381
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but I don't think interstellar is pretentious.

382
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I would use the word misguided.

383
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The script is bad, it has a lot of plot holes,

384
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
it doesn't make a lot of sense,

385
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it has some amazing scenes in it,

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
it has some amazing cinematography,

387
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but the parts where they talk about love being the defining force of the galaxy,

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't think the movie is pretending that it knows more than it does.

389
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I just think it's incorrect.

390
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I think there's a difference between being pretentious and just being wrong.

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No, that's true, it doesn't necessarily make it pretentious, that's true,

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
but I'm just saying sometimes I think you can tell.

393
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The word pretentious is just overused.

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's certainly true.

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Let me propose an example of something that I think maybe actually is pretentious.

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay, cool.

397
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
When I was younger, I listened to Dream Theater,

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and they had an album called Metropolis Part 2, and I really liked it,

399
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and I still think it's kind of good in some ways.

400
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
However, it always irked me about it,

401
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
because in the story of the album,

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
the guy discovers that he is a reincarnation of this person who was murdered

403
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and her murder was never solved, and he's got to go and fucking solve her murder.

404
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So you're saying he's a trans woman?

405
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He used to be a woman, I was a man, okay.

406
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And one of the songs in it is him sort of like opining and reflecting on the fact

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that now that he knows that he is a reincarnated person,

408
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
he knows that death isn't the end, and he doesn't have to fear death anymore.

409
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay.

410
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And that's cool.

411
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
However, it's just a fucking fantasy construct in the story that happens.

412
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I, the viewer, I haven't actually learned anything.

413
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The story of the album has not actually showed me anything about the nature of life and death,

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
so it feels really cheap when this character can say,

415
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
oh, now I don't have to worry about death.

416
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I can say, yeah, good for you, but you're living in the world of this album,

417
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
in this fantasy story, what about me?

418
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't get it.

419
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And you know, that reminds me so much.

420
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I think if I'm presenting that, I think that...

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I really need to piggyback on your story, Ben,

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
because, you know, that, again, I think that you could just as easily say that the story is just bad and misguided,

423
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
not necessarily that it's pretentious, however...

424
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It seems like it thinks it's saying something about life and death,

425
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
but it hasn't actually said anything about it.

426
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let me tell you a little anecdote about Dream Theater.

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was listening to them back when I was like 15 or so,

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
pretty much just the album Train of Thought, which came right after Metropolis Part 2,

429
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but I read an interview in a magazine called Revolver with them.

430
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It was just like a one-page thing, and the interviewer asked them something to the effect of,

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
why do you guys think you're not more popular than you are or something like that?

432
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
One of the members literally said...

433
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He said, there's bands like...

434
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He named these by name.

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He said there's bands like Mastodon, Tool, and the Mars Volta,

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
who are kind of like us, but not as good, and they're more popular.

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So it's kind of like people like stuff that's less good

438
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and people don't like us because we're too good.

439
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He cracked the code.

440
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
For the record, for me at the time, my three favorite bands were Mastodon, Tool, and the Mars Volta.

441
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I just read this like, wow, this is what pretentious actually means.

442
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
How does this feel, Digi, to not like things that are good, to only like the bad things?

443
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You've become Anthony Fantano in the past.

444
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's like that episode of a regular show where they become so smart that no one could understand them.

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's like dream readers like that, that they become so good that nobody likes them.

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I feel like, well, that's the thing though, right?

447
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because what too deep for you is...

448
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, that's exactly what this is talking about.

449
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Right, what too deep for you is when you make something that's just too much

450
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and people can't quite wrap their head around it.

451
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But I think that when it becomes pretentious is when the creator is saying,

452
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
oh, you're just idiots.

453
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You don't get it because you're not smart enough.

454
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's like, well, we don't get it because we're not you

455
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
or we don't necessarily have the same life experiences required to understand it.

456
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If any creator puts in stuff like that that no one could understand because it's from their life

457
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and expects the audience to get that from just a viewing, that's pretentious, no doubt about it.

458
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, that's basically Horst You Finale.

459
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
True, but I think, well, I guess we aren't really the right judges,

460
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but we could tell what was going on, probably because we know you so well by this point.

461
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't know if anyone else was...

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I have no idea what the general audience, what it was like for an average audience member to watch Horst You Finale.

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No fucking idea. It was probably brutal.

464
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I am a very big fan of Horst You Finale and I am not unwilling to call it pretentious.

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Well, I've seen a lot of people take a lot of things out of it.

466
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
In terms of positive feedback, some people have taken stuff out of it that I didn't necessarily intend,

467
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
but that I'm okay with them taking out of it.

468
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And some people have come closer than others to...

469
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm not going to say that you don't get it because everybody gets it to a degree, I think.

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't call it pretentious.

471
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I feel like there's parts of it that I don't get.

472
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Not so much about the finale, but the Horst You Saga in general.

473
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I think there are parts of it that I don't quite see the way that you...

474
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:51,000
For a long time, I've kind of dreaded people asking me to articulate it or explain it

475
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
because I feel like if...

476
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't think that's your job anyway.

477
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, it's not my job for one thing.

478
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And if artists knew how to communicate verbally, we wouldn't be artists in the first place.

479
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you. That's a good point.

480
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Man, that's something that I've been trying to make the point of.

481
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's what I talked about in my Hideyakeyano video.

482
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah, exactly. Hideyakeyano is what I always think about when I have worked on that.

483
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Have I ever told you guys that I always wanted to communicate how much I love Gern Langen

484
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and I really think that this video was my best possible way of making those points?

485
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That's kind of a big part of why we all do what we do.

486
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Right. I mean, that's how I kind of justify what I do

487
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because there's a lot of times where I feel like this author surely understands the work himself

488
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and could explain it except that he already did try to explain it.

489
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, with the work itself. The work is the explanation.

490
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I think the problem with everyone trying to seek answers from Hideyakeyano about what Eva means

491
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
is that I don't think he could do any better of a job than he did in the show.

492
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
He made the show to express these ideas.

493
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't think he's necessarily capable of expressing them a different way.

494
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That reminds me.

495
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I can do it a different way because I don't make Evangelion.

496
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's not what I do. I look at other people's work.

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I interpret it for myself and try to help other people to understand my interpretation

498
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and maybe find some grounds for their own, but I couldn't make Eva

499
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and I don't think Anno could make my Eva videos.

500
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Probably true.

501
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't think he could necessarily explain why the shot compositions are all so good

502
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
or why the character arcs are so good.

503
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I agree. I used to read about great works of art of whatever form.

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He did this. He uses this technique. He does that thing.

505
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I was like, wow, you've got to know all these techniques to be a great artist,

506
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
but that's not true.

507
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
In a lot of cases, those techniques just come about naturally

508
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
from following your artistic inclinations and just doing what feels right.

509
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm going to almost reverse-engineer it with my videos

510
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
because I haven't studied any of this from school.

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I watch a lot of shows and then I go, huh, well, the way that shot was animated

512
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
made it have a lot of impact.

513
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
In the case of animation, I feel like they've probably kept going to school for it

514
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and they understand it.

515
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Hideaki Anno never opened up a textbook and read a chapter on how to compose

516
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
some fucking iconic scene or whatever.

517
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Or some technique about structuring an episode in such and such way,

518
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the one where it cuts away from the battle and then you see the aftermath.

519
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No one taught him that.

520
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
They don't teach that stuff.

521
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
My brother Victor is in film school and he's watched all of every frame of paintings videos

522
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and he's like, why isn't this taught in school?

523
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Because we don't learn any of this.

524
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We should be learning.

525
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
My point is that that's not the kind of thing you can teach.

526
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That's the kind of thing that has to be generated creatively.

527
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That's true.

528
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But what do they teach?

529
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
What is the focus on in such things?

530
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I haven't taken the classes.

531
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
This is a 4x 720 camera lens and it goes on.

532
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
They teach you more like how to get into the industry.

533
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Do you need four years of that?

534
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You've got to remember that most of the people making movies are making shitty movies.

535
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's true.

536
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
All of them have been through college.

537
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
All of them have taken the classes, but most of them are still garbage.

538
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's almost like there's something more important than that.

539
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Weird.

540
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Weird.

541
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's almost like creative spark is what matters the most and understanding having inspiration

542
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and being able to translate it into a medium that people can appreciate.

543
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Do you say something?

544
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I was going to say, if we're talking about the communication abilities,

545
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
it's pretty obvious from my own podcasting prowess that I'm not very good at speaking

546
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
to communicate my ideas.

547
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
If it comes out at all, it's from the weird videos that I make and the comedy videos.

548
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Which we all love.

549
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't think I'd ever be able to get anything across through speaking and writing as much

550
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
as I would through my stupid jokes.

551
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
By the way, guys, Hippo is currently freezing his ass off in his retarded ass apartment that

552
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
has no heat right now.

553
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
He's a real trooper for being here with us.

554
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Are you going to give me a round of applause?

555
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You do sound like you're in Russia right now.

556
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah, you sound really cold.

557
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You deserve credit for doing it anyway.

558
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Okay, I don't think that was important, but thanks.

559
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I want to say that this topic reminds me of one that Mr. B-Tongue video where he talks about art in other words.

560
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I don't remember that one.

561
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
There are no other words.

562
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
If you try to explain a work of art, you're reducing it.

563
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What Digi was saying, the art itself is the explanation.

564
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Which also reminds me of a quote.

565
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm probably going to butcher it, but it's something like, writing about music is like dancing about architecture.

566
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, that's a good one.

567
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There are no other words.

568
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
What's great about that, the funny thing is you brought that quote up.

569
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I've often heard that people use that quote to say, like, don't write about music.

570
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And people rebel against that.

571
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
People hate that term.

572
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
People hate that phrase, rather, because they see it as like,

573
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
oh, you're trying to, because my initial response when I heard that was,

574
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
well, I'd love to see a fucking dance about architecture.

575
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I was just going to say that.

576
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like, I don't disagree with what he's saying.

577
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I just think that it's not necessarily an indictment of the practice I think.

578
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Right, right.

579
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know, I want to ask you guys, what?

580
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Dancing about architecture.

581
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I love the idea.

582
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I love the idea.

583
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Fucking awesome.

584
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I imagine it would be done to an Autecher song, and they have like,

585
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
you know, the guy who created Gundam, Yoshiyuki Tomino,

586
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
his daughter does like interpretive dance and teaches it.

587
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And if you watch the most recent Gundam show,

588
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Recon Gesta NG, the most recent one that he directed,

589
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
which is fucking insanity, the whole show,

590
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
there's like all the eye catches are like the characters dancing,

591
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
like doing interpretive dance,

592
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and his daughter actually choreographed them.

593
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Hey, that's pretty tight.

594
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's pretty cool.

595
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That was a random fact.

596
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I want to ask you guys now, did you change topic?

597
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I like that.

598
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
No, that's cool.

599
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Although Gundam Reco G Reco is perfect for this,

600
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
because that is the most too deep for you.

601
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Really?

602
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
No one understands it, literally no one,

603
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
because there's so much random weird symbolism that makes no sense,

604
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and like random moments of just insanity that no one gets to show.

605
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And Tomino himself like later admitted that he completely failed.

606
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He was like, yeah, he was like, I don't know why I thought this would work,

607
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
or why I thought this was a good idea.

608
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Something like this, is it in fact a case that it was in fact not too deep for you,

609
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
was simply bad?

610
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I think it was, I think it was both.

611
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The show's not necessarily like all bad,

612
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but like it's very clear that Tomino,

613
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that all of the things in the show meant something to him.

614
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's just that what that meaning is,

615
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
is not something that most people can grasp.

616
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You know what it really is at that point?

617
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's at that point you have to like struggle with something like that,

618
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I mean how willing are you to do the research,

619
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
to like do whatever is required to figure out what everything means,

620
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
versus just watch it and then move on with your life.

621
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And like I get it on some level because I have seen a lot of Tomino's stuff,

622
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and all of it, there's like a general theme of his work is chaos.

623
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like he presents war and the scenarios of war as this chaotic, insane thing.

624
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Like when you watch, like there's a movie called Gundam F91,

625
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
which is like pretty standalone in the continuity,

626
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and like the first 30 minutes of it are just like trying to show you how chaotic war is,

627
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and it completely like works and makes sense,

628
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
because it's really well produced,

629
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and clearly there were people who knew what they were doing working on it.

630
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You know it has like cool ideas,

631
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
but then like he'll do the same thing in another show,

632
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
but it doesn't, you don't get that it's about chaos,

633
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
it just is chaos, so you don't know what it's about.

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah, you know the thing is, I feel like the term is probably applied most

635
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
by the people who like take the time least to understand whatever it is they're talking about,

636
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and like they're obviously not qualified to make such a judgment,

637
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and yet that's kind of what sticks with things,

638
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
like you're saying with this war shit.

639
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
A lot of people are downright anti-intellectual about art.

640
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's right.

641
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
People hate when you say that art is deep.

642
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
They're like oh it's all just supposed to be fun,

643
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
games are just fun, games are only allowed to be fun.

644
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Maybe we should talk about, they don't need depth.

645
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We should probably talk about the stigma there.

646
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Why is it people are so uncomfortable with things being outside of their grasp?

647
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Is it just they're offended by the idea that they aren't on, you know,

648
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
able to appreciate it?

649
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Is that just offend them, and they have this reaction?

650
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think it's intellectual cowardice.

651
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Personally a lot of things I find are too deep for me,

652
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
but I enjoy trying to figure them out anyway,

653
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
so I think the reason a lot of people might hate the idea of things being intellectual

654
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
is because generally very intellectual people are snobbish.

655
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There's some sort of like I'm better than you,

657
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
sort of trying to fight against that.

658
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
A deep work of art makes you work to understand it,

659
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
so it's asking more of the viewer,

660
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and it's also kind of, well it means that you can either work harder to understand it,

661
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
or you can just like be, I don't know, smarter or whatever you want to call it.

662
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So it's like if you're not smart enough to appreciate it, it's kind of an insult?

663
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, people are saying like, oh are you saying I'm dumb?

664
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I think the best resistance I would have against that,

665
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and I would just say, I'm not telling you you have to care.

666
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
There's a sort of mentality in pop media where people think that everyone has to like everything,

667
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and everything has to be for everyone,

668
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and it shouldn't be.

669
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I would like it much more if things were not made for everyone.

670
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Like look at the AAA gaming scene, it caters to like the mass majority,

671
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and as a result games are worse, they're more homogenous.

672
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's not as interesting.

673
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I mean it's a thing, it's a matter of, I think that there's,

674
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I like using the terms broad and niche,

675
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
where a broad piece of entertainment is made to appeal to as many people as possible,

676
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but it will only appeal to them on a very shallow level.

677
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Whereas when you make something niche that appeals to just like five people,

678
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
but to those people it like means everything in the world.

679
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, once more valuable you have to ask.

680
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Right, so I mean I appreciate why broad media exists,

681
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and it can be a great way to get people into media in general,

682
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and help them to develop like the lexicon of whatever media they're looking at.

683
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If you go out to see a film, because everyone's talking about it, it appeals to everyone,

684
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and then you learn how to appreciate film,

685
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
then you can go deeper and find the stuff that just appeals to you.

686
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But like, I think people shame niche media for not being for them,

687
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and it's like, not everything has to be about you dude,

688
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
like everyone can like their own shit.

689
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Most of my favorite things are things that are not very widely appreciated,

690
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
but they mean a lot to me.

691
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And I'm not saying anyone's stupid for not liking stuff I like.

693
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I think that most people are just evil.

694
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I would use the word lazy, I think in this case.

695
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Evil, stupid, and lazy.

696
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is there a difference between evil and lazy?

697
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You know?

698
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I don't know.

699
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Well I think any of those three things, evil, stupid, and lazy,

700
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
can become each other by being to a great enough degree.

701
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's true, that's certainly true.

702
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah, let me interject the second.

703
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I think that a lot of people, when they say that something's deep,

704
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I mean, we're talking about depth,

705
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and I think when we say that, we mean that a thing is thematically rich

706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and complex and robust.

707
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I think what a lot of people think that the word means

708
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
is that it tackles a like very significant theme,

709
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
like some like heavy theme, like I don't know, God or whatever.

710
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I don't know if people would assume that.

711
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
No, I think you're right, because there's a lot of people who,

712
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
a lot of the people who get mad at me for liking stuff like K-On,

713
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
people will say it's just shallow, it's not deep,

714
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and K-On has a lot of depth of characterization

715
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and a lot of depth of showing you the human experience.

716
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It tells you something about what people are and what we care about,

717
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
but yeah, I think most people, when they think depth,

718
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
are definitely thinking it should teach us something about world religion

719
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or psychology or child beating.

720
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's part of the misunderstanding of Eva.

721
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
People think that it's deep because of all the Christian whatever,

722
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and then when they find out that stuff is not really that meaningful,

723
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
they say, oh, well, it wasn't deep after all,

724
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
but really that's not where the depth is.

725
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
The depth into Shiji's character and the way he grows and the whole,

726
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
yeah, all that shit, yeah.

727
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That's interesting.

728
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And also I think if a thing tries to tackle some,

729
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I don't know, quote unquote deep philosophical topic,

730
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
like the nature of reality or something,

731
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
like say, I don't know, kind of like...

732
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Charlie Kaufman shit or...

733
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah, or something like that.

734
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And they, and it fails.

735
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Then I think that that's more, that's worse in a way,

736
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and it looks worse than trying to tackle something more humble,

737
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
like, you know, high school girls' relationships like K-On does.

738
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And so I think it's more prone to people seeing it,

739
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
being unimpressed with like what's being said,

740
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and being like, it's pretending to be deep, but it's not.

741
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Basically people are focusing on the wrong thing

742
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
when they're checking for the too deep for you stat.

743
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Like people aren't going to call K-On,

744
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
even if K-On was a shit show,

745
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
people wouldn't call it too deep for you, ironically.

746
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They wouldn't say it was pretentious

747
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
because they didn't think that it was trying to be deep,

748
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because in their mind, deep means like, you know,

749
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
heady philosophical or whatever.

750
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's not deep if a child doesn't get beaten.

751
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Right. If K-On, for example, like put in a thing

752
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that was like, this is the definitive analysis

753
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
of high school girl relationships,

754
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and then failed, like that would make it pretentious,

755
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that would make it, you know,

756
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
if it did something like, if it makes some great claim about truth

757
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and then fails, that's what I see.

758
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Well, okay, let me, I want to move on to another topic here, guys.

759
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I want to ask, what do you do

760
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
when you encounter something that is too deep for you,

761
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
what that process is like for you?

762
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I think I probably know. Never happens.

763
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Never happens. Of course it never happens.

764
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I watched Eraserhead not too long ago.

765
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Too cultured.

766
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And my first thought upon seeing was like,

767
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
okay, this is super pretentious.

768
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I mean, I just don't get it, but everyone loves it,

769
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
so I'll give the benefit of that out

770
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and try to figure out what's going on here.

771
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And the cool, I mean, that is completely off the wall.

772
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
There's these ridiculous things happening all the time.

773
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But when you step back and you look at it

774
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and you think about, I mean, I had to look all this shit up.

775
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I didn't figure it out. But everything that's happening

776
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
really does make sense.

777
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And it's perfectly parsable once you know

778
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
like the symbolism and you are able to understand

779
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
what's going on.

780
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I also, I watched Eraserhead a couple years ago

781
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
on YouTube.

782
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, it was the kind of thing where like,

783
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I enjoyed the overall experience

784
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and I got like vaguely what it was about.

785
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Like, obviously it's about

786
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
dealing with relationships and childbirth.

787
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Like, it's about this awkward guy,

788
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
he hooks up with this girl

789
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and everything's super fucking weird and awkward.

790
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And like, you can easily look at it

791
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
and say like, well, it's all just,

792
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
this is just normal shit, but it's weird.

793
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And it's like, yeah, but the point is that

794
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
it's how you're perceiving it.

795
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That's what art is, it's taking something

796
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and explaining it in a different way.

797
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He's explaining his anxiety by way of

798
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
constant fucking metal noises

799
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
in the background and like,

800
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
weird architecture and shit.

801
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And by having the baby

802
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
be a literal monster.

803
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And it's like, if you look at it, you go like,

804
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
what does this mean? And it's like, it probably means

805
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
that babies are fucking monsters,

806
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
you know, it probably means that the idea of

807
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
childbirth sickens and disturbs this man

808
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and the way he still is, and he still

809
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
kind of likes it, like he's got those warm

810
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
feelings for it sometimes. Oh, it's good stuff.

811
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's good stuff, I like it. And that's what, I mean,

812
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that's exactly what the director has said

813
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
that he was going through at the time. He was

814
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
paranoid about having a kid, you know,

815
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and that movie reflected his paranoia.

816
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It all makes perfect sense if you just look into

817
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it a little bit. And so for that reason, like,

818
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
one person's definitely going to call that too deep

819
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
for you, but I think a more

820
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
informed person

821
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
would say no, it's, I get it.

822
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'd like us each to tell

823
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
a story about this, so Hippo, I want to hear you

824
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
tell a, well, you can say what you were going to say

825
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
first, but. Well, I was just going to say

826
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
there's, I think there's like a difference between

827
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
getting

828
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
like a piece of media and understanding

829
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
the depths, because

830
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I, when I come across something

831
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
that I, turns out is too deep

832
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
for me, like Ava, I didn't understand

833
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
it a lot, but I still enjoyed it, and I

834
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
got it, but I couldn't ever tell anybody

835
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I couldn't, like

836
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
if somebody else did. Yeah, I couldn't

837
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
explain. I didn't know what

838
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'd liked about it, but I knew that I, you know, I

839
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
got it, kind of.

840
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And that's how it usually is

841
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
with, like,

842
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
like, say Gurren Lagann had

843
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
lots more, like, in

844
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
the subtext than I would ever

845
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
have thought about. Dude, nobody gets

846
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Gurren Lagann the first time they see it, nobody.

847
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And, and it's like, I really

848
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
liked it, I really liked it,

849
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but, like, you explaining it in your video

850
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
made it, like, extra cool.

851
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, I, and that's what I was hoping

852
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
to do, to just lay it on the line for people.

853
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So, yeah, so when, like, something's

854
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
too deep, it, as long as it's

855
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
got other elements to it, then

856
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
it's great.

857
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I think that experience you're describing happens

858
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
a lot, both with Ava and, especially

859
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
with the show Serial Experiments Lane,

860
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
which is an anime series that, like,

861
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
most people say that they have to watch it

862
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
four times before they, like, before it, like,

863
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
clicks with them. I've seen it twice enough, no idea

864
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
what's going on. It was funny, though, because, like,

865
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
you're halfway there. All right. It was one

866
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
of those things for me, because I watched it

867
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
for the first, like, all the way through for the first time

868
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
when I was 14, and, like,

869
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
everyone had said that it takes them four tries

870
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and they don't get it, and then I watched it, and I felt

871
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
like I got it, like, I was like, okay, I get the

872
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
point, I get what they're going for here, you know,

873
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
but, like, a lot of the specifics didn't

874
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
make sense to me, and then it was only,

875
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
like, you know, like, five years

876
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
later I watched it again, and I was like,

877
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I didn't get this before,

878
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
like, I thought I did, but I clearly

879
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
didn't, because I get it now,

880
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and what I feel now is totally

881
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
different from what I felt then, you know,

882
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and eventually I made a series of videos

883
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
about it, but, like,

884
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
yeah, you know, I think

885
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
that effort, that willingness

886
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
that you talked about, Hippo,

887
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I made a video about this called Art Is All

888
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
About Pressing Your Buttons, about, like,

889
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
why I will nit-pick

890
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
a show that I don't like so hard,

891
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
but with a show I do like,

892
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'll ignore so many of its flaws,

893
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and it's because, like,

894
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
well, there's, like, a give and take between you

895
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and the art, right, like,

896
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
a show that I can't stand is Ergo Proxy,

897
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
which is an anime series that's really,

898
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
it's super too deep

899
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
for you, you know, I've

900
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
literally called it Pretentious in the past,

901
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
that it was the only anime I was willing to call Pretentious,

902
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
because it does, it's, like,

903
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
way up its own ass with, like, symbolism

904
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and rhetoric and stuff that doesn't

905
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
really seem like it means much in the context

906
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
of the show, it just seems like it's there

907
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
for the sake of having depth, you know, having

908
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
deep shit, but, like, you know,

909
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I've had people tell me that

910
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Ergo Proxy, that there are meanings to it,

911
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
there's all this stuff that I didn't get,

912
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and it's, like, on the one hand,

913
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I don't disbelieve

914
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
those people, but I don't

915
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
want to find out, like,

916
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I hate the show, I don't want

917
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
to sit there and watch it again until I get it,

918
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
you know, like, I'm willing to accept

919
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
that maybe there is actual depth there

920
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
or that it makes sense if you think about it,

921
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
but, like, I don't want

922
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
to, whereas other shows, like,

923
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
it's kind of like, you know, a show

924
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that needs, like, a balance of shallowness

925
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and depth for it to be really good.

926
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I don't think it has to have shallowness, I just

927
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
think it has to press your buttons right, you know?

928
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Well, yeah, like, did you

929
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
say, like, he has to have some surface appeal?

930
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That's true.

931
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Did you not hold, like, his audience

932
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
hostage and say, like, you have to get this,

933
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and in the same respect, he doesn't, you know,

934
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
you shouldn't say did you have to get everything, too.

935
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah, like, Ergo Proxy,

936
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
a lot of people like the show because

937
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
it has, like, a really good atmosphere,

938
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
has beautiful artwork, you know,

939
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
like, interesting characters and stuff, so, like...

940
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And the best ending theme song in all of anime, baby!

941
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah, it's got a...

942
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Paranoid Android, dude. Yeah, Paranoid Android by

943
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I keep...

944
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
For both song and band,

945
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I was thinking OK Computer, which is the name

946
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
of the album, but, like,

947
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
yeah, Ergo Proxy has a lot of things

948
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
that will draw certain people in,

949
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and they certainly drew me in, but then there was

950
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
so much that I didn't like that in the end

951
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I didn't care about it, whereas there are shows

952
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
that, like, that I think have

953
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
very little surface appeal,

954
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
but I still like them,

955
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
like, a 12 ounce mouse, like,

956
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
which is just ugliest sin

957
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and weird

958
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and slow and

959
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
doesn't make any sense, but it does have,

960
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
like, a super deep metanarrative

961
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
behind it, like, if you watch the whole

962
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
show, you'll... I never saw that.

963
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
If you watch the whole show, you'll quickly grasp

964
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
that there's, like, a whole plot behind it,

965
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
like, it is actually a narrative show.

966
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It just doesn't make a lot of sense, and it was

967
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
unfinished, so, like, a lot of the answers

968
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
have never come out. Oh, no, the, like, 12 ounce mouse

969
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
doesn't have a surface appeal, because I

970
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
liked it immediately.

971
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Okay, but not everybody really. I would say

972
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
it has some surface appeal in that it has,

973
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
like, great voice acting, like,

974
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
phenomenal voice acting, and it's funny

975
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and weird, you know, but, like,

976
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't expect anyone

977
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
to look at that show

978
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and immediately be like, oh, yeah, I totally

979
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
want to find the hidden depth in fucking

980
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
12 ounce mouse, like, most people are going to look at it

981
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and go, what is that, you know? I kind of think

982
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
you might be driven to do that by,

983
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
just by how, like,

984
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
uncommonly terrible its presentation is.

985
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I think maybe the terribleness of

986
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
the presentation is part of the surface appeal.

987
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Well, sure, but that's kind of also a thing with,

988
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I don't know, like, what's that one, perfect

989
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
hair forever? It kind of reminds me of that,

990
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and I don't think there's a lot of depth and

991
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
perfect hair forever. No. I think it really is

992
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
just the surface stuff. Not quite the same.

993
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
No, I'm just saying that that can be a form

994
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
of appeal, is lack

995
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
of appeal, if you know what I'm saying.

996
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, I agree

997
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and I think that would be why some people

998
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
might get into perfect, I mean, like, even

999
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
without depth, like, sometimes people like

1000
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
shit just because it's so ugly

1001
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and out there, you know? Sure.

1002
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But, like, I would pause it,

1003
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
that, like, if I were to

1004
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
make, like, some just shitty,

1005
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
like, let's say, I've tried to make

1006
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Jesse Wood's horse shoe saga, but I had

1007
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
none of the talent.

1008
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Like, I'm just a weird, kind of ugly

1009
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
basement dweller

1010
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
who doesn't know how to film, whose audio is garbage.

1011
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Like, not garbage in a way

1012
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
that's, like, endearing, but garbage

1013
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
in a way that's too harsh for you to listen to.

1014
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I don't know which parts of that were about me

1015
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and which parts were about a guy with no talent.

1016
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
No, I'm saying, I'm saying

1017
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
this is a, this is an alternate universe

1018
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
version of you who has none of the things

1019
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
that you have going for you. Like, you know

1020
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
how to, you know how to make a great set,

1021
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
you have amazing charisma and camera

1022
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
presence, you know how to write a fucking

1023
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
type script. One piece of paper with a crayon word

1024
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
scrawled on it, taped to his bookshelf.

1025
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Ten out of ten. It's awesome.

1026
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It is awesome, I know, I totally agree.

1027
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Everything, everything feels right

1028
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
in a Jesse Wood video, you know, like

1029
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the audio is not necessarily perfect

1030
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
but it works and the

1031
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
video quality is not necessarily perfect

1032
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
but it works. He doesn't have to be fucking

1033
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
MKBHD for his videos to make sense,

1034
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
you know, but like,

1035
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
if I was making the same kind of story

1036
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and it was every bit

1037
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
as deep to me

1038
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
as the horseshoe saga, but

1039
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
the writing was like,

1040
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
do any of you guys watch that

1041
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
what's his name, Roger Vanderweed guy, that

1042
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Davoo is like a fan of? No.

1043
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Where his, his writing

1044
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
is like completely incomprehensible, even though

1045
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
like, the points he's making are

1046
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
great and make sense, but you have to

1047
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
parse this unbelievably difficult

1048
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
right, in fact he's a, he's basically

1049
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
who I'm talking about now that I think about it

1050
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
because his videos are like, weird,

1051
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
terrible, the audio is way too harsh,

1052
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
you can't understand what he's saying, the videos

1053
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
are like, ugly, weird flash animations

1054
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
of Sonic characters,

1055
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
he's talking about bullshit

1056
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and insanity, yeah, that guy.

1057
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The guy who does like Sonic Analyze

1058
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
with the two, with the two cartoon guys

1059
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
talking, oh it's so hideous, I hate it.

1060
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, and like, the presentation of them is

1061
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
so bad that I legit, I can't

1062
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
get into it, but like, Davoo

1063
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
like, has gotten into it

1064
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and he's even said, he was like, if I found him today

1065
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
with the standards I have now for like, presentation

1066
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
there's no way I'd get into it,

1067
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
but like, because I already am

1068
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
into it and I know like, what's going on

1069
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
in the narrative, then it's

1070
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
you know, he appreciates it

1071
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and like, if someone tried

1072
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to do the horseshoe saga with

1073
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
even less skills than Roger van der Weed

1074
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
then like, no one would

1075
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
watch it, you know, no one would

1076
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
appreciate it, but that doesn't mean it's not

1077
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
deep or that it's not good.

1078
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Not to criticize Jesse's presentation

1079
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
but I think that probably is

1080
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
at least some portion of that is why

1081
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
it hasn't reached as big an audience

1082
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
as you know, we all wish that it would.

1083
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I think at a certain point

1084
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
my continuity

1085
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
became too much

1086
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
for your average person.

1087
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, that's certainly true.

1088
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Like a lot of the horseshoe reviews

1089
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
if you were

1090
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
just going into them as single reviews

1091
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
would be fucking

1092
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
horrible to watch.

1093
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Well, I mean, the things would be confusing

1094
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
so some things certainly would be.

1095
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You know, when you launched Serialized

1096
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Victor, my brother

1097
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
was like, he was confused

1098
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
because he thought Man Child Incorporated

1099
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
when you put out the video that was announcing

1100
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
that Man Child Incorporated was now a thing

1101
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
he thought that was the endless jest channel

1102
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and that you just changed it again.

1103
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So he was like, he literally

1104
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
got mad after the first Serialized

1105
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and he was like, I don't see

1106
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
the point of it, he was like, who is this for?

1107
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And I said, well, it's for like

1108
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the Pony fans who've gone on and I was like

1109
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
it's a new series without the continuity

1110
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and he said, but Corona was right

1111
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
there in the first episode

1112
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
so this doesn't make any sense.

1113
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And I was like, well, I guess and then I

1114
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
explained to him that, well, it's not

1115
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
it's not Endless Jest, it's the Pony channel

1116
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that's transformed and so it's part

1117
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
of the same narrative in a way.

1118
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
They really are all interrelated though.

1119
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
That's like the best, I love that.

1120
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You can hear me in the background.

1121
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
No more continuity vows so many times

1122
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I know you have. You can't let go.

1123
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't think you should let it go though.

1124
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I don't think the problem with your show is

1125
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
well, let's separate, you know,

1126
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
as a piece of art, I do not want

1127
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Jesse to ever stop doing what he's doing

1128
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
but like for his own sake, it probably

1129
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
would be best. Well, I don't think it's

1130
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
my immediate thought when I started

1131
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Endless Jest was, okay,

1132
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
new beginning, it's new rules, I'm gonna

1133
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
all the stuff that I did, I'm gonna

1134
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
do it differently, no continuity,

1135
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
no reviews and now

1136
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
it's like six months later and

1137
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
now I'm just like, you know what,

1138
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
actually a lot of that stuff is pretty cool.

1139
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I gotta take

1140
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the stuff that I like about me

1141
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
discard the stuff that I don't like about me

1142
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
but still keep the cool stuff.

1143
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You know some of the things you like about yourself

1144
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
aren't necessarily marketable

1145
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and I think that's true of all of us.

1146
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I think we need a fucking sitcom about

1147
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Cold Corona. I would love

1148
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
a Cold Corona sitcom, that would be great.

1149
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Man, I have such plans

1150
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
in store for Cold Corona guys.

1151
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm excited.

1152
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The serialized saga is going to places

1153
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
that no one could anticipate.

1154
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That sounds amazing.

1155
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I think to get back to the whole

1156
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
art being about pressing your buttons

1157
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
shit like that. Here's the thing

1158
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
about Jesse's content.

1159
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Even a show like 12 oz mouse

1160
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
which has no obvious appeal, right?

1161
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
The reason people got into

1162
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
that show is that it was on television.

1163
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It was literally

1164
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
in a block where people were going

1165
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
to watch anyways.

1166
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So even if a hundred thousand people

1167
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
saw it and 99% of them

1168
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
didn't understand it at all,

1169
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
1,000 people are still there who are

1170
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
totally going to love it and get invested

1171
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
in the story and understand it in the long run.

1172
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I think the problem with trying to do this

1173
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
on YouTube is that there's no real

1174
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
platform by which

1175
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
it's one thing

1176
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
if I make a video saying

1177
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
hey you should all watch Jesse because

1178
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
he's basically just like me, then

1179
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
people who are looking for something just like me

1180
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
will go watch Jesse and they won't get it.

1181
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But like

1182
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
there's no like TV channel

1183
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
that is full of things that are kind

1184
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
of like Jesse that he can be

1185
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
broadcasted on and then people find out about it.

1186
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
What he needs really is just

1187
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
a foot in the door. All he needs is there

1188
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
to be one video that was

1189
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
attractive enough and got big enough

1190
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
that people get curious about it

1191
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and then they are along for the ride.

1192
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
The Batz video has over a million

1193
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
views now. 2 million

1194
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
2 million worthless views

1195
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
that haven't translated to anything.

1196
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The video was blocked for

1197
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
monetization within the first day.

1198
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I've seen no revenue from it

1199
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and nobody subscribed because

1200
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
you should have contested that

1201
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you'd have at least 2 grand by now.

1202
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You think that the people who like this,

1203
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
my little pony review would want to see more like it

1204
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
because there's plenty more like it.

1205
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And the worst part is that if I took down the Batz review

1206
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and reposted it, it wouldn't get views anymore.

1207
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
No, it's in the

1208
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
YouTube feed cycle somehow.

1209
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's due to the initial momentum

1210
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
from when it was released.

1211
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But anyways,

1212
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I forget it. No, go on, go on.

1213
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I think we're running low on

1214
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
stuff. Yeah, not to just talk

1215
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
about myself,

1216
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
which would be the most pretentious and too deep.

1217
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That'll be next week's topic, yeah.

1218
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Oh god, we could go on

1219
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
for fucking hours.

1220
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm surprised. I could go on for this topic

1221
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
for quite a bit longer.

1222
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I was talking like

1223
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
fucking a while ago

1224
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
when I first mentioned Horseshoe Finale

1225
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and how for a long time I wasn't sure

1226
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
how I could articulate it to people

1227
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
if anyone asked me. Right.

1228
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But I finally figured out, I finally got

1229
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
the sentence in my head

1230
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
that I can give to people now

1231
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
if they ever ask me what it's about.

1232
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The simplest way that I can explain it

1233
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
is that it's a retelling of a Christmas Carol.

1234
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I see. That's pretty good.

1235
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
What's a retelling of a Christmas Carol?

1236
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Horseshoe Finale, or the Horseshoe Saga.

1237
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It's a story about a guy

1238
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
who turns into this

1239
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
fucking big bastard

1240
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
but then he's confronted with his past

1241
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
and his decisions and where he is now

1242
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and he has to come out of it.

1243
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And that's the main thing.

1244
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I really don't understand the Horseshoe Saga, do I?

1245
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I think you did fine in the Horseshoe

1246
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Finale, explaining it as

1247
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
a wrestling narrative. I agree.

1248
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I think that, again, like the art

1249
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
is the explanation, but

1250
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I was saying that I was struggling for a long time

1251
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to come up with a sentence that I can throw at people.

1252
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You know what's an element? Yeah.

1253
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What did I call it in my video, the Top 10?

1254
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Like, just the biggest come ever?

1255
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Well, that's just going to be my

1256
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
go-to to throw at people

1257
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
if anyone asked me.

1258
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
The world's largest end zone dance after

1259
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
the world's largest end zone dance

1260
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
after the series of touchdowns that was

1261
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
the Horseshoe Saga. That's right.

1262
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's a disgustingly well-made MLP reviews, blah, blah, blah.

1263
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Does anybody else

1264
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
want to bring up an example

1265
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
of something that was too deep for them

1266
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
experience before we wrap

1267
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
things up? Because I know, did you mention that before?

1268
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You got a bunch of those. I forgot

1269
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
if you had one or not.

1270
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Oh, did you? Yeah, if you want to do one?

1271
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Well, I could, but I want to hear Jesse first, because we didn't get to him.

1272
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's true. Hippo did one, I think.

1273
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
There's one creator

1274
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
who I specifically view

1275
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
as a pretentious

1276
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
fucking knob-sucker,

1277
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and I hate all of his work.

1278
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Hey, hey.

1279
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Don't say that about Max Landis. He's a good man.

1280
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
He's the

1281
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
director, Lars van Trier.

1282
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Oh, yes.

1283
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I hate him. Somehow I should have known.

1284
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I've seen all of his movies.

1285
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Wow. When he releases a new movie,

1286
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I make a point to see it just so I can

1287
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
hate it.

1288
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Or just so that I can see how much

1289
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I hate it.

1290
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Fun fact, I only ever

1291
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
saw the first five minutes of Antichrist.

1292
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
My friends were watching it on Netflix,

1293
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and I looked at it and I went, this is fucking pretentious

1294
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and I left the room.

1295
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Okay, he makes like

1296
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
he makes exploitation movies.

1297
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That's what they are.

1298
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But rather than just

1299
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
say like a Quentin Tarantino

1300
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
would say, I make exploitation

1301
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
movies. Isn't it great?

1302
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
He's got to fucking put it in black and white

1303
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
piano music. He's got to make it three hours

1304
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
long and try to convince people

1305
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
that it's like the most mind-blowing

1306
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
complex thing ever

1307
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and people fall for it. This is the

1308
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
greatest director of all time. He's amazing

1309
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and it's just fucking schlock.

1310
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's just William Defoe's penis getting

1311
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
stabbed to the screw. It's just fucking

1312
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Mary Jane

1313
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
laying in a bathtub naked

1314
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
being depressed for four

1315
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
fucking hours.

1316
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh my god, I hate him. His movies

1317
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
are so fucking

1318
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
droll and boring. No, no, no.

1319
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Droll means interesting. Droll means cool.

1320
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Droll does not mean cool.

1321
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Droll means funny. We had this fight before

1322
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
me and Ben had a huge fight about it once.

1323
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Turns out I was right. Well, I guess, I guess

1324
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
droll is too deep for me.

1325
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Loveiest droll.

1326
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah.

1327
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Life is droll. That's what, what's her name?

1328
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Kill La Kill always says.

1329
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Kill La Kill is a thing

1330
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
that people, I think

1331
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
seem as like not deep.

1332
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1333
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It's legitimately too deep for most

1334
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
of the people who watch it. I walked away from Kill La Kill

1335
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
after seeing it, feeling like I had seen

1336
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
something that was very complex

1337
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and had a lot to say.

1338
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And then I go online and everyone's like

1339
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
not surprisingly

1340
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
but still

1341
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
disappointingly. There's a chart,

1342
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
dude. This made me so mad because

1343
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
there's this chart that's like an intro to

1344
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
anime, intro to recommendations

1345
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and the guy clearly

1346
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
knows his stuff in terms of what shows are good.

1347
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's a great recommendation chart

1348
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
but there's a part where it's in action shows

1349
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
and it's like, I think it goes to

1350
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Girl in the Gone or something that it's like, do you want this?

1351
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But with no depth, then it goes to Kill La Kill.

1352
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Get out of here.

1353
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Really? Dude, Kill La Kill

1354
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
and again, legit.

1355
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Too deep for everyone who watches it.

1356
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I know that the stuff that's in it

1357
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
is there on purpose because

1358
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I've heard the creators talk about it

1359
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
and I know their work and I know that they

1360
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
fucking know shit, you know.

1361
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's going back to people

1362
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
thinking that depth

1363
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
is equated to seriousness

1364
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
or like big world

1365
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
things. That's really weird to me.

1366
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Sorry, Ben. Go ahead.

1367
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I was just going to say that's really weird that people

1368
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
think that about Kill La Kill because when I watched it

1369
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I felt like it was really being

1370
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
shoved in my face that

1371
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
this is a subversion of typical

1372
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
anime nudity.

1373
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That's not even what I took out of the most

1374
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
impressive to me.

1375
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I think people

1376
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
probably write it off because of the

1377
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
nakedness and whatever and just the

1378
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
balls to the wall action and the scantily

1379
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
it's so clearly saying

1380
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
something about that stuff.

1381
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
When Episode 3

1382
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
rolled around and it was like Episode 3

1383
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
is literally just stating a message about

1384
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
the fact that she's trying to

1385
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
use nudity as power and the

1386
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
empowerment of being naked without shame

1387
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
like it's literally a conversation about

1388
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that and then like you know there's

1389
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
been a lot of debate over whether the way

1390
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
the show handles that is meaningful or not

1391
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
or if it's really, and like yeah that debate's

1392
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
fine but then when people like

1393
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and that is deep but there's like a lot

1394
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
more throughout the show you know and I

1395
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
appreciate not getting it because

1396
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
when I watched the show my impression

1397
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
was I feel like there's something here

1398
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm not getting and me and Nate did a podcast

1399
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
where me and Nate both said

1400
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
like there's definitely something here

1401
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
we're not getting because we were both confused

1402
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and I did no further research so at this

1403
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
point I still am happy to admit I do

1404
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
not fucking kill a kill. Whereas I

1405
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
then like you know read some

1406
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
shit that other people were saying about it

1407
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
and then went to this panel where this guy like broke

1408
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
it all down in like extensive detail and I'm like

1409
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
holy shit like yeah this all

1410
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
makes perfect sense and it

1411
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
all totally is intentional

1412
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and it's definitely super

1413
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
deep you know like this is some of the most

1414
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
interesting stuff that's happened in a TV

1415
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
series ever should remove yourselves

1416
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
from the mindset that something

1417
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
that's fun or sillier

1418
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
you know can't also be complex

1419
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
like another example

1420
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
is Space Dandy

1421
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
yeah I fucking

1422
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Space Dandy is an amazingly deep

1423
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
show all of Watanabe's show Cowboy Bebop

1424
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
you could say that about it's

1425
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
the fucking it's and everyone would say Bebop

1426
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
is deep and that's the thing though that's

1427
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
why everyone would say Bebop is deep because

1428
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Bebop has moments where

1429
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
the camera is so slowly and he looks

1430
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
at his eyes the one's different colors because

1431
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
it sees the future the other sees the past holy shit

1432
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
they eat the bell peppers

1433
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
without the beef it's bell peppers and beef without

1434
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the beef it's a deep

1435
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
poverty it sinks in you know when Fe and

1436
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the other girls leave and the eggs are in their bowl and they start

1437
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
eating those eggs instead of just their own

1438
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
hey that's my analysis I did that one

1439
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
that's a great scene

1440
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
holy shit I love that scene so much but

1441
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
yeah

1442
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
but yeah like Space Dandy is

1443
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
doing a lot of the same things just with

1444
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
different characters who aren't obviously

1445
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
like relatable

1446
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
and with a layer of more silliness and stuff

1447
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
which in no way detracts from the messages

1448
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
underneath at all it just yeah

1449
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
and I would also say that it's a matter of

1450
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
like Space Dandy starts on the wrong

1451
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
foot the first episode kind of sucks

1452
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
and the first episode of Cowboy Bebop is fucking amazing

1453
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
so people start up Cowboy Bebop

1454
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and they go this is gonna be

1455
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
the most mind-blowing shit I ever see

1456
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
in my life and they're proven right and

1457
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
people start Space Dandy and they go this just

1458
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
seems stupid and then you know seeing

1459
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
the trailers for Space Dandy

1460
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
and being really excited like wow this is

1461
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
a it's gonna be like a fun like a

1462
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
sci-fi throwback and like a flash

1463
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Gordon thing or a Star Trek

1464
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I watched the first episode and I just

1465
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
didn't care to watch anymore for like

1466
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
months huh yeah until I finally

1467
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
picked it back up and then cool shit

1468
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
started happening I mean I probably would

1469
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
have if not for the fact that

1470
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
it was a Watanabe show then I might

1471
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
not have watched all of it that was my

1472
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
whole reason to be interested and I still

1473
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
haven't watched it but I really need to

1474
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
but it definitely has

1475
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
depth as it goes along and I actually

1476
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
think that more people who watch all of

1477
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Space Dandy appreciate its depth

1478
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
possibly because so many fewer people

1479
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
have watched all of Space Dandy compared to

1480
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Kill La Kill but like I think

1481
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
it is that I don't even understand

1482
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
they seem both equally hyped to me

1483
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
well we're all over Space Dandy's dick

1484
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
when it was coming out a space

1485
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
a throwback before it was out

1486
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
yeah Space Dandy was very throwbacky

1487
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
it was very old school I heard about

1488
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Kill La Kill has tits everywhere

1489
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
that's the main reason that it's so

1490
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
popular is that it has fucking tits everywhere

1491
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
that's a lame reason it should be ashamed

1492
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
well they don't they don't shove in your

1493
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
face like a promo art I guess main characters

1494
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
and like everyone in the

1495
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
show like I think I think with Kill La

1496
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Kill it was a mixture of like

1497
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
being a good show and also

1498
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
being a show where there's tits

1499
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
everywhere because everyone likes

1500
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
shows where there's tits everywhere but no one wants

1501
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
to admit it and if the shows are

1502
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
usually bad so like

1503
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
you know like a school a show like

1504
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
high school DxD is really popular

1505
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
because it's just

1506
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
good enough that people can handle it

1507
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
but then everyone's apologizes

1508
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
for it nobody wants to admit it

1509
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
don't they know the literal best thing

1510
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
about that show is all the tits they shove

1511
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
in your face and especially how the main

1512
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
character is completely unashamed

1513
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
he just does not give a fuck and it is

1514
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
he's my favorite main character I've seen in 10 years

1515
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
he's amazing he's my hero

1516
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I think there's a lot of people who do apologize

1517
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
for their Kill La Kill affection

1518
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
and I see a lot of apologies for it

1519
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but I think there's also

1520
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
a lot more people who can

1521
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
watch it and not feel that they have to

1522
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
like they can say

1523
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
well it's really good and of course

1524
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
they'll explain it as

1525
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
oh it's just good you can

1526
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
turn your brain off sometimes

1527
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
it's gonna offend me more than language like that

1528
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
you know what it reminds me of

1529
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
MLP people are just like

1530
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
what even is this

1531
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
there's nothing good to it

1532
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
it's my little point there's no way it could be good

1533
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
they just write it off because of this superficial

1534
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
layer and do absolutely no research

1535
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
to find out whether or not that's even close to true

1536
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
or even worse they do research

1537
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
and come across the fandom

1538
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and that makes it even more

1539
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I think

1540
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I've said this before

1541
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
with ponies we used to say

1542
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
anytime we criticize the show

1543
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
people would always say it's a kids show

1544
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
and then we'd say why are you watching it

1545
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
if it's just a kids show

1546
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
that's not good why are you watching it

1547
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
because you shouldn't be

1548
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
if that's the case

1549
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
that's a good one

1550
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
so my extension

1551
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
of that to Too Deep For You

1552
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
is if people say like

1553
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
well sometimes you can just turn your brain off

1554
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and enjoy something and I would say

1555
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
oh my god

1556
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
if you just ignore

1557
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
the bad parts

1558
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and only talk about the good parts

1559
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
everything is a 10 out of 10

1560
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
guys it's okay

1561
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
you can watch anything it's all amazing

1562
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
he nailed it

1563
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
if you can

1564
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
if criticizing

1565
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
something is so wrong

1566
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
or if all

1567
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
art is just supposed to be fun

1568
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and it's not supposed to be deep

1569
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
there's a difference just watch everything

1570
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
it shouldn't matter anymore

1571
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
just go for it

1572
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and depth can come in so many different forms

1573
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
that it could just be

1574
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
even if the only reason you watch a show

1575
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
is that the character designs are good

1576
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
the fact that the character designs are good

1577
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
is kind of deep because

1578
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
why are they good

1579
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
what makes them good to you

1580
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
why does your brain interpret them that way

1581
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and complexity and artistic

1582
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
depth can come accidentally too

1583
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
it's been a while

1584
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
he literally

1585
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
just wanted people

1586
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
punching each other and going on adventures

1587
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
but he ended up making this

1588
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
all-encompassing

1589
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
this saga of this character's entire life

1590
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and his children

1591
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
and it's beautiful

1592
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
depth can totally be accidental

1593
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
and I think

1594
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
that it probably should be

1595
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
if you set out to make something deep

1596
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
you're probably not making the thing you're trying to make

1597
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
you're probably going to fail

1598
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I think you can

1599
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I don't think depth has to be

1600
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
incidental so much as that

1601
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
you can have an idea

1602
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
and know it's deep and make it

1603
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
obviously Undertale

1604
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Toby Fox knew it was deep

1605
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
there's no way he thought it was just

1606
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
some shallow

1607
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I just made this thing

1608
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
that comments on the nature of the medium

1609
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and has everything to do with everything

1610
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
people would think it was deep

1611
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
he knew it had

1612
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
qualities but didn't know

1613
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
wasn't prepared to say

1614
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I don't think that he set out

1615
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I think what Ben is really trying to say is

1616
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I don't think you should set out to make something deep

1617
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
but if the idea you have is deep

1618
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
then whatever

1619
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
run with it

1620
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
he surely knew it was deep

1621
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
but I don't think his goal was make a deep game

1622
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I agree with that

1623
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
well

1624
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
does anybody want to give any more examples

1625
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
to wrap it up to did Ben

1626
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
do you want to give an example of a thing

1627
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
no

1628
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
wait what about that comic I read recently

1629
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
that was really great

1630
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
the vapors

1631
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I don't know

1632
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
is that something that I can support on Patreon

1633
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
as a matter of fact

1634
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
it is Jesse

1635
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
just go to patreon.com

1636
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
throw a couple of bucks the creators way

1637
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
he's a real deep guy

1638
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I don't know about you guys but I'm going to go do that

1639
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
before this video ends

1640
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I got to run

1641
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
not walk to that Patreon page

1642
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I love

1643
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
to get back to the topic at hand

1644
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I run into stuff all the time

1645
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
that is like too deep for me

1646
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and

1647
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
it's always like that

1648
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
battle of like on the one hand

1649
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I really in fact I would say

1650
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
all video games are too deep for me

1651
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
all of them

1652
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
all video games

1653
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
because

1654
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
all video games

1655
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
you know what all of them

1656
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
most of the games I beat

1657
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
in the last 15 years

1658
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
were like

1659
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
6 hour action games

1660
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
games like Devil May Cry

1661
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
or fucking vanquish

1662
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
or platinum games and stuff like that

1663
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
but I always just played through them on normal mode

1664
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
in 6 hours

1665
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and then never again

1666
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
and like

1667
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
what do you do with those

1668
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I know that there's way more depth to those games

1669
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
if you replay them and get to the highest

1670
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
because most of those games like

1671
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
are made really with the highest difficulty in mind

1672
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
if you play something like

1673
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

1674
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
or Metal Gear Solid 3

1675
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
or any of the Metal Gear Solid games

1676
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
but like 3 most especially

1677
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
the level of complexity

1678
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and depth of high level play

1679
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
is so much different from low level play

1680
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
that's basically another game

1681
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
about what you can be forced to do

1682
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
by the difficulty increasing

1683
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
and how it makes you be creative and explore the game more

1684
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and I think that

1685
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
most mainstream

1686
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
critics of games engage

1687
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
about 50% of the depth

1688
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
of the game

1689
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
maybe close to the 75%

1690
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
depending on the game

1691
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
that's the thing though

1692
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I think the reason that a game like Bioshock Infinite

1693
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
gets so much critical praise

1694
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
is that you don't have to play it again

1695
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
you appreciate the depth

1696
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
you do not have to play Bioshock Infinite twice

1697
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
at all

1698
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I played it on the highest difficulty

1699
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
because it's so fucking easy

1700
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
and the combat is so terrible

1701
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
that I played it on the highest difficulty

1702
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and fucking had a breeze with it

1703
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
and there was nothing else that I felt like I was missing

1704
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
there's little recursive hints

1705
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
like maybe you'll get a little more out of the story

1706
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
if you play it a second time

1707
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
but I don't think it's anywhere near the level

1708
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
of Metal Gear Solid 3

1709
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I think the systems of the game to play it on the highest difficulty

1710
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
compared to normal mode

1711
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
and that's why reviews are often times

1712
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
not really very great ways to judge

1713
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
the content of a game

1714
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
that's why you need someone like Super Bunnyhop

1715
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
who will beat that motherfucker up

1716
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
he will smash the pussy of that shit until it no longer works

1717
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
to tell you how it works

1718
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
it's interesting though

1719
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
that you bring that up

1720
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
that a game could be reviewed well

1721
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
because it is shallow enough

1722
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
to be easily died

1723
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
to the reviewing circle

1724
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
is what they're going to advocate for

1725
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
it plays well in the format that reviewers play

1726
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
which is usually

1727
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
at like a hotel somewhere

1728
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
because they've been invited to a review event

1729
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
or a fucking corporate event where they're surrounded by staffers

1730
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
telling them how to play the game

1731
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
and I love Bunnyhop

1732
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
especially because and I was saying this

1733
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
about the Fallout 4 review

1734
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
and we had a little debate about this

1735
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
maybe even in the best game ever podcast

1736
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
where I was saying how like

1737
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
this game is not that good

1738
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
right now

1739
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
the depth of this game will really be

1740
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
explored once people start modding it

1741
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
and turning it into something different

1742
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and then we'll suddenly have

1743
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
probably a much better game on our hands

1744
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
and I wish more reviewers

1745
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
would write like that

1746
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
would write like

1747
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
this review is based on

1748
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I played this many hours of the game

1749
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
this is how like all those fucking phantom pain reviews

1750
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
that gave the game a 10 out of 10

1751
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
and it's like did you really make it

1752
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
did you really play the fucking

1753
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
like what 90 hours it takes

1754
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
to beat this fucker

1755
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
because I don't think you did

1756
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I think you probably made it to the first ending

1757
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and went okay it was 10 out of 10

1758
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I didn't get bored with it because I only played it

1759
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
for fucking three days and I didn't realize how much

1760
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
like you know

1761
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
bullshit there is but then again

1762
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
if you do go beyond the impossible like Bunnyhop did

1763
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
beat it to 100% completion

1764
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and found all kinds of unique things

1765
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
that even people who played it

1766
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
to the end you know who people like you guys

1767
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
were just like oh fuck this game

1768
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
it sucks you know like

1769
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
he found all kinds of other shit

1770
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
to like about it and came out with the sort of

1771
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
you know and I'm not saying like reviewers

1772
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
shouldn't review games on that level of

1773
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
engagement because I think most people play games

1774
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
on that level of engagement

1775
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
games are too deep for most people

1776
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
most people won't go all the way through

1777
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
most people never see Ash Lake in Dark Souls

1778
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
in the same way we need

1779
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
different games for different people

1780
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
we kind of need different reviewers for different people

1781
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and that's why George Weidman is so valuable

1782
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
not only is he he's a real

1783
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
real modern journalist

1784
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
he does it the way that

1785
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
that technology allows it to be done now

1786
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
much better than

1787
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
going to one of these fucking events and like

1788
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
playing it for 10 hours or whatever

1789
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and like he plays it in the way that I play

1790
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
games personally in fact he goes beyond what I need

1791
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
but the thoroughness

1792
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
is so welcome and so rich

1793
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I would love it if every reviewer

1794
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
like if where they have all those stats

1795
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
on like game stuff or whatever

1796
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
game spot where they have like the little like

1797
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
notations on the side or if it said like

1798
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
how many hours I spent

1799
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
playing it how many

1800
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
you know like how many times I beat it

1801
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
what difficulty I beat it on because you know

1802
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
those are so important

1803
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
super relevant and I love Yahtzee

1804
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
who I respect him so much because

1805
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
he does that in all of his review he'll tell you

1806
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
like I only play games on medium

1807
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I expect them to be that I only play them

1808
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
for a week because I have to do a show

1809
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
you know like if I return to a game I'll probably

1810
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
talk about it on a different show not my review

1811
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
show he's admitted when he played

1812
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Final Fantasy 13 he was like this game's not for me

1813
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I played 10 hours and I'm fucking sick of it

1814
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm too busy

1815
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
half of his review was about how he was opening up the

1816
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
mana bar and therefore he couldn't

1817
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
find time to play the game you know because

1818
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
he didn't care about it like that says something

1819
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
about it yeah like that's and

1820
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
and like for me those reviews are

1821
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
perfect because that's how I play most games

1822
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
you know and I go okay Yahtzee I'm

1823
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I'm with you I also don't want to spend

1824
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
30 hours waiting for this game to get good

1825
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
you know but it doesn't get good after 30

1826
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
hours let's be clear but yeah

1827
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
but like you know

1828
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
for other people there are and

1829
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
and you know I think I think those reviews

1830
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
are out there they're just very decentralized

1831
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
right right game stop is not or game

1832
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
spot or whatever it's not the ones making

1833
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
those reviews if you go to like rpgamer

1834
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
or something you'll find the guy who writes

1835
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
that review you know I think I think it's

1836
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
just a matter of like people should go out

1837
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
and find the reviews that actually reflect

1838
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
the way they play games right right

1839
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
this is we've gotten off top we're completely

1840
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
my point is that video games are too deep

1841
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
for me because I never beat them to that level

1842
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
of completion right

1843
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
okay that's covers everybody we've all

1844
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
told the story that this was

1845
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
excellent discussion this was everything

1846
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I hoped it would be about the subject

1847
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
anybody have any any other last thoughts

1848
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
they want to put in

1849
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
my dick

1850
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I think we all were thinking

1851
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
that yeah the only one who said I mean

1852
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
let's let's be at the end of the day what's the thing

1853
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
that's too deep for anyone my dick

1854
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
way too fucking deep

1855
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
all right my dick runs deep

1856
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
so deep put her ass to sleep

1857
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
cutting off that blood flow in all the right

1858
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
ways all right guys
