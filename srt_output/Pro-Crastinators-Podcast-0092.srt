00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,240
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the PCP, an

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,800
internet show with internet boys on an internet sphere. Just being themselves, creating things,

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,640
and loving life. I'm the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Hippocrit.

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm embarrassed to be here. Excellent. Munchy wears tiny hats.

5
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm so, so sorry. Tom Oliver?

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,680
I, I got nothing, just go. How embarrassing. And Ben Saint.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Nothing, nothing wrong with that. Ben Saint famed for making the PCP late today.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The famous performance of that excellent live action play.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Yeah, I'm not the first, but I'll definitely be the last.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Ben Saint with this embarrassing track record.

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Everything that just happened was really embarrassing and I won.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Well, how great way to start us off. And let's check in, because the folks at home don't know what the fuck we're talking about.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,680
They don't even know the definition of the word embarrassment. So they've never heard this in their lives.

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I know that embarrasada in Spanish means pregnant. So let's just go with that. That'll be our working definition here.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Embra.

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Oh, right. Urban Dictionary, though, says embarrassment is the way people feel when they realize they've been spelling embarrassed wrong their whole lives.

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,680
How do you spell it? Put it on screen, actually.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,680
You spell it with two R's and two S's and two T's. And two E's and two I's.

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Oh, oh, actually. And two feet, two hands.

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Wait a minute. He felt embarrassment that he had been spelling embarrassed with only one R.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Obviously, he left an extremely interesting life. Wait, but embarrassment only has one R.

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Uh-oh.

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Like, on the screen before me, I'm looking at it.

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
What the fuck?

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Oh, it has two R's, right?

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm looking at it on Urban Dictionary as one.

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,680
They just misspelled it and got the wrong definition here. I'm going to save the fucking day.

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
No, no, look at this. Look at this.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
And save the podcast for you.

31
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Okay, seriously, I don't know. Edit this in or something. I think this should be there. Look at the thing here.

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,680
That has one fucking R, even though in the example, it has two, wait.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,680
The hashtag embarrassment has two R's, but the example there has one.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
The top thing has one.

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Top definition.

36
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
You spelled it wrong.

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Top definition.

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,680
And that's when it comes up, because you spelled it wrong.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Embarrassment.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:08,680
An extremely sucky feeling that happens to adolescence, much too often, where your cheeks get all red, red like links to a new page,

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:18,680
and you just, just links to a new page, want to curl up under a dark bed links to a new page for all of eternity and slash or die in a hole.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Oh, no, I get it. It gave me the shitty definition because I spelled it wrong.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
That's extremely embarrassing for you.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Oh, God.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,680
That's pretty great. That's pretty web 2.0. That's pretty advanced storytelling.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,680
These definitions have a real narrative arc to them.

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
They really do. They really do.

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,680
What are we going to do when the dot com bubble bursts and Urban Dictionary goes under and gets bought out by Al Gore and Hillary Clinton's, you know, Harpy's?

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,680
What are we going to do? Where are we going to get our top definitions from?

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Well, the currency of the world is going to shift to the dot com bubble when everyone's just going to trade porn all the time, and that's going to be the most lucrative.

51
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,680
The currency is going to shift to the dogecoin, the most premier currency on the base of the planet.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,680
The only altcoin that matters, the dogecoin.

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Let's get into the fucking episode, please.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah, please. Let's talk about embarrassment, guys. We, we, embarrassing, everything is humiliating and disgraceful.

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
What even is embarrassment? I don't know.

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
It's the worst.

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm going to personally destroy this topic and shift it not only to be embarrassment, but shame, because I think that's incredibly intro-ly.

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
They are definitely relating.

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
For sure.

60
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Sure thing in my mind.

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,680
And to start this episode off with a roaring start, a complete psychological thriller.

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm going to reveal a homesuck-esque tier plot twist reveal here.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:57,680
It may in fact rattle your cerebellum to discover art and PCB fans, but I was not always through a pollucid kosher display of an unadulterate esteem and respectable behavior.

64
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
You see towering before you today.

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Oh, no.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,680
In my young, informative years, a.k.a. yesterday, I was actually an extremely, easily embarrassed, anxiety suckling.

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,680
How did I make such a vivid transformation?

68
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm just going to wait for my arm retrieval-esque, embarrassingly genuine, long speech at the end, or halfway through this episode, and then you'll know.

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Very exciting.

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,680
So there was a definitive moment for you when you no longer cared about anything? Is that what happened?

71
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Basically, yes.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay, okay.

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Good.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
All right, well, okay, go.

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I thought you were going to do a whole...

76
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Okay, Gib, what does it mean to you to be embarrassed?

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,680
I mean, it feels like you want to go away from people and you're like, oh, I sure wish I didn't do that.

78
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
I mean, what do you want me to say?

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
I'm able to tell me why you are a shame boy.

80
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm always embarrassed.

81
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I think I kind of like it, in fact.

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I think I'm Stockholm syndromeed to embarrassment.

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
If I'm not embarrassed, it seems I'm not trying hard enough to try too hard.

84
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Like, if I'm not embarrassed about how hard I'm trying, then something's wrong.

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,680
You know, I should never be comfortable in my skin.

86
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Gib, how does it feel for us to be embarrassed by you?

87
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,680
How does that feel on your shoulders?

88
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Correct and appreciated.

89
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
I don't know. We're not doing any specifics here.

90
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Somebody's got to have a specific humiliating story.

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
That's the juxtaposition.

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Is that where we're taking this?

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Eventually.

94
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Absolutely.

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,680
In the meantime, Tom, what do you think about this?

96
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
You seem like a deeply shameful boy.

97
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
What do you think about this?

98
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm fucking horribly disgusting.

99
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,680
Munchie brought up the point of shame.

100
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,680
I think shame does play a huge part in the embarrassment kind of role of everything.

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,680
I think embarrassment is something you feel yourself and then shame is something society kind of projects.

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Shame is the social focused aiming of embarrassment.

103
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,680
I don't know what that is, but I'm embarrassed that it's happening.

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Oh, how embarrassing.

105
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Oh, God.

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
You should feel ashamed.

107
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
We can just do that the whole time.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Every time you flub or anyone flubs anything in this whole podcast, it's like, oh, how embarrassing.

109
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
How high is the title?

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Maybe if you should stop treating Doecoin.

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
I got to treat my Doecoin.

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,680
This fucking Bitcoin bubble is about to burst.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,680
That's a lot to let me know that Doecoin is going up and surging right now.

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Munchie's over there mining Doecoin with that thing right now, right now.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:49,680
He just mined a new block and all the dogs just burst forth into his room and he has to go to jail right now.

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Dude, it's just like...

117
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
He left, but he didn't mute himself.

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Oh, it's just like Undertale with the dogs.

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
All right, shut up.

120
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Shut up right now.

121
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,680
I have a tangential story about coins and bitcoins and cryptocurrencies and embarrassment.

122
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Bitcoin, obviously, it had a big old boom.

123
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Everyone was like, oh my God, Bitcoin, I'm a fucking millionaire.

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,680
And I was like, can you trade that back for money?

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Because if you can, that's cool.

126
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
And somebody said yes.

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
So I was like, okay, I'll get a bit.

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:33,680
And then I went on to a thing and I got an account and I bought 0.01% of one Bitcoin, which is still like, you know, like 45 pounds or something.

129
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:43,680
And I was thinking, all right, I'll come back and maybe this will be 50 pounds and I'll just cash it in and it'll be a nice little thing I did.

130
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Immediately, from that point, and I haven't checked, but I've checked like a couple times, it has done nothing but go down since then.

131
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
When was this?

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,680
It's the last few weeks or months.

133
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
It was up at a certain point and it has just gone down since then.

134
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,680
It may go back up, but it's very embarrassing that I bought it at the very point.

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,680
The reason it's gone down the last couple of weeks is because there is like some legislation in China and South Korea about trading and mining.

136
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,680
They're like the two biggest places, respectively, for trading and mining.

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
So it's been kind of like really fluctuating the last couple of weeks.

138
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,680
They've got rich Bitcoin reserves under China's soil and you got to get down there.

139
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:32,680
South Korea just said that they're actually not banning trading in South Korea, so it probably should stabilize relatively soon.

140
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
So hold on to it.

141
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Okay. Well, I'm not going to get rid of it until it has more money than I put in.

142
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:47,680
My embarrassing story with Bitcoin, actually, I do have an embarrassing story with Bitcoin, is that I was really into like getting into cryptocurrency back when there was only Bitcoin.

143
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,680
And Litecoin, that was pretty much the only altcoin in circulation.

144
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,680
And Bitcoin was worth about $483 for one Bitcoin.

145
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:05,680
And I was interested in getting some Bitcoin, but at the time, I naively was not aware that you could purchase fractions of a Bitcoin.

146
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I had like $100, but I thought you had to buy one whole Bitcoin.

147
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
So I don't have $500 to buy a Bitcoin with, so I didn't.

148
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:25,680
And if I had just spent that $100, if I had done the research, I would have thousands of dollars right now because it's multiplied by what, like 400 times in value.

149
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,680
So I could have gotten like $4,000 for my $100 investment if I had just done a little bit more research.

150
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
So that's really embarrassing.

151
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
Kind of hit myself.

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Guys, this is important.

153
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Wait, Munchy, Ben was going to say something.

154
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,680
I just have to let you all know that I'm on coinmarketcap.com right now, and Dogecoin is actually skyrocketing.

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Oh, hell yes!

156
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Dogecoin is like fucking peaking.

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Yeah, if you were in the call the whole time, you'd have known that Dogecoin passed $2 billion in market worth, like the entire market of Dogecoin worth like $2 billion a couple days ago.

158
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Yeah, it's like doubly embarrassing for me.

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Not only did the one I pick immediately go down, but it was the wrong one that I picked.

160
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Did you get Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin whatever the wrong one is?

161
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
I don't know fucking anything.

162
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Just of relevance, I just want to point out again that my friend Colin did in fact run a marathon.

163
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
His first marathon wearing a Dogecoin onesie.

164
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Just putting that out there.

165
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
It's a fact.

166
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Dogecoins, as of this time last year, Dogecoins were worth like $0.1500.

167
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,680
They're now worth a whopping like $0.1.

168
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Not bad.

169
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Not bad.

170
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Almost as much as a lucrative PC penny, which is on the rise.

171
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,680
I need to leave for one second to beat my parents and I come back and talk about World of Warcraft.

172
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,680
No, you went to fucking farm Dogecoin by beating the shit out of that dog and wringing the currency from him.

173
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:59,680
He's just, when you defeat a dog, he just spews the experience of doing some Dogecoin.

174
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Okay, this has nothing to do with the topic of this.

175
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,680
This is very embarrassing, our lack of professionalism.

176
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Save it for the cryptocurrency episode, guys.

177
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Save it for the cryptocurrency episode.

178
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:18,680
It's sort of hard to just think of like an embarrassing, because like embarrassing stories of things I've blocked from my memory and I just sort of, I know they exist.

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I just don't know.

180
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Well, I wanted to talk about embarrassment and shame.

181
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
But I shat myself.

182
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
That's what the people want.

183
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Tell me what were you saying.

184
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
We can talk about, I want to talk about like the concept of embarrassment, the concept of shame.

185
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Yes.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Is it good?

187
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
This is weird.

188
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Is it bad? How should you react to it?

189
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
I feel like you guys are, we've swapped.

190
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I feel like we've swapped roles for this episode, because I always want to talk about the theory behind it and stuff, but now I want to talk about specific humiliating stories.

191
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,680
You just want dirt on everybody in this call right now.

192
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
I see how this is.

193
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
No, because I've got mine.

194
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
I prepared mine before any of this.

195
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,680
I know exactly, let me tell you about how humiliating and embarrassing a person I am.

196
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
So what I was...

197
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
No.

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
What?

199
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,680
What's interesting about shame and embarrassment is that they're so integral to all of human culture that's ever existed.

200
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
And so it's interesting.

201
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
I don't care about whatever fucking...

202
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Shame is how social boundaries are set.

203
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
That's the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable.

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
And the way that new things come...

205
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I don't know what Nate says.

206
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,680
I want to see what dirt you have on you.

207
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I want to hear it.

208
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,680
We couldn't have the legendary Digi Brony line on the fringe of acceptable and cringe without the concept of cringe.

209
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,680
So you have shame to think of all of Digi's records.

210
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Incidentally, fat shaming is good.

211
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
That's my favorite bit.

212
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,680
But yeah, we can do both, as I hope to do.

213
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
And I will ring the...

214
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Like Munchy goes to beat the bitcoins out of his dog.

215
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
I will beat the embarrassment coins out of all of you today.

216
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Okay, let me just tell you this story real quick and then we can get to whatever the fuck you guys want to talk about.

217
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Listen to how embarrassing a person I am.

218
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Okay, so when I was a kid, I thought it was the shit.

219
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,680
I thought it was so cool and so rad that I decided to enter the...

220
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
It was like the middle school...

221
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Fuck, what was it called?

222
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
A talent show.

223
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
The talent show.

224
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
And so I did, in fact, enter the talent show.

225
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,680
And we practiced for like weeks and it was real crazy and stuff.

226
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,680
And I did a rendition of Another One Bites the Dust by one queen.

227
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
By one queen.

228
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
I did this alone.

229
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
It was just me.

230
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,680
I choreographed all my own dance moves as they played just like the song with Freddie Mercury's vocals.

231
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
That was just like saying over it.

232
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
Oh, no.

233
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,680
And so, I mean, let's just say it went off without a fucking hitch.

234
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
I nailed every pirouette, every backflip.

235
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
It was a 10 out of 10 performance.

236
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
No question.

237
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,680
But after I finished it, there are tapes of this performance out there in the world.

238
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,680
And just now that time has passed, I live in fear.

239
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Just all my waking days are consumed with fear that this illicit videotape will surface one day.

240
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,680
And the world will see me just popping and locking my life away.

241
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
You know, one step at a time.

242
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
I'm officially opening a PCP monthly.

243
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Exactly.

244
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
We gotta go on the hunt.

245
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I will personally, unironically give you 33% of my PCP wage the month you send me a video of Nate singing Another One Bites the Dust.

246
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Unironically officially.

247
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
That is true.

248
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Give that to me.

249
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Ramp oil, rope, bombs, it's yours.

250
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,680
But only if you have a video of Nate singing.

251
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,680
I just want to let you know, everybody, so your expectations are set correctly.

252
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
I thought I'd be like the coolest kid in town.

253
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
I bought a fedora.

254
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,680
I bought this sick ass bomber leather jacket that was way too big for me, but I wore it anyway.

255
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Holy shit.

256
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,680
And no one at any point even suggested that what I was doing was a mistake in any way.

257
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Which is really the worst part, because that's where shame is so important.

258
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Exactly.

259
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,680
When you push against those boundaries, other people can be like, yo, you're on the fringe, dude, you gotta be careful.

260
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,680
It was only years later as everyone, you know, was aware that I had done this.

261
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
They're like, man, what were you thinking, dude?

262
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
And I was like, well, I don't know.

263
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
I guess I was thinking that that was okay.

264
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I didn't know that you guys would be this mean about it to me later on.

265
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I actually have an incredibly similar story.

266
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:43,680
I think I might have told you before about how I, again, in middle school at a talent show in sixth grade,

267
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I attended a sixth grade camp where we just, you know, went up to some woods near where I live and we camped out for like a week.

268
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Anyway, at the end, there was a talent show and, you know, you have rehearsals of the week leading up to it.

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
And I listened to the talent show, did not know what I was going to do.

270
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I actually just had that as an excuse to not do anything and just hang out in the center where people were doing things.

271
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
That's kind of fucked around.

272
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,680
And then eventually, once it got closer, I just, you know, quit because I didn't have anything to do.

273
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:19,680
And then while the show was going on halfway through, like the stage is set, everything is scheduled.

274
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I said, you know what, I have something I want to do.

275
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,680
So I just like walk up to the stage and say, like, hey, can I be in the show?

276
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Like, it's going on.

277
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Halfway, it's almost over.

278
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
And they're like, yeah, okay, sure.

279
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't care.

280
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Yeah.

281
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Hell yeah.

282
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
So I get up and I do.

283
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,680
I sing as a sixth grader in front of my entire school.

284
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I sing the portal one and two ending songs.

285
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
This was a triumph.

286
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Hell yeah.

287
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Hell yeah.

288
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
This was a triumph, Monty.

289
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
A triumph.

290
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Yeah, literally.

291
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I do that.

292
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
And the thing is, I get off.

293
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I don't know how well I did because I forgot some of the words during it.

294
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,680
And then I get off and then like when we're going back to our house, everyone is like

295
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,680
cheering me and saying how good of a job it was and how much they love video games and

296
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,680
how much I understood what I was referencing.

297
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,680
And the one guy told me the cake was a lie and this was the only time in my entire life

298
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I felt validated by the people around me in school.

299
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
And I was so happy that I did it.

300
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
It was the best experience of my fucking life.

301
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I completely nailed those songs.

302
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Yeah.

303
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
That's how I felt.

304
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
I felt like everyone knew you loved video games.

305
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,680
The only thing I couldn't believe was that I didn't win first place.

306
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,680
I was dumbfounded by the fact that anyone could be chosen over my performance.

307
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Such as life.

308
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
I have a story.

309
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,680
I have a story that's kind of similar to that, Nate, about there was a play.

310
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,680
It was like a school play that I was trying out for.

311
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,680
I don't remember what it's called, but it's some play about the like it's like a court

312
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,680
case about like a science teacher in the deep south who wants to teach evolution or something.

313
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Right.

314
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I remember.

315
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah.

316
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,680
And I thought that I would I thought I would try out for the like fire and brimstone preacher

317
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,680
guy who like is like prosecuting the dude.

318
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I thought that would be really cool.

319
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,680
So his name is like, you know, Mr. Mr. Black, whatever.

320
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,680
So I try to try out for Mr. Black and I go and I like, I'm like, yeah, I think I did pretty good.

321
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,680
And then a couple of weeks later, I see the results and I go and I'm like, oh, Ben got

322
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Mr. Black.

323
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Yes, I fucking did it.

324
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,680
But I show up to but I show up to the first rehearsal and I realized that what has actually

325
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,680
happened is they've gender swapped the role of Mr. Black into Mrs. Black and I'm actually

326
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,680
seeing his his her her spouse.

327
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Oh, that's right.

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,680
The totally like throw away one line side character.

329
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
That's the spouse of the guy.

330
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
And I'm like, shit.

331
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,680
So I just turn around and walked away and never came back.

332
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
That's that's that's how you do it.

333
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,680
That's that was Dick move and they deserve that.

334
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Yeah, I agree.

335
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,680
It was probably listed that that was the case and you just did not realize.

336
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Yes.

337
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
So it's.

338
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Yes.

339
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
I just didn't.

340
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I didn't look.

341
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I could have found out, but I didn't.

342
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,680
But I just wasn't going to suffer that.

343
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,680
I showed up expecting to be like a main character.

344
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Yeah.

345
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,680
And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

346
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
That's the thing.

347
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
That's the thing.

348
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,680
I would like to ask you guys, do you feel more self conscious or do you feel like you

349
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,680
are shamed more, which is more proportional?

350
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Do you do awkward or cringy things and think, oh God, I'm I'm such a shitter.

351
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I'm such a bad guy.

352
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm such a villain.

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm such an antagonist.

354
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Or do you do bad things and you just don't realize and then people make fun of you for

355
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
it?

356
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
What happens more to you guys?

357
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
It's self criticism a thousand million times more.

358
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I don't know because I because I don't know because if other people are just making fun

359
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
of me behind my back, I don't know about it.

360
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Yeah, I guess that's also.

361
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I don't have enough real life like interactions at this point.

362
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm doing something bad.

363
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
So it's all it's all internal.

364
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Like there's so many things that I've done for so long that we're embarrassing and I

365
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
never knew.

366
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,680
But I was too busy like contemplating other things like internally like, oh God, is this

367
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
art that I'm posting like really embarrassing?

368
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Oh God, it probably is not realizing that like I'm acting and looking like a total spur

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,680
glord and I don't know until it's too late.

370
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
It's not like you're the worst guy ever or anything.

371
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Maybe you want to give that a Google fair viewer images and see what you get.

372
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I know it's unreal.

373
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Unreal.

374
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Yeah.

375
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,680
That's probably the most embarrassing thing for me.

376
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
It's not even my goddamn fault.

377
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Yeah, it's not.

378
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
It's not.

379
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
I don't know.

380
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,680
I guess we'll just tell people if you Google worst guy ever, the literally the first thing

381
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm up is Tom's face with like old video.

382
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,680
What happened is I used to I used to wear fedora unironically and this is what I'm talking

383
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,520
about in terms of I did things cringy without knowing.

384
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,440
And the reason that I had this stupid hat is that my girlfriend bought it for herself

385
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,280
and she didn't like it and gave it to me and she likes me in it.

386
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,400
So I was like, I don't know.

387
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,440
I literally don't ever buy clothes.

388
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,280
I don't know anything about anything.

389
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,780
And like this was back in college and when I was in college, I literally I never went

390
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,880
on the Internet other than like trying to post art.

391
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,520
I didn't have any social contact or anything like that.

392
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
So I had no context for any of this.

393
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
So I'm just like, whatever.

394
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
She gave me a hat.

395
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
She likes you in the hat.

396
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
I'm going to wear the hat.

397
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,920
And that that was as simple as it was.

398
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,680
And then I just wore that for whatever because like that just became part of my thing.

399
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,960
And then I just started making videos on YouTube and then someone screen capped it and made

400
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
a fake.

401
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Okay.

402
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Cupid profile.

403
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Yeah.

404
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
And it's since become a meme.

405
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,040
The original like 4chan it was, it was the image was called Mexican Christian bale dot

406
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
B.

407
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Yeah.

408
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
That's right.

409
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Mexican Christian bale.

410
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Yeah.

411
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
So.

412
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,480
You know, this is why, this is why literally everyone on the Internet needs a meme consultant

413
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,160
to make sure they're not making any massive boners that will, that will get them memed

414
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
hardcore.

415
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
It's important.

416
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,600
Like all those innocent young men who just want to take pictures with their katanas that

417
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,280
their moms are taking pictures of and can be seen in the reflection in the mirror.

418
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,320
And then their mom posted to Facebook and it's all over, you know, like you're fucked

419
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
at that point.

420
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,840
These need to go through a review process.

421
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
It's important.

422
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,160
So I was like worried about my artwork being too embarrassing, not realizing that I'd set

423
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,800
this huge fucking trap card for myself.

424
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Yeah.

425
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,240
And, and you know, it's just one of those things.

426
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
And like to this day, every now and then I just get tweets.

427
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Is this you?

428
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,360
And I'm like, I used to respond to them, but now I'm just like, uh, I'm so tired of saying

429
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,640
it's trying to explain this over and over again.

430
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,360
Cause now it's on the record.

431
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,200
Everybody can know, uh, give me, give me money at patreon.com slash save me so I can change

432
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,400
my identity, get some facial reconstruction surgery and just dodge this whole thing forever.

433
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I think that's pretty great.

434
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I'd be pretty proud of this.

435
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm a little jealous, frankly.

436
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,960
I pray that one day I'll be a meme in some faster or another.

437
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,680
I long for that day with all, with all my fucking heart.

438
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
One day.

439
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,160
I'm not making, I'm not making any money off of this, so it's not all it's cracked up

440
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
to be.

441
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Let me tell you.

442
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
That's true.

443
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
That's true.

444
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
I don't care a thing about coins.

445
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
I care about fame.

446
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I care about eyeballs looking at me.

447
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,080
I have an embarrassing story and it's, um, it was in school.

448
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,760
I was a kid and I wasn't a child's genius, projecty golden kid boy.

449
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I wasn't good.

450
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Like us.

451
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,320
That is so embarrassing.

452
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,040
This haunted me my whole life that I wasn't Mozart or David Bowie.

453
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,480
I wondered at least one of those would have been great, but no, there.

454
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
That's it.

455
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
I don't feel shame.

456
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,440
I don't really understand the feeling of shame, even though, like, well, I do, but

457
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,560
like, it doesn't affect me in a way that, like, I know when I do something that's cringy

458
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,560
and it's like, oh, well, it doesn't affect me.

459
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,440
That's actually really important, that factor, because like, shame, because of much of you,

460
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
like shame.

461
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
I think you'll agree with me.

462
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,160
Shame is kind of like where the boundaries of society are set, right?

463
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Exactly.

464
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah.

465
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,760
Kind of embarrassment is you being cognizant of the fact that you're doing something shameful.

466
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,400
Like, so that's, that's what it is.

467
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,960
And then the way that society changes and things become less, like, like become acceptable

468
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,600
is when people know they're doing something shameful and choose to enjoy what they're

469
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,040
doing more than, uh, being held down by the embarrassment.

470
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,400
And then that's how things become socially acceptable and things move more.

471
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,440
I understand what I do that is shameful, but I am never embarrassed by it.

472
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,520
So you're a cultural pioneer, basically, is what I'm saying.

473
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,160
By not being a child prodigy.

474
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,560
You may not be a Mozart, but you're sure as hell a Steve Jobs.

475
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,160
A singular Steve Jobs.

476
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,480
Um, I...

477
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
That's okay.

478
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I...

479
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
So what...

480
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Yeah, go on.

481
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Yeah, go on.

482
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
Okay.

483
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,360
I'd like to, uh, elaborate on my, my seemingly, uh, incongruent, I think is the word, uh,

484
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,000
like, like, incredibly easily embarrassed self and my, uh, munchy self.

485
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,280
While it's true, I often parade around my town in fully, in, like, full pizza jumpsuit.

486
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,840
I actually do that.

487
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm also paradoxically very concerned with what people think about me.

488
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,800
I don't have, like, an on or off switch, really.

489
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,400
Yeah, most of the time, like this, in real life, within reason.

490
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,640
The main point that separates embarrassment in the jumpsuit and out is what my intention

491
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
is.

492
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,320
When I'm in the jumpsuit, I'm the star of the show.

493
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm intentionally poking fun at myself and acting generally silly, specifically at my

494
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
own dismay.

495
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
He's breaking every social norm at once.

496
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Uh-huh.

497
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Yeah.

498
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Yeah.

499
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
It's on your own terms.

500
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I am the clown.

501
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
It's me.

502
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,240
I'm trying to make people happy and get them to laugh at me for entertainment's sake.

503
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,160
But when I'm not intentionally acting foolish and some part of my personality or, like,

504
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,760
quirk of habit shows, I'm not prepared for the public to see, that's far more terrifying

505
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
than an entire crowd of people laughing at me.

506
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,920
It's the old phenomenon of a girl being embarrassed in my anime, the only media I understand,

507
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
or thing I understand.

508
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,080
Uh, when you walk in on them changing, they're in their underwear.

509
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,680
Ah, so has Kashi, so embarrassed, a blush and punch.

510
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,360
But if you see him in a bathing suit, it's no big deal, even though it's, like, literally

511
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,400
the exact same thing, just because they're expecting people to view them in this situation.

512
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,880
So, uh, yeah, you know, it's an interesting distinction.

513
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,320
I think, maybe I was wrong about, like, the embarrassment, because I have that anime

514
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,920
Deku Makura pillow now, like, I got it for a sponsored video.

515
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Welcome to the club.

516
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Welcome to the club.

517
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
The best video of the year so far.

518
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
Uh, yes, I like it.

519
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,800
And it was like, oh, I was making fun of, like, oh, I'm a freak, oh, ha ha, and I pushed

520
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,960
on Twitter, like, oh, look at, look at how degenerate I am or whatever.

521
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,680
But posting it online is, is fine.

522
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,440
I don't actually feel embarrassed about that, otherwise I would not post it.

523
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:21,400
But it's a couple times when my parents knock on the door and they come in, I have to, like,

524
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,480
oh, I look over and it's like, the face is there, I have to cover up the whole thing.

525
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,440
I have to cover up the whole thing with the duvet, so they don't see that I'm sleeping

526
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,240
with a cartoon character.

527
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
They don't know I'm meming.

528
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,160
Oh, God, I can't explain it.

529
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
That's exactly it.

530
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
They don't understand the irony of the situation.

531
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,040
They don't understand that I'm joking.

532
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,880
They don't understand that it's all, it's all ironic and a joke.

533
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,000
He says, intensely hugging the documentary while he sleeps every night.

534
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
No, no, it's, I mean, it's not even ironic in that way.

535
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,040
It is like, it's nice to have a big old pillow like that to hug.

536
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,160
The image on it is like, oh, that's cute.

537
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,800
But they don't know anything.

538
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,480
Like they don't even know the first thing.

539
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,200
They might think it's very weird.

540
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
They might think they should die.

541
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
They haven't seen it yet.

542
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,880
They don't know, they don't know it's there.

543
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,160
I keep it covered at all times.

544
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,800
So I'm definitely embarrassed about that.

545
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,880
And how do you bring that up?

546
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Yeah, I mean, how do you just like, it'd be good to like,

547
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,040
just to let them know the information about, like,

548
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,240
I have one that is in my closet right now

549
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,800
because they don't want anyone to see it and embarrass me

550
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,520
because they'll think that I like, I don't know, like,

551
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,040
that's my life or something.

552
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,920
Yeah, I can't look like that.

553
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,040
But like, how do you bring it up in a graceful way?

554
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,360
Even bringing it up at all is embarrassing.

555
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,960
So the only thing you can do is just simply not bring it up.

556
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,160
And then you always know if somebody were to see it,

557
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,840
it would be embarrassing because you're not gonna bring it up.

558
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,240
I mean, really, what the best thing to do is just to,

559
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,120
you know, if they come in and they see it

560
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
and it's not covered and they say, oh, what's that?

561
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
It's just like, it's a pillow, you know,

562
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,760
like just nonchalant, like, yes, nothing big deal about it.

563
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,360
Don't, you know, it's nothing.

564
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,200
And then they're like, okay.

565
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Man, this is the real shit.

566
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,640
This is the real shit because I think about this a lot.

567
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,640
I mean, I also have one of those opai mouse pads

568
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,520
with the boob on it and they've definitely been able

569
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
to see that because it is on my desk

570
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,480
and they come in and it's like,

571
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,160
but like, they've never mentioned it.

572
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,080
They've never said what's that or, oh, they've never made it.

573
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,600
Oh, you know they're thinking weird shit.

574
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,440
You know it.

575
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,560
If they haven't said anything for sure.

576
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,920
That's the worst part, dude,

577
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,960
when your head makes it 10 times worse

578
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,120
than it probably actually is.

579
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,480
Yeah, but I prefer it like that

580
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,240
when like, I don't prefer them.

581
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,960
Well, I do prefer them to never mention it

582
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,320
because it means they don't care and it's okay.

583
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,560
Like if they think in the back of their head,

584
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,120
oh, well, I guess he likes boobs.

585
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,640
Like that doesn't mean too much.

586
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,200
It's kind of okay in fact.

587
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,480
Okay, well, here's where my mind goes

588
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,520
because I'm twisted like this.

589
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't want one of those

590
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,880
because like I would think if I was in a situation

591
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,160
like yours, what I would think that you should not think,

592
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,320
but what I might think is like, oh God,

593
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,880
they think I'm a freak.

594
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,720
They don't want to bring it up

595
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,280
because they don't want to make it real.

596
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,400
What a freak I am.

597
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,320
So they're just going to like ignore this

598
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,680
and pretend it's not there.

599
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,520
All right.

600
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,560
And we'll all just move on from this.

601
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,240
Here's a head thing.

602
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,640
That happens a lot or it used to happen a lot with me.

603
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,360
Like I would think, you know,

604
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,200
it's very easy to conspire in your mind.

605
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,480
Like they're not bringing it up,

606
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,640
which means that, you know, they know about it

607
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,680
and they're thinking about it

608
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,040
and people are thinking it's conspiracy theory.

609
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,720
You're thinking everybody has some sort of

610
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,800
like nasty thought about you

611
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,520
that they're hiding for their, you know,

612
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
to be seem polite and stuff.

613
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,080
And at some point I just thought it's really,

614
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,480
it's just a bad idea all around

615
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,400
to ever entertain those ideas

616
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,960
that somebody thinks something and they don't say it.

617
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,160
Like what would, it's,

618
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
it's just-

619
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,520
You know what's an interesting,

620
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,080
sorry, you know what's an interesting trajectory

621
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,120
that's like relevant to what you're saying right now?

622
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,160
It's like, it's been my relationship with anime

623
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,800
over the years growing up.

624
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,240
Cause I've been, I've been paying attention

625
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,240
to like how my, how my thoughts have been going

626
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,960
for, I don't know, the last many years.

627
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,440
But it's like when I was a kid,

628
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,400
I unabashedly was into like Power Rangers and Transformers.

629
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,880
And then I just sort of like Dragon Ball Z

630
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,160
and it turned me on like, I don't know,

631
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,360
TUNAMI and like all this stuff.

632
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,800
And then I just got sucked into it over the years.

633
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,120
But like in like my early college years

634
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,440
and my high school years,

635
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,520
I was definitely like embarrassed of it.

636
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,200
Even though paradoxically at the same time,

637
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,560
I was like exclusively wearing anime t-shirts to school

638
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,040
and like wearing Kingdom Hearts wristbands literally every day.

639
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,400
And you know, like this is, it was like,

640
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,760
I was both simultaneously humiliated

641
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,880
when it would come up in any way.

642
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,400
And also like displaying it to all the world.

643
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
So like what, I don't really know why my,

644
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,240
what the deal was with that.

645
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,520
But like at this point in my, in my life,

646
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
I've like completely swung the other way.

647
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,240
And like I don't like shove it in anybody's face really.

648
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,320
I still do wear anime shirts like almost every day.

649
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,280
But like I don't think about it.

650
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,520
And it's not like really part of my identity

651
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,280
to like shove it in people's face,

652
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,200
except how I like, I utilize it specifically

653
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,560
like for my online stuff.

654
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,680
Cause like of course I still like and I still do it.

655
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
And I've turned it into like a product,

656
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,160
basically my, my passion for anime.

657
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,120
It's something that I have, you know,

658
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,280
found an effective thing to like talk about online

659
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,440
and people enjoy listening to it.

660
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,280
So-

661
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,120
It's probably just because you have an outlet for that

662
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,600
now you don't feel you have to like-

663
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,240
Yeah, I never had an outlet.

664
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,360
That's absolutely true.

665
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,680
Me and Ben would talk sometimes,

666
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,680
but like there was no anime club in high school.

667
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,520
There was nobody to like-

668
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,320
But then was the anime master like you?

669
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,800
It's true, it's true.

670
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,520
I was more into these things.

671
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,320
And it's just like now I like,

672
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,760
the pendulum has really swung.

673
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,240
At this point I'm like totally comfortable

674
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,560
with the fact that I like these things.

675
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,040
Like even in like the T-Bap days,

676
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,120
like, you know, I would like make fun of myself

677
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,480
for liking anime and stuff.

678
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,160
But now like I don't even get the point.

679
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,800
Like there's nothing to be embarrassed about

680
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,160
with like liking anime.

681
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,000
And now it just-

682
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,840
But at the same time-

683
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,280
Are you more comfortable with it?

684
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Or has it just become more common and more acceptable?

685
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,240
Well, I actually think that because I've become more

686
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,000
of an adult, I am questioning myself less.

687
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,160
And as a result of that, I think to myself,

688
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,000
yeah, it's just normal for me to like anime.

689
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
Why should I feel embarrassed?

690
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,280
That's just who I am.

691
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,560
Whereas when you're a kid,

692
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
the only difference is that you're less sure of yourself.

693
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,640
Like nothing makes-

694
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,840
Kids get embarrassed about stupid shit.

695
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,680
That doesn't matter.

696
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,520
They sure do.

697
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,360
Oh, they sure do.

698
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,200
It's really funny.

699
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,440
Like Lars in Steven Universe.

700
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,920
Yeah, I can-

701
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,200
The Lars in Steven Universe is like the exact right example.

702
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,920
Like he just is humiliated by things

703
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,600
that are not embarrassing in any way.

704
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,440
And just let's like consume his thoughts

705
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,200
and he just makes up these narratives.

706
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,040
Cause I don't know,

707
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,120
he probably just hates himself or something.

708
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,720
I think it's because when you're younger,

709
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,800
you don't have like,

710
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,240
you haven't like completely figured out your identity yet.

711
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,080
Exactly.

712
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,840
So everything kind of is an act that you're doing

713
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,200
cause you're trying to kind of figure out

714
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,240
what your actual genuine persona is.

715
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,640
But once you have that lockdown,

716
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,280
it's just like, well, this is who I am.

717
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,640
And I'm not going to change it cause fuck you.

718
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,480
And you know what?

719
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
In a certain lens, that's kind of a negative thing.

720
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,400
And this says that you're kind of solidified in who you are.

721
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,880
And you can't like grow and change as much.

722
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,320
It's like when an oak tree grows.

723
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,160
Like when it's young,

724
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,080
you can shape it and make it grow a certain way.

725
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Once it gets too old,

726
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,920
if you try to reshape it,

727
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,520
like snap or it just like won't go that way anymore.

728
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,360
Yeah.

729
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,200
People's personalities are like that.

730
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,120
That's how like, you know, like older generations

731
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,240
get locked into ways of thinking

732
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,080
and your brain becomes less malleable.

733
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,400
And that's, you know, that's,

734
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,960
it's like a good with the bad thing.

735
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,120
Like you're young, you're malleable,

736
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,480
but you're also very vulnerable.

737
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,020
Which is why it's super important that people keep dying

738
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,160
so that ideas can continue to grow

739
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,440
cause people with solid minds,

740
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,720
they need to go away and die like like religion.

741
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,280
Religion is not going away

742
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,960
with like the people who are alive right now.

743
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,520
Those people need to die

744
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,240
and their kids need to get more and more secular

745
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,080
so we can get off the side.

746
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,920
They need to die.

747
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,040
Right up until me.

748
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,320
And I need to be the first one to not die.

749
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,680
Unlimited life.

750
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,320
I mean, I hear you, but honestly,

751
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,040
we should all die too at some point.

752
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,400
Like nobody brings that,

753
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,640
but the one negative about if we had immortality

754
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,080
would be that as far as we understand it,

755
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,880
our minds do kind of, you know,

756
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,000
settle into one frame of reference

757
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,280
in one way of perceiving the world

758
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,040
where new generation, I mean, hell, hell.

759
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,920
Maybe if we-

760
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,640
I'll settle my fist into your face best guy ever.

761
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,120
Fair enough, but I don't know.

762
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,520
Maybe that would be a way to like protect humanity

763
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,200
from proceeding to degeneracy.

764
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,520
Nate, what if we have an unlimited lifespan?

765
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,600
What if the whole idea of like solidifying a persona

766
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,240
in our minds and living that way

767
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,520
is just a consequence of our finite lifespan

768
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,720
and it's like a social kind of construction.

769
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,160
What if we had unlimited lifespan

770
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
and we'd never had to worry about getting older

771
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,360
and like how these like crazy responsibilities-

772
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,680
Hey, if that happens-

773
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,400
Our minds were ultimately malleable forever

774
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,760
and we were always open to new ideas,

775
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,160
always evolving, always changing-

776
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,800
If that happened, there'd be no problem.

777
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,640
That'd be you, that'd be-

778
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,440
People can still change their minds,

779
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,000
like even when they're old.

780
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,360
I think that probably like the mind is still plastic

781
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,680
and like if people were living a thousand years,

782
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,040
I mean, then they'd have a thousand years

783
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,640
for their minds to change, you know?

784
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,360
I don't know if they changed that much though.

785
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,720
I mean, I'm seriously, I wonder about that.

786
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,280
Like how much the mind of like-

787
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,200
Here's the thing, Nate, everybody who,

788
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,080
once everybody has unlimited like lifespans

789
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,400
and is immortal or undying or whatever,

790
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,280
then all those people will be accepting of new ideas

791
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,320
and everybody who wouldn't,

792
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,640
who would have their closed minds

793
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,280
isn't gonna accept immortality anyways

794
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
because they're gonna be like,

795
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,240
I need to go to heaven and die.

796
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,080
So they're all gonna die.

797
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,920
We don't have to worry about that anymore.

798
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,760
That's only one issue though.

799
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
They're gone.

800
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,160
Maybe they're more accepting, but that doesn't necessarily,

801
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,320
okay, well, here's the weird utilitarianism point

802
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,160
of this particular thing.

803
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,480
We could make it one episode.

804
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,280
It's, well, we're already on it basically,

805
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,160
but it's just, okay, if, is it right?

806
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,720
Well, okay, let's say we had a pill

807
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,800
that gives you immortality,

808
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,920
like your cells just stop aging.

809
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
But let's say I really believe,

810
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,040
and I have a good scientific basis for thinking that

811
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,720
it is actually good for people to keep dying

812
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,920
so as to keep this like refreshing cycle going

813
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,680
so people like keep evolving and changing

814
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,520
and through their kids who gain new ideas

815
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,800
and they're not as malleable, et cetera, et cetera.

816
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,200
If that process is helped of like ideas being furthered

817
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,720
by new people being born,

818
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,640
should we then not let people become immortal?

819
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,320
What do we need new ideas for if we don't die?

820
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,960
That's a silly thing to say.

821
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
You're so wrong.

822
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,040
I think, I just think that if we have immortality

823
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
and I don't think new ideas are gonna stop

824
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,440
just cause people are immortal.

825
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,280
Yeah.

826
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,120
I think, I think.

827
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,960
It's a degree though.

828
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,960
Society would change at a slower pace,

829
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,320
but because everybody lives much longer,

830
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,040
it's gonna change slower regardless.

831
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,000
That's inefficient.

832
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,840
That is inefficient.

833
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,760
People dying is a more efficient system,

834
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
and I like that.

835
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,760
I'm coming over to your house to kill you, Nate.

836
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,600
It's for the sake of efficiency.

837
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
Once we think you're at it.

838
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,280
You can make it argument.

839
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,120
We do not die.

840
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,440
We don't need to make any more progress.

841
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,280
That's it.

842
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
That's the end game.

843
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,480
That's not true because the finite has,

844
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,720
the universe has a finite time span.

845
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,400
You've got a finite time span.

846
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,640
Our planet will only be around

847
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,200
a few billion years and we wanna get this shit rolling.

848
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,480
Get what rolling?

849
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,920
Get progress rolling.

850
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
Starfleet.

851
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,600
Progress towards what?

852
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,440
Starfleet.

853
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,760
Interstellar travel.

854
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,080
Interdimensional travel.

855
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,920
Interdimensional travel.

856
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,720
Starfleet didn't have immortality.

857
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,560
That's true.

858
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,880
Starfleet wanted it.

859
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,720
We'd be better than Starfleet by then.

860
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,560
We would need Starfleet.

861
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,400
Exactly why.

862
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,560
We should keep killing people.

863
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,360
The thing I was trying to say earlier.

864
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,560
I'm not even arguing for this, by the way.

865
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,800
When.

866
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,040
Yes, go ahead, get please.

867
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,200
The thing I was trying to say earlier

868
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,640
when I embarrassingly, embarrassingly

869
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
choked on my own throat

870
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,160
and Nate stole the whole podcast away from me,

871
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,880
was that if people don't,

872
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,480
if people have like a problem with you

873
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,800
and they don't air their grievances,

874
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,160
it either means,

875
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,360
well one, it means that you should just assume

876
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,560
that your good qualities outweigh the bad ones

877
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,480
and that people like you and it's not a problem.

878
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,000
Cause like, there was always this feeling that you know,

879
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,760
things could like,

880
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,800
things you do that are wrong

881
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,960
or like issues that people have with you.

882
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,360
If they never bring them up,

883
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,080
then that just means that it's not really a big deal

884
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,240
and you should stop worrying about it.

885
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,640
But if they do have big problems with you

886
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,560
and they don't outweigh,

887
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
like the good parts don't outweigh the negative parts,

888
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,040
it is on them to tell you,

889
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,920
otherwise it's their fault for getting so bent out of shape

890
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,760
about it and maybe exploding.

891
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,280
And so I just, I just like to live my life

892
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,880
like assuming that people like me

893
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,520
unless they say otherwise.

894
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,800
My class pecked is the thief of podcasts.

895
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Nice one.

896
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,240
Got him.

897
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,880
I completely zoned out throughout that whole

898
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
like immortality thing.

899
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,480
I have no idea what it has to do with the podcast at large.

900
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,520
So. A little bit.

901
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,840
A little bit.

902
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,040
While it's nice to not be concerned

903
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,360
with what other people think about you

904
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,640
and it is comfortable to have that peace of mind.

905
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,480
Well, not peace of mind,

906
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,960
but you know, not have to think about

907
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,640
how you are affecting the people around you.

908
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,960
I would say it's kind of dangerous, maybe.

909
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,240
I don't think in your instance necessarily.

910
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,480
Well, I'm very observant of,

911
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,720
like I'm not using that as a crutch

912
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,600
because I'm bad at understanding people's emotions.

913
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,880
Like I can pick up on things.

914
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,600
I just, if I'm not sure,

915
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,400
I lean towards the side of,

916
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,760
well, they don't actually have a problem

917
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,880
because they're not saying anything.

918
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,720
But how do you know that?

919
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,800
How do you know that's actually the case?

920
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,400
Well, I don't, well, I mean,

921
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,640
maybe they have problems,

922
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,240
but like the point is overall as a person,

923
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,080
if they don't want me in their life,

924
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,680
it's up to them to tell me, right?

925
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,400
In one way or another,

926
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,600
not like directly like, hello, goodbye.

927
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,400
Like they don't have to like type it out.

928
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,360
But if there's no indication

929
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,760
that anything I'm doing is wrong at any point,

930
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
what am I supposed to do?

931
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,080
Am I supposed to feel in fear at all times?

932
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,320
I think there's a balance to be found between the two,

933
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,160
but yeah.

934
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,880
Well, isn't that like the purpose of shame

935
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,960
is like social shaming to show you

936
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,360
that the behaviors and things you're doing are unacceptable?

937
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,200
Yeah, and like, and sometimes it's appropriate

938
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,960
to push through shame to like do it anyway.

939
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,000
Cause like it's a dumb idea.

940
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,560
That's the question I wanted to present.

941
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,160
Is that, is shame a good thing or a bad thing?

942
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,800
And is the erosion of shame detrimental to society?

943
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,000
Because like, I feel like we're at a point right now,

944
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,600
like with culture that like there is,

945
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,240
there is a lot of like social shifting going on.

946
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,000
And there's a lot of things that were taboo,

947
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,600
like even 10 years ago, like totally out in the open

948
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,840
and everything's happening now.

949
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,040
And like, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

950
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,280
Cause like if we keep going in that direction soon,

951
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,760
like like doesn't society inevitably break down

952
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,600
if there's no more boundaries?

953
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,440
There is a limit.

954
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
There's no underlying values

955
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,520
that all of society adheres to.

956
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,480
Yeah, I get it.

957
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,680
Here's what I think about that.

958
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,600
I think the way that most people like say if they,

959
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,400
everybody tried to do what I like,

960
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,600
I generally do by assuming that the best of people

961
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,400
and then assuming there's no problem

962
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,160
if people don't speak up.

963
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,160
A lot of people would not like be self-critical enough

964
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,320
to change if so, if it's, it turns out that someone like,

965
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,000
that what, what, Munchie?

966
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,840
No.

967
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,480
Munchie, stop, stop mining Bitcoin over there.

968
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,800
You're stealing my speech.

969
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,120
I wrote a whole speech.

970
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,280
Oh, okay, go on edge.

971
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm bad at speaking.

972
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,320
The most embarrassing thing I do is PCP.

973
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,560
I'm terribly alive.

974
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,240
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

975
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,120
Arm retrieval mode activated.

976
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,760
Embarrassment, more specifically shame,

977
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,040
is not only good for you,

978
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,520
but actively beneficial to society.

979
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,880
Eternal shame is a built in natural repellent

980
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,920
of bad or unhealthy thoughts.

981
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,800
It is your body's way of telling you that you've fucked up,

982
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,680
but not with the carnage of the flesh.

983
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,520
If you're like me, your mind will literally torment you

984
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,600
day in, day out of your past sins and the evils

985
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,960
you've committed to yourself and your loved ones.

986
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,680
You will never escape your misdeeds.

987
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,640
You could be having the time of your life at a party

988
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,120
or falling asleep in bed

989
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,960
when suddenly that one on-court conversation

990
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,320
with your home road teacher back in sixth grade

991
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,840
telling her that she looked like Tina Fey,

992
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,960
but way, way older.

993
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,880
Or worse, the awful, awful porn you've drawn of Tina Fey,

994
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,600
but way, way older.

995
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,000
Then your thought process is hijacked.

996
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,480
And all you can think about for the next 20 minutes

997
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,800
to your sixth grade teachers,

998
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,160
all in variously poorly constructed sexual positions

999
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,880
with no concept of anatomy or what sex actually is.

1000
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,600
This is your personal nightmare.

1001
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,400
It's all your fault.

1002
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,160
Now, clearly this is not a desirable situation to be in.

1003
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,000
You're probably almost moved to tears or an anxiety attack.

1004
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,200
You've started your suggestion of your math room teacher

1005
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,480
sprawled out on what appears to be her knees,

1006
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,760
though due to the complete failure of perspective,

1007
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,880
it looks like her back.

1008
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,200
And you're probably cursing me for the mere suggestion

1009
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,520
that you deserve this fate.

1010
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,240
And to that, I'd say it's your own fucking fault, buddy.

1011
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,520
In scenarios such as this and much less comedic ones

1012
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,720
where you've genuinely hurt the people in your lives,

1013
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
you only have yourself to blame.

1014
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,720
And you have hurt and lied to the people you care about

1015
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,360
or alternatively drawn Steve Neve or Storyboard

1016
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,120
to your point of them.

1017
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,280
You yourself have committed social pause

1018
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,400
or done something you promised someone you wouldn't,

1019
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,640
something such as that.

1020
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,360
No one is allowed to hold that burden but you.

1021
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,160
Only you may inherit the she things you have done.

1022
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,240
Just because they're in your past

1023
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,720
doesn't mean they aren't you.

1024
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,840
You are defined in the ways you,

1025
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,640
that you probably couldn't even articulate

1026
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,360
by your past sins.

1027
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,880
And I think in good ways.

1028
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,200
Now, just because I say the past still matters.

1029
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,880
I'm also now currently, right now, next sentence,

1030
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,520
next word, right next thing I'm about to say currently,

1031
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,800
okay, here it goes.

1032
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,600
Saying that the present and future are wide open,

1033
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,640
like wide, wide open.

1034
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,920
Like you, hold on, I lost track of my notes.

1035
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,120
Like so many hot moms looking like Tina Fey

1036
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,720
only way, way older.

1037
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
Exactly.

1038
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,440
Wide open, like my voluptuous reading teacher.

1039
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,000
Actually, no, no, no, I don't want to, no more.

1040
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,840
Oh no.

1041
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,800
No.

1042
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,560
But the point is you have done she things

1043
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,640
and you've been sung by them, probably hard.

1044
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,200
And that does matter.

1045
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,280
But what matters more is what you do now.

1046
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,920
It's easy to commit a sin and then curl up into a ball

1047
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,600
and cry your eyes out, cursing yourself for mistakes.

1048
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,840
It's almost comforting to throw yourself

1049
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,040
into the pity party, rejecting your actions

1050
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,480
with the same time in the back of your head,

1051
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,040
trying to rationalize them.

1052
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,120
It's so, so easy to do that.

1053
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,960
I've done that for most of my life.

1054
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,920
But if all you do is toil and regret your mistakes,

1055
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,640
that's all you're ever going to be defined by.

1056
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,320
You have to make that next step, the harder step.

1057
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,400
You have to get fucking action and snatch your wrong

1058
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,760
from the baby playhouse of self-defeatism

1059
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,320
and throw that slimy fuck directly into the middle

1060
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,600
of accountability junction, motherfucker.

1061
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,760
You must move on from your life

1062
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,080
and start to specifically be a better person.

1063
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,560
Most of the time this will not mean

1064
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,840
many of them you've done because most of the time

1065
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,360
you have to let certain things go

1066
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,320
because you've probably destroyed them

1067
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,040
more than you can ever repair them

1068
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,440
in most embarrassing situations.

1069
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,320
And you know, it's in the past you can't rewind time

1070
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,680
to make sure that you don't envision

1071
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,520
your homeroom teacher naked during class.

1072
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,680
What you can always do regardless of circumstance

1073
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,720
or background is just remember.

1074
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,840
Live your life and remember what you've done

1075
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,640
and look out for the signs that lead you down the path

1076
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,720
towards treachery.

1077
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,240
Look for ways to remove yourself

1078
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,760
from temptations and obstructions.

1079
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,160
Remember how and why you did the thing

1080
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,840
so you can specifically eradicate all chances

1081
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,120
of it happening again.

1082
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,840
Learn from your fucking mistakes, you slippery slut.

1083
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,520
You fucking cheap dog food nigger.

1084
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,320
You after you snap your life back into place.

1085
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,680
Understand what you did and can do.

1086
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,040
Think for a moment to thank the friend

1087
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,640
that made this all possible.

1088
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,400
Because let's be honest, no way you would have found

1089
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,880
the initiative or power to change your life.

1090
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,040
Even aside the most rousing of speeches,

1091
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,320
if you didn't feel absolutely awful at the low point,

1092
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,560
the original pit of despair and agony

1093
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,600
you felt deep inside your testes

1094
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,640
was the primordial soup for your ascension

1095
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,480
to repair your fucking life.

1096
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,280
People can tell you and tell you what to do

1097
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,440
and how to fix things.

1098
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,240
But if you don't feel bad and you don't feel regret

1099
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,960
for what you did and you feel absolutely ashamed

1100
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,440
of what you did, then you're not going to get better.

1101
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,280
You're not.

1102
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,920
The pain was your trusty, biological suicide of feeling

1103
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,880
that turned your life around.

1104
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,200
Are we anywhere close to the end here?

1105
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,040
Yes, yes.

1106
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,960
Okay, okay.

1107
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,720
So next time you let a conversation

1108
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,280
awkwardly linger for a second or two,

1109
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,680
you cheat on your husband

1110
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,640
or you draw terrible porn to the 13 year old

1111
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,320
that you post on the internet,

1112
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,400
know that the very pain that courses through your soul

1113
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,000
is your ticket to redemption.

1114
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,760
And that's the only way you can let shame

1115
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,600
positively impact you.

1116
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,200
You have to just, you have to take it

1117
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,400
and remember what you've done.

1118
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,240
That's why shame is good

1119
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,160
and it will never go away ever.

1120
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,280
And that's just a clear blueprint

1121
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,280
to be better at everything.

1122
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,800
Yeah, I would say that that is exactly

1123
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,440
what I think about shame.

1124
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,440
The only thing is I only take shame

1125
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,680
from sources that I trust, you know?

1126
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,640
If a friend that I trust the opinion of

1127
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,680
tells me that I'm doing something wrong,

1128
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,880
I will think, oh, oh, I gotta think about this.

1129
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,480
But if it's just a bunch of people that I know are stupid,

1130
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,760
then I'm not gonna feel shame.

1131
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,960
Like if it's like a societal thing

1132
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,600
that is like generally, oh, you shouldn't say swears.

1133
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,960
Like, well, fuck off, you know?

1134
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,720
Like I don't need to change because of things like that.

1135
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,720
But, you know, that's why like trying to get rid of shame

1136
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,880
of societal shame isn't good

1137
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,000
because some people choose the wrong things

1138
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,680
to like not change.

1139
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,240
Like you shouldn't fuck children.

1140
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,560
Ah, get out of here.

1141
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,880
Like that, those guys, those guys should

1142
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,800
try and change themselves.

1143
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,840
They just, you know, they're crazy.

1144
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,400
You need to pick and choose your battles, dude.

1145
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,960
You have to always, you know,

1146
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,280
try and evaluate things yourself.

1147
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,280
And it's gonna be hard.

1148
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,800
You just have to figure out what the people around you think

1149
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,760
because that's what really matters most to us.

1150
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,280
A lot of people will hear you guys talking about how like

1151
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,920
it's what the people around you say

1152
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,480
and it's all the societal stuff.

1153
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,080
And they will use that, like, okay,

1154
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,040
all these positivity movements

1155
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,920
think that like shame is bullshit.

1156
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,160
And like a lot of people want to escape shame

1157
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,560
because it feels completely arbitrary

1158
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,080
and like it doesn't mean anything.

1159
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,800
That's also abdicating responsibility

1160
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,440
and that infuriates me.

1161
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,440
Yeah, like for the body positivity movement, for example.

1162
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,960
Okay, let's say you're a big, fat, fatty piece of shit

1163
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,280
and you want to, and people are giving you shit for it.

1164
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,600
You're getting shit for being fat.

1165
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,360
People are calling you a fatty.

1166
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,680
They're making fun of you.

1167
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,880
Okay, let's say that's happening.

1168
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,880
Okay, so you are experiencing shame.

1169
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,800
I totally get why your reaction to that could be,

1170
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,880
well, this is bullshit.

1171
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
Like what's even the problem with me being fat?

1172
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,160
I am who I am.

1173
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,480
They need to fucking live with these curves.

1174
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,200
It's their problem, not mine.

1175
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,080
Like why, what is the problem here?

1176
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,200
Okay, what you need to do is

1177
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,960
you can't just say I should not feel bad.

1178
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,400
It is wrong that I feel bad about X.

1179
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,200
Let's, that's it.

1180
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,680
What you need to do is sit down and be honest

1181
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,560
and analyze the facts on the ground.

1182
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,720
Is there actually a good case

1183
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,160
for why things are the way they are?

1184
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,200
Fat shaming comes from a long history

1185
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,720
of people generally being skinnier

1186
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,480
and now all of a sudden we've got a big fat obesity crisis

1187
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,040
and lots of people are literally as fat.

1188
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,280
Like half of the American population is as fat

1189
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,560
as like the carnival show Fat Freaks

1190
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,880
at carnivals of like the 20s and shit.

1191
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,680
It's insane and it's disgusting

1192
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,080
and people need to fucking fix their shit.

1193
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,080
But like, so there is a real reason why people say

1194
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,000
like, hey, you should lose weight.

1195
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,920
Whether they do it in a mean way or a nice way.

1196
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,240
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to call anybody shit.

1197
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,720
I'm not actually trying to insult anybody.

1198
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,240
But there is a real reason why people experience,

1199
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,120
you know, blowback when they are extremely obese

1200
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,600
because it is bad for them.

1201
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,320
There are real studies about this.

1202
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,640
It's real, it's real.

1203
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,320
You can't run up the fucking hill.

1204
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
There's two different like aspects to this as well

1205
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,800
because like there's the people who like,

1206
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,760
I don't care, I'm gonna eat what I want.

1207
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,800
I know it's unhealthy.

1208
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,040
I know I'm gonna die young, but I don't care.

1209
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,040
Oh, okay, okay.

1210
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,160
Yeah, there's those people

1211
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,600
which I wouldn't necessarily like,

1212
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,320
I think you're gross if you eat.

1213
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,160
That is degeneracy, that is degeneracy.

1214
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,880
But then there's the people with the body positivity

1215
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,040
who say it's healthy to be obese.

1216
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,520
It's healthy to be whatever weight you want,

1217
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,720
which is the dangerous stuff that you should,

1218
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,120
like that is bad.

1219
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,600
You should know at least what you're doing.

1220
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,880
Like you can do what you like.

1221
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,320
You can die young and fat if you really want to,

1222
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,080
but as long as you know that's what you're doing.

1223
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,920
You know?

1224
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,160
The problem is the spreading of misinformation.

1225
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,000
But see, that's, I think you're touching on exactly

1226
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,040
what I was saying earlier about how eroding shame

1227
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,200
is bad for society because in this quest to erode shame,

1228
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,320
we're now misconstruing facts and lying to people

1229
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,560
in order to make everybody feel better, and that's bad.

1230
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,600
And to go back to what you were saying, Nate,

1231
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,640
with like the fat shaming thing,

1232
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,160
because like I don't want to pick on fat people,

1233
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,320
but this is a great example

1234
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,040
because it's very tangible and easy to understand

1235
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,560
to kind of explain this more of like a wider context

1236
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,000
is that if you, I think for me,

1237
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,480
the shame thing has always been my internal,

1238
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,640
like just enjoyment of something versus the external shame.

1239
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,120
So like if I enjoy myself enough

1240
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,120
that the shame isn't a problem anymore,

1241
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,360
then I'm just gonna do it.

1242
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,400
No matter, you know, like as long as I'm not hurting

1243
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,960
anybody else, like that's usually, you know,

1244
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,880
if you're hurting other people,

1245
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,320
there's the, you have a whole different story.

1246
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,800
But if it's just like affecting you

1247
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,600
and you're having fun more than the negative impact of it,

1248
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,720
then just do you.

1249
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,400
So like if you're someone who just is like super fat,

1250
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,160
eats tons of food, doesn't want to exercise,

1251
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,440
and you're just like, you know what?

1252
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,280
I enjoy my life.

1253
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,160
This is what I want to do with it.

1254
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,400
Like go ham.

1255
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,080
But then there's people who are going to like

1256
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,880
the fat acceptance movement and things like that.

1257
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,720
They're doing that not because they are actually proud

1258
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,560
of what they're doing.

1259
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,160
It's because they're ashamed and they're afraid

1260
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,520
and they hurt and they're trying to get rid of that hurt

1261
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,120
and they're using this as an excuse

1262
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,600
because there's a lot of people

1263
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,840
that before this whole fat acceptance movement,

1264
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,080
if someone said, here's a pill,

1265
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,600
it'll make you have slim tomorrow,

1266
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,320
they would have taken it in an instant.

1267
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,680
But now they've internalized this

1268
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,280
and it's become part of their identity

1269
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,040
because they're too afraid to put the work in

1270
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,600
to do what they actually would want to do.

1271
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,300
They're treating the symptom of shame and not the disease

1272
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,720
that is the underlying cause.

1273
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,240
And I mean, I'm not always saying it's necessarily

1274
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
always going to be a disease, every type of shame.

1275
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,320
Like if you're, I don't know, just an example.

1276
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,400
Like if you're like a black kid in like a white school

1277
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,440
and like they talk shit on you

1278
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,480
because you're black and different,

1279
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,040
then like obviously that's not cool.

1280
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,080
You got, you know, that's a reason to not, you know,

1281
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,400
to fight back and shit.

1282
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,020
But like there are real tangible things to, you know,

1283
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,900
to get, to be shame for.

1284
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,620
I think I should talk for a second.

1285
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,860
He's as the token fat character of the PCP.

1286
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,940
Indeed.

1287
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,900
I would like to explain my reasoning for being fat

1288
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,540
on trial here.

1289
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,020
By the way, you don't have to defend yourself.

1290
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,940
You are anybody else.

1291
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,820
You can do whatever you want,

1292
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,860
but you know, you can expect blow black.

1293
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,460
Blow, blow fat.

1294
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,300
Blow black.

1295
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, blow fat if you will.

1296
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,460
I more or less fall into the category one hippo described

1297
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,620
of I, my priorities just do not lie in the,

1298
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,780
in the physical world.

1299
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,940
I'm about the digital gamer world.

1300
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,460
And you may mock me in the physical world,

1301
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,100
but in the game world, I reign supreme.

1302
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,060
And my favorite is top level.

1303
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,340
And you cannot defeat my blade.

1304
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,580
He is the platinum trophies reign from the sky.

1305
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,020
It's unbelievable.

1306
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,420
But seriously, I might like my parties just do not lie

1307
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,420
in me living that long or me, you know, being attractive.

1308
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,980
And I do realize that I am less attractive

1309
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,140
than if I was skinny.

1310
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,620
I realize all of these things with, you know,

1311
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,060
fat being there because they're just true.

1312
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,180
I mean, obviously there's going to be people

1313
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,260
who like fat people and they're going to people who like.

1314
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,740
To be fair, fat guy is kind of a look.

1315
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,700
It's kind of a look that I kind of like.

1316
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,620
I kind of like it.

1317
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,700
I'm just saying, I'm just telling you

1318
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,460
for your information guys, fat girl is not a good look.

1319
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,300
It's not a good look.

1320
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,180
I'm just giving you the facts people.

1321
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,060
Obviously there will be outliers, but that's just, you know.

1322
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:17,900
Of course.

1323
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,740
Of course.

1324
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,580
That's just, again, that's the, what's the word?

1325
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,580
That's how most of society feels.

1326
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,420
And I understand that.

1327
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,860
And while I'm not, I wouldn't say I'm ashamed of being fat.

1328
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,100
I'm not happy about it

1329
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,340
because there's nothing to be happy about.

1330
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,140
It's simply me not dedicating like the runescape points.

1331
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,180
I've never played runescape.

1332
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,380
The runescape points to doing this.

1333
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,940
One can recognize faults with themselves

1334
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,460
and imperfections and not let it consume them

1335
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,020
in terms of like, oh, I'm worthless now.

1336
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,100
Like I have this thing that's not ideal.

1337
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,220
Like I honestly want to lose weight

1338
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,460
and I think about it a lot and it's a little bit embarrassing.

1339
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,580
And like I want to lose like 10 pounds

1340
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,500
and I'll be happy about it.

1341
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,300
Until then I feel embarrassed and ashamed of it.

1342
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,900
So, you know, like that's me doing it in my,

1343
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,980
I very much practice what I preach here.

1344
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,860
That's why I work out every fucking week

1345
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,620
so that I can feel better about this.

1346
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,620
I have accepted the responsibility

1347
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,060
of taking care of this for myself.

1348
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,100
It's all about responsibility.

1349
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,420
It's about accountability.

1350
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,620
I understand that it is my fault and my fault alone

1351
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,300
that occasionally I'll be like, oh man, I'm fat.

1352
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,660
But that's a fleeting thing.

1353
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,980
And that doesn't consume me

1354
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,580
because I'm not, that's not where my priorities lie.

1355
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,820
And I don't know, part of me feels like

1356
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,260
that shouldn't be for you either.

1357
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,700
Not like you Nate or that like physicality does not matter

1358
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,340
or that being attractive does not matter.

1359
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,660
I'm just saying like, like for you fat acceptance people,

1360
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,020
you shouldn't let this thing that is your fault

1361
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,260
and an ailment of you consume your thoughts.

1362
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,780
If you want to be a fat broad,

1363
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,700
well then you're just a fat broad.

1364
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,060
There's no, there are going to be,

1365
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,820
there are going to be men that like you regardless

1366
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,980
of how much we do not like it.

1367
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,180
There are going to be people that like you.

1368
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,380
There will always be a look for everyone

1369
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,420
and you're not a worthless person.

1370
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,460
I do not think you're a bad person.

1371
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,780
But you can't just say that it is good

1372
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,380
or it is healthy.

1373
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,260
It's, it's just simply a not healthy

1374
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,900
and I don't know a good aspect of it.

1375
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,140
I think another component of this is that people

1376
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,060
have changed this idea of tolerance

1377
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,740
to like welcoming things with open arms.

1378
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,620
Tolerance is not even praise.

1379
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,660
But that's exactly, that's like the whole problem

1380
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,360
is that like you can be fat

1381
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,020
or you can be whatever sort of like socially

1382
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,740
unaccepted thing you want to be,

1383
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,580
but don't expect people to like fucking give you praise for it.

1384
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,820
Like, you know, people give you shit.

1385
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,740
Like that's just part of doing what you're doing.

1386
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,460
It's going against the social fabric.

1387
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,980
And like tolerance is not, is not being actively trying

1388
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,820
to stop you.

1389
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,660
That's what tolerance is.

1390
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,780
To tolerate something is to say, it's there.

1391
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,380
I'm not going to do anything about it.

1392
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,220
And that's it.

1393
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,180
It's not accepting it with open arms.

1394
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,140
So like, don't, I think this whole idea

1395
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,780
of like trying to eradicate shame is bullshit

1396
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,780
and is never going to work.

1397
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,220
And I think it's, yeah, it's ridiculous.

1398
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,380
It knows it's never going to work.

1399
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,100
It's act, if it, like the, the, the entries it takes

1400
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,460
will be extremely destructive.

1401
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:08,340
I mean, I have no doubt that the fat positive moment

1402
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,300
has completely destroyed some people.

1403
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,020
It has made some people feel vindicated

1404
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,740
in their ability to not stop eating.

1405
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,580
And it's just made them fucking, I don't know.

1406
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,420
I don't know.

1407
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,780
I don't know the stats, but you know,

1408
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,660
it definitely will not be.

1409
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,460
I mean, let's, let's just say there's been a measurable rise

1410
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,300
in BBW LVR license plates across the nation.

1411
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,540
And that's, that's a tragedy in its own way.

1412
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,940
It raises paw.

1413
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:37,100
It, it, incidentally, I guess I can't say

1414
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,580
the fat positive moment is all bad

1415
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,140
because we do have a BBW LVR.

1416
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,660
But I don't remember the thing.

1417
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,340
So, so, so, so maybe there's something to it all along.

1418
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,660
Okay, that's fair.

1419
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,340
Well, I don't know.

1420
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,180
It's cool.

1421
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,100
Let me, let me tell you about the time

1422
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,540
I pooped in my bed.

1423
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,380
Okay.

1424
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,220
Great.

1425
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:00,260
Well, I took a shit in my bed.

1426
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,220
And that's, there's a little more to it.

1427
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,060
There's a little more to it.

1428
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,260
I just, I got really drunk one night

1429
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,300
and I was, I was living with some friends

1430
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,380
and I won't, I blacked out and I woke up the next day.

1431
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,900
This was adulthood?

1432
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,740
Yeah, yeah.

1433
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,500
This was, this was, yeah, I was like 23 or 24.

1434
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,140
Oh no.

1435
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,820
Well, listen, see, I don't understand.

1436
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,780
I don't really, I can't really explain it.

1437
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,380
I just woke up after having been blackout drunk

1438
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,060
and there was just poop on my bed.

1439
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,100
And I was like, maybe you're afraid.

1440
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,860
I don't want to hear this story.

1441
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,100
And I was like, well, why would there,

1442
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,860
I mean, my, my, I was, I'm right next to the bathroom.

1443
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,100
My room is right next to the bathroom.

1444
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,340
Why would I come into my own room and poop on,

1445
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,860
like not in my bed, just on my blankets and everything.

1446
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,620
So I told everyone, and I convinced myself

1447
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,660
that a cat had done it, like a cat had shit on my bed.

1448
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,740
But like, I don't know.

1449
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,980
I don't know if I really truly believe that.

1450
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,820
You know what I mean?

1451
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,340
But we all know the forbidden snack

1452
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,420
that is just pissing and shitting yourself in bed

1453
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,500
so you don't have to get up.

1454
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,700
Well, there was no pee.

1455
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,540
At least I don't agree.

1456
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,420
Unspoken rule of the PCP, that you have to,

1457
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,700
that's the hazing ritual.

1458
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,020
You have to pee in his bed to get into the PCP.

1459
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,060
Oh, come on, no. There was no pee.

1460
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,300
There was just some poop.

1461
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,340
And I was like, well, it was, it was a cat.

1462
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,580
But like, no one believed me.

1463
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,100
And I didn't really believe myself,

1464
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,500
but I don't really know.

1465
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,620
And like, I had to take the blanket out in the backyard

1466
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,260
and spray it down with a hose and stuff.

1467
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,860
And it was very embarrassing.

1468
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,780
You know what that reminds me of?

1469
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,420
There's a story our dad has, when our dad was a kid,

1470
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,100
he got, he got like hit in the head with like a golf club

1471
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,000
and he got really messed up.

1472
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,760
So he had to be bedridden for like a long time.

1473
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,680
I remember this story and the story is weird

1474
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,520
and I don't get it.

1475
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,360
It is, okay.

1476
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,400
But like one day, just like he's in bed,

1477
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,240
you know, he's just laid up

1478
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,360
and like his parents are better or whatever.

1479
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,800
And like everybody else goes out

1480
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,640
and his parents has gotten him a bunch of like weird

1481
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,160
tasting chocolates.

1482
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,960
So he's, he's just sucking on a chocolate.

1483
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,800
You know, I was like a little kid.

1484
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,640
He's like seven or something.

1485
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,200
They tell him like, don't get out of bed or you'll die.

1486
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,080
Yeah, that's right.

1487
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,880
Do not get out of bed or you'll die.

1488
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,960
And so he, he gets one of these chocolates

1489
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,000
from like the bedside table.

1490
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,320
He puts it in his mouth and it's just like rank.

1491
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,240
It's just like vile.

1492
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,440
It's like the most disgusting thing he's ever eaten.

1493
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,640
And he just spits it out into his hand.

1494
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,160
And like, okay, so he's in this bed, right?

1495
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,560
He's got a melting chocolate in his hand.

1496
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,920
The sheets are white.

1497
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,720
The sheets are pristine white.

1498
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,280
And like he's got chocolate all over himself

1499
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,120
and the walls are right there.

1500
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,720
So he's like, well, okay, here's what's happening.

1501
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,080
And so he proceeds to smear the chocolate on the wall,

1502
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,640
just in a big brown streak on the wall.

1503
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,120
And then, you know, he's just living in fear

1504
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,440
of what's to come.

1505
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,080
And then like his parents get home, like my grandparents.

1506
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,880
And they're just like, you pooped the bed.

1507
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,720
What, why would you do that to the wall?

1508
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,040
What did the wall do to you?

1509
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,880
That was exactly how they said it too.

1510
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,720
You pooped the wall.

1511
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,560
That's what they said.

1512
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,400
You pooped the wall.

1513
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,040
You pooped the wall.

1514
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,200
Unbelievable, but apparently true.

1515
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,560
So there you go.

1516
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,680
That sounds awful.

1517
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,560
I hate everything that just is transpired.

1518
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,680
It's strange, but it's stupid and infuriating story.

1519
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,760
I'm so upset that it's gotten this way.

1520
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,440
It's good to know that the Bestman family,

1521
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,720
or whatever you want to call yourself,

1522
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,040
has a lineage of poop stories.

1523
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,200
I do not have one.

1524
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,440
I have no poop stories.

1525
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,280
Yeah, right.

1526
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,240
That means it's coming.

1527
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,080
That means it's coming.

1528
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,600
That's a pretty stretch goal.

1529
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,920
Nate shits himself.

1530
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,760
Please.

1531
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,760
You're cursed by the family goblin, the shit goblin.

1532
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,360
Eventually, he'll shit on your bed.

1533
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:26,840
How fun.

1534
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:32,800
And I have one little embarrassing moment.

1535
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,880
We've got all the speeches out, but I think

1536
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,840
it's time for just anecdotes at this word.

1537
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,560
Yeah.

1538
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,680
Well, as a kid, I was just embarrassing as a default.

1539
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,160
So I can't think of very many particular moments

1540
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,800
that were incredibly embarrassing,

1541
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,560
but there was a drama class that I had to go to.

1542
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,240
And drama was like, oh, no, not on stage.

1543
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,080
I can't do it.

1544
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,000
But I didn't say anything.

1545
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,160
I was just sort of like put a look at the floor

1546
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,440
when they asked me to come up.

1547
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,560
And it was generally a voluntary thing.

1548
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,520
Like they would do some things in groups, like group in pairs,

1549
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,360
and you've got to act out this scene.

1550
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,920
You know, like, oh, no.

1551
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,440
And I never did anything and ever.

1552
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,120
Like I would never, ever do anything.

1553
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,160
And they would say, well, OK, you don't have to.

1554
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,600
And I would always be in the audience.

1555
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,240
And there was this one time where I plucked up the courage.

1556
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,000
Like they were cheering because it was kind of a meme

1557
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,520
that I would not do drama.

1558
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,200
I would never go up on stage and do anything.

1559
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,400
And everybody in my class knew.

1560
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,760
They knew that I hated drama.

1561
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,240
And this one time I stood up when asked.

1562
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,720
And they were like, oh, my God.

1563
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,800
And it was really like the first baby steps of stuff.

1564
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,480
So I wasn't really acting.

1565
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,000
I was just on the stage as the other guys did something.

1566
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,280
And then I looked at them.

1567
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,360
It's basically, if you go to the BronyCon thing, it's that.

1568
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,400
I'm just standing there looking at the crowd.

1569
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,960
And then I leave.

1570
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,400
It sounds hate stages.

1571
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,000
You know, that's a good, I'm glad you mentioned that.

1572
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I almost forgot about that.

1573
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,880
I am a little embarrassed of my performance

1574
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,040
at BronyCon 2 for me.

1575
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,600
Just going up on that stage and just, you know.

1576
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,920
I'm unbelievably embarrassed about my performance there.

1577
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,040
Yeah, yeah.

1578
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,640
OK, mine was the worst.

1579
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,560
I love the bit with the toilet paper, Ben.

1580
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,440
It was really inspired.

1581
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,520
No, please don't mention that.

1582
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,760
I hate myself.

1583
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,840
Ben, the toilet paper again, he can't escape at this guy.

1584
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,760
Yeah, it's just a poop lord.

1585
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,120
Poop story after poop story.

1586
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,200
It's poop stories all the way down with me.

1587
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,520
This actually brings up an interesting point.

1588
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,200
Well, actually, two things.

1589
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,920
One, what was the latest time you felt genuinely real 100%

1590
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,240
embarrassed?

1591
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,240
Because we have small and embarrassing things

1592
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,680
that happen to us every day.

1593
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,640
But when was the last time you felt like actually,

1594
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,520
genuinely, like, oh, god, I really actually fucked up?

1595
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,600
And also, second, maybe as I have this,

1596
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,680
do you guys have a period of your life that just

1597
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,360
was embarrassment central, that you can take apart

1598
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,240
starting and ending dates and the reasons you felt like?

1599
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,040
You know what I've got?

1600
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,720
I went on that golden age.

1601
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,120
I have a nega embarrassment a time in my life,

1602
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,080
which is very interesting.

1603
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,760
Nate, an urban embarrassment, please.

1604
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Yes, forgive me.

1605
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,760
I think this was in middle school, like first or second,

1606
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,440
like fifth or sixth grade or something.

1607
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,040
It might have been a little earlier than that.

1608
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,320
OK, but anyway, it was just like, I wanted to,

1609
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,800
my parents wanted to give me a retainer from the orthodontist.

1610
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,520
You know, like a retainer that goes around your head

1611
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,960
and fucking fixes your teeth and shit.

1612
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,840
And it was a big headpiece.

1613
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,880
It was called headgear.

1614
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,560
Sorry, headgear is the term I'm trying to find.

1615
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,040
I remember.

1616
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,360
It was fucking headgear.

1617
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,280
And when we went to the orthodontist, like, hey,

1618
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,720
you need headgear, I was like, OK.

1619
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,480
And they're like, OK, so like, if you wear it at night,

1620
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,680
you'll be done in a year.

1621
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,040
And I said, what if I wore it all the time?

1622
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,920
And they said, well, six months.

1623
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,720
But like, are you sure you want to do that?

1624
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,520
And I was like, hell yeah, boy.

1625
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,560
Strutted out of the office in my heelies.

1626
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,600
And so I just wore headgear for like a full six months of school.

1627
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,080
And I was never embarrassed about it.

1628
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,320
I had like no problems.

1629
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,040
I have no negative feelings even associated with it.

1630
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,000
It was a really a Chad move, I suppose,

1631
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,880
only was completely unnecessary.

1632
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,120
And I could have just worn it at night.

1633
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,880
Why did I do it?

1634
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,520
I don't know.

1635
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,360
I just didn't care.

1636
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,360
That builds up your reserve so when you became an anime man,

1637
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,800
you could buy that vampire 100D hat.

1638
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,840
And you don't feel bad about it.

1639
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,520
Very true.

1640
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,400
Very true.

1641
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,560
That totally is a fucking Chad move.

1642
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,080
That's a fucking, that's a make-up move.

1643
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,880
That's totally a give-it-it, isn't it?

1644
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,400
And like, you know, I'm just going to take responsibility.

1645
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,520
I'm just going to fucking do this all in one go.

1646
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,960
That was the birth of weird utilitarianism.

1647
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:44,600
Yeah, yeah.

1648
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,200
Indeed.

1649
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:45,720
It's true.

1650
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,480
It's very true.

1651
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,480
Also the first thing I said, what was the last time

1652
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,600
you felt like genuinely embarrassed, Nate?

1653
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,320
Like recently?

1654
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,840
Oh, I would just say that occasionally at work,

1655
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,800
at my real job, like discussion comes up of my YouTube stuff.

1656
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:07,040
And just whenever that happens, I feel a little terror inside.

1657
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
That is the worst.

1658
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,800
Wait, why does it come up at work?

1659
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,880
OK, there have been times when it has just like,

1660
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,760
there's just situations where like I can't quite avoid saying

1661
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,400
like what, like I could lie when these questions are asked,

1662
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,840
but instead I'm just like, yeah, you know,

1663
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,480
I do like some online stuff.

1664
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,680
You know, it's just like a, just a little thing I do.

1665
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,200
And nobody, nobody there now like knows very much of it.

1666
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,840
And nobody pays attention or really cares.

1667
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,560
And like I've shared a little more information

1668
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,640
with some of the guys who are actually pretty cool at work.

1669
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,640
But like, yeah, like one of the guys, this guy Brad

1670
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,440
that I work with just said like, hey,

1671
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,480
congrats on 60K, dude.

1672
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,480
I was like, oh, no.

1673
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,960
Yeah, there's just the fact that he could then like tell

1674
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,840
like my fucking like real boss about like the things

1675
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,680
I'm doing and saying online.

1676
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,000
Oh, no.

1677
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,480
I like to imagine like whenever there's like a cordially

1678
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,920
report or like whatever, your boss interviews someone else

1679
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,240
that just like, the boss just like,

1680
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,320
so what subscriber account is Nate at now?

1681
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,800
You're never gonna believe what video this guy just put out.

1682
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,440
No way am I embarrassed of like any of the content.

1683
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,680
It's just, what I'm embarrassed of is this crossing

1684
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,920
of the world to these people who know nothing

1685
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,960
about any of this stuff.

1686
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,280
That's it.

1687
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,560
If work, Nate, walks through the PCP door,

1688
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,560
that will kill PCP Nate.

1689
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,400
It's true.

1690
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,240
It's true.

1691
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,840
It's like the meeting of the, the George's

1692
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,960
or colliding sort of situation going on.

1693
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,960
It's exactly what it is.

1694
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,440
That reminds me at New Year's this year, like a couple,

1695
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,040
a couple of people like had like seen on Facebook

1696
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,120
and stuff that like I had a Kickstarter and shit.

1697
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,200
Like a couple of people, these aren't people

1698
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,040
that I like know very well or friends with.

1699
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,320
They're like in my extended circle.

1700
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,200
And a couple of them asked me about like the kick starters.

1701
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,800
There was this one drunk girl who was like,

1702
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,200
oh yeah, I'm really interested.

1703
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,040
She had some shit to say.

1704
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,880
It didn't matter.

1705
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,320
The point is, the point is that it came up

1706
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,840
and was being talked about and I was fucking mortified

1707
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,080
that like real, these real human people in real life

1708
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,440
were like talking, cause I have no idea what to say about it.

1709
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,480
It's like, I made this thing and it's on the internet

1710
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,000
and you're asking me questions

1711
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,960
and I'm like, what am I supposed to say?

1712
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,560
I appreciate the interest, but please,

1713
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,920
please I have nothing for you.

1714
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,000
Yeah, I hear you.

1715
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,400
I don't know what you guys' deal is.

1716
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,400
That's, that'd be cool.

1717
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,640
If I was, if so I was walking down the street

1718
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:28,640
strutting my stuff as I do and some lowly coward asked me

1719
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,800
something about, I don't know, fucking the Japanese Juggalo.

1720
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,080
Munchy, you're like a Gwynn and Ben is like a furtive pygmy.

1721
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,840
So easily forgot, so easily forgot.

1722
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,680
He doesn't want to be seen.

1723
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,080
I mean, I did appreciate it and I thought it was cool,

1724
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,040
but I also felt like very, very embarrassed at the same time.

1725
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,360
Remember when we were talking about T-Baptome?

1726
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,520
That was always humiliating.

1727
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,360
Yeah.

1728
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,200
Yeah.

1729
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,840
I think it's just you have, when you have an online persona,

1730
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,280
you kind of like sit down

1731
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,040
and like you have a way of presenting yourself online

1732
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,600
that is definitely different from real life.

1733
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,680
So when you have to like try and like turn that switch on

1734
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,080
when you're not in front of a screen,

1735
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,960
you're just like, what the, what, how do I do this?

1736
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,800
Yeah.

1737
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm not used to this.

1738
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,840
It's weird though, cause like-

1739
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,080
It's not even embarrassment, it's just discomfort

1740
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,680
and not being able to under really know

1741
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,080
how to present yourself at that point.

1742
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,520
I mean, for Ben specifically, you do comics

1743
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,720
and that's like more of a real world thing anyways.

1744
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,200
So if anything, it would feel less embarrassing than to say,

1745
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,920
I have a YouTube channel, I do Pokemon Let's Play.

1746
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,440
You can't say, I do, I make comics.

1747
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,640
Hey guys, it's me, Ben, I'm a real pokey tuber.

1748
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,480
Yeah, he sure is, he sure is.

1749
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,760
You might think so, but I feel just as embarrassed.

1750
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,080
I feel just as embarrassed talking about the vapors

1751
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,720
as I did talking about T-Bab.

1752
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,440
It's made me wonder if I was even really bothered

1753
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,720
by the whole pony thing in the first place.

1754
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,560
Yeah, exactly.

1755
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,800
I mean, yeah, I think so.

1756
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,080
I'm like, it's embarrassing.

1757
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:47,920
I don't know, man.

1758
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,760
It's something about the way,

1759
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,280
it's like if they were to go watch a video,

1760
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,960
it's like they'd expect me to act like that around them

1761
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,600
or they'd be like, why don't you?

1762
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,240
I don't know, something weird's going on there

1763
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,360
and I can't quite articulate it.

1764
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,200
It is weird.

1765
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,120
Yeah, I can't quite explain my feelings

1766
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,440
on the subject either.

1767
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,960
Yeah, yeah.

1768
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,320
I just, I don't know, cause like no one feels ashamed.

1769
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,720
Like if you were fucking Harvey Oswald

1770
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,200
or whoever makes comics nowadays.

1771
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,280
Lee Harvey Oswald?

1772
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1773
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,040
If you were just someone like that,

1774
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,960
then you wouldn't be, like if you were Brian Leo Malley

1775
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,600
and someone's like, oh, you draw comics,

1776
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,640
you'd be like, yeah, I do.

1777
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,480
I actually think I would.

1778
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,720
That's a respected job.

1779
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,440
I actually think I would be kind of like,

1780
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,840
oh yeah, I guess I'm Brian Leo Malley,

1781
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,440
but I don't really want to talk about it.

1782
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,440
You know, but if you think about what it would mean

1783
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,040
to be him, to like have fucking movies

1784
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,720
and like book deals and like be, like that's,

1785
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,480
you're, you know, I do.

1786
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,880
I just think that like if you're really on that level,

1787
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,400
like your world has changed

1788
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,120
and like it's not like being like a small time YouTuber

1789
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,560
or anything, it's like a different, it's like real.

1790
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,640
It's like real and then you're like more,

1791
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,840
I'd feel more like, like a business executive

1792
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,840
like uncle of mine would like be like, oh yes,

1793
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,080
you're raking in XYZ and the infrastructure stock.

1794
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,400
And that's the opposite of embarrassment.

1795
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,680
That's social credit, like social credit at that point.

1796
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,520
Right.

1797
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,360
Yeah.

1798
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,640
I keep imagining Ben as Quentin Tarantino

1799
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,280
and people come up to him and say, oh dude,

1800
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,320
I love Pulp Fiction.

1801
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,960
And he's like, oh yeah, I don't know.

1802
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,320
Yeah, I guess, I guess.

1803
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,480
Well, that reminds me, Nate, do you remember that one time

1804
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,160
that our dad got really like weird about the fact

1805
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,040
that we were swearing on T-Bap?

1806
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,440
A little bit, yes.

1807
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,120
He was like, and this is stuck with me

1808
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,000
because I remember I asked him, I was like, dad, okay,

1809
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,120
this is gonna sound really fucking pretentious

1810
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,200
and like I'm really fucking up my own ass

1811
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,920
and think I'm hot shit here.

1812
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,480
But I was just trying to make a point.

1813
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,280
I was like about art and I was like, dad,

1814
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,960
do you think that Quentin Tarantino is embarrassed

1815
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,600
by Pulp Fiction because people say fucking it?

1816
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,440
Okay.

1817
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,120
And I was like, of course,

1818
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,240
of course not, right?

1819
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,000
Like of course the answer is no.

1820
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,040
But dad didn't say no.

1821
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,120
He was like, well, I'm sure he's in some cases,

1822
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,720
I was like, god damn it.

1823
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,880
Well, I get his point.

1824
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,320
I just fucking agree with me because I'm right.

1825
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,320
He's seeing this like, dad's thinking about this

1826
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,840
the same way he thinks about like people who post like,

1827
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,840
because this is frame of reference,

1828
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,920
like pictures of themselves like swearing

1829
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,440
or drunk on Facebook, like, oh, how embarrassing.

1830
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,920
Oh, this is gonna stick with you forever,

1831
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,760
as opposed to like an actual like comedy video

1832
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,080
where it's all like intentional

1833
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,840
and presented in this way deliberately.

1834
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,680
Yeah.

1835
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,000
You know, that's how he's thinking about it.

1836
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,760
This is a work of fiction.

1837
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,440
This is a work of creative energy.

1838
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,240
And it's a work of artifice.

1839
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,480
Maybe.

1840
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,400
Whatever.

1841
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,200
Maybe shame has been corroded for me

1842
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,480
because I don't even think of swearing

1843
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,160
as like a degrading or like embarrassing thing.

1844
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,000
It just helps me communicate.

1845
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,840
There is a certain audience.

1846
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,600
There's a generational thing.

1847
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,120
Like I think millennials and under,

1848
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,880
like Gen Xers and millennials

1849
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,520
and like it's with every,

1850
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,760
it's swearing has just become less and less of a thing.

1851
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,760
I don't even think swearing exists anymore

1852
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,680
unless you're like over the age of 40.

1853
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,360
Modern day swearing is bringing up topics

1854
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,680
that are like, oh, God, shut up, like politics.

1855
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,560
Like that is swearing now at it.

1856
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,760
Yeah, yeah.

1857
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,560
Like if you say Donald Trump anywhere,

1858
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,760
like, oh, why would you say that?

1859
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,120
More like Donald Trump.

1860
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,960
Please.

1861
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,800
Thank you.

1862
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,040
Donald Trump is like,

1863
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,760
the butt to ass, you know?

1864
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,600
Exactly.

1865
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,920
I was gonna say it's the crap to shit

1866
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,960
and things of that nature.

1867
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:31,800
Yeah, exactly.

1868
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,080
Don't say, you gotta hone that down a bit.

1869
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,080
Tune in to the bonus of this month, ladies and gentlemen.

1870
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,040
Oh my God.

1871
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,880
It's gonna be incredible.

1872
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,720
You're gonna want to see that, guys.

1873
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,120
You're gonna want to fucking see that shit.

1874
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,240
But it's like the same things where the old ladies

1875
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,720
will say, oh, what's your language?

1876
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,360
I would do that with what's your topic?

1877
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,200
I don't want to hear it.

1878
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,040
Hey.

1879
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:51,880
Hey.

1880
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,880
Hey.

1881
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,960
Excellent.

1882
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,800
I'm just gonna jump in here and say

1883
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,000
my most recent embarrassment was yesterday.

1884
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,120
Oh, good.

1885
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:01,960
Yeah.

1886
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,960
I, for a school project, was going to a school.

1887
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:11,120
Like I wrote up an essay and for some reason at my school,

1888
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,760
they give you more points if you like speak your essay.

1889
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,880
And so I was going to like,

1890
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,440
I was gonna suck up to my teacher real hard

1891
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,120
and I was gonna try and like make it seem

1892
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,760
like I really actually genuinely cared

1893
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,080
about the things I was talking about.

1894
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,680
And so I was going to go to like a museum near where I live.

1895
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,000
Not like an indoor museum.

1896
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,680
I was just going to go near this like historic,

1897
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,360
it's kind of hard to accept, like a historical museum

1898
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,640
center block called Babbo Park.

1899
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,760
If you like Google it, viewers,

1900
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,880
and you'll get a better sense.

1901
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,960
I was inside of the museum screaming.

1902
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,120
But I was going to go there and I was going to like,

1903
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,560
like recite my essay just like a way for people

1904
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,720
not bothering anyone.

1905
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,720
But the mere idea of me pulling out my phone

1906
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,040
and like talking while there were people like,

1907
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,840
like could like see me like recording something

1908
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,000
that other people will see just made me

1909
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,720
so fucking upset and scared.

1910
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,560
Interesting.

1911
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,080
I've tried to do that because like there's people

1912
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,600
who like vlog just out on the streets or whatever.

1913
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,440
Yeah.

1914
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,280
How do they do that?

1915
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,440
I have no fucking clue.

1916
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,200
That's the scariest thing in the entire fucking world.

1917
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,840
I've been, I've tried multiple times

1918
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,520
and every time it's like, no, no, no.

1919
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,600
Yeah. Is it really embarrassing?

1920
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,440
I don't know, man.

1921
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,280
I don't know.

1922
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,200
I don't remember doing that.

1923
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,280
It's cause they're like infringing on their space.

1924
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,120
Kind of.

1925
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:24,960
Yeah.

1926
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,240
I think that's really where my thing comes from

1927
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,360
is just like, I don't feel like I have the right to do this.

1928
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,080
Cause I feel like if I was just walking

1929
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,400
and someone was like, hey guys, I'm shooting a vlog.

1930
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,320
I'd be like, I'm going to shoot you with a gun.

1931
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,640
Yeah.

1932
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,840
Here's the thing though.

1933
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,480
Wait, wait, give was going to say something.

1934
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,320
Sure, sure.

1935
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,200
Well, I was just going to say that one time

1936
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,200
I was walking through a park and doing that.

1937
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,560
Like I was vlogging in the park

1938
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,920
because I assumed nobody would be there.

1939
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,720
But of course there's dog walkers there.

1940
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,960
And when, you know, it's a long.

1941
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,880
We're like, we call them dog coin miners.

1942
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,200
That's what they're up there.

1943
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,040
Yeah.

1944
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:57,880
Okay.

1945
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,000
Sorry, sorry.

1946
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,920
So, and like there's parts where the path is just really long

1947
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,400
and they can see you for a long time

1948
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,840
and I can see them for a long time.

1949
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,680
Oh yeah.

1950
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,920
So I'm holding my camera in front of me.

1951
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,520
They can see that I have my camera

1952
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,280
and then they definitely know that I'm putting the camera down

1953
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,640
so that I can walk by them

1954
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,160
and I'm just going to bring it back up again.

1955
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,360
They know you're embarrassed.

1956
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,440
That's the worst part.

1957
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,480
Oh no.

1958
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,480
Here's the thing.

1959
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,400
I talk loud.

1960
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,080
Like when I'm with my friends

1961
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,480
and I'm walking down the street, I talk loud.

1962
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,920
People can definitely hear me

1963
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,280
when I'm just having normal conversation.

1964
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,240
But I will talk, like I talked really quiet

1965
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,160
when I was trying to record this video.

1966
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,000
Like I don't think anyone could hear me

1967
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,440
or I don't think anyone noticed me.

1968
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,680
But like, whereas like normally people will notice me.

1969
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,160
So why is it just the camera?

1970
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,880
Like the camera itself makes it embarrassing for some reason.

1971
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,720
It does.

1972
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,560
It does.

1973
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,520
Because people can see that you're like doing something

1974
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,280
and you're like recording something and they're like.

1975
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,120
Oh, I don't know.

1976
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,480
Oh, I just thought of a life hack about that.

1977
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,240
Like if you have like a phone.

1978
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,320
If you're filming on a phone

1979
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,080
and maybe you should have like a dummy phone

1980
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,800
and put the phone up to your ear.

1981
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,600
So if people look at you and they glance,

1982
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,640
they say, oh, he's talking to someone on the phone.

1983
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,280
He's not talking to his phone.

1984
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,400
Isn't he trying to film himself though?

1985
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,240
Yeah.

1986
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,960
You know, you just put sort of like,

1987
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,080
like, the pretend that they don't see that on.

1988
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,120
You just get a drone.

1989
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,600
You have the drone fly like over a hand.

1990
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,440
Yeah.

1991
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,280
Superb.

1992
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,120
That's how you do it, man.

1993
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:27,960
That's how you do it, man.

1994
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:28,900
You just have your phone.

1995
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,700
You've got that excruciatingly loud like

1996
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,840
rrrrrr of the fucking thing in the museum.

1997
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,440
It's okay guys, I'm just vlogging.

1998
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,400
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1999
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,960
Please ignore the drone.

2000
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,160
That was the cat material.

2001
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:48,080
By the way, Munchy, you mentioned school doing a school project. I've been wondering about

2002
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:53,640
this. You must be a god at your school. You must own that fucking place. Because like,

2003
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:58,280
how could these weak cowards that I went to school with possibly stack up to the intellectual

2004
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:04,080
juggernaut that you are, you know, just in real life. And these are lowly like 16, 17-year-old

2005
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,080
freaks.

2006
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:10,040
Honestly, you would, any high school person I've ever met in my life, you would crush

2007
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,040
them instantly.

2008
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,760
Yeah, what's the deal? What's that like? What's that like?

2009
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,680
Well, I actually don't know. I told this before, but I go to-

2010
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:18,680
I dropped out.

2011
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:24,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I went to an, well, I'm going to an online charter school. I've been

2012
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:32,040
in my senior year. So I don't go to a school. But when I did, that was before my, as I

2013
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:36,120
alluded to earlier, the golden age of me being embarrassing.

2014
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:41,000
So as you're saying, are you saying that like, that going to an online charter school

2015
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,040
has unlocked your Christ consciousness? Is that, is that where we all drop the ball?

2016
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,080
I think literally so.

2017
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,240
For Munchy, it's been a huge success. It's allowed you to do all the things I think like

2018
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,800
a charter school would like want their kids to be able to do. Like just live your life

2019
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,480
and make positive stuff and just do whatever you want.

2020
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,520
We missed the boat. If I had gone to a charter school, I could have been a cool dude like

2021
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,520
Munchy.

2022
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,520
Yeah.

2023
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,520
Yeah.

2024
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,120
I hear charter school and I think ship chart and I think like sailing around.

2025
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,120
It's a nautical school.

2026
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,120
Exactly.

2027
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,120
He's going to be an admiral when he grows up.

2028
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,120
He's sailing across the worldwide world.

2029
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,120
He's sailing around the, the surfing around the web.

2030
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,280
Hey, when he, when he graduates and he's an admiral, he can come on our ship and come

2031
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,280
on the podcast, patreon.com slash the podcast pirate.

2032
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,280
The propellant.

2033
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,280
Wait, I would like that.

2034
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,280
I'm Mr. Regular Old Rear Admiral Wattage.

2035
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,080
No, not Wattage. What was his name? What was the tentacle role? What was the tentacle

2036
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,080
role?

2037
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,080
Uh, colopsic.

2038
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,080
Colopsic.

2039
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,080
What a god.

2040
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,080
Uh, yeah.

2041
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,080
Sick reference.

2042
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:45,080
Back when I was in like, like normal school, I was, I was not a god by any means.

2043
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:49,080
I, I, I was, I was disabled kid tier.

2044
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,080
Oh no.

2045
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,080
That's bad.

2046
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
Oh no.

2047
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,080
That's bad you do.

2048
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,080
Yeah. That's, that was, it was real bad.

2049
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,080
It was.

2050
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,080
Interesting.

2051
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,080
Interesting.

2052
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:03,200
I, I, okay, okay. Gay period stuff is too recent for me to talk about and not like genuinely

2053
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:09,200
just like, oh God, like I'm going, I'm going to be real upset genuinely on this podcast.

2054
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Muchi, give us one. Give us one, please.

2055
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2056
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Just one.

2057
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you some.

2058
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
Okay.

2059
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,200
From, from, from my normal, normal school.

2060
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:25,200
Uh, there, I already, I already told you about how I almost like broke some kid's spine.

2061
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,200
His fault still. His fault still.

2062
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,200
Oh, the hug.

2063
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,200
Yeah.

2064
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,200
The wheelchair, right?

2065
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Yeah.

2066
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,200
Yeah.

2067
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,200
I was very forgiving hugs.

2068
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
That was a thing that I did.

2069
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:44,200
Uh, I, I, I don't know why I did this, but, but I was, I, I, I was very flamboyant, some

2070
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,200
on purpose, some not.

2071
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,200
Everyone thought I was gay.

2072
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,200
Not a single person did not think that I was gay.

2073
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,200
Excellent.

2074
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:59,200
And, and, and I think like, like, like what, what really like just like, uh, like, I think,

2075
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:06,200
I don't know, uh, uh, in a critical moment in me being perceived as gay was how I was

2076
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:13,200
just walking on, on, on, on the field, mind my own business, not doing anything.

2077
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:19,200
Some like Argentinean exchange student who was like, like four or three and I was like,

2078
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:23,200
I was already like five, like 10, if not higher came up to me.

2079
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:30,200
And she's like, I like, like in a thick bridge, like in a thick Spanish accent was like, I

2080
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,200
see, I see you doing the hugs.

2081
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,200
You need to stop this homosexuality.

2082
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:39,200
You need to stop perpetrating this fucking propaganda.

2083
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,200
You need to stop hugging people.

2084
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,200
You're just like, you're just really gay, man.

2085
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,200
You're just really, really gay and you need to stop.

2086
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,200
Wow.

2087
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:50,200
And I was like, you don't know anything.

2088
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,200
You don't know what I'm going through.

2089
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,200
You don't understand what it's like.

2090
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,200
I just ran away.

2091
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,200
He just failed.

2092
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,200
To be fair, he probably didn't understand what it was like.

2093
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,200
I was in front of him being gay and I didn't even say I wasn't gay.

2094
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,200
I was just too gay.

2095
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,200
That's true.

2096
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,200
Oh.

2097
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,200
See, something about that is not even embarrassing.

2098
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,200
Yeah.

2099
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,200
When you look back on it and you just laugh about it and it's like, I was so silly back

2100
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,200
then and he showed that like, you know, you've learned and like, obviously you do it a little

2101
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,200
different now.

2102
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,200
You probably hug that motherfucker and make him gay too.

2103
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,200
That's what I would have done in that situation.

2104
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,200
Spread it around.

2105
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,200
Indeed.

2106
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,200
Yeah.

2107
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,200
There's like, there's like, um, there's a certain amount of like, oh, well, I didn't

2108
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,200
even know I could do that at the time.

2109
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,200
Yeah.

2110
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,200
To, you know, to wave away like, like, oh, I was so clumsy.

2111
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,200
I was such a stupid bitch.

2112
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,200
But like, if you made a mistake like that today, it would be terribly embarrassing.

2113
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,200
If somebody, if somebody said, I don't like you and you ran away, like, come on.

2114
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,200
Yeah.

2115
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,200
Ran away.

2116
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,200
Incredible.

2117
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,200
Literally.

2118
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:03,200
There's just too many, my memory's too foggy and there's just too many things that I couldn't

2119
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,200
really go on it, you know, a whole tirade about my, my, my, my old days in school.

2120
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:13,200
If I, if there's a high demand, I can probably like come up with like a couple stories later

2121
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,200
after this podcast, but yeah.

2122
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,200
Guys, I think I might need to go soon.

2123
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,200
Let's just jump to a couple of questions if you got a minute or two.

2124
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
Yes.

2125
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,200
I'll actually say one more story that will only take a second.

2126
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Okay.

2127
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:32,200
But in seventh grade, I forgot the combination to my locker for physical education and I didn't

2128
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:37,200
want to ask the teacher because I didn't want to let him know that I had messed up and forgot

2129
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,200
my code.

2130
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,200
Right.

2131
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,200
So I just stuck my gym code, my gym clothes into my backpack and so it stunk up my fucking

2132
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,200
backpack every single day for the rest of the year.

2133
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
This was on day like three.

2134
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:48,200
Oh no.

2135
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,200
So, so for all of seventh grade, I had just kept my gym clothes in my backpack because

2136
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,200
I didn't want my teacher to think that I forgot my codes, which I did.

2137
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
How embarrassing that would have been.

2138
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,200
Yeah, yeah, I know exactly.

2139
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,200
Indeed.

2140
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,200
Okay guys, it's, it's, it's time.

2141
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,200
Thank you, Munchie.

2142
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,200
Thanks everyone.

2143
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
Of course.

2144
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,200
Thanks for your questions because there's at least one that I need Gibbs answer to.

2145
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,200
Of course.

2146
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,200
Okay.

2147
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,320
So everyone hashtag SBCP, send them on the Twitter, we take some there and then of course

2148
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,840
more likely to get them read is if you go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators, enter

2149
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,760
our patron chat discord and that's where we ask for more questions and let me read one

2150
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,960
from there right now.

2151
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,280
This is my favorite question that the PCB has ever gotten.

2152
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,040
I love it intensely.

2153
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:34,160
It is from famous Chai Wenny's singer and it is simply, do you guys munch it?

2154
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,160
Or crunch it?

2155
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,160
That was the question.

2156
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,160
That's the question.

2157
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:45,680
That's the fucking, well, well, definitely crunch it like a fucking sick, sick, crunchy

2158
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,680
Dorito when I'm doing strange sports.

2159
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,680
I actually crunch it as well.

2160
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,680
I crunch it as well.

2161
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,160
Yeah, I, I, I crunch it because there's a chocolate bar called a crunchy and I really

2162
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,160
like those.

2163
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,160
Crunch is good.

2164
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,960
Because I like the kinesthetics of chomping into something.

2165
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,960
I don't know.

2166
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,160
When it's munching, it kind of, that implies that it's not as powerful as a crunch.

2167
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,160
You're munching.

2168
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,160
It's gamey the same.

2169
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,160
You know, it's true.

2170
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,160
A munch.

2171
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,160
Yeah.

2172
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,160
Crunchy.

2173
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,160
Munchy is like more powerful, like evil doppelganger.

2174
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,160
It's called crunchy.

2175
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,160
Yeah.

2176
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,400
I, I think in like munchy, munchy is like casual playthrough of, of, of video game and crunch

2177
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,400
it.

2178
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,440
And crunch it is like speed run, high intensity, you know, high velocity, every Uber hacks,

2179
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,440
you know, that sort of style.

2180
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,600
Like the other side run no damage.

2181
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,160
I think there's a time and a place for both.

2182
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,360
You know, first you want to munch something and then you crunch it and there's a harmony

2183
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,360
to be found here.

2184
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,360
I don't know.

2185
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,560
I think munchy should be crunched.

2186
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
You gotta go crunch or go fuck.

2187
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,800
What, what do you, let's, let's enter a wild variable in this one that may change your

2188
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,200
perception entirely.

2189
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,160
Do you munch it, crunch it or slurp it?

2190
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,160
No.

2191
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,360
This is like adding the Z axis to the world.

2192
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,000
I, I crunch, I, if I could, I would crunch soup.

2193
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I don't like liquid.

2194
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,080
Do you put oyster crackers in your soup perhaps?

2195
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,080
That had some crunch.

2196
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,040
I, I, real talk, I do chew, I chew my drinks completely subconsciously.

2197
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,720
Like a coke or something?

2198
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,720
How would you chew that?

2199
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,720
Yeah.

2200
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,720
If I just take a drink of soda, I'll just like chew it without even realizing it.

2201
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,720
Oh, that's autism.

2202
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,720
It's, it's, it's absolutely autism.

2203
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,720
Not even, not even.

2204
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,720
Fascinating.

2205
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,720
Fascinating.

2206
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,120
Oh, I have one embarrassing story I have to tell.

2207
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,120
Just really quick.

2208
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,120
Okay.

2209
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,120
Okay.

2210
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,120
Okay.

2211
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,120
Okay.

2212
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,120
Okay.

2213
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,120
Okay.

2214
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,120
Okay.

2215
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,120
I got called autistic one time on the internet.

2216
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,120
And you ran away.

2217
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,120
Yeah.

2218
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,120
And I was like, you know what?

2219
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,120
That just, that just has to be true.

2220
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,120
That just has to be true.

2221
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,200
I need to know if that is true.

2222
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,700
There's by some random person I got called autistic.

2223
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,200
And so I begged my mom to let me take an autism test.

2224
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:42,200
So she took me to a therapist so I could take an autism test to see if I was autistic.

2225
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,680
And I took it and I wasn't.

2226
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,880
And I was like, this is not true.

2227
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,880
This is fake.

2228
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,880
I have to be autistic.

2229
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,880
I am autistic.

2230
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,800
So I, so I was like, I told the therapist like, there must be something wrong here.

2231
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,800
I am autistic.

2232
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,800
I know.

2233
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,800
I can feel it.

2234
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,800
And she was like, no.

2235
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,800
I can feel it.

2236
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Like you, like you aren't.

2237
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:01,480
And then she was like, well, okay, like, like, are you ready to do therapy now?

2238
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,880
Like that, that's what you sign up for.

2239
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,080
Like you want to get autism test.

2240
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,440
I can help you alleviate whatever pain you have.

2241
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,560
And I was like, no, no, I don't care about your services.

2242
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,960
I don't care about keeping therapy.

2243
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,640
I just want to know if I was autistic or not.

2244
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,400
And I still believe that I am.

2245
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,480
So goodbye, you're worthless to me.

2246
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,080
You didn't give me the validation I needed.

2247
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:22,040
And that sounds like a lot was learned that day.

2248
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,040
Yeah.

2249
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,040
Yeah.

2250
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Okay.

2251
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,040
I'm going to, I'm going to change things up a little bit.

2252
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,040
I'm sorry, editor.

2253
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,520
I just want to be able to acquire a little bit of extra work.

2254
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,800
I just, this image has to be put on screen.

2255
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,760
This is a hashtag askpcp from the Twitter.

2256
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,720
And it's simply this.

2257
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,720
It's simply this.

2258
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,720
Oh God.

2259
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,720
What did I paste in the wrong chat?

2260
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:39,720
Whoops.

2261
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,720
Sorry.

2262
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:41,720
Hang on.

2263
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:42,720
Shit.

2264
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,720
Oh my God.

2265
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,720
Right here.

2266
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,720
Here.

2267
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,720
There.

2268
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,720
What is going on here?

2269
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,720
Is that Jaden Smith in the middle?

2270
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,720
Yeah.

2271
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,720
Is that who that is?

2272
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,720
Who is that on the right?

2273
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,720
No, it's not Jaden Smith.

2274
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,720
No, it's not Jaden Smith.

2275
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:54,720
Is that Ted Cruz on the left?

2276
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,000
Oh, by the way, this is from Ask Pro Masticators.

2277
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,400
Hey guys, what's going on?

2278
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,200
I have no idea who the two right people are.

2279
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,200
I've, I've, I've, I've not tall enough to ride.

2280
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,200
Wait, no, that's the kid from High School Musical.

2281
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,200
That's the black kid.

2282
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,700
I'm not tall enough to ride this meme.

2283
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,700
Oh.

2284
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,760
That's the High School Musical kid, but I don't know who to kid on the right.

2285
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,720
Is this implying that DeVoo is so white that he, that he deletes the black musical

2286
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,720
meme?

2287
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,720
He deletes the black.

2288
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,720
He deletes it.

2289
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,720
Well, there's a, there's a middle ground.

2290
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,720
There's a middle ground, I guess.

2291
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,720
Um.

2292
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,720
This picture of DeVoo looks like a creepy pasta thumbnail.

2293
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,720
It does.

2294
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,720
This looks, this looks like, like, like, like a Jeff the Killer episode seven.

2295
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,720
Okay.

2296
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,720
Well, anyway, uh, that, that's it.

2297
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,720
That's it.

2298
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,720
Our answer to that is yes.

2299
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,720
Good job.

2300
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,720
Yeah.

2301
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,720
Let, uh, uh, okay.

2302
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,720
Here we go.

2303
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,000
Once Parr asks, who was your favorite musician when you were 12?

2304
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,720
I know that I loved Queen intensely when I was around 12, I think.

2305
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,720
That is defined by, by your, your talent show.

2306
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,720
Indeed.

2307
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,720
I, I'm accurate.

2308
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:57,720
Uh, uh, because I didn't like know any bands except the ones my dad said, I just said I

2309
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,720
liked the Beatles the whole time.

2310
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,720
Yeah.

2311
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,720
Because, you know, those are good.

2312
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,720
And I didn't really know how to look at music myself.

2313
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,720
They can't even drop the fucking bass.

2314
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,720
Ringo doesn't even know that shit.

2315
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,720
It took Skrillex to innovate that into the music sphere.

2316
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,720
Thank God for that.

2317
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,720
That was the beginning of real music.

2318
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,720
Dude, can someone please make a dubstep remix of Beatles songs, please?

2319
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,720
Like, like, you just like, like, like dubstep remix the entirety of the Beatles discography

2320
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:24,720
for me, please.

2321
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,720
I, I need that.

2322
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,720
That's your homework for tonight.

2323
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,720
Somebody's probably doing that.

2324
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:33,720
Uh, from the patron lounge, vamp the vampire for the draw boys.

2325
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,720
What's the best way for a very beginner level artist to develop their school, their, their

2326
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:39,720
schools?

2327
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,720
Also, what drawing tablet do you guys recommend?

2328
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,720
Here's a fucking bombshell.

2329
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,720
I'm going to drop for you.

2330
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,720
Uh, the kind of tablet you get does not matter.

2331
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,720
It doesn't matter.

2332
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,720
Don't.

2333
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,720
It totally doesn't.

2334
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,720
Yeah.

2335
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,720
It doesn't.

2336
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,720
Whatever you can afford.

2337
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,720
Yeah.

2338
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,720
Yeah.

2339
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:56,720
If you want to get some tink shirt, whatever does not matter.

2340
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,720
Uh, I will probably use this Wacom tablet to the day I fucking die.

2341
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,720
I used a Wacom bamboo for like seven years.

2342
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,720
Yeah.

2343
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,720
Exactly.

2344
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:09,720
I had an old Wacom bamboo I used from like 2007 to like literally when I started Real

2345
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,720
Pixels, that was the one tablet I had.

2346
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:12,720
Sponsored by Wacom.

2347
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,720
The PCP.

2348
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:14,720
There you go.

2349
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,720
Please.

2350
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,720
I will.

2351
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,720
I will say if you're using a brand that's not Wacom, you, they tend to have compatibility

2352
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,720
issues with open source and free programs.

2353
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,720
Yeah.

2354
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,720
So if you're using like credit or GIMP or whatever, you probably want to get a Wacom.

2355
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,720
They work better with that.

2356
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,720
You're going to want to install Gen 2.

2357
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,720
Get, get, get, get, get Wacom.

2358
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,720
Don't do the other weird shit.

2359
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,720
They aren't good.

2360
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,720
Unless, unless you're buying them through my Amazon affiliate links and all the alternatives,

2361
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,720
please.

2362
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,580
In terms of getting better, I just straight up do gesture drawing.

2363
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:46,720
If you want to get better drawing figures, just do like five, then three, then one minute

2364
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,720
gesture drawings.

2365
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:53,720
I, I, I will recommend the tried and true classic Andrew Loomis books, fun with a pencil.

2366
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,720
Yeah.

2367
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,720
And I think the other one's called, I think it's, I think it's just called gesture drawing.

2368
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:57,720
Andrew Loomis is good.

2369
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,720
Andrew Loomis is good.

2370
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,720
Yeah.

2371
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:08,520
I recommend, I recommend just, just, just, just draw, just draw something and don't

2372
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,520
stop until it looks good.

2373
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:16,520
Like just go in there and go nuts with your fucking, with your pencil tool, your pen tool.

2374
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:21,520
And it just, just keep Doug going and control Zing as much as you want until you get, it

2375
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:27,520
would go in with the eraser and just like keep going and don't stop until it feels right.

2376
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,520
And don't be afraid to use references.

2377
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,520
As someone who doesn't know how to draw.

2378
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,520
And I'm definitely 10 times worse at drawing than I would be if I'd use references from

2379
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,520
the start.

2380
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,520
As someone who doesn't know how to draw at all.

2381
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:42,520
I feel like I gained at least a general understanding by just watching a little bit of, of streams,

2382
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,520
specifically Ben streams, the one I've seen.

2383
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,520
And at least that, I mean, I don't know, it gives you sort of an idea of something you

2384
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,520
could like try.

2385
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,520
So, hey man, I know nothing about any of this shit, but that seems like a good place to start.

2386
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,520
I should stream more drawing.

2387
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,520
I actually might not recommend that.

2388
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,520
I mean, that's valid if you want.

2389
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:05,520
But the thing with us is that we are do stylized drawings, which is nice and all.

2390
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:10,520
But please take it from me who finds it very hard to once they've started drawing, go back

2391
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,520
and learn anatomy.

2392
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,520
Learn anatomy.

2393
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,520
Please.

2394
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
Do that.

2395
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
God.

2396
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,520
Learn anatomy.

2397
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,520
Don't do what I did.

2398
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,520
Yeah.

2399
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,520
Don't like, even if you want to draw cartoons.

2400
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,520
Well, the thing, the thing that I confused a lot is that the different, there's a difference

2401
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:28,520
because like my reason and I never learned anatomy as a kid and I still haven't mastered it now,

2402
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:34,520
even though I've tried is that I misunderstood drawing from life as drawing realistically.

2403
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,520
And I was not interested in all and drawing photorealistically and sitting there and drawing

2404
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,520
like a pencil study for like seven hours.

2405
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:45,520
You can sketch from life and draw like something really loose and not that detailed while looking

2406
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,520
at something real that'll help you understand the form better.

2407
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,520
Exactly.

2408
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,520
Exactly.

2409
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,520
There's a huge difference.

2410
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,520
So like even when I do, I say do gesture drawing, I don't mean like sit there and spend 12 hours

2411
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,520
rendering like hair on the legs.

2412
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Yeah.

2413
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,520
Just, just like look at it so you can understand how the body works and everything and just

2414
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,520
like learn about the line of action.

2415
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,520
In the beginning.

2416
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,520
That's what I mean.

2417
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:11,520
Learn about the line of action and learn about anatomy and stuff, but don't get bogged down

2418
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,520
in it either.

2419
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:17,520
Like learn it and be like, okay, now to put it into practice and then just go draw.

2420
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,520
And then after some drawing, you can come back to it and be like, maybe I didn't pick,

2421
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,520
maybe I should figure this out better than I did.

2422
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,520
Don't get bogged down and study.

2423
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,520
Obviously, the best way to draw is to draw.

2424
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,520
But I'm just saying as a basic, like Andrew Loomis is fine with the pencil.

2425
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,520
That's good because that teaches you the building blocks of how to construct a figure.

2426
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,520
But just take it from me.

2427
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,520
Learn fundamentals.

2428
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,520
They are important.

2429
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,520
Even if you want to draw Steven Universe to your bullshit, it helps to have fundamentals

2430
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,520
so you can understand 3D space and things such as that.

2431
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,520
So please.

2432
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,520
Not everyone's been saying who can get a science degree and just be like, I'm just going to

2433
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,520
draw now.

2434
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,520
And then like a month later, he's a God.

2435
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,520
So like most people have to actually try.

2436
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,520
Yeah.

2437
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,520
Sucks for them, I guess.

2438
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:04,520
If you want to be good at drawing, draw and quarter yourself because it's not worth doing.

2439
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,520
It's a waste of fucking time.

2440
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:11,520
It's some bullshit and you should feel bad if that's what you do with your life.

2441
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,520
True.

2442
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:17,520
In conclusion, learn fundamentals and learn shit.

2443
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,520
Learn shit.

2444
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,520
Drawing is shit.

2445
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,520
It's all bad.

2446
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,520
Get rid of it and it's not good except I really like it.

2447
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,520
I like drawing.

2448
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,520
It's really fun.

2449
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,520
Don't let anyone tell you that it's not fun.

2450
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,520
But it is for cowards.

2451
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,520
Yeah.

2452
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,520
It is the cowards way out.

2453
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,520
It's the cowards way out.

2454
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,520
Speaking of the cowards way out, we have a wonderful question from Avada Akbar.

2455
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,520
It's time to weigh in on this.

2456
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,520
The official stance of the PCP.

2457
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,520
If you had to choose which one, which would it be?

2458
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,520
Israel or Palestine?

2459
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,520
All right.

2460
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,520
Let's get it.

2461
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,520
Who's going to obliterate one and save the other?

2462
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:52,520
I'm going to go with Palestine because they're funny, silly boys over there.

2463
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,520
And I enjoy watching them be hilarious.

2464
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,520
Which ones are the good ones?

2465
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,520
I want to pick the good guys.

2466
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,520
I want to pick the good guys.

2467
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,520
Oh no.

2468
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,520
Tell me who's the good guys and I'll pick them.

2469
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:11,520
The real heroes are the friends we dated along the way.

2470
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,520
The real Palestine was the friends we made along the way.

2471
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,520
It just depends.

2472
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,520
Do you pick a Wonder Woman or do you pick her opposition?

2473
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,520
Good question.

2474
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,520
Good question.

2475
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,520
By the way, the objective answer is Israel because it has Jerry Seinfeldt in their military.

2476
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,520
Recently, Jerry Seinfeldt.

2477
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,520
This is true.

2478
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:37,520
Jerry Seinfeldt went to a military tourism camp to learn how to fight Palestinian terrorists in Israel.

2479
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,520
Are you quite kidding me?

2480
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,520
Yeah.

2481
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,520
He went with his family.

2482
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:41,520
Well, let me just tell you.

2483
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:46,520
We don't even need to choose because Palestine's going to be wiped up a fucking map in like any fucking day now.

2484
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
With Jerry on the case.

2485
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,520
The Pacha is like a bomb going over.

2486
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,520
The bomb just goes off.

2487
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,520
Oh my God.

2488
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:05,520
It's like they're marching and he's like playing the trumpet and instead of the ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, it's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2489
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,520
Dude, but like Jerry's going to get to the front lines.

2490
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:15,520
Across the battlefield, leading the Palestinian forces will be George fucking Costanza.

2491
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,520
George, what are you doing over there?

2492
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,840
Over there. I don't know. I just there was a hot slut. I wanted to fuck Jerry. And now I'm wrapped up with this madness

2493
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,320
He outmaneuvers his opponents by using his vast speed as seen in the race

2494
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,720
Yeah, exactly

2495
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:35,920
The way he beats the pestilence is again. He gets a head start that no one notices and he gets the absolute quicker

2496
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,920
The name one else does yeah

2497
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,560
Excellent. Well, that's everybody

2498
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,600
Favorite dead. Oh wait, actually, you know what? That's a terrible question

2499
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:48,920
Um, um, I don't know. There's these are all bad

2500
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:55,680
Avada Akbar also asked do you know the way a beam get it get it you know, no

2501
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,040
Got a knuckle. Okay, whatever. That's it. No more good questions. I think they're all good. They're I mean bad

2502
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,120
Yes, okay, that's it everybody. All right, thank you. They should all feel embarrassed, right? Oh

And it's gonna be a nightmare. So yeah, get ready for that shit
