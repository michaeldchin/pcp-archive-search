00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're back. I'm back. I've been away for two weeks. I know y'all miss me, but that's okay.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're here again. Did you guys didn't show up either? I'm really upset. I invited all of you and everything.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
My name is Tom Oliver, and we got a whole brigand of disgusting people with us today, starting with the man himself, Digibro.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm gross. Indeed. We have the Hippocrit Gibbontake himself.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I thought you said Barum. That's why I didn't come.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, well, you were right, actually. I fooled everyone. It was a very awkward time for all. Nate is here.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Every side of the dreidel is represented here.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Indeed they are. And Ben Saint.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yo, I'm back from Anthro New England, baby.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah, yes. I got pictures. I got proof. It's true.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hell yeah. I saw teeth from that all weekend, and I was sad that I couldn't go with my lowers but my brothers regardless.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll be interested to hear. You want to tell us about it? I'm very curious.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Did you get it on any sick furry orgy's dog?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's the most important question. I'm afraid I didn't get to weasel a single person.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, what the fuck? Everything I know is a lie.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Actually, most of my, I mean, I was walking around with Kazi in her new Colby Jack suit, which is fucking, is baller by the way.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've seen it. It's a well-made unit.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Does someone want to post a picture? It's on her timeline.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll find one.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But most of my experience was weird drama, friend drama of some people.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We went to one of their friend's hotel room for a bit, for everyone to get suited up.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He didn't confess he was maybe thinking of voting Republican in the presidential.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He wouldn't do that, right? I mean, he wouldn't tank his whole career doing something like that now, I hope.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I mean, I hope he would have more sense than something like that.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't we all.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
By the way, there's the image you can see in the show notes.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then we all left the room and we were going to go to a restaurant to eat.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then we got to the restaurant and suddenly a bunch of these people are like, we have to go.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And they leave and we're like, what the fuck was that about?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then we find out when we get back that all these people, all these friends of our friends who had their own hotel room,

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
they all got fucking weirded out and had anxiety attacks because there were too many of us in the room at one time.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then they were like, we don't want to see them anymore.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They can't be in here anymore.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They didn't say anything about it. It was only later after the fact.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They're like, we have to fucking form a coalition against these other people.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They can't be allowed to intrude on our personal space any further.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Fascinating.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so they were like, all the stuff was sort of, they gave us the stuff and were like, take this, take this,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you got to give it back to the other people, take this and go.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I'm like, yeah, cool, whatever.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That was it.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Were you one of the offending intruders or were you part of the core group?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, I was just a friend of a friend of a friend.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, okay.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I don't know.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Like, Kazzy and Munchie, their stuff was in the room.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They were just like, here, you know, it's fine.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We had like a mutual friend who was like, she wasn't mad at us.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
She was just like, hey, I'm sorry.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You guys, could you just, you know, like these guys are like these other people, they're having a fucking attack.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They're having a fucking episode over here.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Here, I'm sorry, just here's your stuff.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we had to take all our stuff.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Anyway, we had to leave the convention early.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But I did get, I just, I got to the convention and I just walked in the front door and I asked someone,

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm like, hey, where's the con?

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And he's like, oh, you're going to want to go to a registration.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're going to go on a ticket.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's right, it's right through there.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I'm like, thanks.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Had an exactly the opposite direction.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Just walked directly into the main hall with no tag.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Find them, sit down, watch the end of the furry dance competition.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No ticket required.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Paying for things is for losers.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well done.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've always wanted to do that.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like every year, I mean, aside from the fact that a lot of the cons I go to, I get into for free anyways.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But like, anytime I see a con where it's like the security's not that tight, I'm just like, did I fuck?

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Am I a Rube?

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like, should I?

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I mean, just for example.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They might have checked my tag, not to go in at all, but to go into the hall where the dance competition was taken.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's what I was going to say.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They probably would have checked it if I'd gone in at the beginning, but like, it was almost ending anyway.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I think they just didn't care anymore.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
They didn't even, they didn't even ask me.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
At Bronycon, the only time you were checked is if you went into like the dealer's hall or I think like any of the main events,

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you could 100% wander around and get 90% of the experience.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've been, it's been that way at a few of the smaller cons I've been to.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And yeah, particularly at Bronycon, I remember it being like, what the fuck?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like there is no reason anyone should have paid for this convention.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Like the only time they check you is if you go into the main events hall, which none of us did.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I mean, I don't even think that's, is that even frowned upon to do?

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I feel like it's almost supposed to be that way to attract lookie-loos to, I don't know, make the event seem more...

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, like anime, anime New England is like that too.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Most conventions they go to, getting into the convention grounds is not hard and does not cost money.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's, they only check your tag for events and for panels and for the vendors hall and stuff like that.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So for any of you, any of you thrifty would-be con-goers, just consider not buying a ticket.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, make sure you know how the con works.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because there are plenty of cons that do check you at the entrance.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you're gonna con the con, do your research.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's fair.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I went right into the main event.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I watched the last like three dancers, including the one who ended up winning.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I guess I've seen the best dancing that Anthony New England has to offer.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I only, I enjoyed the finest, the finest things in life.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What does a fursuit dance look like?

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's pretty tame, honestly, because like, there's not-

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tame like an animal?

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean, they can't get, I think they can't get too extreme with it.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because they'll fucking puss out.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because their suit will fucking explode, yeah.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Right. I wasn't sure if you meant can't get too extreme, like, they can't do jabberwocky fucking dance maneuvers?

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Or like, is it a raunchy dance? Like, is it a pole dance?

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, nothing. And there was nothing raunchy about it.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was just, there wasn't even any cool like break dance spins.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was just like, I don't know, it was just-

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Being in a fursuit would make break dancing easy on your back, at least.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You just wouldn't be able to slide around, people kick you.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your friction would be so, you could spin on the ground so much.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anybody, I mean, I've heard of the like advanced nanotech like water cooling fursuits that they're rolling out.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They're really pioneering like the battle armor technology, the fursuit community.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm looking forward to it. Keep it up guys.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Incidentally, Kazzy's fursuit looks like Barney the Dinosaur got fused with Super Eye Patch Wolf's avatar.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I've been seeing her make it for like months, like every time she would come over to my house, she would have like a paw.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And she'd be like, yeah, I was sewing it on the bus. Old women commented on it.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've seen it come together piece by piece.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is like actually pro.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is it supposed to be like a, like what animal is-

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It is a fur dragon.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, so it is just like a dragon with a wolf's head and paws basically, right?

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a dragon.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a furry.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It does have kind of a somewhat canine snout there.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, but it's a dragon with paws and fur.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Pretty dope.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's it.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Congrats to all involved.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Looks like a triumph.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Seems like a triumph.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think she's going to start selling them.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think she's going to start doing this like for money.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Damn.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I mean, it looks like it's quality work.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, you got the skill.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think this suit is probably like between like 500 plus hours work.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh my God.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Remember, what is it? Violent J's daughter received a shitty cosplay costume from some shitty seller.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Next time, look up Kazzy.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Kazzy will do right, but she'll look it up.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, anything else go on there?

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Anything else?

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I didn't spend that.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was supposed to go-

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, this segues into-

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was supposed to go to it at noon.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I was supposed to get there in the middle of the day, but I overslept.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I slept through my alarm because the previous night I had heard such disturbing news that I could not get to sleep

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and I was not able to sleep and I slept through my alarm because of it.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I learned that due to some kind of clerical error or something, I'm not going to be able to vote in the fucking primaries on Super Tuesday.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I fucking registered.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I fucking registered before the deadline.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I went on the 31st.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I checked the box.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I should be registered.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm calling the registrar tomorrow.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
They're going to get a piece of my mind.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is bullshit.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is voter suppression.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is not democracy.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm white.

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm supposed to be able to vote in these things.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
God damn it.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Did you try turning it off and on again?

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, turn the DNC off and on again.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It'll work.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Sir, is it plugged in?

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is your vote plugged in?

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Whatever.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to call the registrar.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's fucked up, man.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It is.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I did everything right.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I did everything right, but it's still-

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I would have assumed you would do everything wrong, but no.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I thought so too.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I saw it.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I checked my status, and it's not registered.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm like, oh god, I fucked up.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I fucked up.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I let it go by.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I wasn't paying attention.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I missed the deadline, but then I remembered, no.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was at the RMV weeks ago, and I filled out the form.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I should be registered.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I registered.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is this?

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What am I looking at?

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I did not fuck up.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is there any hope of remedying this, do you think?

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know.

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to call the registrar, and I have no idea what he will say about it.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What is the RMV?

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's the Massachusetts form of the DMV.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's the Registry of Motor Vehicles as opposed to the Department of Motor Vehicles.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We have a BMV in Ohio.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't know all this.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
All over the spectrum, everybody has different ideas.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We have a BMV, the Building of Motion Vehicle.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I might be cocked out of voting on Super Tuesday, which makes me very sad, very upset,

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
very frustrated.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But it's okay.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is Super Tuesday this Tuesday?

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It is a week from this Tuesday.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's March 3rd.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it'll be the next Tuesday after you, the listener, are hearing this.

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But it's okay.

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But it's okay because Bernie fucking blew out Nevada.

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Bernie obliterated Nevada.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He did.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That snake warren, not even viable.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Not even a single fucking delegate.

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Pete Buttigieg scrabbles with his little rat hands just barely over the precipice of viability.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He'll probably get like one and a half delegates.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Biden will get a handful.

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He came in.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But Bernie fucking blew it out and got almost half.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He almost got more than everyone else combined.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ben, did you watch Pete's speech he did after Bernie won Nevada?

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I didn't watch the speech, but I saw the tweet.

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was pretty funny.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He was like, congratulations to Bernie.

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm glad that we agree on so many things he did so well.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I will now proceed to shit on Bernie and tell you how bad he is for the next 20 minutes.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Everyone is just, oh, Pete and Warren, they're all just like, oh, Bernie's so mean.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He yells so much, though.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like, what a nasty man.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I wouldn't hang that man in my kitchen.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I find it off-putting.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a big cope.

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Did you see Chris Matthews on NBC?

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He compared it to the Nazis.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He compared Bernie blowing out Nevada to the Nazis.

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The Nazis blew out the Jews?

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The Nazis are conquering France by running over the Maginot Line.

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Odd comparison, but okay.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In slightly bad taste, considering Bernie's family was killed in the Holocaust.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, but that's true of like every Askenazi Jew.

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So, I mean, what are we going to do?

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We're all day worried about this.

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What are we going to never compare Jewish people to Nazis?

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, come on.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Once in a while. They build a hell of an Autobahn out there.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There was just a recent struggle tweet about that where a guy was like, he said,

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
it's like the Holocaust, both parties fault.

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The Nazis for killing Jews, the Jews for being Jews.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wait, yeah, who tweeted that?

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I remember that.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, shit.

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It seemed like a joke, but then I wasn't sure.

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Damn.

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Was it like Richard Dawkins or something?

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was. It was somebody who would say that, I believe.

261
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Richard Dawkins isn't like woke on the JQ.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That can't be right, is it?

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, what he is is a liberal.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And liberals are stupid because liberals, this is what we're seeing.

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is what we're seeing with the mainstream media melting down right now.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Liberals like fascists more than they like socialists.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is what's had.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're going to have to fucking learn to deal with it.

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
People like fascists more than they like socialists.

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
People do like order.

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sure.

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you like order?

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, so, yep, they sure do.

276
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They love it and they're going to cry.

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to drink their tears.

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Listen, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but yes, in my heart of hearts,

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I do want to see heads on spikes.

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes, I am the toxic Bernie bro your parents warned you about.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I am one of the bad ones.

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's no secret.

283
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm owning it.

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's good to know.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But they're not all like me.

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm I'm the bad one.

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay.

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay.

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It wasn't Richard Dawkins who said I knew it.

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I knew it.

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Both sides to blame.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This has to be a joke.

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's have a little bit of charity here.

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It has to be.

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let me I don't.

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I mean, is it like a parody account?

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But he's made some pretty fucking.

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He's made some like recently he unironically tweeted about how eugenics.

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You might not like it, but you can't deny it works.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay.

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Come on.

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That was taken way out of context because his point was like, yes, of course, you can

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
manipulate the genes of a population if you choose to, but morally, obviously you don't

306
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
want to.

307
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But you know, you could if you wanted to just don't do it.

308
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Which is true.

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, it's true.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But why would you say it like that?

311
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why would you say it works?

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know.

313
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Every there's no like nobody contends that you cannot manipulate a genome through selective

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
breeding.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Nobody needed that pointed out to them.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
As always.

317
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay.

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Were you in the none of us were in the fucking conversation he was responding to and we're

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
just taking the thing.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let me look.

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going to look right now.

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going to look up the content.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,400
There are just so many stupid people on Twitter that you probably would have to spell out

324
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,000
something like that if you like start talking with all the dregs, you know.

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't really know anything about Richard Dawkins.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Other than I've heard his face.

327
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Richard Dawkins.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
His name.

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Richard Dawkins.

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I believe in God.

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,760
A relevant writer who a decade and a half, who a couple decades ago was pretty big because

332
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,680
he wrote some books about how atheism is kind of cool actually.

333
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,000
The God of delusion was him.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The God of delusion.

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I've heard all of that.

337
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He was one of the four horsemen with Sam Harris and the other guys.

338
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
In any case, I mean the thing you're referring to Ben with him talking about eugenics, he

339
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,000
does in his follow up tweet say, I deplore the idea of a eugenic policy.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I simply said deploring it doesn't mean it wouldn't work.

341
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is it a dog whistle, Ben?

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Does he actually support it?

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Work to do what?

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is this his position?

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Work to do what?

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
To eugenicize humanity?

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How much more clear can he be?

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Obviously it would work.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm just saying, look, I'm not saying Richard, I didn't say Richard Dawkins made these tweets

350
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to unironically promote.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's just a weird thing to say.

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And here's another.

353
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This Jew thing is even weirder.

354
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's all I have to say about it.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Bernie Rondavada, Deb.

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's going to be okay, America.

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay.

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No, it's not.

360
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You think the DNC is going to fuck him?

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What?

362
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, what's the position of Steve?

363
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You think the DNC is going to fuck him out?

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They have super delegates, don't they?

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't really still have the chance.

366
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They have super delegates, but they do not come into the vote until after the first

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
until after all the pledge delegates.

368
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So if he were to win a majority, or anyone were to win a majority of regular delegates,

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the super delegates would not be allowed to vote.

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay, I see.

371
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, do you know about like on the last debate, the last question, they asked everyone like

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
should the person who gets, even if there's no majority, should the person who gets the

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
plurality of delegates be made the nominee?

374
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And everyone but Bernie said no because they don't believe in democracy and their shitlibs

375
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and they have no values.

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Hmm, I did see that.

377
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay, I see your point.

378
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Although to be fair, if Bernie has a plurality but not a majority, can it really necessarily

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
be said that he like, you know, is in fact the winner?

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Shouldn't they pair things down and decide?

381
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because that's not like the 51% has decided that they won.

382
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Pair things down to who?

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, you know, like to do like that, it's not first past the post, but that voting system

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
where the weakest candidates are limited.

385
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Like democracy isn't just there's one thing, there's one way of doing it specifically,

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and we know that's real democracy and every other voting system is bad.

387
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There are different ways to do it, including the like the CGP gray model of like everybody

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
wants if there is no majority.

389
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes, that's fine and all, but like that has no relevance at all to the super delegates

390
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and the convention.

391
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There is no alternative vote.

392
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It is, yeah, the super delegates just are a secondary block of unpledged voters who

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
just get to vote whoever the fuck they want.

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't want that.

395
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That should go away.

396
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know why that exists.

397
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That seems wrong and not good.

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You know who else thinks that that's bad and shouldn't exist?

399
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, who all said that it was bad and undemocratic

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
until suddenly it was their only chance at the nomination and now they all support it.

401
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, don't you understand once they have power, they will make things good.

402
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You just need to trust them.

403
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes, that's true.

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is what you don't understand, Ben.

405
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You have to trust them.

406
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They know what's best for you.

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I do.

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I do trust them.

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They are standing out with a podium.

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean, I'm not standing up with a podium.

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm on team P now.

412
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So, better listen.

413
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Warren's the immoral after a plant position of power becomes moral once you are in power.

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I love it.

415
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's fantastic.

416
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's my plan too.

417
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can't argue with it.

418
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Or you go to the fucking vote room.

419
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Anyway, it's all very upsetting.

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Anyway, the point being that, yeah, if Bernie doesn't get the majority, it's possible the

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
super delegates will screw him out of it.

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They'll come in and they'll be like, uh, we're actually all going to vote for Bloomberg, so

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
he gets the nomination instead because he paid us too.

424
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm ready for the Bloomberg.

425
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm ready.

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm ready to...

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm ready to hashtag vote bloom no matter whom.

428
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's...

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No matter whom he is, if he changes himself.

430
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The delegates are going to vote bloom no matter whom.

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So Bernie changes his last name to Bloomberg.

432
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He gets all the votes instead.

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, sneaky.

434
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But I don't know.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There's a possibility that it might not come to that.

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Bernie might end up with a majority.

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We don't know.

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He's going to start winnowing.

439
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Elizabeth Warren needs to drop out soon.

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Pete Klobuchar, even I would say Biden at this.

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Honestly, nobody else even has a chance.

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Just get them all out of here.

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Just get them out of the country.

444
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Leave them out.

445
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Just throw them into the ocean.

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't know if I want the field to narrow down for Bernie to soak up more support, or

447
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
if I like that the center's vote is split between all these fucking nobodies.

448
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's the question, isn't it?

449
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's the X factor.

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm not sure.

451
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Did I mention...

452
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I realized that I didn't mention...

453
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Before New Hampshire, I was making calls.

454
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Did I say that I was making calls for Bernie on the PCK?

455
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You mentioned it at some point.

456
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

457
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay.

458
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
All right.

459
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

460
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was fucking in there.

461
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I was in there because I was really worried about New Hampshire, and it turns out I had

462
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
every one...

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
$1,000 to our next Kickstarter to get a personal Bernie Sanders endorsement phone call from

464
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ben St. who will convince you to vote for Bernie.

465
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah.

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's what my reward is.

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I will convince you to vote for Bernie Sanders, no matter what.

468
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We'll be here all day.

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We'll go over all the facts and logic until...

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, boy.

471
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Do I have anything else to say about...

472
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Do I have anything else to say about that whole charade?

473
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't know.

474
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
South Carolina's coming up.

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Biden might win South Carolina, but the gap is narrowing.

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Bernie might actually be ahead by the time they do the poll.

477
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't know.

478
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Open quit.

479
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, he needs to fucking drop out.

480
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He is dead in the water if he doesn't win South Carolina.

481
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He's probably dead in the water anyway, to be perfectly...

482
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yon!

483
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You bore us, Ben.

484
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes, yes.

485
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Collectively.

486
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
All right.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's do something else.

488
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I've said all I have to say.

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm not following it.

490
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I have nothing to add to this.

491
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's fine.

492
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Here's the thing.

493
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm following it, and I have nothing to add to it.

494
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Fair enough.

495
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm really excited for the debate on Tuesday.

496
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Join my discord where every time there's a debate, we all get in the discord and are

497
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
like, oh my god.

498
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Did you guys watch the debate?

499
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I only saw a little bit of bloom getting up.

500
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This last debate was unbelievable.

501
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It was by far the funnest debate.

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There's a part where Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar are literally just screaming at each other,

503
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and the moderator cannot quiet them down.

504
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They just keep going.

505
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That happened a couple of times.

506
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Klobuchar's barely contained rage is palpable.

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's so uncomfortable.

508
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

509
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Considering that she probably views him as an upstart guy, she's like, how is this fucking

510
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
guy questioning me?

511
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, it was about a thing in a recent interview.

512
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
She was not able to name the president of Mexico.

513
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh, right.

514
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The people, the moderators asked her about it, and she was like, you're right.

515
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I hate Mexicans.

516
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't view them as human beings.

517
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You got me.

518
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You want to understand my position.

519
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
She's like, it was just a slip of the tongue, and Pete Buttigieg, fucking psychopath, is

520
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
like, I don't believe that that's true.

521
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't believe like, are you, like, how can we trust someone who would forget something

522
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
so important?

523
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And she gets fucking like really defensive.

524
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
She gets, she's like, I'm sorry, we're not all as perfect as you, Mayor Pete.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Are you calling me stupid?

526
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Are you saying I'm dumb?

527
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And he basically just goes on and says yes.

528
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think I speak for a large portion of our audience when I say I couldn't give less of

529
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
a fuck about anything in the world possibly.

530
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So fair point.

531
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I was fucking on the edge of my seat.

532
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I was on the edge of my seat.

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I was edging on my seat.

534
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was edging the whole time.

535
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And then at the end, last thing, and then at the end when Bernie just does literal fucking

536
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Marxism to Bloomberg, that was when I had the coom.

537
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That's when they're like, do you deserve to be a billionaire, Bloomberg?

538
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And he's like, yes, I worked very hard for it.

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And Bernie's like, don't you think your workers are the ones responsible for that fortune?

540
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't you think they deserve some of the credit for it?

541
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Just literal fucking Marxism, literal class consciousness.

542
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Bernie's a hero.

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He's my hero.

544
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I mean, Bernie's a millionaire though.

545
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You're such a fucking moron, Nate.

546
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Your IQ is fridge temperature level.

547
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Let's go on with that, Ben.

548
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah.

549
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
With you being ironic, I can never tell.

550
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Who knows?

551
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Who knows?

552
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay.

553
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah.

554
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
A great point.

555
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
A great stupid point, also made by fellow stupid low IQ moron, Michael Bloomberg, on the debate

556
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
stage, which is why he's basically out of the running at this point.

557
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Good job.

558
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Let's move on.

559
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
A fellow bloomer.

560
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
How exciting for all of us.

561
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Finally, we'll get the bloomer representation, the most oppressed minority in the White House,

562
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
looking forward to it.

563
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We need more.

564
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We're all about to bloom.

565
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We need more voter suppression.

566
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
When you think about it, who is a bigger minority than billionaires?

567
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Just saying.

568
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's true.

569
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Right.

570
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Just saying.

571
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's true.

572
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They're guillotines way more often than non-billionaires are.

573
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You should join the guillotine, Ben, when the guillotine, when they are rolling out through

574
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the streets.

575
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I will be the first one.

576
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I will be the first one out there.

577
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I'll probably be the first one that they turn on.

578
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I've had enough of this crap.

579
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes.

580
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I said let's move on.

581
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I am talking about the artistic creative process because I'm having art problems, artist boy

582
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
problems, anxiety about things I do, always being not good enough, no matter what it is.

583
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Tell me about it, bro.

584
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You can take-

585
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Sounds like our democratic process.

586
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You can take any multitude of potential reasons.

587
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I felt bad about this because I didn't use a reference and you're supposed to do that.

588
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Or I did use a reference and I felt like I was cheating.

589
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I used something and it didn't work out the way I wanted it.

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Any potential reason for upset with the art.

591
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And the core reason is always the same.

592
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And it's just that I'm afraid of death and everything that I'm doing with regards to art,

593
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
when I'm trying to get good, when I'm trying to improve the quality of what I can draw,

594
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
what I can create, what's going through my head is this feeling of every moment I do something,

595
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
it has to be working towards being good because I only have a limited amount of time on this

596
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
earth and I'm going to die if I don't do it fast enough.

597
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I need to be efficient.

598
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I need to be making the most of the time I have.

599
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And as that's going through my head and I'm drawing something and it's not perfect,

600
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm thinking, okay, what could I be doing wrong?

601
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I'm thinking of all the tutorials that I didn't fully watch or the things I could have been doing,

602
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
the techniques that people have told me about and I've kind of forgotten how to do.

603
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I'm like, oh shit, my knowledge banks are too low.

604
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't have the capability to be efficient.

605
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's a lost cause.

606
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm a lost cause.

607
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This drawing, which admittedly is fine, is terrible and I've wasted my life and I'm a worst person ever.

608
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And it's all downed to the whole death thing.

609
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And I'm trying to figure out how to not be scared of death.

610
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That's my goal.

611
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'll tell you.

612
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Tell me if you want to.

613
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Well, I can help to some degree because you just got to think about the fact that death will come

614
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
suddenly and there's no way to predict it.

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Oh, that makes me feel so much better.

616
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Thank you.

617
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, there's no point.

618
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We're in.

619
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Right.

620
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's kind of the way I look at it.

621
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's like, I don't see much point in considering it because it's like, well, I know that if it happens,

622
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
it's going to happen suddenly or it'll be obvious long before it happens.

623
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I fear death a lot, but I fear disability significantly more.

624
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's my...

625
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, it's not literally just about death.

626
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's that death is the cause of my artistic anxiety.

627
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Like the reason I hate myself through my art is because I'm scared that I'm not getting

628
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
fast enough, good enough.

629
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Right.

630
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think like, for me, it's kind of like, I understand that fear in the sense of like,

631
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
oh, I don't want to, you know, what if I don't get good enough before I die?

632
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But it's like, you won't.

633
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You won't get good enough before you die.

634
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's just not going to happen.

635
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like you'll never, because there's no ceiling on it.

636
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You'll always want to get better.

637
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
At no point will you look at your stuff and be like, okay, now I can die happy, you know?

638
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
True.

639
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I do feel like though there are like very obvious milestones and I am currently in the

640
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
mediocre artist point where I can't easily sketch something that looks okay.

641
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I need to spend a long time on anything.

642
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I mean, like, if you...

643
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I mean, all artists spend a long time on things.

644
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I know that, but like, you see how like someone who has a very good grasp of, you know, drawing

645
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
can, you know, sketch a little cartoon character, a little doodle.

646
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And it can be like clearly, you know, if you put lines on the line art on that, that would

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
be a great drawing.

648
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And they didn't think about it too much.

649
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's sort of on autopilot.

650
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I maybe wouldn't realize when I hit that point, which is the reason like you would always

651
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
be aiming higher and higher until you're dead.

652
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But I know of certain things that I need to improve about my drawing.

653
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And once I feel like I've conquered them or like I can conquer them in individual drawings

654
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
without tearing my hair out, I will know that I have gotten to a good point.

655
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I think it's a good idea to just, you know, I mean, obviously practicing all the time.

656
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But like specifically just like doing as much different stuff as possible because I feel

657
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
like the best way to get through, like to make breakthroughs in any kind of art is to

658
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
stop trying to force the thing that you're trying to do and just go do something else

659
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and come back later and see if you've figured it out by then, you know, because like you

660
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
never know where the answer that's going to unblock your understanding might come from.

661
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's like maybe you're like, oh, why can't I get these colors right, you know, and then

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
you go and draw a bunch of other shit and then while you're working on something else,

663
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
you're like, oh, this color, this is the one I needed for that other drawing I was trying to do,

664
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
you know, just like maybe it's just a good idea to, you know, if you hit something,

665
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
you're not sure how to fix this problem you have, just go do something else.

666
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Well, here's the thing. I'm aware of like certain practices and tutorials, things I can go to

667
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
for like information on how to do specific things. It's not a specific thing necessarily

668
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that I'm having trouble figuring out what it is. It's more of a getting past that initial

669
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
like death spiral way of thinking. As soon as you start a drawing, you open up the program,

670
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
you're looking at it and you draw the first little bit and you're like, oh no, this isn't

671
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
going to work and that stops you. I don't let that happen to me. I try to just power through

672
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the whole thing as fast as possible. Sometimes I'm not thinking and that's the thing that always

673
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
seems to work is that when I'm not thinking about getting better, I draw and therefore get better

674
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and I really want to know how to stop thinking. I need some sort of way to make myself an idiot

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
while I do this stuff. I was thinking, hmm, let's just drink profusely, but I'm not sure

676
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that's a really good idea. That doesn't seem like the best solution. Just get into marijuana.

677
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's worked for me so well. I mean, it's not legal in the UK and I really don't want to talk to teenagers.

678
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's not legal where I am either, but... There's a guy I know. This is in no way a solution to your

679
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
problem, but what it is is another example of a guy I'm currently mystified by the insane amount

680
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
of talent that this person has. Do you guys know who Mark Rebele is? Or Rebele? Nope.

681
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Does this sound familiar to anybody? Okay, Mark Rebele. I've never actually heard the name pronounced out loud.

682
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I've just seen it on YouTube and stuff. So he's a musician and what he does is he has made a career.

683
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
He quit his job a while back and has gone pro like doing sets where he will set in coffee shops

684
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and restaurants and on stage. He's getting more and more popular these days where he will set up his

685
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
keyboard and he will have zero set list and he will go up and he will improv, but he used loops

686
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and samplers and stuff to capture his own voice and to in real time mix full on songs that he 100%

687
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
improvs based on audience submission and stuff. So okay, here's a link to, in my opinion, the

688
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
greatest work of art of the 21st century, which is a song called Work That As For Daddy.

689
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah, this song. It's an eight minute long, jazzy breakdown song just built around the

690
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
concept of Big Booty Black Girl. That's it. And he just makes up all the lyrics based on that.

691
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And it is an absolute journey to go on. And I've watched this so many times, once I love the song,

692
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and two, because I know that like, okay, he has to have like his keyboard, his sampler, he has to know music

693
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and how to loop things correctly. But I'm so in awe of all the skills that went into in real time.

694
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
He did this on a live stream one time. This is literally what I want my life to be.

695
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It is so amazing. He's bought all the equipment that I dream of having.

696
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And he's just rapping, he's just literally saying, yo, give me that ass, give me that fucking booty.

697
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And he looks like Anthony Fantano when he was 18.

698
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm sucking your booty and ass in the same place. Whatever the fuck it was.

699
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, I'm sucking your pussy and ass in the same place. Gotta work that ass for daddy.

700
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And he looks like a Anthony Fantano who's in shape with hair. It's nuts. He looks like a pedophile and it's great.

701
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He's a monster, but I love him. And I'm just in awe of this.

702
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And as a guy who has just dabbled a little bit into music and music composition here and there, total, total amateur shit.

703
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Like, I've talked about this before. It's like this man's casting a fucking magical spell.

704
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
He knows the Harry Potter runes and glyphs to just do magic in front of me. And I don't get it at all.

705
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's funny that you're so impressed with it just because I do get it. I get like how this, how you do this.

706
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I mean, okay, answer this question. I've had one question about this.

707
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The hardest thing about this to me seems how to get the loops to sync up perfectly in real time.

708
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You gotta press the button at the right exact second, you know?

709
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That seems so hard to do that consistently.

710
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's the same as playing notes on the beat consistently.

711
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But that's hard, though. It's kind of the most basic skill you need to have.

712
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
If you can tap your feet to a beat, you can eventually, you know, transfer that skill into doing something.

713
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And the fact of the matter is, there is some, you know, margin of error allowance.

714
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Like, I'm thinking about, like, times I've seen live bands where they have to, like, Agiloch,

715
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
which I know, Hippo, you listened to, like, the whole Agiloch discography the other day, right?

716
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. The, uh...

717
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah, what'd you think about that?

718
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I liked it. There was a lot of, like, the deep, screamy...

719
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Well, not a lot, actually. There's just bits of it.

720
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But, yeah, it was very moody and very cool.

721
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Good background music for working.

722
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah. When I saw Agiloch live, because they switch back and forth between a, like, unplugged-and-plugged-in sound,

723
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
in order to, you know, switch between guitar tonalities, they have to, like, press a switch with their, you know,

724
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
like, the kick down on a little switch.

725
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But there's often moments in the songs where it, like, dramatically transitions between, like, acoustic and electric.

726
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So you have to hit that thing on the floor just at the right time to...

727
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You know, and you can see that it's, it definitely seems like a bit of a struggle to remember to do it at the right time.

728
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I definitely had trouble with guitar pedals and stuff.

729
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I never seem to... I mean, it was years ago that I've been using guitar pedals and, like,

730
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
when I used to be in, like, a school band playing, like, little rock things.

731
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And you're doing the thing with your hands, and then you go to, like, okay, lift, like, your foot up and land on something.

732
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Anything involving your feet, like, what this guy is doing in this video is, it's funny.

733
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
This is exactly... When I said, like, this is what I want to do, I'm not exaggerating.

734
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I literally want this equipment because I have a habit of banging on desks, like, making desk beats and stuff

735
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
just out of not being able to sit still.

736
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And, like, those pads, the synth pads, like, what he's got there that he's doing his beats on,

737
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
ever since I saw the Kanye West video for Runaway where he's playing the beat pad to the Phoenix,

738
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I was like, oh, I don't have to learn how to play drums.

739
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Drumming is so hard. Like, to me, this looks easy.

740
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Drumming where you have to time your hands and legs together is nearly impossible.

741
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I cannot coordinate my hands and feet.

742
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But if you just press buttons on a pad with your hands, it's so much easier to control and time your hands.

743
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So, you know, something like this, this seems like a way I actually could perform music that, you know,

744
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
would be less difficult than any other method.

745
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Every day, every time I stream, I'm getting more and more of a master.

746
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm acquiring these skills via my soundboard, which I would mash right now,

747
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
but none of you will hear it in the recording, so I'll do it for myself.

748
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Heh, heh, epic. Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

749
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You know, music has also been one of the things I've been trying to make on, like, a garage band on my iPad.

750
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Just simple beats that, you know, they loop, so I don't need to think about time too much.

751
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I'm just trying, desperately trying to make something that sounds like it could be on a Gorillaz album,

752
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and then I'm gonna sing over it.

753
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But every time I make, I make the beat, and I'm like,

754
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I think I have a trouble, like, figuring out how to structure the song.

755
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Maybe Digi, you could help with that.

756
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Like, like advice, because I have the beat and it loops,

757
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and then I add a thing, and now it suddenly, there's too many things, and it's too cluttered, so I get rid of it.

758
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I can't figure out how to visualize the entire song before I have something to sing to.

759
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
If you're having trouble with too many layers, like too much sound, is that what you mean?

760
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't know, I have a few things where they just sound like amateur, doesn't know what he's doing, sort of beats.

761
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I would say that part of what I've learned is that the EQ matters a lot,

762
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
in the sense that a beat is usually prepared out of elements that don't exist on the same frequency as your voice.

763
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So think of a rap beat, usually bass and hi-hats are the main focus,

764
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
because it's either way super deep or way super high-pitched, but your voice tends to fall into the mid-range.

765
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So as you're customizing a beat, a professional producer would try to create the beat around the singer's range,

766
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
try to figure out where do we fit your voice in there,

767
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
or make a good singer, of course, will also know to fit their singing to the beat,

768
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
but for me, I try to seek out beats that I will sound good on top of.

769
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I more or less know where my voice falls in the range from just looking at my singing through an equalizer.

770
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So I just try to make it so there is space in the beat for that sound frequency that nothing else is on that exact spot.

771
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And granted, I don't do this very often, most of my music just sounds like shit.

772
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It just sounds like a garbled mess, because I can't avoid these problems,

773
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
either because I didn't make the beat or whatever else.

774
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But when you're actually making your own, it's very nice to get to go like,

775
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I will sometimes create a beat just by thinking,

776
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
alright, let me find a low-pitched noise and a high-pitched noise and something in the middle that doesn't counteract my voice.

777
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And if you have those three things, you're done, essentially.

778
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You just got to arrange them into a song.

779
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I guess I just got to work at it a bit.

780
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It always annoys me. I'm getting close. I have a bass line.

781
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I play that and it loops and it's like, that's pretty good.

782
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I add some drums and it's like, yeah, it's pretty good, but it doesn't feel like a song.

783
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Well, it also helps remember, especially if you're doing a guerrilla style thing,

784
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
that most of it is sample-based.

785
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Rather than just making it out of the sounds that are built into the program,

786
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
it might help to go and just go find drum sounds that you want to use

787
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
or make your own samples or even something like that.

788
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sure that a lot of...

789
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
In the case of guerrillas, the album The Fall, I think he literally made that

790
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
in a week on his iPad while flying to new places or something.

791
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
When I learned that he made it on an iPad, I was like, okay, well, I have an iPad.

792
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Maybe I could try. Maybe he could make something.

793
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It's funny because I used to fuck around in GarageBand way back when I had a Mac,

794
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and that makes that kind of thing a lot easier because it comes with a sample pack.

795
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
A lot of those guys, I don't know if Damon Albarn specifically uses GarageBand,

796
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
but I will hear the sounds that are pre-packaged with GarageBand in all kinds of music,

797
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
especially TV shows.

798
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
AudioJungle.com.

799
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Even Yuki Kajiyura, who's my favorite anime soundtrack composer,

800
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I know she uses GarageBand just because some of those loops come up in her songs.

801
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm like, ah, there they are. I've played with these myself,

802
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
but it's also a little embarrassing when you hear it too much.

803
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm watching House Hunters or something, and I'm like, okay, I know all this music is made out of three loops.

804
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The soundtrack was crafted in 30 minutes, and I could have done it myself.

805
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I mean, I don't really mind that it feels...

806
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The thing that I've always had problems with in music is just having songs that have beginnings and endings

807
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and hooks and stuff, like a flow.

808
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't really care what I make it with or how it sounds.

809
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
All you need is 8 bars of intro, 16 bars for the first verse, 8 bars of chorus, 16 bars for the second verse,

810
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
8 bars of chorus, some kind of bridge for 4 to 8 bars, 8 bars of chorus again, 8 bars of outro.

811
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That's every pop song, so...

812
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, there you go.

813
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Write that down, kids.

814
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, let me actually write that down.

815
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
She delivered for you.

816
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Clickety-clack down the track.

817
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And at 130 BPM, that almost always equals a 2-minute song, which is why nowadays,

818
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
rap music, you'll notice that there are so many songs that are almost exactly 2 minutes,

819
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and it's just because if you just do that structure I just described at the minimal level,

820
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
it will always come out to 2 minutes.

821
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You'll see that on a lot of my albums that I did with Shade,

822
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
because he just builds a song to that structure, and it's just like, okay, done.

823
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Is that going to be the Radcon rap?

824
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Is it going to be exactly 2 minutes?

825
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
No, it'll probably be much longer, because there's 6 of us on it.

826
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
We've got a lot to cover.

827
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
There's a lot of garlic to butter, a lot of bread to slice, you know.

828
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Gotcha, gotcha.

829
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Obviously, we're in the middle of the show right now, but what do we want this track to be?

830
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Do we want it to be an epic length of this track, or like a cool, in and out, more of a hit song?

831
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I was thinking, for the purposes of the, you know, it's a story.

832
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The PCP got hacked, and we're dissing Brad Garlic House.

833
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I think it should be a storytelling song, instead of just a fucking view.

834
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I think that the music video should tell the story, if there is one, and the song is just...

835
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Well, I mean, there's one of the same.

836
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You can't really tell a story with a song that isn't telling a story.

837
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I mean, of course you can. Music videos hold the time of stories that aren't in the song.

838
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Usually in the song, maybe you don't pay attention to the lyrics.

839
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Usually the video is like an interpretation of the song on some level, but...

840
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'm not literally saying, like, let's start with a story time, of course.

841
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Like, once upon a time, the PC... I mean, we could do that.

842
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Well, I don't care what we do with it, honestly, but if we don't tank Ripple XRP when the release of that song comes,

843
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
we will have failed our mission, so that's my one thing that I want to have happen.

844
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
My one thing is that we're on the PCP channel right now.

845
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That would be nice. That would be nice, Brad.

846
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Help us out.

847
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Where's this going?

848
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
No? Okay, never mind.

849
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You're gonna upload this episode on your channel, Nate?

850
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I don't know. Probably not, considering I already said I don't want to.

851
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah. Why is that?

852
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
There you go. Because my channel is for very specific content.

853
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Okay. So, like, it wasn't in the plan or anything.

854
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It wasn't in your plan or anything that, like, any of these PCP episodes might go up on your channel.

855
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But the rest of us, though, that was our plan.

856
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Uh, fair enough.

857
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
No, I'm saying that ironically, man. Being sarcastic.

858
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm saying you're being selfish for not wanting to upload this on your channel,

859
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
when the rest of us are totally willing to do it.

860
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That's what I'm saying. Fuck you.

861
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You are welcome to have that opinion.

862
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I do. Fair enough.

863
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay.

864
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Well, result.

865
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Excellent.

866
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Hey, Tom.

867
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yo.

868
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
What's going on with you, dog?

869
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Uh, I made a cell shader, and I'm really proud of it.

870
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
That's what I did while everyone else doing PCP the last two weeks.

871
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I figured it out.

872
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I made in Blender a shader that looks just like a cartoon,

873
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
really easily, and it looks good, and it has line art that, like, scales.

874
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It doesn't get distorted as a bunch of 3D nerd shit that most people don't understand.

875
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But it looks great, and it's crisp, and it's perfect, and I love it,

876
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and I put an animation up on Twitter.

877
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Uh, it's great. 10 out of 10.

878
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Unlocked full potential of doing cartoon style in Blender.

879
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Really proud. 10 out of 10, good times.

880
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
What if we used 100% of our brain?

881
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh, we have the answer. We have the answer.

882
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah, you get perfect cell shading. That's what happens.

883
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I saw... I was reading political articles.

884
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, no. That's nothing to do with cell shading.

885
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I got accidentally redirected to some article,

886
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and it was like Jeff Bezos talking about...

887
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
No, no, it's like Trump says to Bill Gates,

888
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
like, you will not ban this invention. The American people need it.

889
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I was like, what the fuck is this?

890
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And it was talking about some, like, breakthrough.

891
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Like, Bill Gates says, we can now access 100% of the brain.

892
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It was just a fake article for, like, some brain pills.

893
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It was just, like, some fucking brain pills of advertisement.

894
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Thank you, Alex Jones for bringing those to our attention.

895
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes, it was Alex Jones' tear shit, and I had been had.

896
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I've been having those every day, and I can tell you they don't affect me very much.

897
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Sorry, my internet...

898
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I already had 100% of my brain, I guess. You know, what are you gonna do?

899
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
My internet cut out for a second. What was being said?

900
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Brain pills.

901
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Brain pills.

902
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Brain pills.

903
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Thumbs up or thumbs down.

904
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
He's a genius now.

905
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
He bought and invested.

906
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Here's, I'll just run this by you guys.

907
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
This is a thought I was having earlier about a potential video I might make

908
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
about different types of level design and game design

909
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and storytelling and game design.

910
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And I was thinking about it because of Dark Souls.

911
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I started playing Dark Souls 3 again, which is fucking bay.

912
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It is.

913
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I was thinking about how Dark Souls 1 is definitely way more open-ended.

914
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
There's a lot more you can do, a lot more variety in the ways you can play it.

915
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
But how Dark Souls 3 is so opulent and tightly crafted,

916
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and it's like every single moment of it is really memorable, to me at least.

917
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I was thinking about the trade-off between more modern and older games,

918
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and how most modern games are trying to create a very linear, tightly crafted experience,

919
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but with a lot of depth, at least in the visual and graphics department,

920
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
where they're trying to make it so that there's a lot of verbosity to the storytelling.

921
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That's the term I've come up with.

922
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The way I would describe what is verbosity in a video game setting is

923
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
if you were to translate this into a book, how many words would it take

924
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
to convey everything that's on the screen?

925
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That's just a normal word, Digi. That just is a word that means that.

926
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yes.

927
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Well, I'm applying it to game design, because in the case...

928
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So to give an example of a game that I would consider to be not verbose,

929
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
but also extremely nonlinear would be Dwarf Fortress, right?

930
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Almost anything can happen in that game, but the way that it will happen,

931
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the way it will be described to you, is just a sentence telling you that it happened,

932
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
whereas in say like...

933
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think I've heard this video.

934
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah? Are you saying somebody's already made this point that I'm making here?

935
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
No, it's you. Didn't you talk about Dwarf Fortress in that big,

936
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
old or autistic something or other something?

937
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I don't think so. I don't remember.

938
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
You were talking about all the different forms of our mediums and then how they...

939
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh, I don't...

940
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't think I did talk about Dwarf Fortress in that video, but maybe.

941
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't remember if I did, but...

942
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Anyway, point being that in that game, like, tons of things can happen,

943
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
but they will not be described in very much detail.

944
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It's just kind of telling you that the thing happened,

945
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
as like in an uncharted game or something, even just like Nick Drake jumps and grabs ledge.

946
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Like, that story is told in like an obscene amount of detail through the visuals and graphics and all that.

947
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So, like, the question becomes, like, what makes...

948
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I don't know if I agree with this at all.

949
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Like, the game's state of Dwarf Fortress is so much more complex than any of these other games you're talking about.

950
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
We're talking about raw graphical representation, though, right?

951
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
To fully...

952
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Well, that's such verbosity.

953
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
To fully describe the game's state of Dwarf Fortress would take so many more words.

954
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yes, well, that's the thing.

955
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
To describe the current game's state, but the game's state should be...

956
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
If I'm playing uncharted, for instance, like, if I were to say that, like,

957
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
describing this one moment, all that simply is happening is that Nate Drake is, you know, climbing up a wall.

958
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But, like, that is in the middle of the ongoing story of what's happening.

959
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Like, in Dwarf Fortress, one thing is happening right now.

960
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But, yes, to describe everything that led up to that point would take a long time.

961
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well, one thing is happening, but, like, one thing is happening, like, everywhere simultaneously.

962
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Like, a separate thing.

963
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Like, every tile of the map has its own state and, like, every entity that exists has its own state

964
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and, like, also history of everything that ever happened to it.

965
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Would you say that that state is, like...

966
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
How do I put it?

967
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Because, like, I agree with you that, like, keeping track of what's happening in Dwarf Fortress would be, like, a much more complex operation.

968
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm just thinking about, like, if let's say that one of the stories being told in this game is, like, Dwarf goes too well, you know?

969
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Like, there is nothing to that other than that phrase in that game, you know?

970
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Whereas, like, Nate Drake Goes Too Well has a visual representation that tells another conglomerate of stories

971
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
through the art design and everything else like that, you know?

972
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And this is...

973
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I mean, there is information conveyed in...

974
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I mean, I think both games have certain information that they do convey and certain information that they don't.

975
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I mean, visually, in terms of, like, what it looks like when he does this thing, yeah, there's a lot more going on in Uncharted.

976
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Are we talking about Uncharted?

977
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Whatever game, it doesn't matter.

978
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Uncharted is just the first HD, visually focused, you know, experience-driven game.

979
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It was just making me think about how, essentially, you always are going to have to kind of pick where on this slider you want to be,

980
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
because there's, like, limited time and resources to get anything made.

981
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And so, the more nonlinear an experience is going to be, the less verbose it necessarily can be within the same, you know, same resources

982
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
as making something linear but super verbose, you know?

983
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You're talking about how you can't have a character progression and a story arc in Minecraft,

984
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
because it's Minecraft, you know, to have that, like, randomly generate would be impossible.

985
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah, that's...

986
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yes, that is partly what I'm saying as well.

987
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Like, in any game where...

988
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I guess I'm thinking more about, like, Asset Generation, like, the sheer complexity of Dwarf Fortress,

989
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:41,000
you can't, like, the reason it doesn't have a visual interface is that you'd have to just account for so many possibilities,

990
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
it would take fucking forever, you know, to create, like, an actual visual interpretation of what's happening.

991
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So, you know, the way I see it, it's just like, any of those games, like, the games with the super complex systems almost never have super complex graphics, you know?

992
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
That almost always comes down to a more linear experience.

993
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And, you know, on that point, it ties into the video I've long been thinking about making, which is this, like, whatever it is,

994
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I've yet to find a satisfying teleport, but it's like the, like, cap or, like, the curve of, like, intellectual...

995
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Like, the ceiling of intellectual complexity, meaning, the more, like, take your Final Fantasy XV, that game is quote-unquote complex,

996
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
but it's complex in many superficial ways that don't tie into, at least superficial in terms of gameplay,

997
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
but in terms of, like, rendering and graphical representation, like, all the complexity is there.

998
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
When it comes to gameplay, you mash X to attack. And there's other options, too.

999
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And that's part of what I kind of want, like, the takeaway from this video idea I have to be.

1000
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And it's something I've been saying in a lot of my videos lately, is just that, like, I really think that when you're crafting a story,

1001
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
you should always be asking yourself, like, what story am I telling right now?

1002
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Not so much in, like, the broad sense of, like, everything has to fit into my grand narrative,

1003
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
but just that whatever you're doing, it should be telling a story.

1004
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It should contribute to the telling of a story, and if it doesn't tell a story or contribute to the story,

1005
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
or it's not an interesting story, then just try to get rid of it, you know?

1006
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Like, if there's parts in a video game where, let's say you're just walking through empty space

1007
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and maybe that could be because, let's say you're playing Xenoblade, right?

1008
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And you're in a gigantic open field full of monsters and it's, like, really epic

1009
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and you feel swept up in the moment, like, that's a good story about wandering around through an open field.

1010
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But usually, wandering around through an open field is not a story and it's not interesting,

1011
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and, you know, you would want to cut down on how much random wandering there is in your game

1012
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
unless that's, like, core to the point, like, Skyrim. And even then, it's boring.

1013
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's just a connection, the connecting thread that needs to be there for the story

1014
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
to feel the way that it does, you know?

1015
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But, like, overall, like, you know, trimming the fat is a good idea

1016
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and I think that the biggest problem with these AAA games that go all in on the graphics

1017
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
is that they don't always tell the story.

1018
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
They're not always contributing or at least not contributing enough

1019
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
for it to be worth the extra effort they're putting in, you know?

1020
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's like, how much, at what point does the verbosity become purple prose?

1021
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's just fill in, you know, extra detail that really wasn't necessarily

1022
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and doesn't contribute to the story, you know?

1023
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's nearly all of graphics. Like, how much does it...

1024
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
The way of rock is rendered with, like, perfect lighting

1025
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
and it's like, oh, it's glistening with water and it's also dynamic

1026
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and graphics intensive and computer intensive

1027
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and that rock, like, slightly more sells the realisticness of the location

1028
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
but it's so redundant at some point.

1029
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Like, it's been redundant for years.

1030
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You can feel like...

1031
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
For a game that isn't redundant, though, would be Dark Souls.

1032
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Like, Dark Souls 3, everything you see tells a story in that game, you know?

1033
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I was going to mention Bloodborne, but yeah, the same thing with that.

1034
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So, like, and even just the random things that are used to sort of spruce up the environment,

1035
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
like, I think about Deus Ex Human Revolution, right?

1036
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That game has tons and tons of random, like, papers and stuff on all the desks in everybody's room

1037
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and it's almost all repeated.

1038
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Like, you can recognize the exact same assets in, like, every room in the game

1039
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
but they're just there to make it so that every room feels like somebody lives in it, you know?

1040
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And I'm fine with that. Like, obviously, it's a little distracting that the same stuff comes up over and over again

1041
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
but do I think that the game looks better with the clutter than it would without it?

1042
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I do kind of think so.

1043
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And, like, in the case of Dark Souls, like, there's all these random bodies strewn about all over the place, right?

1044
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
But, like, you know, they're placed in ways that look good.

1045
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
They contribute to the feeling of the setting and the story that has been told before you got there, you know?

1046
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And even if a lot of it is just obviously the same clone-stamped bodies, it's the way they're arranged,

1047
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
the way that, you know, meaning is derived from putting a character next to an object

1048
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
or putting it in this location or the story of, you know, going to this one random platform

1049
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
is interesting because of the item layout and the enemy layout.

1050
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It's just the game is always telling a story.

1051
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Every single encounter is a story, you know?

1052
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
This gives me a really cool idea.

1053
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Imagine a game that the story is about things being copy-pasted.

1054
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So it would be, you know, like mass-produced, like, everybody, like, there would be the same clutter in everybody's house,

1055
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
but the reason all the clutter is the same is because everybody's being fed the same information

1056
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and they're sort of like a hive mind of people.

1057
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You could make the, you know, having to copy-paste things for saving money into the story of the game,

1058
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
and then it would make more sense, and it would be like, oh, yeah.

1059
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That is a good idea.

1060
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I think, you know, this, tell your time.

1061
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Why don't you try and say something before I'll go after you?

1062
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I was just going to say, I think that the problem that you're talking about comes from just, like, intent and laziness, right?

1063
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Because, like, all these big AAA games, they want to be filmed.

1064
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Like, they're trying to be filmed.

1065
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That's why they have, like, these narrow scopes with this really, like, crazy amount of detail and stuff,

1066
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and also because, like, it's easier to sell to people,

1067
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
especially when your entire industry is kind of based on technological progression.

1068
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So it's like making an uncharted game that has, like, basically no depth, but, like, is a visual tour de force,

1069
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
is A, more filmic, which is what the normal people kind of understand.

1070
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Like, oh, it looks like a movie.

1071
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And it's easier to iterate on technical aspects than to be creative and build story.

1072
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And, like, the money still flows.

1073
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah, I mean, in the case of Uncharted, like, I think they really, they base the Uncharted games around the set pieces for the most part.

1074
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So I think they look at it as, like, what's a crazy, exciting set piece we can create

1075
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and what is necessary to make that happen.

1076
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And, like, I do think that the realism of those games adds to those scenes where some of them are really well done.

1077
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Like, this comes down to a problem of, like, for instance, Tomb Raider in the new Tomb Raider series,

1078
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
all the times where it, like, changes controls for a dramatic scene and, like, becomes a movie.

1079
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
They all suck. They're horrible.

1080
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And, like, every time one of those scenes happens.

1081
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Because they have to be incredibly easy so you can do it instantly.

1082
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Or they're not incredibly easy to do the first time, but it's completely fucking just asinine.

1083
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like, it's worse to fail it than it is to get it right the first time.

1084
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But those scenes, I hate them.

1085
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And every time they would come up, I would just think, like, man, this game had such a ludicrously overblown budget.

1086
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Because Tomb Raider 2013 or whatever, it was, like, it sold, like, six million copies

1087
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and was still a disappointment for Square Enix.

1088
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's just like, why did you put all these fucking expensive scripted sequences that don't contribute anything to the story?

1089
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They are not interesting stories in and of themselves. They are dull, generic.

1090
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
They're all the same story.

1091
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
A lot of cruffed slides down a fucking hill.

1092
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
That's, I mean, like, it's totally true, but Tomb Raider 1 or the 2013 one was critically acclaimed.

1093
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Everybody loved it. It got praise from everybody.

1094
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It is a great game, aside from those scenes. That's the thing.

1095
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Like, everything else it does, it does right.

1096
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But I think most people, I think there are a lot of people, like, the mass market,

1097
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
that enjoy the spectacle of those scenes and don't care about the lack of complexity.

1098
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Maybe. But those are definitely true.

1099
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,000
That is what I think is the biggest thing that hurts modern games is that they throw in too much frivolous shit

1100
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and one frivolous thing in a game that costs millions to generate, like, a second of gameplay, you know?

1101
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It's a lot of fucking wasted money.

1102
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Right.

1103
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Here's an interesting example about that.

1104
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So I've recently, I replayed Kingdom Hearts 3 recently on Critical Mode.

1105
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
The game is a nightmare. It's a disaster, like, through most of it.

1106
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The only times that that game is good is some amusing, like, engagement between the Disney stories,

1107
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
like the characters and the original Kingdom Hearts story.

1108
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Sometimes that's good, like in Monsters, Inc., a little bit, and in Toy Story.

1109
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Like, the ending of the game is an absolute nightmare, makes me want to kill myself.

1110
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Absolute fuck up.

1111
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But the DLC, well, first of all, Critical Mode was added, so now fighting is actually kind of fun,

1112
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and the DLC data boss fights at the end are actually good.

1113
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
None of that was my point.

1114
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
My point is that as I was playing through the game the second time,

1115
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
and this is the first time, but whatever, there's a...

1116
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Have you guys ever played the game The Witness by Jonathan Blow?

1117
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You know what that game is?

1118
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I've heard of it.

1119
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I know it.

1120
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It's a...

1121
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
For anyone who doesn't know, it's a perspective-based game where you walk around in a 3D environment.

1122
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
That's correct. That's correct.

1123
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And it has...

1124
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That game, The Witness, has a unique feature about a lot of things...

1125
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Real quick, I would recommend actually...

1126
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah.

1127
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It was Joseph Alexander who did a 45-minute review of that game, right?

1128
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And Joseph Anderson.

1129
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Joseph Anderson.

1130
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yeah, I believe that's right.

1131
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
That was a pretty good video.

1132
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
That's the only video by that guy that I really enjoyed, so check it out.

1133
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, that's his best one.

1134
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, check it out.

1135
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Because interestingly enough, there is one thing that's...

1136
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I was wondering if it was maybe copied in KM3 from that,

1137
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and there's lots of these...

1138
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
In certain positions in The Witness, things will line up in...

1139
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
There's a thing you look for.

1140
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It's a dot with a line after it.

1141
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And it could be things like in a certain position on the island you're on,

1142
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
the clouds will form that position.

1143
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You have to look at it in this perspective,

1144
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and then draw a line with your mouse, and it'll do something.

1145
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
There's a mechanic similar to that in KM3,

1146
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
which is these Mickey emblems that are scattered throughout the world.

1147
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And as you play through the game, you can find them.

1148
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And if you're very keen in looking for things...

1149
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
For example, there's these three pillars of rocks

1150
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
that don't look like anything as you're climbing Mount Olympus.

1151
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
But when you get to the top of Mount Olympus and you look down at them,

1152
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
suddenly they form the shape of Mickey's head,

1153
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
which is the Mickey emblem, and you can take a picture of it,

1154
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
and that gives you the achievement.

1155
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Stuff like that was cool.

1156
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And the thing to tie into what we were saying was that

1157
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
one of those things, which actually didn't involve the perspective thing,

1158
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
but as I was playing through the game, I got to Monster's Inc.

1159
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
and I was fucking around doing stuff.

1160
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I beat the level.

1161
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
One of the things they do in Kingdom Hearts is they recreate

1162
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
places from the Pixar worlds in now an explorable 3D environment

1163
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
in the Kingdom Hearts world.

1164
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And a lot of people just enjoy that,

1165
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
even though they have to partner with a company and recreate every detail.

1166
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Blah, blah, blah. It's a whole big thing.

1167
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But one of the things is, if you remember on the scare floor in Monster's Inc.,

1168
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
there's just desks where Mike Wazowski and Sully would work,

1169
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
and Mike worked at his desk and had papers and stuff,

1170
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and Sully would go scare in the doors and then come back out.

1171
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So they've each got desks covered with paper.

1172
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
As I was playing through the game again and getting all the emblems,

1173
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
one of the desks, written on the paperwork,

1174
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
has a unique thing, which is like a bunch of wires in a circle,

1175
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
and those wires are a Mickey emblem.

1176
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
They're in the shape of a Mickey emblem.

1177
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And you have to look for them specifically and find them.

1178
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And when I was going through and finding that,

1179
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
at no point did I ever give a single fuck about anything that was on any of those desks,

1180
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
as I was like blasting through the world,

1181
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
just killing the Heartless and the Unversed as fast as I could to get to the end,

1182
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
actually good part of the game.

1183
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
But then I was like, as I got to that,

1184
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
it made me suddenly take stock and kind of appreciate the environmental design

1185
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
that had gone in here, which is something that I just absolutely would not have done

1186
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
if I wasn't a completionist who wanted to get every little mini-game in the game completed.

1187
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And to tie it back to the point, it's just like they put so much work into all these details

1188
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,000
that 99% of people will want 100% just blast by and not pay any attention to.

1189
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I mean, it's really funny because there's some places where you want to praise that,

1190
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
and then other places where it's like, why did you bother?

1191
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Why did you try?

1192
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
There's a give and take.

1193
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Obviously, most people will never see Ash Lake in Dark Souls,

1194
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
but those who do will be like, this is a life-changing moment.

1195
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
In Kingdom Hearts, I'm not sure if you will feel much once you finally do observe all that stuff

1196
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
other than, oh, they put all this here? Why?

1197
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

1198
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
That mini-game is one of the more enjoyable actually gameplay things that was in the game from the start.

1199
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But I mean, it's true.

1200
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
In the grand scheme of things, did that save the game?

1201
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Absolutely not.

1202
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It's a complicated thing how good that game is, but yeah.

1203
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
In terms of the money and time, the 13 years to get the game done due to various reasons,

1204
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
obviously it wasn't all that they were just building out specific stuff like this.

1205
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm just going to go ahead and call that, I mean, obviously what it is, bad project management,

1206
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
which is just Square Enix in a nutshell.

1207
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The fact that they have had all of these issues, like the whole Tomb Raider being considered underselling

1208
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
because of how much it costs, is just the kind of stuff you look at and you go like,

1209
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
how fucked is your corporate structure that you can make this mistake?

1210
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Because I know that Square, obviously Square Enix isn't the studio that developed Tomb Raider,

1211
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
but they are the publisher, so they were obviously part of it.

1212
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The fact that they agreed to like,

1213
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Well, and that they were having this issue on all their games,

1214
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
because that year it was also like Hitman Absolution and fucking, what was it, Sleeping Dogs.

1215
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Those were all three games that they had published that all had sold millions of copies

1216
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and all were considered financial disappointments.

1217
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And all were just way over the top with the graphics.

1218
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And it's like, there's no need for this.

1219
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I don't know if this makes you as...

1220
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
The reason they're all doing it is because I think it makes them competitive to have better graphics,

1221
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
but it's like, you're being competitive with games that are selling 10 million copies.

1222
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You're not...

1223
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Only one in every so many games that even attempts to reach that audience is going to do so.

1224
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So it's just not worth the risk of trying to even do that.

1225
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I agree.

1226
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I agree.

1227
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
There's an aspect to this as well, which is games that go for a heavy stylistic approach

1228
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,000
where the heavy computer processing power is not required in any way.

1229
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And the art...

1230
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I was playing Okami, right?

1231
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The best game ever made.

1232
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And the game, if you're not aware, is about a dog, a wolf.

1233
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And you are the dog, and you are the wolf, and you are a god, and you have magic powers.

1234
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And because...

1235
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And it's like the graphic...

1236
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Graphical design is supposed to be that of like a Japanese painting, watercolour or calligraphy

1237
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and all that sort of cool, non-realistic looking shit.

1238
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And because of that, they can take massive shortcuts with things in the background.

1239
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
In the background, there's no skybox, there's just a big blank colour and calligraphy mountain.

1240
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Just a big black line of just a mountain and a tree or various mountains.

1241
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,000
When you're in the city, you can look up and you can see completely solid black silhouettes

1242
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
of almost like paper cut out tall Japanese buildings looking things.

1243
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And that's all they need to give you the illusion that this is a huge city with loads of stuff in

1244
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and then the mountain is like this world is vast.

1245
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And it's really smart to go with something like that,

1246
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
because not only did that game come out like a million years ago

1247
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and is still one of the best looking games I've ever seen in my life,

1248
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
but they were able to make it back then in the same way.

1249
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
They made HD versions, but nothing has been changed.

1250
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's just the fidelity, the resolution rather.

1251
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So it's a time saver, it's a money saver, it's a graphics saver and it's just better.

1252
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Just don't do realism.

1253
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I just wish that the AAA market was what I think it should be like an enthusiast niche.

1254
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Right now it seems like games are dominated by people,

1255
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
games that work as hard as possible to be the most technologically impressive.

1256
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I wish that was like with technology that the most advanced stuff is for that group that wants to get it

1257
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and be pushing the envelope, but that's not what it is.

1258
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Here's what I think happened and this is based on, there's a great show called What Happened on YouTube

1259
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
by a guy called Matt McMussles where he breaks down games that flopped

1260
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
or that had trouble developments, he goes through what happened.

1261
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And a lot of the time what he's talking about is how the seventh generation of consoles

1262
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
basically killed everybody.

1263
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Making games for the PS3 and Xbox 360 just because of the fact that all the games

1264
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
were trying to be the most expensive, most broad reaching game possible

1265
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and that's what the publishers wanted.

1266
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And so every promising game developer that starts to spring up, EA or whoever else comes in, buys them out

1267
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
and gives them a shit ton of money to make a bigger, crazier game and they can't do it.

1268
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Making games on that scale, especially when they keep getting mandates from the publisher

1269
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
for all these different things, oh now you gotta add multiplayer

1270
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
because this game came out with a hugely successful multiplayer and now we all have to have it

1271
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
and it's just like well it doesn't go in our game and it's expensive to implement, doesn't matter

1272
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
now the game's uneven, it's gonna get seven out of ten scores, it's not gonna sell

1273
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
more than one or two million when it needs to sell six or seven million

1274
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
and the developer gets shut down.

1275
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And it just comes down to I think all these publishers looking at GTA and Call of Duty

1276
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and saying we have to be that successful.

1277
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
We all want to be super rich giant corporations

1278
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and when you go in with that mentality that it's just like you're not thinking about how to make good art

1279
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
you're thinking about how other people have made money trying to copy it without really understanding what they did

1280
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:13,000
and then failing and it's just like this is not the environment to do creativity in

1281
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
like if you want to make stories you have to think about the story you're making

1282
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
what is the appropriate size of this project, what is the appropriate amount of effort and budget to spend on this

1283
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:29,000
so that it can make profit you know and I think that with a lot of these triple A games

1284
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
with all the crazy graphics and stuff really the problem is that the price of games has never increased

1285
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
but the expectations have you know that like games keep being six well it's not that they never increased

1286
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,000
but you know going into the seventh gen it became $60 was the standard but it's like you know $60

1287
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I could spend $60 on Dark Souls and they will be making way more money off of that $60

1288
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,000
than Tomb Raider would have made off the same purchase you know and it's just like that's smart business

1289
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:05,000
and that's why even a small developer like FromSoft by just not bloating their process

1290
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
can keep making these games that feel like magic because they

1291
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I'm not even sure that they count as triple A but they are the only triple A company I trust

1292
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
like only one I don't trust anybody else anymore

1293
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
least of all Square Enix

1294
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
well let's hope Elden Green is fucking baller

1295
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
indeed

1296
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
you have been playing Okami I recall you saying on Twitter

1297
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
hell yeah it's fucking great

1298
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
talk about how cool it is

1299
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
it's the fucking shit I mean I just I find myself I constantly getting lost in Okami

1300
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
just trying to figure out how Clover did all the fucking things they did

1301
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I don't understand because like a lot of the stuff in the game is just sprites to cut down on the poly count

1302
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
because I'm playing Okami and like it's funny because you're saying like it's not very graphically taxing

1303
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
and now it's not but I have a strong suspicion that at the time this was pushing the PS2 to its limits

1304
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
maybe it was

1305
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
a lot of the things they do

1306
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
it never chugged on my PS2

1307
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
yeah it's because it's like because the way they're doing the outlines for all the characters

1308
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
they're doing what I'm doing it's called the inverted hull

1309
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
it's where you duplicate the mesh and have it the back of the faces be transparent

1310
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
so you can see through it and then you make it a little bigger

1311
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
so all you see is the outline of this like duplicate shell around the main mesh

1312
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and so that doubles the poly count of everything in the game

1313
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and when you're working with this low headroom like the PS2 that's a problem

1314
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
so the characters are all really simplistically designed

1315
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
like the characters don't have any mouths that articulate or anything like that

1316
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
the head just kind of jingle around when they're talking

1317
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
and like there's like a poly count limit in the engine

1318
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
because there's no enemies on screen you always go into this little tiny arena

1319
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
when you encounter one of those scrolls and then the enemies spawn

1320
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
so they don't have to draw the background

1321
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
so there's tons of little like shortcuts they're doing

1322
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
but it all just looks aesthetically gorgeous

1323
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
because like it has like considered art direction from the very beginning

1324
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
and like it's really interesting because like Okami originally was going to be a photorealistic game

1325
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
like there's an old ass fucking trailer and screenshot of like a realistic Amaterasu

1326
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
running in a realistic looking field

1327
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and it just wasn't feasible with the PS2

1328
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
so they completely changed the art direction

1329
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
and once they got the painterly style that's when they added the celestial brush

1330
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
because they started like thinking of other ways to use this art style

1331
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
reflected in gameplay

1332
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and there's just so many fucking cool things that the game does

1333
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
and it's just so brilliantly considered

1334
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and the way the aesthetics and the gameplay blend together

1335
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
it's fucking great it's like

1336
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Kamiya's the man dude

1337
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
he really is

1338
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
and the fact that like all these characters referenced

1339
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Devil May Cry and Beautiful Joe is fucking badass

1340
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
every time you fight Wakka he makes a reference to one of Kamiya's other games

1341
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
and it makes me lull

1342
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
it's great

1343
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
are you excited for a

1344
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
probably for Okami

1345
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
are you excited for the wonderful 101 ports

1346
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
coming out

1347
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
yeah cause I haven't played it

1348
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
even though I have a Wii U

1349
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I never got around to buying it

1350
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
cause at the time I didn't even realize that was a Kamiya game

1351
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
cause I'm a fool

1352
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
you know that's cool

1353
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I don't know if any of you saw it

1354
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I don't know if any of you saw it

1355
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
the Matthew Matosis talking about the Kickstarter

1356
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
where he straight up called Wonderful 101

1357
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
his favorite game of all time

1358
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
he did

1359
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
damn

1360
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
he said that Rain World

1361
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
might be vying with it for domination

1362
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
that was interesting

1363
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Matthew has a very specific taste

1364
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I know that his best favorite game of all time

1365
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
is not going to be something that I would like on the same level

1366
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
um but

1367
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
maybe

1368
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
like he's into that arcade stuff

1369
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Wonderful 101 was like oh yeah it's basically

1370
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
beautiful Joe, Devil May Cry and Okami

1371
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
all wrapped up into one game

1372
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
so like the biggest come in the universe

1373
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I mean maybe

1374
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I have like very specific desires

1375
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
and it's really just

1376
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I want to be in a three dimensional world

1377
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and have autonomy to turn around

1378
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
anything that is like an arcadey version

1379
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
like oh 2.5D makes me

1380
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
you know that's a big trigger

1381
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
that's a big no-no

1382
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
where you have 3D but

1383
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
you've taken it to the two dimension

1384
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
and you're just fake 3D

1385
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I can't run around and jump on things

1386
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
fuck you

1387
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
but actually it's fine

1388
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I did beat that game

1389
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
years ago

1390
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
on a Friends Wii U

1391
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and I did like it a lot

1392
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
uh

1393
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
but I don't really care

1394
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
that it's getting remade

1395
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
but I'm happy for those who do

1396
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
so Godspeed everybody who's

1397
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
who's interested

1398
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I'll get it

1399
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
it'll be sick I'm sure

1400
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I already have it

1401
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I prefer Devil May Cry

1402
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
what can I say

1403
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I'm positive I'll prefer Devil May Cry

1404
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
because it's my jam

1405
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
and it's my favorite forever

1406
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
for all time

1407
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I mean the fact of the matter is

1408
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
that the reason the wonder

1409
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
other than the fact that it's on the Wii U

1410
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I think the reason the wonderful 101

1411
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
was always poised for lack of success

1412
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
is just that it doesn't look

1413
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
cool on the surface

1414
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
like it looks deliberately

1415
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
lame in a way

1416
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
and I think that

1417
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
whatever it is going for

1418
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
obviously once you actually understand it

1419
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and you you know engage with it

1420
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
then you'll appreciate it on its own terms

1421
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
and I think that

1422
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Matthew Matosis is very good at that

1423
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and

1424
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
like it fascinates me to see

1425
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
the different reasons people like things

1426
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
because like I tend to be of the opinion

1427
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
that like I like it because it's good

1428
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
you know and like

1429
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I like all kinds of things that are good

1430
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that appeal to me in some way

1431
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
but like the main appeal

1432
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
is the fact that it's good

1433
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
whereas I think most people

1434
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
the main appeal is on a conceptual level

1435
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
more so it's like

1436
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
that is like 80% of the battle

1437
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
for most people

1438
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
it's like I get to play as a cool guy

1439
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and slash things

1440
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
it's like most of it

1441
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
and then the fact that it's good

1442
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
is what keeps you coming back

1443
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I think it's because most people's

1444
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
like occupation isn't exploring media

1445
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
and so they have to make choices

1446
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
well it's funny because

1447
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
that gets brought up every time I think

1448
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
about this but like the reason

1449
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
my occupation is exploring media

1450
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
is because I love exploring media

1451
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
like I made that my occupation

1452
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
so not everybody has autism like you do

1453
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
so that's another thing

1454
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
well that's and it's sad because

1455
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
everybody who I have ever known

1456
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
who has experimented

1457
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
it makes your life better

1458
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
because you eventually find things

1459
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
that you didn't know you wanted

1460
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
it's like if I had never started

1461
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
eating Asian food

1462
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I imagine my life would be very different

1463
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
you would never love Japan period

1464
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
right

1465
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
it's just funny to me to think that

1466
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
like because there's lots of people

1467
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
especially when it comes to food

1468
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
here in America

1469
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
almost most of the people I know

1470
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
or encounter have just never

1471
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
even tried experimenting with other stuff

1472
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
and I always come away like why

1473
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
wouldn't you assume there are things

1474
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
that you will love that are out there

1475
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
that you haven't found yet

1476
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
won't you be like so fucking hype

1477
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
when you find out about those things

1478
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
but I don't know

1479
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
most people don't seem to care

1480
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
they're just like I'm fine with what I got

1481
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
and I'm like alright

1482
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
there's a guy I know out here in Ohio

1483
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
this doesn't speak highly of this

1484
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
place in the country or the world

1485
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
but who as far as he knows

1486
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
has never eaten anything except

1487
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I believe it was fries and chicken tenders

1488
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
his entire life

1489
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and this is just how he survives

1490
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
that's it

1491
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
my dad knew a guy who lived off hot dogs

1492
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
so I guess it's possible somehow

1493
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
fair enough

1494
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
fair enough

1495
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
you're just

1496
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
by the way that reminds me

1497
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I am glad that this

1498
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
remaster is coming or whatever

1499
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
release for PC or whatever

1500
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
because I'll probably play through it again on that

1501
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
because I always want to take notice

1502
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
of Matthew Matosis

1503
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
and he's the guy who's made me

1504
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
like Matthew Matosis introduced me to the idea

1505
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
that like I should go back

1506
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I've beaten all the Devil May Cries

1507
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
but like I should play them again

1508
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
and find out why I don't get them

1509
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
because I still don't understand

1510
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I mean I just haven't done this yet

1511
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I've been saying for a while

1512
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I need to find out why

1513
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
the point system

1514
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and the trying to like master combat

1515
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
is like particularly enjoyable

1516
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
whatever I talked about this before

1517
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I don't get it yet

1518
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
and I'm gonna make some effort

1519
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
and Wonderful 101 is absolutely one of those games

1520
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
where like the real goal

1521
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
is to get pure platinum

1522
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
unlike every mission

1523
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
that's when you really beat

1524
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
that's well I think there's a

1525
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I think that one of the biggest problems in game journalism

1526
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
is that not enough people approach games

1527
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
on their own terms

1528
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
and it's because

1529
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
every reviewer is reviewing

1530
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
is trying to appeal to everybody

1531
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
they're trying to like

1532
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
imagine like the layman

1533
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
like the perfect just gamer

1534
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
who is generic

1535
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
who will like the same things

1536
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
whose opinion is predictable

1537
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
you know like they're thinking

1538
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
okay most people only play a game once

1539
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
so let's review this from the perspective

1540
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
of having played this game once

1541
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
and it's like okay but in the case of

1542
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
like Beautiful Joe

1543
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
or any of Kamiya's games pretty much

1544
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
like the point

1545
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
is to play it more than once

1546
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
like the game is not designed

1547
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
with the expectation that you would play it only once

1548
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
most of his games are like two to six hours long

1549
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
you know wonderful one-on-one

1550
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I understand is much longer

1551
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
but like you know the

1552
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
yes you will have a good time

1553
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
playing Devil May Cry through once

1554
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and that's kind of a testament to how great

1555
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
the design of the game is

1556
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
but like can you really review it

1557
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
if you're not having the experience that

1558
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
the game is meant to

1559
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
to provide and will provide

1560
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
at its best like

1561
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
shouldn't we

1562
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
shouldn't some reviewers

1563
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
like make sure that they get to that point

1564
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
before they really talk about the game

1565
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
and that's why I appreciate Matthew Matosis

1566
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
and Super Bunnyhop

1567
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
so much as well

1568
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
right they'll 100%

1569
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
they'll go to the highest difficulty

1570
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
and a lot of the times

1571
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
you don't really get to experience all the systems

1572
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
of a game until you go to the highest difficulty

1573
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
because it will push you to have to learn

1574
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
those systems especially Metal Gear Solid

1575
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
where you know as he

1576
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
put it in the MGS3 video

1577
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
where he says like low level play looks like this

1578
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
and he's like

1579
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
looks like a super serious action game

1580
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
and he's like high level play looks like this

1581
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
and it's like five guys standing around a porn magazine

1582
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
that then like spews out knock out gas

1583
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and knocks them all unconscious

1584
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
and it's like yeah

1585
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
just mastery of the systems completely

1586
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and just you can do it everyone

1587
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
oh it's beautiful

1588
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
and it's like obviously the average player

1589
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
will not do those things

1590
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
so reviewers don't try to account for it

1591
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
but like what if the reviewer tried

1592
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
to push you to do those things

1593
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
like Matthew Matosis

1594
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
he didn't just beat

1595
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
like do a perfect run of Devil May Cry

1596
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
he's like hey

1597
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
why don't you challenge yourself

1598
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and try to get this good at some game

1599
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
like surely there's a game

1600
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
that you're passionate about

1601
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and like you will learn so much more about it

1602
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
if you play it this way

1603
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
so like if you really want to develop

1604
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
a real relationship with your video game

1605
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
like you know

1606
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
just try some things

1607
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
try some kind of challenge

1608
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
absolutely true

1609
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I got to plug this thing real quick

1610
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
because with the DLC release

1611
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
for Kingdom Hearts 3

1612
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
remind DLC

1613
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
with all the actual good bosses

1614
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
at the end of the game now

1615
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
there has been an influx

1616
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
of what's called

1617
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
something like Kingdom Hearts 3

1618
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
versus any of them

1619
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
like Marluxia

1620
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
level 1

1621
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
no hits

1622
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and then with style

1623
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
the rise of these with style videos

1624
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
has been exactly what I've been hoping for

1625
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
we would get

1626
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
and it's all these people

1627
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
doing insane

1628
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
like you were saying

1629
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
with Metal Gear Solid 3

1630
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
just having such mastery of the system

1631
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and knowing exactly

1632
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
every single thing you can do

1633
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
you think that fighting Terra

1634
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
or whatever

1635
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
back in the day in Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix

1636
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
was like

1637
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
hard

1638
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
the people who have mastery

1639
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
they just

1640
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
they can make them look like a child

1641
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
it's almost embarrassing to watch the bosses

1642
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
try to fight back

1643
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
against truly masterful players

1644
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
and there's one thing they'll do

1645
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
the with style thing

1646
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I just want to say

1647
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
the with style thing they do

1648
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
the number one thing is that

1649
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
there is a selfie mechanic

1650
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
in Kingdom Hearts 3

1651
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
and there is nothing more embarrassing for a boss

1652
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
that when they are charging up their super weapon

1653
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
and this player just knows

1654
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
so they just do a pose with Sora

1655
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and do a big like little like

1656
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
making fun of him

1657
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
gesture with his fucking hand

1658
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
and take a fucking selfie

1659
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
while they're charging up their death beam

1660
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that they know

1661
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
is going to do no damage

1662
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
because they know how to deal with it

1663
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
it's

1664
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
it's a performance art

1665
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
like the game

1666
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
it is

1667
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
the game allows you

1668
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
the game is a template for you

1669
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
essentially any video game

1670
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
is a canvas for storytelling

1671
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
that you participate in

1672
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
it's like

1673
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
how are you going to

1674
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
contribute to making this story good

1675
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
are you going to

1676
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
you know

1677
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
if you play like shit the whole game

1678
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
it's a shitty

1679
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
it's probably going to feel like a shitty story

1680
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
you know

1681
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
but if you master it

1682
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
you can make the story

1683
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
into something very different

1684
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and like

1685
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
like you were saying

1686
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I'm imagining Dark Souls players

1687
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
who will use the emotes extensively

1688
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and just how fucking funny

1689
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
some of the videos are where

1690
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
you know

1691
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
they're doing all this crazy stuff

1692
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
in the game

1693
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
or fucking with other people

1694
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and then using the emotes

1695
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
and like it

1696
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
it allows you to have charisma

1697
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
in as a game avatar

1698
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
you know

1699
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
see that

1700
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
that's the kind of review

1701
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
like I want one of those people

1702
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
to make my reviews

1703
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
of my video game

1704
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and that's why

1705
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
when I made my first

1706
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 review

1707
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
that's why

1708
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Seth Zenak is the best game reviewer

1709
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
yeah that's right

1710
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I was so clear on mine

1711
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
like this is the first one

1712
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I will get back to you

1713
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm going to fucking

1714
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
master the DLC

1715
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
so I can be

1716
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I've been dreaming of this

1717
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
for years

1718
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
that I will be the guy

1719
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
even if other people have done it too

1720
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
who does the equivalent of

1721
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
you know

1722
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
fucking

1723
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
super bunny hops

1724
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
100% middle of your solid 5

1725
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I'm going to be the 100%

1726
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC guy

1727
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
just give me 6 months

1728
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and you know

1729
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I'll be there

1730
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it's going to be good

1731
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
it's going to be good

1732
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
wait

1733
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
shut up

1734
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
wait before we go to voicemails

1735
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
I have to talk

1736
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
what's the matter Ben

1737
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
you don't like video games

1738
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
oh I want to talk about politics

1739
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I'm super

1740
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
yes I am

1741
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
super bored by this

1742
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
well I have to call

1743
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I have to have a

1744
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
a discussion

1745
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I got to reconvene

1746
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
with Ben and Nate

1747
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
because

1748
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
when this episode comes out

1749
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
it'll be the end of February

1750
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
and if you recall

1751
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
in the beginning of January

1752
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
we all made a pact

1753
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
oh dear

1754
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
about being healthy fit boys

1755
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
and I just want to say

1756
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
that since that day

1757
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
every day

1758
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
100% keto

1759
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
no carbs

1760
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
down almost 20 pounds

1761
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
how are you guys doing

1762
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
very nice

1763
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
that's fantastic

1764
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I have been keto

1765
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
for the last several weeks

1766
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I haven't weighed myself

1767
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
but diet-wise I'm doing good

1768
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I'm on track

1769
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
dope

1770
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
okay

1771
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I'll be

1772
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
that agreement was for one month

1773
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
and I definitely failed that month

1774
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm back

1775
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
obviously it's the end of February now

1776
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I have

1777
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
failed

1778
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
oh no

1779
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
failed is the short version

1780
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
okay

1781
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
yeah just be super clear

1782
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
but

1783
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
but

1784
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
gonna

1785
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
gonna do my best

1786
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I had free pizza thrown in front of me

1787
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
multiple times

1788
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I did resist

1789
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
now that's Will

1790
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
you know what

1791
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I'm glad this exists so that Tom

1792
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
you represent

1793
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
the good aspect

1794
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
like what one could aspire to be

1795
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
well done

1796
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I am probably the worst

1797
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I gained a couple pounds while I was away

1798
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I'm the guy who's getting really good at Kingdom Hearts instead

1799
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
instead I was really good at Kingdom Hearts

1800
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
yeah I didn't even do that

1801
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I was just on vacation doing nothing

1802
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
ooh what a waste

1803
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
we all have our strengths and weaknesses I suppose

1804
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I mean I haven't picked up lifting again

1805
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
which I wanted to do

1806
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
but I didn't do that

1807
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
yeah

1808
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I will make a vow

1809
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'll go today

1810
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
people listening

1811
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
be inspired

1812
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
even if you're in the hole

1813
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
fix it

1814
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I'm gonna go to work

1815
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Jim

1816
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
it's never too late

1817
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I'll go there

1818
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
that's right

1819
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
we got

1820
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
by the way

1821
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
11 days till Radcon 3

1822
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
so

1823
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
better get beach body ready

1824
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
real fast

1825
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
it's impossible to do that

1826
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
it's impossible to do that

1827
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
or Radcon 4

1828
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
after that

1829
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
you could lose 10 pounds easy

1830
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
in 11 days

1831
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
it's not about 10

1832
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
it's not about 10 pounds

1833
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
it's that I have body hair

1834
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
and it looks bad

1835
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
you could shave it

1836
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
that's a doable thing

1837
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I'm gonna shave my whole body

1838
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
it's weird

1839
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
why not

1840
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
literally why not

1841
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
that's what people do

1842
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I'm gonna give

1843
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
having the body hair

1844
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
or shaving

1845
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
that's the question

1846
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
both are gay

1847
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
both of those things are gay

1848
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
yeah

1849
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
he's right

1850
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
the problem is

1851
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
there's no getting around

1852
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
the

1853
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Radcon body is

1854
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
gonna be gay

1855
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
no matter what we do

1856
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
so

1857
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
it doesn't matter

1858
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
how you want to

1859
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
everything you do is gay

1860
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
yeah

1861
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
actually

1862
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
you know what

1863
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I think

1864
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I mentioned a long time ago

1865
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I have a fitness

1866
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
wall

1867
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
around here somewhere

1868
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
or like I've got

1869
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
like a chart

1870
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
did you saw this

1871
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
when he came to visit

1872
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
all my fitness goals

1873
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
one of them has long been

1874
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
for like

1875
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
the five years I've had the chart

1876
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
shave your entire body

1877
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
from the neck down

1878
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
maybe Radcon 3

1879
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
is the

1880
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Radcon 3 is dead

1881
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Radcon 4

1882
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I mean okay

1883
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
because bodybuilders do it

1884
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
a lot of them are just like funny

1885
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
like

1886
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
be like a bodybuilder

1887
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
yeah you want to be funny

1888
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
yeah I see

1889
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
it's a joke

1890
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
but

1891
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
wait wait

1892
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I'm laughing

1893
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
before we go to voicemails

1894
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I did want to say

1895
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
one last thing about video games

1896
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
sure

1897
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
talking about like the whole

1898
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
with style thing

1899
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I feel like

1900
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I come on like a different

1901
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
like if there's two sides to this coin

1902
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
one is the Devil May Cry

1903
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
play the game over and over again

1904
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
to get mastery of it

1905
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and the thing I like

1906
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
which is more

1907
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
to play a game

1908
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
what I would consider

1909
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Devil May Cry side

1910
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
would be like arcade

1911
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
like part of

1912
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
the fun is performing well

1913
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
in front of other people

1914
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
in the arcade

1915
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
looking at you being the cool kid

1916
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
playing the video game

1917
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
and the other side is

1918
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
just living

1919
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
in a video game world

1920
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
and just having autonomy

1921
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
and doing things

1922
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
and then existing

1923
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't really feel

1924
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
the need to perform well

1925
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and so when a game is like

1926
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
you have to be incredibly good

1927
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
otherwise it sucks

1928
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
as in

1929
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
with the case of Kingdom Hearts

1930
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
if it's like

1931
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
you're playing it casually

1932
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
you can play on easy

1933
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
but

1934
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
it's not

1935
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
on easy it's just boring

1936
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and you have to

1937
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
you have to play

1938
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
on the harder difficulties

1939
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
for it to be fun

1940
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
which is why I didn't like it that much

1941
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
the game is only good

1942
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I would argue

1943
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
at a high level of play

1944
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
when you're

1945
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
so like

1946
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
when the baseline

1947
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
enjoyment is

1948
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
the arcade thing

1949
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I don't really gravitate towards it

1950
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
but something like

1951
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Minecraft

1952
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
or World of Warcraft

1953
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
where

1954
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
it's just

1955
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
you

1956
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
can escape from the world

1957
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
and play a game

1958
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
and be a game character

1959
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
doing something

1960
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I mean Dark Souls

1961
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I would consider this as well

1962
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
because

1963
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
you don't need to

1964
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
necessarily be very good

1965
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
you can put loads of points into

1966
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
the OP thing

1967
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
and just

1968
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
run around

1969
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
and be powerful

1970
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
it's interesting you mentioned that

1971
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
with Dark Souls

1972
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
because of the fact that

1973
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
like

1974
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
if you know how to

1975
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
make it easy

1976
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
then Dark Souls

1977
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
can be a game where you run around

1978
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
like a

1979
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
good

1980
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
one of the main reasons

1981
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
to play Dark Souls

1982
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
is kind of as a horror game

1983
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
which obviously

1984
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
the more you master it

1985
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
the less you get out of that

1986
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I was explaining to May the other day

1987
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
that the funny thing about Dark Souls

1988
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
is that people are always talking about

1989
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
giving it an easy mode

1990
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
or whatever

1991
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
the reality is that the game is too easy

1992
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
yeah like

1993
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
there's no way to make it hard

1994
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
is really like

1995
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
you have to make it hard

1996
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
by your own volition

1997
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
you have to do things to yourself

1998
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
to make the game harder

1999
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
there is no hard mode

2000
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
New Game Plus is not significantly harder

2001
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and it only

2002
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
becomes harder

2003
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
you know

2004
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
for a certain amount of time

2005
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
so it's like

2006
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
yeah I think that

2007
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
that what makes Dark Souls

2008
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
so fascinating

2009
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
is that it can be

2010
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
both of those games at once

2011
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
you know

2012
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
that it both is a game

2013
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
where you can just hang out in the world

2014
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
and do whatever

2015
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and it's also a game

2016
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
where you can do the most

2017
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
crazy flamboyant

2018
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
challenge run

2019
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
you know

2020
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
and like

2021
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
a game like Devil May Cry

2022
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
only has one of those two

2023
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
aspects really

2024
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
you know like

2025
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
when I watch people play Devil May Cry 5

2026
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
it's obvious to me that like

2027
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
a huge part of the appeal

2028
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
to people who love the game

2029
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
is how complex the battle system

2030
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
or the abilities you have are

2031
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
and how much shit you can do

2032
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
and like for me

2033
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
it's like

2034
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I appreciate that at high level play

2035
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
you'll be forced to do all those things

2036
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
and therefore

2037
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
the game does kind of require you

2038
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
to get good

2039
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
for the game to be good

2040
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
but you can play it on normal

2041
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
you can just spam

2042
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
the same attack over and over again

2043
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
the game just not nearly as good

2044
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and it's still good

2045
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I mean I like all the Devil May Cry games

2046
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
even though

2047
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I've mostly just kind of

2048
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
you know

2049
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
played them in a boring way I guess

2050
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
or Bayonetta for a better example

2051
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I got a stone statue

2052
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
on almost every mission

2053
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
still beat the game

2054
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
in like eight hours

2055
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
you know it's not like a

2056
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
the only thing that makes the game

2057
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
super hard is trying to do well

2058
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
but that's also the

2059
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
you know for me

2060
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Bayonetta is like an 8 out of 10 game

2061
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I completely understand

2062
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
why it would be a 10 out of 10

2063
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
to somebody who

2064
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
does want to engage in those systems

2065
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
you know but like

2066
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Dark Souls can be a 10 out of 10 for me

2067
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
without being any good at it

2068
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
in fact Dark Souls would 10 out of 10 for me

2069
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
before I fucking played the game

2070
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Remember back in the days

2071
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
when Digi hadn't played Dark Souls

2072
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
that whole saga

2073
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I remember that

2074
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
it was a good time

2075
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I enjoyed it

2076
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Alright let's

2077
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
go to the voicemails

2078
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
voicemails okay alright

2079
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000

01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000

Radcon 4 Parasite

2091
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I think this is from a

2092
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
particular time and place in history

2093
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
let's see

2094
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
what he's got to say for himself

2095
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
okay and

2096
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000

Radcon 4

it's a

2109
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it's a

2110
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000

2113
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
it's a

2114
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
it's a

2115
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
ahhhhhhh

2116
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
remember when we had only

2117
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
earned $30,000

2118
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Redcon

2119
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I feel so bad

2120
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
for anyone that wasn't watching

2121
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
one of our streams live

2122
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
when we

2123
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
it was

2124
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
it was

2125
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
it was

2126
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
it was a great time

2127
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
we were all just like

2128
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
streaming each other's streams

2129
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
yea that's right

2130
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
this guy left a second one

2131
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
after we hit 33,000

2132
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
but it was pretty much

2133
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
just the same thing

2134
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
oh 33

2135
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,520
three I think I get the idea to discuss that on this episode I oh somehow days

2136
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:42,040
ago I thought that would be the entire episode but it's been a few days and now

2137
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,080
it's boring now it's lame it's boring now now I'm just now I'm just back to

2138
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,840
being mad that YouTube hasn't given the channels back yet sure sure human

2139
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,240
happiness is a fleeting thing we want to see the biggest come you've ever seen

2140
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:58,680
your life go watch one of the recordings of the live stream if people

2141
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,880
want I tweeted one out on my on my Twitter it's because I private the

2142
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,920
live shows would have been the one that went the longest so if you want the the

2143
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,160
entire thing you'd go to him but uh yes but I read my chair go most your

2144
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:15,160
head is red in my stream because you were on my yes well but everyone else

2145
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:23,160
could hear me saying it was read more than Nate's by me yeah that's true all

2146
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,880
right well I mean shit what is there anything else I mean we funded what do

2147
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,600
we fund on that stream we earned over one one one one one dollars more than

2148
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,680
that we earned like the Kickstarter ran until noon that day between midnight and

2149
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:38,520
noon we earned like $12,000 so we earned like a thousand dollars an hour that

2150
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:44,720
whole day and like like ten thousand hours yeah those last two hours are

2151
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:50,680
worth a week for sure we put the the the gruff showing the spike yeah yeah show

2152
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:54,160
notes will link the the tweet with the chart okay yeah I'll get it right after

2153
01:35:54,160 --> 01:36:02,040
this okay well yeah what do we find we got we got over the 2222 which I don't

2154
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:06,200
even remember what that was we because we were sure that at the start we were

2155
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:12,480
trying to get genome was 25 25 well remember we had already hit the 2222

2156
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,880
by the time we started the live stream then cuz that's right trying to get

2157
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:20,400
genome mm-hmm there was an animated we got him he's confirmed there's an animated

2158
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:28,360
OP there is there's a dojin to go along with the OVA we missed we missed the

2159
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:33,440
ultimate stretch goal of did you making a funny face on Twitter yeah by less than

2160
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:37,720
a thousand dollars which means I was thinking that blur out his face and

2161
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:43,000
every whenever did you make a funny face in the OVA we should censor it saying

2162
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,120
funny face you didn't pay for it so you can't have it yeah that's right he's not

2163
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,600
allowed to make funny faces how will we know if I'm making a funny face or not

2164
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,320
well you know when you see people hey rate these faces and then we'll blur out

2165
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:02,080
the funniest one it's always funny so we just can't show it at all it makes

2166
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,320
sense all right next voice mail we funded all kinds of great stuff it's gonna be

2167
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,680
correct and just FYI when you hear this literally when you hear the next one one

2168
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:14,520
day one week from now that is the start of radcon one week from when you are

2169
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,320
hearing this Jesus seven days from two days I should probably start working on

2170
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:24,380
my fucking yeah yeah yeah we all should I have to figure out what I'm gonna

2171
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,400
lecture about because I don't have enough time to do the research for the

2172
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:35,200
other ideas I had fair enough fair enough and let's do faces it would

2173
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:42,240
faces for a straight hour and I'm okay all right next voice mail this is from

2174
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:51,040
21 means I am immortal okay and go hey PCP let's give me my birthday today

2175
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:56,200
before you're listening to this so it's gonna be my 21 birthday and I just

2176
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:02,400
really want to get smashed so what should I do and how should I do it thanks

2177
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:07,920
what do you think we get smashed by drinking alcohol straight vodka shots

2178
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,520
it's the cheapest way to do it why spend your money go to your local game

2179
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:25,720
store sign up for the smash tournament get smashed oh god no just jump into a

2180
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:30,840
river just just end it all that's what I would do although do you think he meant

2181
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,320
maybe he said before you hear this I'm gonna turn 21 maybe like before like not

2182
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,480
even on the day that we're playing this but like some period beforehand maybe

2183
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:43,960
he's like already 21 that's why I was confused by the question beer before

2184
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,840
liquor never been sicker drink yeah yeah take shots first and then switch to

2185
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:54,000
beer that's what you do have sex okay let's move on that's my recommendation

2186
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:02,600
oblivion rent a car okay let's go on right well driving off a bridge that's

2187

2191
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,520
waiting around it's time for coordinated action the slow burn method isn't

2192
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,120
working to get the channels back and we all know YouTube only responds to bulk

2193
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,600
pressure if you can hear the sound of my voice you are compelled by justice to

2194
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,440
message YouTube on Twitter next Thursday if you are truly a blessed night like me

2195
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:42,440
you'll be doing it every six hours by the time they record the next podcast they

2196
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:46,040
should have the channel back safe and sound you know your mission get at it

2197
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:54,200
boys email email the YouTube support and in addition to the tweets because

2198
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:59,960
sure in my experiences mass email gets people's attention the most because it

2199
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:05,240
feels really serious and scary the mass tweets they hit the whoever like that

2200
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:09,480
PR HR person is who's managing that Twitter we've been helped on Twitter it

2201
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:14,000
just hasn't helped so it's like we gotta we gotta be we gotta they said on

2202
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,320
Twitter they said like we're ready to restore the channel like you just need

2203
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:24,200
to do this and then Nate you went and you did the things to it's almost like

2204
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:29,480
every time we raise a stink they try to get us to stop by telling us that they're

2205
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:33,200
doing something about it and then they don't do anything about it here go we

2206
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:38,000
need to just consistently be reason raising a stink I guess yeah live update

2207
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,520
okay this was like this morning and I need to reply to it I think we got one

2208
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,280
more update let me see what we also we weirdly got like access to the can

2209
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:50,640
tent like email address back but not the channel or something right okay didn't

2210
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:54,000
you not lose the email address and like didn't they just go into the email and

2211
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,400
transfer the channel to another yeah that's not exactly correct as did you

2212
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,920
said like they said something about how they've detected like spam like videos

2213
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:06,000
are being posted or like they know it's not us and they can see it was hacked and

2214
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,080
they said like they were gonna give back the Google account okay so like things

2215
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,800
are wrong we have the Google account there is so much confusion by dealing

2216
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,920
with it they obviously do not know the specific issue if you log into the can

2217
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:26,080
tent Google account there are two like listings of it like as though there were

2218
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:30,400
you know both the channel and the non-channel version of the email anybody

2219
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,600
who has a YouTube account probably knows what I'm talking about but or YouTube

2220
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,040
channel but the the thing is they both say no videos neither one is the can

2221
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:43,960
tent channel so you can sign into two different versions of can tent and not

2222
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:48,760
have access to the channel and I'm like well what how do I get into the channel

2223
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:52,880
like who has that there's that second channel is here's the way they restore

2224
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,160
it they ask you to make a new brand account which is different from like a

2225
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,320
user account it's you know it's like right it won't ask for like first and

2226
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,760
last name this is just the account name of like can't enter whatever and then

2227
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:08,440
like once you make a new brand account on whatever Google account you say they

2228
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:12,920
and then you give them that link they will like port the channel to that brand

2229
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:17,120
account that you have created they'll like stick everything on I'm waiting for

2230
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:20,640
it that will become I gave them all the information I don't know what the fuck

2231
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:24,320
they're waiting for by the way just just here's a little update I'm gonna

2232
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,040
respond to this after we're done here but it said like so the team responded

2233
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:33,800
they have confirmed that the PCP was hijacked on January 23rd okay do you

2234
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:38,160
hear that they have confirmed their hijacked after this happened they start

2235
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:42,840
remember how they were streaming today on the fucking PCB channel after the team

2236
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:47,640
confirmed they were fucking hacked what the why haven't you stopped them from

2237
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,920
doing shit if you know it was hacked I think they might be hacks over at the

2238
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,680
YouTube support I don't understand okay anyway I'm gonna touch base with those

2239
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:01,800
people but hey I don't see any reason not to spam them with emails what's the

2240
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:09,000
probably do a lot of good honestly be respectful people and I would encourage

2241
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
you to list all the channels I think Nate you have all the channels listed in

2242
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:19,080
your Twitter bio right I do I do you know can't attend a podium cast tea bath

2243
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:24,200
and so on there's like seven of them or something that we have you know it seems

2244
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,600
to me like we're close to getting the PCP back but I said that first like a week

2245
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:35,200
ago so you know slightly won't give them back until we harass them into doing it

2246
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:39,280
and they get sick of it and they won't give us they'll just give us back one

2247
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,120
channel at a time we're just gonna have to keep harassing them until we get every

2248
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:47,400
chance like we're gonna have to do the same thing for every single one so let's

2249
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:53,200
probably just commit to doing that works for me so as Tarbuck said

2250
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:59,360
Thursday I retweet on the TP Crasinators channel I retweet everyone that posts

2251
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:06,240
hashtag save the PCP with you and that adds team YouTube I would encourage and

2252
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,000
like I would encourage everyone to tweet hashtag save the PCP with all like list

2253
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,400

scrum deli umptress I have to say but you know much to my chagrin when I went

2264
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:11,800
to the Washington Monument I did not see a speck of Brad or garlic in sight no

2265
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:18,240
but you know it's hard to stay mad when you're drawing a nice a juicy a sweet

2266
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:28,880
a grapefruit with loaves of bread loaves with L O A F S Nate look I know

2269
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:46,200
windows and snatching your grapefruits up but I'm gonna leave on a bit of a

2270
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:55,280
positive note here's a picture that you may find a little appealing monster he's

2271
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,240
pouring sweet and directly on to the grapefruit voice jail voice jail voice

2272
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:04,080
straight to voice jail what was this guy's name for okay whatever we'll look

2273
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:10,320
it up on on fucking DVR it's quandary poser so like a splatter on the ground

2274
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:14,280
it's absolutely horrendous he's gonna you know as a matter of fact that off the

2275
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:19,000
black the asphalt you know but before this I couldn't get into the DVR like I

2276
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,400
saw this linked on the thing and like I tried to click on it it was literally

2277
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:28,080
locked because it was said like contains adult content this image so I had to

2278
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,040
log in to fucking like the t-bap DVR for back of the day cuz it's the only one I

2279
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:36,320
knew how to get into and yeah anyway quandary poser you are a fucking monster

2280
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:41,120
for a number of reasons by the way I just realized not only did we forget to

2281
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:45,440
talk about our extreme success with our thing but we also forgot to talk about

2282
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:57,160
the fight this episode is on reserve it's on reserve what is that on hold

2283
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:07,960

2285
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:18,280
solid minute of what's our position then on what this episode is canonically this

2286
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:23,960
is 201 obviously okay so we're not coming out let you live from the future this

2288
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:37,720
last message one last fucking voicemail okay here's the thing this one is very

2289
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:43,400
long and we can cut it off anytime but what it is is that one dune coon made a

2290
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:50,720
a PCP something like a radcon fanfiction and they converted it to audio and we

2291
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:54,240
have it here it's like four minutes long anytime we can cut it off anytime but

2292
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,800
let's just listen to a snippet of it and if we like it we can listen the whole

2293
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,440
thing but we'll we'll see how it goes okay here we go and take it away dune

2294
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:06,360
coon impress me go you're listening to an abridged version of radcon the

2295
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:12,440
untold story by dune coon duji bro was sitting in front of his work computer

2296
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:16,920
desperately trying to thrust his uncircumcised seven-inch penis in between

2297
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:21,360
the thighs of his shinobu oshino anime figurine when the knock came out his

2298
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:25,320
door he'd almost managed it when a second knock rang out breaking his deep

2299
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:30,280
concentration what the who the fuck is here did he asked shinobu he rose from

2300
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:33,840
his cum stained office chair and hobbled towards the front door peeping

2301
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,840
through the peephole and readying his 3d printed gun which was a dick show

2302
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:45,440
preaching on reward and opened up what's up nigga Nate greeted

2303
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:55,520
saying the n-word is funny it wasn't a lie he had spent the morning trying to

2304
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,200
figure out how to fit more of his fetishes into the story maybe I can make

2305
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,400
shinobu like some fairy things like yui from sorda online then I could fucking

2306
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:06,720
even smaller version of her I mean talk whom I could fucking even smaller

2307
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:10,120
version of her yeah that's what I meant with that out of the way and all

2308
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:14,400
pleasant not into many girls with no obvious direction to steal the

2309
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:19,040
conversation they stood in silence eyeing each other up did you bros overwhelming

2310
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:22,960
fatness was rapidly escaping from his clothing his oily hair clung to his

2311
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,240
equally oily skin like he was rubbed down by a Japanese prostitute but even

2312
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:31,120
with his physical abnormalities there was something about digi that Nate just

2313
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:35,640
found irresistible it wasn't his uncircumcised 7-inch penis it was his

2314
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:39,640
uncircumcised 7-inch brain

2315
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:46,080
it was nothing more than a professional appreciation Nate had insisted

2316
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:56,360
nothing more I'm gay digi was one of Digi's personal names I try not to hold it

2317
01:49:56,360 --> 01:50:01,760
against you Nate replied but it was for naught Digi had become painfully

2318
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,960
aware that he was not currently ingesting drugs and sought to remedy

2319
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:08,760
this as soon as possible without another word did he marched back to his

2320
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,920
work desk he started up his water-cooled desktop tower which also

2321
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,800
functioned as a bong he took a long hit and invited Nate to come sit next to

2322
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:20,120
him you want some of this did he asked politely Nate was hesitant to partake

2323
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:24,120
in Digi Bo's debauchery but the long and uncomfortable flight had left his body

2324
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:27,000
and mind withered it felt like he had just gotten hit by the wither in

2325
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,480
Minecraft and it was now a scene from being withered like in the video game

2326
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:35,400
Minecraft followed Digi's example and did the weed it took effect immediately

2327
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,840
Nate was no stranger to weed but he should have known that Digi Bo's personal

2328
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:42,240
tolerance would have been multiple times higher than his own pretty strong right

2329
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:46,280
I brought it off the deep web did you explain and by that I mean I bought it

2330
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:52,920
from a black guy never having actually met a black person Nate was having

2331
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,480
trouble focusing on the computer screen it was consistently blocked by Digi

2332
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:00,280
exhaling fat clouds of smoke and after a few more lips for himself Nate's

2333
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,120
throat had become dry I'm gonna go grab a drink Nate announced rising from his

2334
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:08,120
seat do you have any off-brand LaCroix did you bro never got the opportunity to

2335
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:11,880
answer because once Nate stopped using his chairs of support he fell face

2336
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:16,000
forward right into his friend and in their intoxicated states neither of them

2337
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,680
were able to grasp what had exactly happened if they were sober both of them

2338
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:23,680
would have noticed Nate's hand grasping Digi Bo's uncircumcised seven inch

2339
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:27,560
penis there's Dr. Pepper pajama pants immediately as things were took me at a

2340
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:31,360
good 30 seconds and even after that his brain failed to process the next

2341
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,800
reasonable course of action Digi bro who tried to have his uncircumcised

2342
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,800
seven inch penis touched at all times made no attempts to push Nate off it was

2343
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:44,400
like that one scene in Evangelion except dumb and gay you're a big guy noted for

2352
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:27,680
he did I'm thinking voice grail voice grail for doing Coon what do you think

2353
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:34,120
maybe if the story continues and to be entertaining then I mean to be fair he did

01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:40,320
there's a complete something about Isis shows up I mean it's voice grail it's

2355
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:44,400
voice grail not thick grail the voicemail was good what was presented

2356
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:50,920
Isis already shows up in my story in the road to Radcon 4 well maybe that's why

2357
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:54,760
maybe it's continuity hey you know I'm for it I say voice grail

2358
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:59,200

Twitter reminding me who I've forgotten that be appreciate keep is been keeping

2368
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:47,800
track of yeah there's a word document I thought we just say it like randomly

2369
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:52,360
because what like wherever the moment takes us I knew there was a word doc

2370
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,280
but is it publicly visible anywhere I think it's in the description of every
