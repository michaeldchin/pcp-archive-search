00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
And without further ado, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:24,320
It's Ben Saint, and we got Gibbontake, and we got Tom Oliver is back from the grave.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
Rise from your grave.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Rise from your grave.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,400
Classic altered beast for the Sega Genesis, the best console of the 90s.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:42,240
Shut the fuck up. It's the SNES, you motherfuckers. It's the Super Famicom.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,440
Sorry, there are like 32 bits, colors, 16 billion dollars.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,200
There are these magazine advertisements that told me that Sega does one in 10 down,

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
and I believe my my superiors when they market to me.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,840
That's not that's not true.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,240
No, gaming, the best game ever made was A Secret of Mana for the Super Nintendo,

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
and it was all downhill from there.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
They'll never change my mind.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
Why don't you review it then, huh?

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,280
Fuck you.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
Why don't you show me?

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,640
You are too, your old 3D graphics are too fucking modern for me.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,640
They are they are Zoomer shit. The shit you like is dumb, and it's too high tech.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,160
Got reject modernity 3D graphics, embrace tradition, Secret of Mana.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,120
It's like no, reject modernity, and it's like PlayStation Banjo-Kazooie or Crash Bandicoot.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,760
It's like reject modernity, embrace tradition, yeah.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
Like only five years apart from each other.

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,320
It's all takes.

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
Where you been, Tom? What you been up to?

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,320
I've just been dying entirely and playing too many video games.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,920
I beat all of Ghost of Tsushima. Man, that was a fun game. That was pretty cool.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, yeah. Talk about that because that I saw that in the game awards when they because,

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
you know, because I'm stupid and I watched that.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,160
And I saw some of the cutscenes. I was like, hey, that looks not bad.

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
I wonder what that is.

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,240
It's the newest game by Sucker Punch, which I'm sure you're aware of.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
They did the Sly Cooper series, and then they did Infamous for the PS3 and PS4.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
And this is the game they've been working on for the last like five or six years or whatever.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,880
It's like it's like an open world samurai game, and it's really fun.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
And I enjoyed it a lot.

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
It got passed. It like sinks into a lot of like the open world kind of bullshit,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,520
where it's just like go to this camp and kill people and like do that a bunch of times.

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,880
But like the side quests are pretty good because like instead of having a bunch of

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,640
random side quests, you meet like four supporting characters and they have like a long quest

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
that's like 10 parts each as you go through the campaign.

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
There's like these mini campaigns with these characters going along on side of it.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,000
So they feel a little bit more substantive than just like go here, do a quick thing and like

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,560
tick the box off your map. And it was cool. The combat was fun.

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
You have like different stances to fight different kind of weapons and the skill tree is cool.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,360
And you're a samurai, so you can like challenge people to showdowns and kill them in one hit

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
if you find everything right.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,120
Yeah, yeah. I was thinking, I was thinking about him the entire time.

48
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,720
We now know the samurai's name is Jin Sakai. That's who's been calling us this whole time.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,000
I figured it out.

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Is it like like Japanese the Witcher?

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,360
Pretty much. If the Witcher was like had way better combat, it was more fun to play moment

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,960
to moment because like you can choose to be a samurai guy or you can be like a dishonorable

53
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,400
ninja guy and reject your samurai code and murderously backstab people and poison people

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
and just do whatever dirty tactics you have to to like kill the Mongol invaders and it's

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,600
really fucking cool.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,560
That's what happens when you embrace modernity.

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,040
How true to life is it? Because samurai were like

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
it's true to my life.

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
It's true to my lived experience, 100%.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,520
Like they samurai like if I, as far as I understand, they like had bows and they would

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,400
ride on horses and they would shoot from afar and only bring the sword out when it was like close.

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,480
You can ride a horse and shoot bows.

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,080
In fact, I mainly used bows because it was so much more fun to just snipe people from afar

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,960
and then clean up what was left after you've exhausted your arrows and stuff. That was pretty cool.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
And there's like armor sets that give you bonuses to like using bows and stuff because

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,480
there's like you go around, you find these like storytellers.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,720
These like musician guys who are like telling like fables of like ancient artifacts of like

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,040
legendary warriors from Tsushima's past.

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
You can like track down those locations and get like mythic level armor of like these like

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
legendary heroes from hundreds of years ago.

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
And that's pretty fucking cool.

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Sounds just like my favorite.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,200
No, the best video.

74
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,200
The best thing is like this game is like super colorful, but like because it's a love letter

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,040
to Kurosawa movies, there's that a Kurosawa mode that turns it like grainy black and white

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,080
like a movie.

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
And that's Kurosawa.

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
Yes, that's pretty cool.

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Yeah, it's pretty pretty dope.

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
It's pretty based.

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
I liked it a lot.

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,200
If it's inspired by that, then it's got a better or worse.

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,080
Is it better or worse than Cyberpunk 2077?

84
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,800
Well, I haven't played Cyberpunk, but I'm going to assume probably better than it is in its current state.

85
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,800
Even though I secured a 3060 Ti, so I do have a good enough graphics card to play it.

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
I just haven't yet.

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,200
The only thing I know about Cyberpunk, aside from glitches, is that one like funny video

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,920
where somebody like made it so there's the guy on the train and he's like,

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,840
oh, something, something, Cyberpunk.

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,480
And then it reveals and like the title comes up as like shitty PS1, like low resolution background

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,160
and it stutters and then it crashes.

92
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,360
You know that?

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,320
The no man.

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,120
You talk about the no man skype redo thing that they did where like because like they

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,760
initially did this with no man sky, but then they like redid it on Twitter for like Cyberpunk

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,000
because like the reveal from like the E3 trailer to the actual game is like totally different.

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,040
It's pretty.

98
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,520
Yeah.

99
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,000
It's pretty.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
It's pretty good.

101
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,520
The music seems cool.

102
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,760
That's like the best part of the game so far from what little I understand is that the soundtrack is

103
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
pretty, pretty dope.

104
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,120
Best part of the game is not the video game part.

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,360
Yeah.

106
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,720
It's weird.

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Like what bothers me the most?

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,760
Wait, are you talking about Tsushima or Cyberpunk?

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,480
Cyberpunk.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,760
The soundtrack in Tsushima was serviceable, but not like outstanding.

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,240
I didn't.

112
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
There's no like particular track.

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,320
I remember.

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,440
It's funny because like the advertising campaign for like Cyberpunk has been like counter

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,640
use like what defines a criminal in Night City getting caught.

116
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
I'm like that's that's just the real world.

117
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,360
Like you can do whatever crimes you want as long as you don't get caught.

118
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,000
That's true.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,760
You're not charged with the crime unless you're caught.

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,120
Like this is a dumb campaign.

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Great commentary.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah.

123
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
Great commentary there.

124
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm just like Ben Strupp lifted multiple times.

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,480
He's not a criminal yet.

126
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,720
Have I have I admitted that?

127
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
Have I admitted that on the podcast?

128
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Yes, you have.

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,080
Did you just out me?

130
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,480
Okay.

131
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,200
No, you had.

132
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,040
Remember you talked about it like last year and had like a mini crisis like,

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,600
should we cut this?

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,320
Should we cut this?

135
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
And then you're like, fuck it.

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
No, no, no.

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
I think you're conflating two times.

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,320
I think there was one time when I did talk about it and then afterwards I was like,

139
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,040
no, no, cut that.

140
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,680
We got to cut that.

141
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,400
We got to cut that.

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
And then I think later on we talked about it again and I said like,

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
last time I said cut it, but this time I don't care anymore.

144
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,920
Maybe.

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,880
I thought the first time was like really early on in the PCP.

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920
It was pretty early.

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
It was a long time ago.

148
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
Things have changed.

149
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
Things have changed.

150
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
Ben's been radicalized.

151
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,800
Radicalized hardcore.

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Now shoplifting is a badge of honor.

153
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
Nothing to be ashamed of.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,920
I was shoplifting before it was cool.

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:08:04,000
Speaking of music and video games, why is Pokemon Black and White 2 just the best game ever made?

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:15,120
I was listening to, I was looking for some good video game OSTs and I was looking on Reddit

157
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,320
because I like googled question like underrated video game soundtracks.

158
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
And I got a bunch of like Reddit threads that were the results and I like was just going through

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,320
a bunch of the results and Black and White 2 has just has the best music in any video game ever made.

160
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,080
And also the best graphics and just is the best game period.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,640
Hands down.

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,920
Not Pokemon Peak there and so did gaming in general.

163
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,280
I know I said it was Secret of Mana, but that was Red Hair.

164
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,240
That was a secret.

165
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,760
That was a trick.

166
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
That was a trick.

167
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
God, it's so fucking good.

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
Man, the way this is gonna gush for a second.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
Just the way the way that when you get to that the music changes when you're fighting a gym

170
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
leader and they get down to their last Pokemon, it's just from like a tense battle theme to

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,520
like a like triumphant theme.

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,120
It's so fucking good, man.

173
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Black and White 2, the ones where they replace the like annoying beep when you're

174
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Pokemon's low on HP to like the stressful music, but like it might work.

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,960
That sounds like probably I don't know.

176
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,800
That was fucking sick and I like that sounds like something they would do.

177
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,040
Yeah.

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh, and I had the best.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
It had the best sprites.

180
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
It had the best animations.

181
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,960
It was right before they decided, you know what?

182
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,680
Fuck everything.

183
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,960
Let's just go 3D now.

184
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
And that was the downfall.

185
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,720
That was the downfall, the switch to 3D, the switch that everyone says.

186
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
Oh, you Mario, this is a switch to 3D.

187
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Oh, it was a big challenge for the video game industry.

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Well, guess what?

189
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
They didn't survive it.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Video games didn't even survive the transition to 3D.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Video games are a dead medium now.

192
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:53,840
That's true.

193
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,760
There are no real video games anymore.

194
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,360
They're dead.

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,240
They died.

196
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,920
They died in 1996 or whatever when the Nintendo 64 came out.

197
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
3D did make games mainstream, which did ruin them.

198
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
So that's right.

199
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,280
Thank you.

200
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,600
Yes.

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
We have to go back.

202
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
We have to reject modernity.

203
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Many people are saying this.

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,400
Man, I can't wait to get a PS5, guys.

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,440
It's going to be so good.

206
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,600
No.

207
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
What even video games are on the PS5?

208
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
Literally, it's just another...

209
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
It's Demon's Souls machine again.

210
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Why?

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,600
Just like the PS4 was just a blood-borne rig.

212
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,040
This is a Demon's Souls rig.

213
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,680
It's the only game.

214
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,240
Why?

215
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
The best thing about PS5 is that you can play all your PS4 games at 60 frames.

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
I already played those video games.

217
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,840
I want to play Ghost of Tsushima again at 60 frames per second and no loading.

218
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
I want to fucking kill myself.

219
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,120
I can't wait to have something that I can plug in and is a big piece of plastic and metal.

220
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,160
Yeah.

221
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,280
I can't wait to consume this content.

222
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,520
And consume...

223
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,160
I've resisted buying a Nintendo Switch for this long.

224
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,440
How could I possibly purchase something so shit as something as a PS5?

225
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm not going to get a PS5 until the slim version comes out,

226
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
because this current one is some ugly monstrosity that I detest.

227
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,320
It looks like...

228
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,880
I think it's kind of cool looking, even if it is the best thing.

229
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
It is a bit strange.

230
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,400
It reminds me of when you get two Pringles and you put them together so they curve outwards.

231
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,440
The best thing people have done with a PS5 is someone 3D printed a head of Setokaiba

232
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
and put it on there because it looks like Setokaiba's coat from the second arc.

233
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,280
That was the best thing.

234
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,800
Seen something like that.

235
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,080
That almost justifies how ugly it is, but not really.

236
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
Looks like a weird clam thing.

237
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,040
No, really, though.

238
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,400
What fucking video games can you play on the PS5?

239
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,840
Are there any?

240
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,120
Literally the only games that anyone should care about right now is the Demon's Souls remake

241
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,760
and Spider-Man, Miles Morales, which is also on PS4 because I bought and beat it on PS4.

242
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,760
What the fuck is the point of the five?

243
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
You get no loading times.

244
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,160
It's got that SSD.

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
It's just stupid.

246
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,400
It's tradition.

247
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
This is the embraced tradition mindset.

248
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,520
If you embrace the tradition of creating new consoles, then you get this.

249
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,920
No, this is the modernity.

250
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,000
I thought tradition was what we want to go back to.

251
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,920
That's the thing.

252
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
Sometimes tradition is bad.

253
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,720
Oh, god.

254
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,280
Are you saying that there's new wants to things in the world?

255
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes, there's no.

256
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
Wait, are you saying that the PS5 is modernity or tradition?

257
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,000
It's tradition because there's always been a new console cycle to iterate.

258
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,560
Tradition, the tradition is to just endlessly iterate and follow the cycle.

259
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,520
Everyone says that the coolest thing about the PS5 is the new controller because the trigger buttons

260
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,560
have sensitivity, so you can program different guns and stuff to feel different.

261
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,720
You can have really effective haptics.

262
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
There's a game that ships with it called Astros Playground or whatever, whatever the fuck it's

263
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,800
called.

264
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
And depending on whether you're walking on sand or metal, the vibration is different,

265
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,360
so it has a really expanded sense of tactility to everything you're doing.

266
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,960
And everyone's like, this is the coolest thing.

267
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,520
This is the best.

268
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,160
Fuck graphics.

269
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
This is the coolest shit ever.

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,240
Oh, Astro's Playroom?

271
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah, that one.

272
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,480
I think I saw an article somewhere or a tweet or something that said that

273
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,520
the best thing on the PS5 is this free demo.

274
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah, that's the one they're talking about.

275
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, but it's the only launch game that actually makes use of all the weird functionality.

276
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,080
No one else is going to do it except for Sony themselves to convince you you didn't just

277
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,440
waste $500 because you could only play Demon's Souls.

278
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:51,520
This little guy Astro reminds me of, did you guys try out the Oculus Rift at the Radcon 4?

279
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,240
Yeah, we all brought it.

280
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,880
Play Beat Saber.

281
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah, did you remember the demo when you booted up with the little robot?

282
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
I didn't play the demo part.

283
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,360
Did you see one of us playing it?

284
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
There's a little intro sequence where you put on the helmet and then you're in this room,

285
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,000
this kind of junky room, and this little robot wakes up and comes over and says hello to you

286
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,800
and gives you a bunch of items to fuck around with and disks to load into slots to load data.

287
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,320
Interesting.

288
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,040
I don't know.

289
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,760
It's very cute, and this guy looks like that.

290
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,360
If you want to spend multiple hundreds of dollars on a new video game thing, buy a VR set.

291
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
There's so many games out there that are good for that.

292
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Haptic feedback, I think, is pretty good.

293
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,280
That's a pretty nice feature to build into a game that's also very unintrusive,

294
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
unlike motion controls.

295
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,880
The more I start playing video games and thinking about them more critically

296
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,880
because I'm making games now, I'm just like, haptic feedback is so important to making combat

297
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,600
feel good.

298
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
Every time I play on mouse and keyboard and there's no haptics, I'm like, this sucks.

299
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,360
I don't, I mean, what kind of games are you talking about?

300
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,400
What?

301
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,240
Do you just mean any game?

302
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
Like first person shooters?

303
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,960
Like any game on PC, because you're playing with mouse and keyboard on a PC,

304
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,200
there's no rumble built into your mouse and keyboard.

305
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,680
So like you can shoot something and there's no like forced feedback and it sucks.

306
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,920
It's a weird thing to say to me because like video games, video games thrived

307
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,240
before haptic feedback was invented.

308
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,480
Sure.

309
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
But it's just so much better when you have it.

310
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,880
That's my only point.

311
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,000
Really?

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,560
Yeah.

313
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,800
I mean, I feel like when you're playing like a visceral action game or a shooter or something

314
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,840
and you get like a kickback from like, I don't necessarily think that it is kind of game,

315
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,080
I guess.

316
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,840
It sells sensation way more.

317
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,200
Are you saying that like now that you have it, you can't go back to not having it,

318
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,240
it doesn't feel the same?

319
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,760
No, it's just categorically better to have it than to not.

320
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,920
It doesn't ruin the experience, but it doesn't detract anything from the experience by having it.

321
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
I guess it doesn't detract anything.

322
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,120
I just think you could get basically exactly the same level of like interest through visual cues

323
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440
and like animation and stuff.

324
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,520
Like I'm thinking of like Paper Mario, how it feels or like Super Mario RPG,

325
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,520
how it feels like really good to time the button presses to whack an enemy.

326
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,320
And it's like the sound effects and the animation and stuff.

327
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
Like you could have all of that and then controller rumble.

328
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,720
And it would be like you could have you could have everything that makes that satisfying plus.

329
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,840
I don't know that it would be necessarily even.

330
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,320
I don't know.

331
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,200
I don't really care.

332
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,800
It doesn't bother me that playing TF2 feels just as satisfying with a mouse and keyboard

333
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,760
as playing a different game that has the the rumble stuff.

334
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,680
I like rumble putting it in all my games going forward.

335
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,760
I've decided.

336
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,360
I gave it some thought and it's good.

337
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Can you do that?

338
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,280
Yeah.

339
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,120
You can just like use code like stuff in for rumble and shit like that.

340
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
You just got to like make it work.

341
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,280
That's so that's so weird.

342
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
How do you think?

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,800
How do you think equals?

344
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,000
How do you think Sony does it?

345
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
I I don't I don't fucking know.

346
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,040
They have magic controller proprietary device.

347
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,800
The bushlaw controller rumble.

348
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:17,840
I don't know.

349
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,880
They own the means.

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,440
They own the means of haptic Xbox controllers to it.

351
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,640
It's just controllers.

352
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,840
They all do well.

353
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,320
Okay.

354
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,640
Yeah.

355
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,040
I guess I'm just saying it's it's I guess I can understand that there's no reason why an indie dev can't.

356
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,440
Well, it's it's it's just like a make use of a of a first party controllers haptic functionality.

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
They have in like things like Unity.

358
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,120
Like you can you can say set up a control scheme for an Xbox controller or or you know

359
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,720
so and that like would automatically map to a PlayStation controller.

360
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,640
I hope they'll maybe they'll maybe for mouse and keyboard nerds like me.

361
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
They'll make they'll they'll make a mouse a mouse with haptic.

362
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
There has someone has to have done it.

363
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,840
There has to be like a haptic mouse that exists.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,080
Probably now that I know that I say it doesn't actually sound that weird.

365
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,680
I could imagine it being like if you did it badly.

366
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,960
Like if you're you need precision clicking and then like the rumble makes you move over like

367
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
you would probably need to use them like a special mouse pad or something.

368
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,600
Because if you just use it on your fucking table, it's like I'll rattle your table and it vibrates.

369
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
It's a feature not a bug in war when you're shooting.

370
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,960
You'd be really nervous and you wouldn't be able to keep your your aim steady.

371
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,280
So we're just replicating that with force feedback.

372
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,280
Yeah, they should they should like like tape guns to your computer

373
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
so that when you get shot in the game, it shoots you for real.

374
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,680
That's the ultimate haptic feedback.

375
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,440
Well, isn't there a story of someone who like put an IV in them and like it like drained their blood

376
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
when they took damage in like the game.

377
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,800
What the fuck?

378
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,680
That's not I remember reading that story years ago.

379
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,040
What do they think would happen?

380
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,800
Bad things.

381
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,440
They died.

382
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Did they die?

383
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,680
Or like what's the I don't remember.

384
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,640
The end of the story.

385
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,440
I could very well have made this up, but I'm almost certain I read this at one point.

386
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,080
It does sound kind of like a nightmare fever dream.

387
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
That sounds like a sort of like cryptid thing.

388
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't want to I want to think about it.

389
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
Yeah, it sounds like a pretty gamer moment, you know.

390
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Oh, yeah.

391
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Oh, very, very gamer moment.

392
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,440
I was playing Sonic the Hedgehog and something seemed off.

393
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
There was an IV feed stabbed into my arm.

394
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,440
I didn't think much of it at the time, but I just kept playing.

395
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,920
Every time I lose rings, I just like pull the needle out.

396
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,040
My blood spray is everywhere to simulate the sensation.

397
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,800
I got to run around and collect all of them.

398
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,520
But if I have at least one blood, it's OK.

399
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
No blood, please.

400
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,320
Keep keep the blood out of video games,

401
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,080
by which I mean drain it entirely out of my body when I play them.

402
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
Thank you and good night.

403
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,920
You know, video games is a good interesting, not interesting.

404
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
It's not an interesting topic, but it's definitely not interesting.

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,120
It's a good topic because I have recently just been

406
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,360
I think I've talked before about the list of video games

407
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,760
that I've made of all the video games on all the platforms that I own

408
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,000
and the ones I've played, the ones I've like beaten to completion.

409
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,360
And I've been going through it because I've got like the release dates.

410
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,920
And I'm like saying like which of the games I've played

411
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,720
from like 2003 is the best game of that year.

412
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,120
And I was thinking of doing like a big funny stupid list.

413
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,120
Do it.

414
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,080
I've got like 2003.

415
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
Here's a list of the games I played.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Aladdin's Maths Quest, The Sims,

417
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,280
Ape Escape 2, Rayman 3, Metroid Prime,

418
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,960
Donkey Kong, Country, Game Boy Advance, Pokemon Sapphire.

419
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
You know, there's all these Wallace and Gromit in Project Zoo.

420
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,520
Whoa.

421
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,160
Simpsons Hit and Run, Broken Sword, Lord of the Rings Return of the King, Puzzle Pirates.

422
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,480
I just thought like I love lists, guys.

423
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,680
I like putting lists and games and putting them in order.

424
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,760
It's very...

425
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
I'm playing with blocks here.

426
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,760
There's like a weird like human desire to like bring order to chaos, you know.

427
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,480
Like when you when you do something that's structured, it feels good.

428
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,720
You're just like, yes, I've taken this malformed chaotic mess and presented it

429
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
in some sort of like structured way.

430
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,880
I've applied human intellect to the chaos that is natural life and it feels good.

431
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
It's just an illusion.

432
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
It's totally an illusion.

433
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,360
You're just fooling yourself.

434
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
Sure, but all the pixels on screen are also illusions, Ben.

435
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,960
No, no, those are the only thing that's real.

436
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
The entire state of society is an illusion, Ben.

437
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
We're all just masking the state of nature.

438
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,920
We're all playing an elaborate game to prevent us from just like killing each other with clubs.

439
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,920
It's like I'm collecting data and arranging it in a way.

440
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,680
And it's kind of a video game in itself.

441
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,840
And it's really like it like on the face of it.

442
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,320
It seems like why would you ever care about such a thing?

443
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,200
And it's true.

444
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,760
Why would I?

445
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,240
I don't know.

446
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, you know, if it makes you happy, it makes me more happy than playing any of them.

447
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
Metroid Prime is so good, though, bro.

448
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
Like I like I've got all these games and I'm like, yep, that's the list.

449
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,800
Look at that list.

450
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,120
Well, good time to go to bed.

451
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,880
Time to just sleep my days away.

452
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,160
Why would I boot anything up and be entertained?

453
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,360
It just doesn't make any sense.

454
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
I agree.

455
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,000
I unironically agree.

456
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
I hate the idea of being entertained.

457
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,760
When I look at when I look at Cyberpunk 2077, what I see is like,

458
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
I don't I don't understand.

459
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,320
I don't understand the appeal of something like that at all,

460
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,640
because it looks it just looks like I see this is a this is a contraption that has been

461
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,560
that has been constructed to distract me for like, you know, 60 or 100 hours.

462
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,360
Yeah, it's that.

463
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Hey, guys, the new day care just dropped.

464
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
That's kind of how I feel about it.

466
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
I don't want to be distracted.

467
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
I need my fucking wits about me.

468
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
That's like fucking danger.

469
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,280
I know.

470
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,040
Yes, I agree.

471
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,200
I know that that's a stupid thing to say.

472
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
And yet I say it on ironic.

473
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
Ben, Ben, you're an artist.

474
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,360
Your whole life is dedicated to.

475
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,480
I hate art, Tom.

476
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,680
I fucking hate art.

477
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,480
I hate art.

478
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,360
I don't believe in it.

479
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
It's a fucking ruse.

480
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,360
It's a scam.

481
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,320
I kind of agree.

482
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,600
I've been thinking a lot about like the fact that like I think back.

483
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
I've been grappling a lot thinking about just video games in general,

484
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,360
because I've been spending so much time with them for the last like two months

485
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
and how much time they take away from me.

486
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,080
And I'm like, yeah, do I want to make video games and subject other people to this time sink?

487
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,960
Like am I participating in like a negative thing?

488
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,760
But then it's like it's all it's not none of it's compulsory.

489
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
People choose to spend their lives this way.

490
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
And not everybody has the desire or the capacity to make things.

491
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,440
Some people just want to be entertained.

492
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,880
And I say, I say, I say all this like I'm above it all or whatever.

493
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,280
But of course, no, this is just things that I don't like.

494
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,360
And then you're in the trenches with everybody else.

495
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
And that's why you relate to it so strongly.

496
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,200
Because like you're personally affected by it.

497
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,760
It's just there's some other some other thing that is the thing that I choose to

498
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,200
be distracted by like Dwarf Fortress or whatever.

499
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
It's just some some different thing.

500
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,520
We all have our voices.

501
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,320
No better.

502
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,160
Right now my my thoughts are all about like completing art.

503
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,400
Like I've got all these games in my steam library that I've never even fucking opened.

504
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,000
And to me playing them is not like interesting because I I mean maybe something would be good.

505
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,960
But like the idea of completing the list is a more interesting and fun game

506
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
than like playing the games.

507
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
So I feel compelled to play them just so I can tick them off, which is really like

508
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,720
it's like Skinner Box like that I built for myself.

509
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,520
But I kind of like it.

510
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,920
You're gamifying your collection of games essentially.

511
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,160
Yeah.

512
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,840
It's like a metagame.

513
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:15,360
Like it's like at a like first glance it seems like I'm adding to like distraction in my life.

514
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,680
But really I'm just sort of this is the distraction.

515
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
Otherwise I would be playing one game or another game.

516
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,600
And this is the game I decided to make is a game about games and gaming.

517
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,120
And God I hate that word so much.

518
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,240
I heard it in my head.

519
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,760
Gaming.

520
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,400
Gaming.

521
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,040
Such a stupid word because it's been made into a joke.

522
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah.

523
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,440
It's made into a joke.

524
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
Just the saying it is funny apparently.

525
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,760
See.

526
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,880
Oh man.

527
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
Did I talk about did I talk about my dwarf fort?

528
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
Oh I not recently I guess.

529
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,680
Did I talk about the that I started the the succession game with my with my roommates.

530
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,800
And I don't have a little accident.

531
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,440
No everything was going everything was going so good.

532
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,760
Everything we did a succession game is when like one person plays an in-game year

533
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,200
and then they pass it off to the next person and you and you take turns playing a year.

534
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
Our fort is so much gold.

535
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
There's gold everywhere.

536
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,600
Like all all the walls have gold in them.

537
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
There's like gold nuggets like littering the floor because everywhere we did.

538
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
We just keep finding gold gold gold gold.

539
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,520
But we don't have any like talented metalsmiths.

540
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,080
So like my whole thing has been like trying to get a bunch of metalsmiths.

541
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,960
Practicing making copper stuff so they can become extremely good metalsmiths.

542
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
And then they can make like really expensive gold crafts and sell them right.

543
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,440
Because if we just if you make crappy gold stuff and so that'd be waste of money.

544
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,000
You want to make good stuff out of it to maximize your return.

545
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,480
All right.

546
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
So that's that's what I wanted to do.

547
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,600
All right.

548
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,880
So by the time it gets to my year you know I fuck around.

549
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,720
Like we get attacked by a monster a giant tick or whatever shows up.

550
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,760
Had a very funny very funny battle.

551
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,800
This this forgotten beast that's a giant tick shows up.

552
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,760
And he is coming through the caverns and there just happens to be one dwarf stucos out in the caves

553
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
hunting like a kangaroo or something.

554
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,440
And this tick this giant tick beast just runs up to him and stucos leaps on the tick and

555
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,040
starts biting its legs and latches on with his teeth.

556
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:37,200
And then the tick breathes a cloud of freezing dust to I don't know to do to harm stucos in

557
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,360
some way but in the cloud of dust it like trips and falls and hits its head on the cave wall

558
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,920
and just splatters its own head open into pulp on the wall and just bursts its own head

559
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
with its own weight I guess.

560
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,760
And it just dies and stucos fucking did it.

561
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,520
And that was fine.

562
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,160
No problems.

563
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
No casualties at all.

564
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,120
But then one were horse I think shows up.

565
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,160
And our can our fortress is on a canyon.

566
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,120
There's a river and it's a canyon.

567
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,440
And there was a bridge that goes over the canyon.

568
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,320
And that's like a main supply line for our fortress.

569
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,960
And this happened to become the full moon.

570
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
I guess it's just the wrong time.

571
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:28,560
And one were horse went crazy at the full moon on the bridge and our whole military rushed it

572
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,080
and they fought him on the bridge and he just like laid waste to one dwarf after another.

573
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,760
And everyone like rushed the bridge and they all fell off into the river and died.

574
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,120
Like 60 dwarves just like died in the river because one were horse like got angry.

575
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,160
Just pummeled them all with skull crushing hooves.

576
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
What is a were horse?

577
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,200
Is it a horse that turns into a dog?

578
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,840
That would be smaller.

579
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,200
No, no, it's a dwarf that turns into a horse at the full moon or a horse beast.

580
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,400
So it like it halved our population.

581
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,960
It went from like 120 dwarves to like 60.

582
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,960
You needed to get a cowboy dwarf to bucking bronco it like right at like a tain it.

583
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
We need something.

584
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,600
We need something.

585
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:20,080
All right, you know, things aren't things aren't looking good in in in fern relics.

586
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,120
That's our that's our our fort.

587
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,520
Okay, just wanted to update you on my dwarf situation.

588
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,760
Now you know, I was playing or trying out this cool game that had dwarves in it called deep rock

589
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,400
galactic.

590
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,440
I've been marathoning a lot of skill up on YouTube.

591
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,400
His videos on games are really fucking good.

592
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,440
And one of the games you recommended was this game called deep rock galactic.

593
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
It's like an indie multiplayer like four player game.

594
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,680
I've seen this it's it's some dwarves in space mining space rocks.

595
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,360
Yeah, it's like actually like pretty cool.

596
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,440
It's it's like all the stuff's procedurally generated and like you can destroy any part

597
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
of the map and create like your own custom tunnels and you're looking for like gold and other kind

598
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,840
of like precious resources while fighting off like swarms of aliens that come and attack you.

599
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,280
And there's like four different classes.

600
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
And it's pretty cool.

601
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,360
I only played a very little bit of it because there's no demo and I don't buy games without

602
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,840
trying them.

603
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,800
So I pirated it.

604
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,760
Sorry, indie devs.

605
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
I will buy it if I like it.

606
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,880
But I play a little bit of it and it runs pretty well.

607
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,760
It's pretty fun.

608
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,560
And there's a bunch of goofy drunk dwarves.

609
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,640
And yeah, if you if you like those multiplayer games, class based multiplayer stuff like PvE,

610
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,120
it seems like a great recommendation.

611
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,080
It's apparently like in the top 100 highest rated games on Steam of all time,

612
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,560
despite being like a very new game by a small team of guys.

613
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,280
So apparently it's pretty sick.

614
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,040
And it's kind of cool.

615
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,760
Looks kind of neat.

616
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,320
It's pretty fun.

617
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm looking at images.

618
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,720
All right, I'm amenable.

619
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,080
I'm amenable to what I'm seeing.

620
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,040
I'm just saying if you had those dwarves in your fort, you probably could have killed this fucking

621
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,240
warhorse with ease.

622
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,960
Don't stucos the if stucos, the bug hunter had been there.

623
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,240
If he had been the first on the scene, I'm sure everything would have been different.

624
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,760
But instead, just our stupid ass military who doesn't know what they're doing got their first.

625
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,360
And of course, the slaughter that ensued was legendary.

626
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,960
This is why we have to redirect 90 percent of our nation's budget to defense.

627
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,200
Otherwise, the war horses will come and kill us all.

628
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,800
That's right.

629
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,440
That's right.

630
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,280
If only I if I'd invest more.

631
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,560
Oh, the other thing about our fort is that we have no good medals.

632
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,880
We have no iron for making steel.

633
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,280
We don't even have any tin for making bronze.

634
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,840
All your weapons are gold.

635
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,040
They're fucking copper and whatever and whatever we've been able to trade for.

636
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,960
I've traded for some steel, but like it's there's not that much.

637
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,760
So, you know, it's it's our military is like they're where they're all got like

638
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
silver hammers are the best thing we can have.

639
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,040
Silver hammers and maces are pretty decent.

640
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,640
But other than that, it's like it's just not it's just not a lot of good shit.

641
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
It's very sad.

642
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,640
Tragic, even.

643
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:18,080
OK, I was going to talk about something else, but then I got distracted by my dwarves.

644
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,960
Too many dwarves.

645
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,680
And I and I yeah, so OK.

646
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,200
2016, the only games I bought in 2016 with Dark Souls 3, Pokémon Go and Pokémon Moon.

647
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,480
I guess I didn't buy Pokémon Go and buy Pokémon Go.

648
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah, I was.

649
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,800
Did you tell me if you get the new if you get the Pokémon Sword Shield?

650
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,840
I got Sword.

651
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,640
I was gifted it.

652
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,560
I would not have bought it of my own volition.

653
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,120
I had fun.

654
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,360
Yeah.

655
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,200
Yeah, I didn't get it.

656
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,240
It's more Pokémon.

657
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,280
It's like definitely not worth being the first console game.

658
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,960
Yeah, I feel like when it comes to like I need more Pokémon, there's plenty of

659
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,880
ones that from the past that I haven't played yet, such as Black and White.

660
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,640
I kind of want to play.

661
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Not not.

662
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,880
Yeah, Platinum.

663
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,960
Is that the one with Giratina?

664
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,440
I don't know if it's not the first 150 Pokémon.

665
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,320
Is that Gen 4?

666
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,680
Yeah, it's Jen.

667
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,200
I think Diamond and Diamond Pearl and Platinum Platinum is the third one of that.

668
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,440
I like I didn't I played Pearl and Pearl was like, OK, I didn't love it.

669
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,440
And then and then like I didn't I sort of skipped Gen 5.

670
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,040
But at the time anyway.

671
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,280
But like people say that Platinum is like much better than Pearl and Diamond.

672
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,120
So I think I don't know, maybe it would be worth going back to revisit.

673
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,160
I think so.

674
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,960
I think I've heard that it's just like all of the the little

675
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,680
annoying frustrating things or at least some of them were like addressed in the third.

676
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,640
Yeah.

677
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,880
Yeah, I played Platinum.

678
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,560
I played Pearl in college and I was like, this is fine.

679
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,720
Yeah, I was playing Pearl at the end of high school.

680
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,520
And I think that's the game that disillusioned me from Pokémon.

681
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,560
I'm just like, yeah, it's fine, whatever.

682
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,720
I'm too old for this apparently, but I wasn't too old.

683
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,760
The game was just not good.

684
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,040
I skipped Gen 3 and then I got Gen 4 as like a retro like a throwback thing.

685
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,400
It was like a nostalgia thing because like all my friends were getting it.

686
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,080
And then I think I did get Black when it was new.

687
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,720
But I didn't like finish it.

688
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,200
And then of course, much, much later.

689
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,440
Getting sword and it was based.

690
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,320
Was the first game I got when it came out since Pearl.

691
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,920
So there was a huge gap and just me not playing any Pokémon games.

692
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,520
So it felt kind of fresh because I'm like, oh, you can just like hit a button to throw

693
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
Pokéball without having to go into the menu.

694
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,400
How black?

695
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
How a revolutionary.

696
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,920
Black and White 2 really is the pinnacle of the series.

697
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,720
That seems to be the general consensus from what I understand.

698
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,920
Yeah, X and Y.

699
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,840
Everything I hear about them makes them sound bad.

700
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Yeah, I think I got one of those and I tried to play it.

701
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,000
And it was just sort of like, I don't know, it's kind of cute that you can roll a blade around.

702
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
And I don't like Pokémon, so I stopped playing.

703
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,440
Le Mans.

704
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,920
It was normal to like see everything in 3D for the first time since I've seen it.

705
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,120
Pokémon Moon was like quite good, I felt.

706
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
Yeah, that was alright.

707
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,080
Like just, I don't know, like Gen 3 was like my first one.

708
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,520
And Gen 4 immediately, it was like, I don't care.

709
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,880
It's 3D, I like the sprites, whereas the sprites gone.

710
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:40,320
Yeah, you didn't think that X and Y had like the charm of like the PS2?

711
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,920
I felt a lot of like the PS2 charm.

712
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,520
I didn't play X and Y.

713
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,960
X and Y had like on the surface is like, oh, cute low poly 3D stuff.

714
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,800
And it looked nice, but the locations were just so boring.

715
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,440
Yeah.

716
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,040
I just didn't care about anything that was going on.

717
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,040
It was weird playing X and Y, where like the game felt for the most part,

718
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,520
like the locations were still designed with like a tile set of like a sprite based game.

719
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
Like they didn't take any advantage of the dynamism 3D offered,

720
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,800
where Sun and Moon, like the worlds felt a lot more organic and like took advantage

721
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
of like polygon graphics, which I think made it feel a lot more immersive.

722
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,720
With X and Y, the fucking roller blades, you use, because it's the 3DS,

723
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,680
they have the joystick, the, you know, analog stick.

724
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,440
And so you could move in an analog way around the place,

725
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,160
but as soon as you took them off, your character just sort of

726
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,080
zoomed into the nearest square and then it was grid based again.

727
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,120
Yeah, I just didn't like that.

728
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,320
That was really dumb.

729
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,800
Now, I didn't play X and Y and they don't look that appealing to me,

730
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,440
but I will say one thing I do know that is good about them is that the X and Y,

731
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:01,040
the Kalos Champion, Diantha, has an absolute banger theme, like battle theme.

732
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
It's super good.

733
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,720
It's super fucking good.

734
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,320
I never got there, so I wouldn't know.

735
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,880
Excellent.

736
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
I'll take your word for it though.

737
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,960
I think I, well, I'm not, I won't bother trying to describe how the song sounds.

738
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,200
It goes.

739
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,920
It's got, no, it's, it's got a real nice mix of sort of like ethereal like bells

740
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,680
and like soft parts and chimes and piano.

741
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,880
And then it kind of like switches between that and like a kind of like electric guitar thing.

742
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
It's so cool.

743
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,320
It's very.

744
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
Do you like kind of miss Game Boys?

745
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,760
I kind of do.

746
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,400
No.

747
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,960
I kind of do.

748
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
Um, why?

749
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
Um, because like the Switch isn't a Game Boy.

750
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,080
It's like really expensive and like the games are designed to be like big games.

751
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,960
The Game Boy was pretty expensive when it first came out.

752
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,720
Compared to consoles though, it wasn't like the games were half the price.

753
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,800
The console was like a half to a third of the price.

754
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,640
The games were shorter and simpler.

755
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
It felt like there was like a platform for like these simple games.

756
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,440
You could just kind of like take with you anywhere.

757
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,240
Nowadays that that stuff is like indie games on Steam rather than handheld.

758
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,920
I'm not going to like fucking bring my desktop around with me to just like

759
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
dig around and play a simple game when I have like a couple minutes.

760
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,920
Or mobile games, I guess.

761
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,480
And mobile is like way too monetized and like the free to play model.

762
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,840
Like, I don't know, there was like a weird niche that the Game Boy had

763
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,080
that I didn't realize I liked until it was gone because I took it for granted and it kind of stinks.

764
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:43,600
Yeah, I will say if you can get like GBA emulation on your mobile phone, it is very fun.

765
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,480
I played all of Fire Emblem 7, the first English translated one,

766
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,960
a few months ago on my phone.

767
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,240
It was just like, it's about the same size as the Game Boy Advance SP.

768
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,240
It's just felt like I was playing it all over again.

769
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,720
It was great.

770
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,800
Yeah, Fire Emblem, the first Fire Emblem on GBA.

771
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Like you're tucked up in bed, everybody has their phone in bed because they look at

772
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,120
fucking YouTube videos and tweets like idiots like me.

773
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,320
Not me.

774
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,400
And so it was such a natural like, oh, instead of looking at Twitter or looking at YouTube videos

775
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,800
that I've seen already, I'll play a video game that I played already and that's much better.

776
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,040
I don't know, is Fire Emblem good?

777
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,160
Yeah, it's fun.

778
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,240
Yeah, Fire Emblem 7 is like classic, classic, classic good game.

779
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,480
The sequel, The Sacred Stones was very good as well.

780
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,360
And then in three, and they sort of, with the advent of three-dimensional polygonal

781
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:58,240
graphical shit, it sucked and it looked bad because the sprites were so...

782
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,680
Agreed, reject modernity.

783
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,560
The sprites were just so beautiful and so well animated and then they came onto the GameCube

784
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
with one and they had no flair at all.

785
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,640
They were just like stick figures going up and swinging a sword in a very normal way.

786
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,280
It sucked.

787
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,400
It's true, the catharsis of those animations in Fire Emblem were like really good.

788
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,080
I will never ever forgive Sakurai for putting all of the Fire Emblem characters in Smash,

789
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,600
except the only good games were Snubbed, the only ones.

790
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,360
Why is Linda?

791
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,920
7 and 8.

792
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:38,400
I guess it's tired and I probably don't need to say that there's too many Fire Emblems in

793
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,480
Smash and they all look the fucking same and I hate them.

794
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah, I hate them as well.

795
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,360
They're just bad picks.

796
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,840
They're just picks based on whatever is currently there.

797
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,200
I was thinking the other day, you know what would be better?

798
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,640
Is if there were just one or two Fire Emblem characters and you could pick a different,

799
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,120
just like each new Smash game could have just a new Fire Emblem that would be the same as the

800
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,040
last one, but it would look different and it would be just some other girl with a sword

801
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,840
who plays identical to the last one, but just has a different name.

802
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,680
That's just the annoying thing is that Fire Emblem has such a variety of types of fighters

803
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,200
and they always choose whoever is the protagonist or the main character,

804
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,920
which is a similar sword-wielding lord usually and there's all of these like

805
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,080
incredible diverse characters they could take from any of the games,

806
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,680
but they always take the main character.

807
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,400
There should be one character named Fire Emblem and you can choose to be like an Axe

808
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Man or a Sword Man or a Magic Man and their moves that would change.

809
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,880
Like Pokemon Trainer?

810
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,080
Yeah, that's what it should be.

811
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,800
There should be one character named Fire Emblem.

812
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,680
That would be cool.

813
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,040
I would like, if I had the power, I would model like three-dimensional versions of

814
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,880
all the Fire Emblem classes as they appear in sprite form and then I could make like Smash,

815
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,400
just Fire Emblem Smash though.

816
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,200
And it would be actually good and people would be like, ah, yes.

817
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,000
We already have a Fire Emblem Smash, it's called Smash.

818
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,560
It's true.

819
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,120
LaMalle.

820
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,600
It's been colonized.

821
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,040
But now they have Sephiroth, so like all is forgiven.

822
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,520
Sephiroth, he's pretty good.

823
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,880
Sephiroth looks pretty cool.

824
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,480
It's pretty, you know, as these things go.

825
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,960
Did you see?

826
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,000
He's no Steve.

827
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,920
Did you see Sephiroth's little Let's Play video where he plays as Sephiroth and shows us how he plays?

828
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,680
Yep, yep.

829
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:35,920
That was fun.

830
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,080
He does one for every new character, right?

831
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,640
Yeah, it just sort of, it's sort of cute.

832
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,280
I don't know, something about the way he was doing that.

833
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,120
So I just felt like he was Let's Playing.

834
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,840
He's a good man.

835
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,480
There's the part in it where he's like, he's talking about like frames.

836
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,840
And then he's like, wait a minute, I don't care about this.

837
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,160
I'll leave that to the tournament players.

838
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,800
Let me just say, it feels fun to do this.

839
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,360
Yeah, it's like he clearly like does care a little bit.

840
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,240
And he's like, wait, Smash is not a competitive game, haha.

841
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,800
Yeah.

842
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,760
I mean, it's funny because if you watch his play through when he talks about Terry,

843
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,720
it's obvious that he's like a hardcore fighting game guy.

844
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,640
He knows all this shit about King of Fighters and Fatal Fury and Street Fighter and all this

845
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:22,880
shit.

846
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,160
And he's talking about all the different really obscure movesets and stuff that he integrated

847
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,360
in all the references to all these obscure SNK games.

848
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,880
He grew up in the arcades.

849
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,240
He's clearly like a hardcore fighting game community guy.

850
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,920
But he was tasked to make a fighting game, or a party game.

851
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,520
And that was the initial idea.

852
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,160
And it's just like that DNA is like in him, but like he has to play it like closer to

853
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,040
the chest.

854
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,400
And it's just like pretty funny how like this party game was taken and became like treated

855
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,640
communally as the genre that he clearly has a lot of love for, but wasn't setting out to make.

856
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:03,440
Yeah, it's nice to see that he seems to have more control over this current game than he

857
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,240
did previously.

858
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,720
And he's happy about it.

859
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,040
Yeah.

860
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
There's Minecraft in it now.

861
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,760
There's Steve in it.

862
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,240
That's all you need.

863
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,800
That's so cool.

864
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,200
There's Minecraft in Super Smash Bros.

865
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,160
It's pretty good.

866
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,160
But you know what?

867
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,480
I'm not going to play it because I actually don't like playing Smash Bros.

868
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,600
No, neither do I.

869
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,040
I just like looking at it.

870
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,840
I kind of like that it exists, but I'm not going to play it.

871
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,520
And I actually don't care at all.

872
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm like, I get much more enjoyment watching like Maximilian Dude react to like New

873
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,040
Fighters added to Smash than I do playing the game.

874
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,600
You know, like if you watch his reaction when like Cloud was announced, it's like the most

875
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,560
entertaining good feel thing of all time.

876
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,680
Watching this grown man flip his shit for a character in a video game.

877
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,480
What did he do about Sephiroth?

878
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,560
He also flipped shit, but he was like three other people.

879
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,680
So they were all just like geeking out.

880
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,040
I'm like, I don't know who any of these guys are.

881
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:07,760
Man, I thought Sephiroth was so cool when I was in like eighth grade.

882
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,520
And you still do.

883
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,520
And I still do.

884
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,360
No, I wanted to, I, when I, I grew my hair out really long and I think part of my motivation

885
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,280
for doing that was that I thought Sephiroth looked really cool with long hair and I wanted

886
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,320
to look like that.

887
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,080
Same with Zero from Mega Man X.

888
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,800
Those were my two like long hair goals at the time.

889
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
Were you going to dye it gray or silver?

890
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,240
I thought about it.

891
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,000
I never like really, occasionally I wondered like, what if I dyed it gray?

892
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,480
Little did he know Ben's life would be so stressful.

893
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,000
He'd start growing gray naturally.

894
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,960
Yeah, yeah, like all I had to do was wait.

895
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,960
I can, I can see Ben like young Ben with long dyed gray hair and a leather trench coat.

896
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,760
It's really funny.

897
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,360
Ben dressed up like Sephiroth with like the long hair and then Nate with his vampire

898
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,080
Hunter D hat.

899
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,240
Just like the ultimate, the ultimate, pure weaponized cream.

900
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,080
Embrace tradition, guys.

901
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:13,200
You know what, you know what, I was, I was, I was cleaning my room the other day.

902
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,800
I was cleaning my room.

903
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
This is, this is going to sound really stupid.

904
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,240
But I guess I might as well say it because where else am I going to say stupid shit other

905
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,320
than on the procrastinators podcast?

906
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,880
I've seen your Twitter.

907
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,520
I was cleaning.

908
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,720
Oh, no, I only, no, fuck you.

909
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,000
I see smart things on Twitter.

910
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,280
I'm the only smart one there.

911
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,480
God, I don't want to talk about that.

912
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,680
I don't want to talk about Twitter.

913
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,160
Fuck you.

914
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:45,680
The, the, I was cleaning my room and I found behind some shit on my dresser.

915
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,320
I found the like makeup stuff from, from Radcon.

916
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,600
I found like, you know, the eyeliner and the, and the lipstick and stuff.

917
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,320
And I was just thinking like, and I, and I just remind him is like, yeah, uh, uh,

918
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,520
uh, fucking the, the goth thing, the whole like, the goth, like eyeliner, E-boy thing,

919
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,960
you know, it's kind of cringe, but I, you know, deep down, deep down, I think it's kind of cool.

920
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,040
And, uh, maybe I should pull a Hussie.

921
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,360
Maybe I should pull, like, I think Hussie, Hussie just became a clown.

922
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,720
Like, you know, like he always wanted to.

923
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,920
You became a chocolate.

924
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,480
Yeah.

925
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,800
Maybe I should just become a goth E-boy again.

926
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,760
Embrace, embrace tradition, reject modernity.

927
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,160
I was thinking about similar things because I have some makeup now and I haven't tried it yet.

928
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,280
I've been thinking, ah, God, dang it.

929
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,280
I want to, I kind of want to be like an emo scene goth punk girl.

930
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,040
What better time than now to experiment?

931
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,240
You're not going anywhere.

932
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,520
You know, you don't really risk anything other than the people immediately around you

933
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,040
seeing your, your awkward, like figuring it out phase.

934
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,640
And then you can emerge from the pandemic, like a fucking God of aesthetic.

935
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,480
It's true.

936
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,200
It's true.

937
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,440
Yeah.

938
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,640
Well, I mean, shit, we're most of the way through it now.

939
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,280
Exactly.

940
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,320
Now's the time before the window of opportunity passes you by.

941
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

942
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,520
Um, I don't know.

943
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,920
But, uh, but then I think about like, uh, man, look at myself in the mirror and I'm like,

944
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,960
oh, but I look like that.

945
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,200
Oh, but, but this is my face.

946
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,720
Like if, if a person that looked like this tried to do, tried to try to like look cool

947
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,160
in any way, that would just be like such a mismatch and it would be so cringe.

948
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,600
You got to just commit to it so hardcore.

949
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,280
It turns around and becomes based again.

950
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,800
I think so.

951
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,520
Yeah, I think, I think there's, that's true.

952
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,200
If possibly you can do it, anybody can.

953
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,480
I don't know.

954
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,680
Um, I mean, I don't want to be try hard, right?

955
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,120
No, you have to try hard.

956
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,640
It's, it's, it's now, it's now, it, I feel like it's, it's cringe to be what, I mean,

957
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,080
kind of always has been cringe to worry about what other people think too much,

958
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,480
but it's also cringe to not go hard enough.

959
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,840
Well, that's the whole thing is like, you can,

960
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,720
there are people who can pull things off naturally and like good for them.

961
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,560
And then there's like the people who are tryharding,

962
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,360
trying to like fit into something they're not supposed to be.

963
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,320
But then like, if you try hard so much, you become like so fucking hardcore,

964
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,400
like committed to the cause, it becomes cool.

965
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,440
Yeah, even if you don't like really get there,

966
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,760
the fact that you're trying is like, it's kind of cool.

967
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,920
And I wouldn't sell yourself short.

968
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,640
I don't, I wouldn't like throw the entire idea under the bus,

969
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,720
just cause you're uncomfortable with how your face looks.

970
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,920
I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as you're making it out to be in your own mind.

971
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,120
I mean, I think there are ways to try hard that are more embarrassing

972
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,600
and there are ways to try hard that are less embarrassing.

973
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:33,760
Sure.

974
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,200
The most embarrassing thing is caring about people thinking you're try hard

975
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,480
and reducing your own happiness because of that.

976
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,320
So go go ham, my dude.

977
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,960
Okay, well, I guess I will, whatever that means.

978
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,560
I mean, at the end of the day, Ben,

979
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,000
you're already immortalized on YouTube forever and videos that are out and more to come.

980
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,520
So what's the worst that could happen?

981
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,600
I guess next next next lecture, I should just do it in like full like goth.

982
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,040
I agree.

983
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,360
Wait.

984
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,040
I found, I found a bunch of like rings that I used to wear for like a little period there

985
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,200
when I was maybe like 23 or something.

986
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,360
I was like accessorizing, I was wearing like a bunch of like rings

987
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,080
and I had a bunch of like fake like piercings that I would wear on my ears.

988
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,080
And I found the box in my closet that I had all that stuff in.

989
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,960
And I was like, that was so lame, but also that was so cool.

990
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,480
Maybe it was kind of a little bit cool.

991
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,840
I don't understand why I never like

992
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,400
try to experiment with my aesthetic in real life more

993
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,360
because like I'm always interested in like character creators and video games and stuff

994
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,120
and like aesthetic, something that interests me.

995
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,920
But for some reason, like I never considered myself being a worthwhile canvas.

996
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,840
And that seems like such a missed opportunity.

997
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,520
I know what you mean.

998
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,320
I know the feeling.

999
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:09,120
It's it's the what is it, the expectation of like men to be like normal and not maybe

1000
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,560
not really that flashy and to be flashy is to be homosexual.

1001
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,040
Well, I am pretty gay.

1002
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,400
So I feel like that barrier has been crossed at this point.

1003
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,680
Well, shit.

1004
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,080
Well, like I don't want to be gay.

1005
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,720
Oh, well, that's where I don't have to be fucked up.

1006
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,240
That like deeply ingrained toxic masculinity.

1007
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,360
There it is.

1008
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,480
It's like you got to you got to dress like everyone else.

1009
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,000
Otherwise you're not.

1010
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,680
I mean, I mean, like in in high school, I was like, I was very I did like,

1011
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,760
I was I was pretty try hard.

1012
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,240
Like I did.

1013
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,120
I had I had like coats and stuff.

1014
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,360
Right.

1015
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,280
I have like I have like not like a trench coat, but I had like like leather coats

1016
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:03,040
that I thought were like cool and weird and that were like sort of like my like signature

1017
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,240
pieces and stuff.

1018
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,120
And I was like, oh, man.

1019
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,760
Yeah, I have this coat like nobody else has coats like this.

1020
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,840
Nobody else has like a I don't know, you know, has like hair as long as mine or whatever,

1021
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,840
a fucking hat like this or whatever, you know, whatever the fuck.

1022
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,640
I did a lot of that.

1023
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,160
And then but it was cringe.

1024
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,600
It was definitely cringe.

1025
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,880
No, I like I didn't have a space like that.

1026
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,840
And I wish I did.

1027
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,320
Yeah, same.

1028
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,000
No, it's it's a I don't know.

1029
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,480
It's such an action is cooler than inaction.

1030
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,760
Almost it constantly.

1031
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,680
I think I think it's true.

1032
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:49,840
It's not a good it's not a good thing to be like really like trying to have like quirky

1033
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,960
affectations.

1034
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,320
Well, I don't I feel like even if that in and of itself is like cringe and awkward.

1035
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,120
That's like a necessary stumbling block on the path to finding your own aesthetic and

1036
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,520
being comfortable with like your self presentation.

1037
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:11,200
Yeah, you know, what I really mean is just like it's it's based in as like compared to

1038
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,440
being afraid of people looking at me weird and and not doing anything with myself at all.

1039
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:17,760
Right.

1040
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,280
The the the stages may be cringe, but the process and the results that come from it is based.

1041
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,960
I mean, I'm I'm not I'm not afraid to like look weird at all.

1042
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,480
I'm just I don't know.

1043
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,000
I feel like I'd be so much more willing to experiment if it was like like in a video game

1044
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,080
where like you could just like pick a piece of gear change and then change back.

1045
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,080
Like if you want to like experiment with like I'm going to change my hairstyle,

1046
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,680
you got to like commit for like two months to that until it like grows back out,

1047
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,640
even if it looks bad. Where's like, you know, in a video game, it's like score back to option

1048
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,040
four, option three did not work, you know. Well, it's because that's low effort.

1049
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,760
It is. Right. It is because in real life, if you have like a very particular look,

1050
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,600
it means that you went about achieving it and it probably took some doing.

1051
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,360
This is why we all need to be VTubers and like abandon our physical bodies.

1052
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,120
Then then our changes are that easy.

1053
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,600
It means it means that you were committed to it and you really you pursued it and you

1054
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,640
thought it was a good idea. So if you like look a certain way in real life and it's like,

1055
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,080
oh really, that's what he decided to go with. Like, oh boy.

1056
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,680
But it's just part of the learning process, like in real life, too. It's just like you just

1057
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,040
well, I know. Just tried. Sure.

1058
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,080
So I think we all should give our fellow man a bit more benefit of the note.

1059
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,880
Sure. But that's not fun. I'd rather make fun of everyone on the internet because I'm a

1060
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,720
jackass. I mean, I'll fucking judge someone if they look stupid.

1061
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,760
Well, of course. With the thing about like it being cringed to pretend to be quirky,

1062
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:07,040
do you feel like it's like it would be cooler if you just naturally felt like doing this thing

1063
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,480
instead of trying to do it? Is there a difference?

1064
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,480
I don't think so.

1065
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,640
There's kind of a difference. Like, I remember on the Ricky Gervais show, there was one

1066
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,080
Stephen Merchant made like a joke or he was talking about, they got like a male.

1067
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:31,040
They got like a piece of male from someone who they thought was like a big fucking dweeb.

1068
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:37,120
And they decided that this guy was like a big nerd who thinks he's cool. And he described him as

1069
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,960
like, oh, he's the kid. He's the kid in school who he only wears bowling shoes, right? Because

1070
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,040
it's like quirky. And like doing that for no reason, like just to do it because nobody else

1071
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:57,840
does it is like stupid. Doing it, if he if he just like liked bowling shoes, that would be

1072
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,240
something else. Sure. I think that's a different thing than what we've been talking about, though.

1073
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,920
If you're if you're experimenting with an aesthetic simply because you want to

1074
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,960
differentiate yourself from people around you, that seems like an empty pursuit. But if you're

1075
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,760
just trying to find your own self expression, you're doing it specifically for your own

1076
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,040
satisfaction and you're weighing that against how you'll be perceived, that's a completely different

1077
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:32,720
thing. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, I don't think I think it's I think aesthetics are fine. I don't

1078
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,600
know. I don't know how I feel. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I mean, maybe if I had like more

1079
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:45,120
places to go, maybe if I ever like went out ever, maybe then I would put more thought I never have

1080
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:51,040
any cause to consider like how will I look? How will I present myself? It's just such a it's

1081
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,520
it's depressing, actually. I wish I wish there were more opportunities for me to even think

1082
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,000
about such a thing. And then maybe I would experiment with it more LeMau.

1083
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:11,920
What do you think about that? I mean, I feel similarly I've had like makeup nearby, like I've

1084
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,320
been thinking mascara, like eyeliner, like I don't know how this was stuff works. I gotta look at

1085
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,000
YouTube videos, and I gotta try it out and fail a bunch of times. I just have no reason to because

1086
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,720
you know, I don't need to look good for camera. And I don't need to go outside. So like,

1087
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,960
what am I going to do? Here's here's what I think. Here's what I think. I think

1088
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,240
here's why I'd be a little uncomfortable with something like something that I think is

1089
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:44,400
a look that I think is cool, like, um, like like a long hair or like eyeliner or something. I think

1090
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,360
something like that. This is just my opinion. I think something like that looks good. It's like

1091
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:58,800
kind of like a feminine detail or a feminine affect. I think it looks the best on like someone who is

1092
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:05,120
very traditionally masculine. And it's like, to the point that like it's sort of like a deliberate

1093
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,880
contrast. I think that's interesting and looks good. I think that I am too shlubby looking.

1094
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,960
I think that I'm like too normal of a guy. I'm not like, if I think you'd need, I don't know,

1095
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,880
I think to pull off a look like that, you need like to be tall or like have a strong jaw or

1096
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,600
something. And I don't, I'm just normal. Uh, I don't know. When I imagine myself doing something

1097
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:36,160
like that, I think it's like, that's weird. It's cringe. Hmm.

1098
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,840
I don't know. I wonder how much of that is like internal versus external, like just kind of like

1099
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:50,320
conditions you've put upon your own kind of, uh, uh, expectations of what that should be versus

1100
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:57,520
like objectively what it actually is. Well, I guess I don't, I don't know. I mean, I have the same

1101
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,240
issues with myself because I always feel like, you know, I don't look properly for aesthetics I'd

1102
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,640
like to do. And then on top of that, it's just like, I also don't feel like putting in the time,

1103
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,480
effort or money to figuring it out. But then on the other hand, it's like, would

1104
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:18,160
addressing how I look and like make myself more aesthetically in line with how I would like to

1105
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,960
be or finding out what that even is, would that help just make me feel better in general?

1106
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,360
You know, like such a huge part of like the self that I've never explored. And like,

1107
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,000
perhaps that would help just make myself feel better if I actively took a step and like

1108
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,320
presenting myself as I would like to. I don't know. I mean, it's something that's been such a

1109
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,880
non part of my life. Like I've just, I've had like all the same clothes since high school where

1110
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,440
it's just like a T-shirt and jeans or whatever. And I just don't give a fuck. And I don't know if

1111
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:56,320
that's was a mistake. I mean, I think there's probably like a, like a self reinforcing loop

1112
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:05,200
there wherein like, if you put more thought into your appearance and then, and then, you know, you

1113
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,640
have, and then you actually like go out in situations where like presentation is matters,

1114
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,160
then that like act of going out and like being presented, like presenting yourself to others

1115
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:27,040
will probably make you then consider your appearance even more so, right? And these things

1116
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:36,400
will reinforce one another, right? Yeah, I would assume so. Yeah. Same with like working out,

1117
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:43,600
honestly. Same with like, when I was, when I was like going out more, seeing more people,

1118
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:50,480
I was more, like when I was more social, I think I had more of like a drive to like

1119
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:58,880
work out and be active and like, you know, keep myself from getting fat and turning into a fucking

1120
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,840
piece of shit, right? I mean, I was like in the best shape I've been in a while,

1121
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,920
like by rad con for, and then COVID happened and I definitely let myself go.

1122
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,640
Yeah, same. Yeah, same. It was all downhill from there. I'm desperately trying to like recover,

1123
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,480
like the last couple of weeks I've been like really strict on diet again. I'm like, no, I have to,

1124
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,680
I have to get it back. I feel like completely, I haven't gained like that much weight, but like,

1125
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,640
I have like, I'm off keto and I'm just like, ah, fuck it. I gained a significant amount of weight,

1126
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,920
especially in the last like two months, just like, no, I can't do this anymore.

1127
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,400
I gained some, I gained a bit in like the first, the first bit of quarantine, and I've basically

1128
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:43,600
just kind of been stable there for a while. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty lame.

1129
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,840
Part of my personal aesthetic is not being fat. Can't have that must destroy.

1130
01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:01,120
Yeah. Yeah. I should, I should, I should get back on keto, but I just bought some loaves of bread.

1131
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,680
Gross. I just got on. I literally threw out all the food I had.

1132
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,560
I just was like, you know what? Sacrificing on the altar of like being a keto boy again.

1133
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,160
I just dumped it all, dumped all the bread, all the bagels, all the dumps should I had bought

1134
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,480
that was cheap. And I'm like, nope, we're getting, we're getting back hardcore on the bandwagon.

1135
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,760
You know, that's a good way to like mentally reinforce that like, no, we're taking this

1136
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,920
seriously now. And to show how serious I am about it, I'm going to like, you know,

1137
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,360
basically throw out some money, right? Basically spend money by tossing all this food that I

1138
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:41,600
shouldn't have bought. Yeah. It's like back when I used to smoke, sometimes when I would try to not

1139
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,320
smoke anymore, it would be like, it would be a little more effective if I didn't just like

1140
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,720
finish a pack and then not buy another, but for me to say like, no, no more and like throw out

1141
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,880
like, you know, the half a pack or whatever I have left. Right. That means the decision starts

1142
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,160
right there, not when it's more convenient. Yes. Yes, exactly. It was a deliberate change,

1143
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:11,760
not just, oh, well, I guess, I guess it's done. I've quit, I've quit smoking though,

1144
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,920
like that's pretty good. That's like, you know, for all Coronavirus, they say it's

1145
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:22,000
bad for your lungs, but for me, it's been great. Pretty based, pretty based.

1146
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,560
Do you still vape? I haven't heard you vaping in a while.

1147
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:31,040
I have, no, I just haven't done it. Oh my God. That's like your main character trait. I don't

1148
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,400
even know who you are anymore. I don't have any stuff. I mean, I guess I would like,

1149
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,680
I don't think vaping is that bad or anything. I just because they like along now at this point,

1150
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,200
it's been a long time since they stopped them. They wouldn't ship a vape shit to Massachusetts

1151
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,760
because it got like restricted or something. I think it is still technically restricted. I don't

1152
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,760
know. I haven't tried to buy any. Yeah, they wouldn't ship it to me online and it's so getting my

1153
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:07,360
hands on it became a hassle. So I just stopped getting it and it's been a long time since I've

1154
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:14,880
had any and that's fine. Lamal. Well, you're probably saving money. There's nothing else.

1155
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:22,480
Yeah. I mean, vaping is cheaper than smoking, which thank God, which was one of the,

1156
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,520
which was one of the, one of the reasons why I switched to vaping in the first place

1157
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,120
is because like, hmm, you know, I can actually, if I'm smart about it, I can, if I, if I vape

1158
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:36,240
instead of smoke, I can actually spend less on it. But yeah, I mean, vaping does cost

1159
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:44,400
something. So, you know, nothing is cheaper than either. So yeah, very good, very, very clever,

1160
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,600
clever allocation of resources on my part. I congratulate myself.

1161
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,040
You know, speaking of lighting a little bit of paper on fire with leaves in them,

1162
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,880
I feel like I thought recently about how I think I might be like a,

1163
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:08,800
like a minor pyromaniac. Like a little bit of a, like I just, I'm a little bit too excited

1164
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,560
to burn things to get rid of them instead of throwing them away. Because there's like,

1165
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,480
I was clearing out stuff and there's a piece of furniture that's like, we don't need this,

1166
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,400
it's taken up space. We'll put it outside for now and think about what to do with it later.

1167
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,840
And I was like, wouldn't it be cool if we just burn this? And everyone was like, uh, I mean,

1168
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,760
it's still functional. I was like, yeah, but like, I don't know, I just thought we could like burn it.

1169
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,240
And I realized then I was a little bit too eager. And it was funny. I just love making fires and

1170
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,480
looking at them. It's all that dark souls. You just want to light that bonfire really bad.

1171
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,840
I do. I mean, fire is cool enough, I guess.

1172
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,080
It's, it's, it's kind of like a thing, like a stoked about it. Like you go out to, like some

1173
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,960
people, they go out to a party and they like dance or something. I go out to like a bonfire and I

1174
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:06,080
look at the fire all night and I'm like, well, that was fun. Go to bed. I mean, sure. Fire is

1175
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:13,680
I can watch a fire for a while. It's like, it's the same though. It's pretty much the same. Fire

1176
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,600
is much more entertaining when you're throwing things into it and watching that thing get destroyed.

1177
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,840
Yeah. When I'm in charge of like keeping it fed or like half in charge, it's just so like,

1178
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,520
yeah, we got, we got all this scrap wood and we're not going to use it for anything.

1179
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,360
We're going to not going to build anything out of it and it's a nice night to do a fire. So let's

1180
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:38,160
burn some stuff. It's just like, yeah, put stuff on there. We usually after Christmas, we get the

1181
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,520
Christmas tree because all of the pine needles on those things have like a lot of oil in them.

1182
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,200
So they burn really, really hot for a very short time. It's kind of like,

1183
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:55,600
so we chop that up and we have like a Christmas, like end of Christmas bonfire, which is cool.

1184
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,520
I just love fire, guys. Fire is pretty dope.

1185
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,000
That's fine. Nah, it's all right, I guess. What about if it's a government building, Ben?

1186
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:21,200
Well, no, you fucking moron. Some buildings are good, actually. Not all buildings.

1187
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,040
What? Which one? Hashtag not all buildings?

1188
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:35,200
All buildings matter. Oh, yeah. Yeah. If it's cops or a bank, maybe, I guess.

1189
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:42,800
I don't know. So the bad ones, yeah. But if you burn the bank, all your money goes up in smoke?

1190
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,880
You know what? I hadn't thought. I don't want to think about it. It doesn't matter.

1191
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,200
I just hope fire destroys whatever is the best thing for fire to destroy.

1192
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,840
That's why I said all these buildings on fire, just on the off chance that one of them did that.

1193
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:07,840
Fire is a tool. It's neither good nor evil. It is used as the human that is as good as the human

1194
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:15,360
that wields it. Life lessons with Benzane. When I think of return to monkey, I usually think of

1195
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:20,560
build fire, ooke-ooke first thing. Even though monkeys didn't necessarily do that,

1196
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,320
I guess one of them must have at some point.

1197
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,360
Um, no. Has a monkey ever made fire? Do monkeys make fire?

1198
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,480
I don't think, well, I'm trying to think of the technical name.

1199
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,520
I mean, in Jungle Book, like Homo Sapien.

1200
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,920
That's like the whole plot of Jungle Book.

1201
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:46,000
Like there's a Homo Sapien Neanderthal and then Homo Sapien Sapien. I can't remember which way it goes.

1202
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,960
The Cro-Magnon Man and the Homo erectus, my favorite.

1203
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,800
No, I don't remember any of them either, but I know you're talking about like primitive

1204
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,160
version of man first discovered fire. I don't know which one it was.

1205
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:09,360
Yeah, you have to be a man to obtain man's red flower. That's what I learned.

1206
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,880
I feel like it's not the first time you've mentioned that on this podcast.

1207
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,600
Would you guys never see fucking Jungle Book?

1208
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,720
I know exactly what you're talking about.

1209
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,760
I know. I love Jungle Book. I feel no reason to say it.

1210
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,280
You guys are so silent. I was like, who, who, who, who, appreciate.

1211
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,680
I just, I just, I was happy like deja vu. I got,

1212
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,920
because specifically remember you saying that recently.

1213
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,920
King Louis has my name. So I, I was like, oh my God, it's me.

1214
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,240
It wasn't that, that's where your love of fire began.

1215
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,840
It wasn't that recently, but a while ago I did go on a thing about how I think it's so cool

1216
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,000
that they, that he, he doesn't know what it is. So he calls it man's red flower.

1217
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,160
I just like story telling.

1218
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,520
I learned that whole song of by heart when I was young,

1219
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,760
like all of the beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, all that stuff.

1220
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,920
I watched that movie a lot as a kid, a bunch of times. And then I never thought about it.

1221
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,360
And then as an adult, I like remember, I think I heard it again.

1222
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,080
And only then did I appreciate that, that metaphor. I was like, hmm.

1223
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,320
Yeah. Nice.

1224
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,720
Bass, Disney.

1225
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,640
And maybe the multinational corporation is pretty good.

1226
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not get too ahead of ourselves.

1227
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,600
Maybe, maybe, maybe I spoke to Zinn.

1228
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:35,520
Hey, have you guys seen your movie sucks has been streaming his editing process for the Lion King

1229
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,600
remake review for the past like 17 months?

1230
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Yeah, I've seen snips of it here and there, but I haven't sat down and watched the whole thing.

1231
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,920
It's a lot of, it's a lot of time he's been spent editing this Lion King remake review.

1232
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,600
I can't believe it's been so long.

1233
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,760
I'm kind of like strangely hooked on these streams because they're so repetitive,

1234
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,840
they're unbelievably repetitive. He says the same things over and over again.

1235
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,960
Wait, what thing, what do you tell, what is this?

1236
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,280
It's YMS, right? You know, your movie sucks. He's editing on a stream.

1237
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,000
And then there's like stream clips of him editing the Lion King review,

1238
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,000
Lion King remake. And he's like, there's so many of them at this point.

1239
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's just like such a like, probably like, I don't know, 14 hours of like content of watching him

1240
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,440
edit and talk about how the Lion King remake sucks before he's made the actual review,

1241
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,320
which is looking to be more than two hours long itself.

1242
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,360
What a bad man.

1243
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,960
He's such a content machine.

1244
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,520
Indeed.

1245
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,320
I just sort of...

1246
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,880
Human content machine, Adam. What's his name?

1247
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,360
Adam Marshall.

1248
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,520
Adam plays. That's his full name.

1249
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,760
That's what I was going to say. That's what I was going to say.

1250
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,480
Adam Johnson.

1251
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,720
But I went with the Star Wars reference instead.

1252
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,120
Like it.

1253
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,320
I hate streams.

1254
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,240
That's what the people want. They want streams.

1255
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,360
I love streams.

1256
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,320
I guess they do.

1257
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,160
No, I hate them.

1258
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,240
I hate them for, I literally, I feel the same way about them that I feel about video games,

1259
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,040
which is that they just waste your time.

1260
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,320
But like more so.

1261
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,560
It's not even, it's not even like crafted content that they're wasting your time with.

1262
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,080
It's not even like a deliberate experience.

1263
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:20,720
It's so efficient.

1264
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,520
It's just like some, it's just like some accidental bullshit.

1265
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,200
Not every streamer is as good as others, but I love German.

1266
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:34,640
German 985 because he's like on the ball witty so often that there's usually like funny things

1267
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,320
happening every minute or something.

1268
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:41,520
I mean, when I was like, when I was into, when I was into Destiny or then when I was into Vosh,

1269
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,760
like I never watched them live.

1270
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,640
Oh yeah, of course.

1271
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,400
Because like, why would you do that?

1272
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,040
Like they'll, they'll, they'll put the best stuff on their fucking channel as clips.

1273
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,840
Just watch that.

1274
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,280
I think it's people who just want to participate.

1275
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:01,040
It's the participation aspect, being able to be part of the chat and contribute to it and like

1276
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,280
being there when things happen live, which personally does not intrigue me at all.

1277
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,400
But I can understand why people would want to be part of something.

1278
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,160
I definitely have that feeling with, with German.

1279
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:16,400
Like the reason I watched the Game Awards was because German was streaming it and it was just fun.

1280
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,840
Like hearing his like funny commentary over the being sporing stuff that didn't matter.

1281
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:28,560
Obviously, like the answer, obviously the solution here is like, like with everything,

1282
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,280
do it in moderation and it's fun, right?

1283
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,080
So, you know, don't think you're smart for telling me that answer.

1284
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:41,040
I already know, but it seems like, like to be being like the kind of guy or like

1285
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:48,800
being someone who watches live streams regularly just feels like a job.

1286
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,600
Just feels like a job you don't get paid for.

1287
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,640
Well, if you're having a good time, I guess it's not a job.

1288
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,520
I guess.

1289
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:02,160
Some nights I'm just like, I could go into a discord call just to hang out with a few people

1290
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,000
or I could watch a German stream and it feels the same.

1291
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,720
And I just, I just need to wind down and just listen to someone.

1292
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,760
I think I don't usually stay for the entire thing because it goes on for like five hours usually.

1293
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:19,280
I think the problem is we all like fancy ourselves content creators, you know.

1294
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,320
And so every time we do something that isn't working, it's always like a calculation.

1295
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,200
Like I could be spending this time being productive.

1296
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,840
We're like 99% of people don't have that problem.

1297
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,440
Like as soon as they're done with their job, their time is there to do whatever they see fit

1298
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:39,760
because they have no autistic inclinations like we do to have to like do something

1299
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,400
greater with their lives and bless them, bless them for not being cursed like we are.

1300
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:51,280
I mean, I feel like I'm less and less like a content creator mentally due to me not making

1301
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,560
content for a long time.

1302
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,080
The last two months playing games, watching streams and like sitting around and doing things.

1303
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:05,120
It's like I'm a little sad about some parts because like, oh no, I'm not, I'm suck.

1304
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:12,640
But part of it has just been like, I feel more like a consumer or an audience member of things

1305
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,600
rather than someone who could potentially make an analysis video of whatever I'm watching

1306
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,720
or playing.

1307
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,200
Like that stuff doesn't enter my mind as much anymore, which is, it feels good.

1308
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:34,000
I have again become that person you described, Tom, who must be creating at all times or

1309
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,920
they're wasting their time and they're a loser.

1310
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,680
I mean, I'm always like that.

1311
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,680
I like, I've been like trying to come to terms with the fact that like I enjoy playing video games

1312
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,800
and like shouldn't feel bad about it because like I like for decades, every time I watch a

1313
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,440
movie or play a video game for more than an hour, like I'm just wracked with guilt and

1314
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,320
it's been this way forever and it's so bad.

1315
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,360
Tom, you deserve to exist regardless of what happens.

1316
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,400
No, same for you.

1317
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,440
You're not paying for yourself.

1318
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,920
You're not, no, you got to pay your own way.

1319
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,360
Well, you're not contributing to the academy.

1320
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,720
Ben, you're valid.

1321
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,920
Okay, fuck up.

1322
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,960
No, I mean, for the last, listen, you said two months you haven't been on the ball.

1323
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,920
Well, me either.

1324
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:26,560
You know, I put out fucking, I put out that their Slime and Punishment video in like August

1325
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,520
and then I spent a long time doing like fulfillment stuff on my, on those two kick

1326
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,640
starters, which is something.

1327
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,040
But other than that, I have gotten very little done and I feel pretty bad about it.

1328
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,040
But, but I also feel liberated.

1329
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,960
I feel a little bit liberated by low expectations, right?

1330
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,520
Because I feel like at this point, it's been so long since I really did anything.

1331
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,720
Since I really made anything and put it out there that was like worth a fucking a damn

1332
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:04,160
at all that like anyone who's still following me probably has their expectations are rock bottom.

1333
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,640
And they're, well, wait, that sounds, that's not exactly what I mean.

1334
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,800
It's not not for like quality, but like they're not expecting anything anytime.

1335
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,680
They're patient, right?

1336
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,160
They're patient, which means that like, okay, I have, I have embarked.

1337
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,440
I have embarked upon a new construction.

1338
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,360
I have embarked upon a new project.

1339
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,720
And it, and the thing about that is that they've been here this long.

1340
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,200
It's, it's been this long since I made a new thing.

1341
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,120
Like if it can take me however, however long it takes me, it's fine.

1342
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,080
I don't have to worry about like, oh, I have to get it done by the end of the month.

1343
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,160
If it take, it's going to take me however long it takes me.

1344
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,480
And if it takes me two months, then so be it.

1345
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,080
Like it's, it's not going to be, it's not going to be a disaster,

1346
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,280
any more of a disaster than the gap since my last thing has already been, which is exciting.

1347
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,680
I have been, I've been, I've been like trying to work 24 hours a day.

1348
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,040
And I can't, guess what?

1349
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,800
Shocker, I can't do it.

1350
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,640
I'm in a terrible brain fog and I can't sleep.

1351
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,600
And I can't focus on anything.

1352
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:17,680
And my eyes hurt and I woke up, I keep waking up at weird hours

1353
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:22,080
and trying to like get back into it and then just staring at my screen.

1354
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,920
And it's like, oh, I can't, I can't remember what I was doing.

1355
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,680
So, you know, it's going good is what I'm saying.

1356
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:30,720
Excellent.

1357
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,200
Things are, things are, things are according, proceeding according to plan.

1358
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:42,480
I mean, I felt like entirely the same with regards to last thing I did was in August

1359
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,840
and then nothing and fuck.

1360
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,960
Last few days before today, I was feeling really bad and I just stopped feeling bad.

1361
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,040
I guess it's just one of those chemical things.

1362
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,400
It's just the depression juice ran out and I guess I'm fine.

1363
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:05,360
But like, I don't know, it's, it's okay to just not do anything, isn't it?

1364
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,680
Yep, it is.

1365
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:15,040
I do like the idea that, you know, knowing that I still want to do it, it'll happen eventually.

1366
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:22,240
And I don't know, there's just earlier in the year, like at the very beginning of the year,

1367
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:26,080
in fact, I was like, this is going to be the year where I do a fuck ton of things

1368
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,120
and I'm super productive and I become a real mangaka and I didn't do that.

1369
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,240
I did a lot of ghosts extremely fast in one month or two months, I think.

1370
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,240
That was so much for one month.

1371
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,920
You really did crank that out.

1372
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,760
And then like, I think it was immediately then it was Redcon 4

1373
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,280
and then COVID and that was fucked.

1374
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,280
But then I sort of picked myself up near August and I was like, let's do

1375
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,680
another thing, let's do the Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King

1376
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,040
comic for the contest.

1377
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:03,920
And I did another month of extreme intense work and that's like two out of, or two and a half out of

1378
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:10,320
12 months of actual like real work and the rest was just being deceased.

1379
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,960
And on the whole, it's like, it's not terrible because I did do stuff and it's,

1380
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,640
but it's not good because so much of the year was, I don't know,

1381
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,520
riddled with anxiety and terrible other stuff.

1382
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,080
And I guess transitioning was a big part of my focus.

1383
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,400
Yeah, I definitely feel like I did get some things done this year,

1384
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,760
but I think I thought I would get more.

1385
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,720
There were things I thought I would have done by now that I didn't.

1386
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,720
Shocker, COVID was not a great motivator.

1387
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,200
No, then I don't know about you guys, but as soon as it starts snowing,

1388
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:47,840
I'm done.

1389
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,000
Like I can't, I can't handle winter at all.

1390
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,160
So now that it's snowing, I'm just like, that doesn't really affect me.

1391
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,880
Oh God, I can't really have much.

1392
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,000
I'm surprised.

1393
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,200
No, I can't.

1394
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,760
That's that.

1395
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,560
I don't care about that.

1396
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,960
That's the reason like the last like two months.

1397
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,360
Why?

1398
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:03,760
I don't know.

1399
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,520
I just hate the cold.

1400
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,400
I hate the cold.

1401
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,200
I hate the snow.

1402
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,280
I do hate the cold.

1403
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,000
I always forget how annoying the cold is.

1404
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,560
Okay, the word what's really bugging me is that I have a space heater in my room,

1405
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,520
which is fine.

1406
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,360
But like when it's on, it's too hot.

1407
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,880
And when it's off, it's too cold.

1408
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,440
Like I have to like turn it on and off every like half hour.

1409
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,200
You never worry about air air conditioning.

1410
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,200
Air conditioning gets you exactly where you need to be,

1411
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,920
but like you can never balance the heat when it's too cold.

1412
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,200
It's always uncomfortable one way or the other.

1413
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:34,480
Yeah.

1414
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,080
Fuck the snow.

1415
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,760
I hate having to dig out my fucking car,

1416
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,040
which you don't have to deal with obviously,

1417
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,720
but like you need to go somewhere.

1418
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,640
Well, I got to fucking dig out my goddamn car.

1419
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,800
It's buried in fucking snow and I have a broken back,

1420
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,000
which makes it even harder.

1421
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,440
And it's just like, yeah, that's a fucking shit show.

1422
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:51,680
Where are you?

1423
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,480
I mean, do you have to leave the house for stuff?

1424
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,120
I mean, like going grocery shopping and shit.

1425
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,040
I don't have to.

1426
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,120
I don't go a lot of places, but it's just like,

1427
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,960
I can't I can't use my EBT with fucking Instacart.

1428
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,520
So if I want to like use my fake money,

1429
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,680
I got to like dig the car out and get going.

1430
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,840
Just just just say just save the just save the EBT.

1431
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,640
You can use it later.

1432
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,520
It doesn't expire.

1433
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,240
Yeah, I suppose.

1434
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,360
But then I have to spend I have to spend real money,

1435
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,520
which is very valuable.

1436
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:23,760
What?

1437
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,320
What?

1438
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:24,720
Yeah.

1439
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,000
Money is valuable.

1440
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,880
What the fuck?

1441
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,760
So I've been told.

1442
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,440
I feel like we've all been tricked into thinking that,

1443
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,720
but in the current paradigm, yes, it is very important.

1444
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,360
What a nightmare.

1445
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,600
Well, if you say so, if you say so.

1446
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,200
No, I never leave my house.

1447
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,320
I've been Instacarting.

1448
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,360
It's it's based.

1449
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,280
The only cool thing is when I do get Instacart

1450
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,520
and I come out like with with my cane,

1451
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,520
their demeanor goes from my hate serving,

1452
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,640
like obnoxious white people to like,

1453
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,000
oh my god, can I help you bring these in?

1454
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,800
And I'm just like, I never,

1455
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,640
I never meet the deliverer at the door.

1456
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,440
I don't want to.

1457
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,440
I don't want them to look at me.

1458
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,040
I want to just I can just I'll just go down

1459
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,040
and find the shit on my doorstep later.

1460
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,200
Please start doing their makeup stuff.

1461
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,120
That's going to be your fucking like litmus test

1462
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,320
for how good they're doing.

1463
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,000
Just answer the door and see how it goes.

1464
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,520
I don't want to have to say like,

1465
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,600
oh, yeah, yeah, just leave it right there.

1466
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,920
Oh, no, you don't have to let help me take it in.

1467
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,800
No, I'll get it.

1468
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,920
No, thank you very much.

1469
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,960
Yeah, you know, I have a good day.

1470
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,920
I don't want to do that.

1471
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,480
Like just just fucking put it on my step.

1472
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,680
Just leave it there.

1473
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,560
I'll take care of it.

1474
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,800
And and I and and I don't make me tell you that either.

1475
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,080
Just do it. Thanks.

1476
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:40,400
All right.

1477
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,000
You can leave a note for them to do that, right?

1478
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,600
I mean, that's just what they do by default.

1479
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,240
They do it now.

1480
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,960
Not that they're not used to.

1481
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,920
Well, I mean, before COVID, like they were usually like,

1482
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,600
like you'd answer the door and shit.

1483
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:57,280
But now it's maybe you know, maybe it has changed

1484
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,160
because they would like.

1485
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,880
Yeah, maybe it has changed.

1486
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,600
I mean, I just eventually I mean,

1487
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,800
I just stopped answering the door.

1488
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,760
Like they ring the doorbell.

1489
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,560
I just don't answer until like 15 minutes have gone by

1490
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,320
and I am confident that they're gone.

1491
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,640
I don't need to have a conversation with them.

1492
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,680
It's not productive.

1493
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,400
So fuck it.

1494
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,040
It's fucking Instacart.

1495
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,320
I tip them and I tip them and that's good enough.

1496
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,920
That's the only conversation they need.

1497
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,040
Yeah.

1498
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,560
What more do they want?

1499
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,280
I don't.

1500
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,880
Frankly, they probably appreciate it.

1501
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,800
Like what do they need from me?

1502
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:30,960
Nothing.

1503
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:31,600
That's true.

1504
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,320
Just your money.

1505
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,360
I don't do that many favors by making small talk with them either.

1506
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,240
No, who gives a shit?

1507
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,960
I've recently just now I'm on Twitter and apparently Andrew Hussie is

1508
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,440
he's got a trailer for a thing that is new and is not homestuck.

1509
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:49,280
No.

1510
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:54,320
It's it's apparently a visual novel that is coming soon.

1511
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,520
The trailer is like four minutes and 40 seconds long.

1512
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,800
You can't milk Homestuck anymore.

1513
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,160
We're all stuck at home now.

1514
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:01,360
Yeah.

1515
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:05,920
It looks like the same sort of art style because it's written and drawn.

1516
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,600
Entirely by Andrew Hussie.

1517
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,960
So that's like good.

1518
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,320
Oh, really?

1519
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,120
Yes.

1520
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,000
That's exciting.

1521
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,000
Is it clown related?

1522
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,000
I think it has a clown guy in it.

1523
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,680
Okay.

1524
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,040
Is this like an onboarding part?

1525
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,760
Can I finally get on board with it as an Andrew Hussie project?

1526
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:26,640
This card theme seems to relate to his most recent juggler photo shoot.

1527
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:35,840
It would be cool and not like unlike him for that Instagram thing to be like

1528
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,680
clues to whatever this is.

1529
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,560
I think it's definitely related at least thematically.

1530
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,200
Oh my god.

1531
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,040
Oh my god.

1532
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,520
This is I'm it's it's it's Hussie art.

1533
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,400
This is Hussie art.

1534
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,440
You can tell.

1535
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,760
Yeah.

1536
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:50,720
This is a real deal.

1537
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,480
It's none of this fucking bullshit.

1538
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,400
He's drawing and writing a visual novel and I am excited.

1539
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,320
I want to see the next thing the man has made.

1540
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,600
A chance.

1541
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,560
It's been so long.

1542
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,320
Oh my god.

1543
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,080
I didn't know.

1544
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,000
I didn't realize I would be excited for the next Hussie thing.

1545
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,800
But I am.

1546
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,680
This is great.

1547
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,880
I'm just fucking stoked.

1548
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,240
That's a retweet for me.

1549
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:15,920
Yeah.

1550
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,440
You know what?

1551
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,240
Fuck it, me too.

1552
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,000
No, actually, I'm just kidding.

1553
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:25,920
Can't let people on that.

1554
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,080
I'm excited about something that's so off brand.

1555
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,040
I mean, I've always said that like all of the stuff about Homestuck

1556
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,520
being like half written sort of by Andrew Hussie and mostly written and made by other people

1557
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,240
and it just doesn't feel the same was annoying.

1558
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,320
And I wish he would just make a new thing.

1559
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,520
And now this is a new thing.

1560
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,280
So I can't help but be excited.

1561
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,480
I mean, I wonder.

1562
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:55,360
Yeah, it's like, I guess maybe he's just been doing this instead of while the other guys

1563
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,360
like deal with Homestuck too, which like, yeah, makes sense.

1564
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,600
I mean, I'm glad he's just he's not just not doing anything.

1565
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,240
But I guess I'm not surprised.

1566
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,920
Like when you're Andrew Hussie, you can never stop, right?

1567
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,200
You can you can never you can never just quit quit.

1568
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:18,160
It always it always felt like a such a sad ending that the idea that someone's so prolific

1569
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:24,160
and so genius that they would make one thing and then stop creating forever after that.

1570
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,080
And it's like, no, there's got to be something more.

1571
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,120
It's so it's so weird.

1572
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,720
These are like, oh, God, these characters.

1573
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:35,920
Yeah, they don't look that great.

1574
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,840
They still like they look straight up bad.

1575
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,360
But like, I'm okay with that.

1576
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:48,640
It's it's it's like the way Andrew Hussie's style for this sort of like lo-fi MS paint drawing

1577
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:54,240
in in act six of Homestuck sort of changed over time into something that looks like this.

1578
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,600
I got to say, I don't like know what this is.

1579
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,840
I guess I'm only halfway through.

1580
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,080
I don't this guy spinning guns.

1581
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,840
This is it looks it kind of looks really bad.

1582
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,840
But like, I that's like good.

1583
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,480
I like that.

1584
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,480
I genuinely like that it looks bad.

1585
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:26,000
That's because like because it's never it was never about how it looked.

1586
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,400
Homestuck looked good sometimes.

1587
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:34,960
But your first impression of it would be like, oh, this is kind of strange looking weird little

1588
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,520
Yeah, yeah, that's the clown.

1589
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:45,440
This is the clown in this trailer is the guy he's dressed up as in his profile picture and stuff.

1590
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:45,680
Yeah.

1591
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:46,880
Yeah.

1592
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,840
Oh, this is a new YouTube channel Hussie Tube.

1593
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,680
It's just got this one thing on it.

1594
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,560
Yeah, I really I'm still watching this trailer.

1595
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,840
I got I got a minute left.

1596
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,560
I don't really know what to make of it.

1597
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:10,960
Very, you know, I think it's interesting that it's it's

1598
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:21,680
visually it's all Homestuck and it's no like his old art style, you know, like whistles or

1599
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,360
one of his other like traditionally drawn.

1600
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,600
That stuff's too hard.

1601
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,720
Maybe I guess he's just completely embraced the Homestuck aesthetic is that's just how he does

1602
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:38,880
things now, probably just because he realized that like when he draws like that, he can just

1603
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,520
make content like so much faster, right?

1604
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:47,360
He probably used to spend like days on a page of a comic and now it's like, why fucking do that?

1605
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:52,080
Why fucking do that when this is what you're also you're known for and is so much easier to do?

1606
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,680
Yeah, for real.

1607
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,120
Well, maybe Bale, maybe Bale, Jake shouldn't get better.

1608
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,920
Maybe you should stay as shitty as it looked before.

1609
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:09,680
You say, well, it art always gets better.

1610
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,640
It can't it can't help but do that.

1611
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,200
That's true.

1612
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:17,280
Like if you just like purposely tried to like keep it at the same level of quality,

1613
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,520
it would still slowly get better, just not intentionally, I suppose.

1614
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:26,000
Yeah, all we all you can do is be like,

1615
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:32,080
like you can like you could you could be like scribbling it out like just as fast, right?

1616
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,360
Like spending just as little time on it, you would just you would get better at

1617
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,760
doing it fast and loose and sloppy.

1618
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,400
You know what I mean?

1619
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,440
I think the most distracting thing about these character designs is that the bodies

1620
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,960
are pixelated, but the eyes are smooth and it's drawing.

1621
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,800
Yeah, they're just less pixelated.

1622
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,360
That's just a little are they are they alias?

1623
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,600
I don't know if I'm watching it like in a tiny window.

1624
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,240
So I can't tell if they're alias or if they're just higher resolution.

1625
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,880
But either way, they are not congruent and it's very strange.

1626
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,000
It's it's hideous.

1627
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,000
I don't know if I'd go that far.

1628
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,320
I think I would.

1629
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,120
All right, all right.

1630
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,960
I think I would drop the H word.

1631
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1632
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,680
OK, at 206, at two minutes and six seconds.

1633
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:26,720
Yeah, obviously, like her body and hair is that like is low res and the

1634
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:31,360
hair, eyes and mouth are like, yeah, God, that's disgusting.

1635
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,440
I know that's a nightmare.

1636
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,960
I don't understand why you would do that.

1637
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,480
Or is it like recycling like face rigs for all these characters?

1638
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,680
So you don't have to continually read?

1639
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,760
I mean, I don't recognize those expressions.

1640
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,680
So you probably just drew them again.

1641
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:48,800
But I think I think it's just that he probably drew like the the scene like the

1642
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,920
next character at 210 looks like it has the exact same kind of eyes.

1643
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:59,200
I imagine he drew the scene in like a certain resolution and then he zoomed in on the character

1644
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:03,200
and drew the face at a different resolution.

1645
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,760
Yeah, he's like he's he's zoomed in.

1646
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,400
He's zoomed in shot in here, which is interesting.

1647
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,840
I'm just skipping through now.

1648
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:15,760
He's zoomed in the shot and then drew the eyes and drew the expression at the original

1649
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:23,120
resolution, which then looks higher resolution than the zoomed in pixelated old stuff, right?

1650
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:24,960
Oh, God.

1651
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:32,080
Oh, God, this is, you know, what this says to me, like, this is the trailer for your project.

1652
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,680
Like, clearly, he does not give a fuck if it looks good.

1653
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:39,600
Like, like, like he doesn't care and like good for him.

1654
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,800
And thank God.

1655
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,160
Like, that's that's clearly not the priority here.

1656
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,600
This is not it's not like my new corporate enterprise.

1657
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,000
It is.

1658
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Here's a funny thing I thought of when I made it.

1659
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,920
Yeah, for sure.

1660
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:52,800
Oh, that's great.

1661
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,840
Oh, this is so good.

1662
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,040
Well, I'm fucking I'm fucking stoked.

1663
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,480
I'm fucking hype for this shit.

1664
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:03,920
Whatever it is.

1665
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:09,440
I wonder if the clown is hussy.

1666
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:10,560
You know what I mean?

1667
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,200
It might be.

1668
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:11,520
Yeah.

1669
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,720
Or maybe it's like cosplaying the clown.

1670
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:21,280
Yeah, like either either hussy is cosplaying this clown character or that clown character is him

1671
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,160
and he just depicts he just is a clown now.

1672
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,200
Like this is what we're meant to know about him.

1673
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:34,080
The bit at the end was like this does not happen in the game.

1674
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,000
Wait, where does it say that?

1675
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:38,800
With with.

1676
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:46,000
It's like 313 or that sequence there.

1677
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:48,720
Oh, this does not.

1678
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:55,520
We're Violent J, Shaggy Tutto with Dragon Ball Z, Scouters and what's his face for the AK-47

1679
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:56,960
and Kojima.

1680
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:03,200
Oh, OK, so this is just some shit that's in the trailer because it's funny.

1681
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:03,920
Yeah.

1682
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,760
And it's not I am sorry.

1683
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,600
OK, if that's true, then yeah, I think this is just hussy.

1684
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:15,920
This is just clown hussy and Kojima and Shaggy Tutto open Violent J and

1685
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,400
it's not Guy Fieri.

1686
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,800
I don't know who this this guy in the blue blazer is.

1687
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,920
The blue blazer.

1688
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,680
No, no, that's that's I forget his name.

1689
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,240
He's big rock rap guy.

1690
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,760
I forget whatever.

1691
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,760
Oh, I don't fucking know.

1692
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,400
He has some sort of a name that is a name.

1693
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,960
Is he like a is he a sad rapper?

1694
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:47,920
No, he's like something I don't know.

1695
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,400
I don't know knowledge about what he does.

1696
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,120
Perfect.

1697
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,480
Someone mentioned Post Malone.

1698
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,520
Is that Post Malone?

1699
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,560
That's what I was thinking.

1700
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,000
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

1701
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,400
That's who I was thinking of and I just couldn't place the name.

1702
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,800
And all I remember is that he's got like a sad rap song that got really popular.

1703
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,280
Anything about anything?

1704
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:06,560
It is.

1705
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,120
Damn.

1706
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,080
How did I fucking know?

1707
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,080
I've never I don't even know fucking.

1708
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,840
I couldn't name a Post Malone song, but somehow in my lizard brain,

1709
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:19,120
I associated this face with that identity even though I couldn't place the name.

1710
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:19,680
Stupid.

1711
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:22,720
All right.

1712
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,600
Enough about this.

1713
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,480
Yes.

1714
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,440
Fuck Andrew Hussie.

1715
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,720
Fucking hack.

1716
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,600
Gigapause was too long.

1717
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:32,880
Truth.

1718
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,280
Well, should we go to questions?

1719
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,880
I mean, do we still do voicemails?

1720
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,200
Holy shit.

1721
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:41,920
We do.

1722
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:48,000
Believe it or not, I have one more thing that I wanted to complain about before we go into voicemails.

1723
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:57,200
And that is I got so a while ago, I've said this before, my tablet died, the screen died.

1724
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,080
Press F.

1725
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,840
So so I bought a new one.

1726
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,560
Not an almost as old model, a slightly upgraded model.

1727
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,440
It's still like a decade old at this point.

1728
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,600
So like, you know, kind of old tech.

1729
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:19,360
But I got a new tablet, a Cintiq 21 UX DTK upgraded from a DTZ.

1730
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:26,400
But it turns out, and I remember I had gotten, when I had got the old one,

1731
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,920
an old, a previous patron of mine, Artemis gave it to me.

1732
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,280
I guess he's had an extra one.

1733
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,320
But he so he gave me the tablet and I didn't have a stylus.

1734
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,080
So I went and I bought a stylus and it didn't work.

1735
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,960
And I asked him and he told me, oh, yeah, that's stylish you got.

1736
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,000
Sorry, that doesn't work with the DTZ with the DTZ.

1737
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,720
That only works with the later model, the DTK.

1738
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,080
So I had to buy another stylus for that.

1739
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,840
And then I got this one, it's the DTK.

1740
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:01,200
And I had previously bought a stylus that only worked with DTK.

1741
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,720
And I don't know where it is.

1742
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,760
I can't find it.

1743
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,320
That's why I was looking through my room when I found the makeup.

1744
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,200
I was looking through my shit trying to find that old stylus.

1745
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:09,840
And it doesn't work.

1746
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,160
So now I have to buy a third stylus to replace the first one

1747
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:18,000
for the first tablet that didn't work, that I need to replace with the second stylus.

1748
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,040
And so this thing that I'm trying to make right now,

1749
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,680
it does, it's going to involve drawing some stuff.

1750
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,840
But I can't draw anything until I get the fucking,

1751
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,280
until I get the freaking thing in the mail.

1752
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:37,280
So I won't be able to do that for like a week, but it's okay.

1753
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,600
I'll have other stuff to work on with it.

1754
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,920
Do you have pencils and paper?

1755
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,280
Shut the fuck up.

1756
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:50,080
Oh, it's a, I need, I need to produce digital.

1757
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,080
I need to produce digital images.

1758
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,960
I mean, you could sketch them maybe.

1759
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,320
Just so you have them,

1760
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,960
then you don't need to think when you're drawing them digital.

1761
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,240
Well, no, well, okay.

1762
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:06,640
Yeah, in theory, I guess if I need an image,

1763
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,280
I could sketch it and then scan it and then put it,

1764
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,920
because I need sketch it and then scan it

1765
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,840
and then like trace it in my computer.

1766
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,960
No, there's no point.

1767
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,840
There's no point at all.

1768
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,880
In fact, there's no point to anything.

1769
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,440
You know, we're all just going to die one day, actually.

1770
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,560
Yeah.

1771
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,600
Why don't we just do that now?

1772
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,040
I don't know.

1773
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,160
Now you're speaking my language.

1774
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,000
All right.

1775
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,160
Let's do voicemails, right?

1776
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,680
Okay.

1777
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,960
Oh, man, I like hinted at that,

1778
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,800
but I didn't get into specifics.

1779
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,600
My sleep has been really weird lately.

1780
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,480
I've been waking up at the same time,

1781
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,800
no matter when I go to sleep.

1782
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,640
And like it's really bad.

1783
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:52,960
Like it's early.

1784
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,680
Like I've been waking up at like 6.45 a.m.

1785
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,640
Pretty close to that every morning,

1786
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,400
even when I went to sleep at like two in the morning.

1787
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,440
I can't seem to get a good night's sleep for the full eight hours,

1788
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,320
unless I would have to go to sleep at like 10.

1789
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,120
And I don't want to do that.

1790
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:13,840
That's stupid.

1791
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,920
8 hours seems like too much.

1792
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,600
8 hours?

1793
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,080
What do you mean?

1794
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,160
Like going to bed at 10.

1795
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,520
Oh, I guess if you're waking up at 6, no, no, it's fine.

1796
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,480
8 hours is normal.

1797
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,120
Going to bed at 10 seems like so early, but if you're...

1798
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,800
Yeah, I would rather shift it.

1799
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,680
I would rather shift it.

1800
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,480
So I'm going to sleep sometime between like midnight and 2

1801
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,640
and waking up sometime between like 8 and 10.

1802
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,760
Waking up like before 7 in the morning just seems like...

1803
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,000
There's no need for that.

1804
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:40,640
There's no need for that.

1805
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:41,760
It's not 10, man.

1806
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,080
No.

1807
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,320
The early worm catches the bird.

1808
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,360
I don't know.

1809
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:51,680
So I keep staying up a little later than that.

1810
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,760
I keep staying up until like midnight or two

1811
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,480
and then I only get like four or six hours of sleep

1812
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,840
and I wake up and I'm bleary the next day and I can't focus.

1813
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,160
I'll figure it out.

1814
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,520
Okay, are we ready for voicemails?

1815
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,680
Yeah, is a truth teller?

1816
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:11,600
Yes, the first one on the second page.

1817
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,040
Oh, boy.

1818
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,960
Because there's two called truth teller for some reason.

1819
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,240
Here we go.

1820
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,440
A truth teller.

1821
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,200
Three, two, one, go.

1822
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:23,600
That's me.

1823
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,760
He loves what?

1824
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:36,240
Anal.

1825
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,120
Anal.

1826
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:37,440
Oh.

1827
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:41,440
This is really what I come back to after like five weeks of not being...

1828
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,080
Being here.

1829
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,400
Good to know some things never change.

1830
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,600
Like the quality of voicemails.

1831
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:46,320
Even better.

1832
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,440
We've got another one from truth teller is our next voicemail.

1833
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,400
I hope it's him profusely apologizing for the previous...

1834
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:55,040
Three, two, one, go.

1835
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,960
He just did it again.

1836
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,280
With better mic quality this time.

1837
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:21,600
I want to like file criminal charges for wasting my time like that.

1838
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,000
I mean, this is supposed to be amazing grace, right?

1839
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,720
Yeah.

1840
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:27,120
Yeah.

1841
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,760
Well, why didn't he complete the fucking stanza?

1842
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,240
Because he's...

1843
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,760
What the fuck is this hack work?

1844
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:32,960
Voice jail.

1845
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,920
Like me.

1846
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,280
You didn't do the like me.

1847
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:40,800
Fuck.

1848
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,120
It's so annoying.

1849
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,520
I'm so glad that I'm here right now.

1850
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:50,720
Next one is called ABA sends its regards.

1851
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,600
Three, two, one, go.

1852
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,200
And you'll pass in the shadow of your past childhood.

1853
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,000
The jet fuel can't melt steel beams.

1854
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,920
Fuck off, you man child.

1855
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,040
You fuck tard.

1856
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,160
You loser.

1857
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:22,800
Fuck off.

1858
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,360
You master of lies and deception and die.

1859
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,320
Pop filter, please.

1860
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:29,280
Okay.

1861
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:34,560
Was that an attempt at like a Pink Floyd lyric?

1862
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,520
The ABA, does the ABA refer to the rhyme scheme?

1863
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,600
I have no idea.

1864
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,160
Okay, well, terrible.

1865
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,720
We're doing great guys.

1866
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,200
We're doing great.

1867
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,160
Next, we're just going to be good.

1868
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,040
We're just going to be good.

1869
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,560
Next one is Liam.

1870
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,520
This is like if NWA was good.

1871
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,200
Three, two, one, go.

1872
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,360
I was like not going to like do another call ever again,

1873
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,720
but holy shit.

1874
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,760
Let's the fucking garlic house.

1875
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,600
Fucking the fucking the what's it called?

1876
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,720
The Brad Garling house.

1877
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,280
That's right.

1878
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,080
Distract, dude.

1879
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,040
I hate it.

1880
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:17,520
I like it.

1881
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,560
I don't like it at all.

1882
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,760
This is fucking stupid and terrible and not good.

1883
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,440
And it's amazing and I love it.

1884
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,600
And it's bad.

1885
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,840
And the munchy verse was kind of unironically

1886
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,560
actually wicked, but it's stupid and bad.

1887
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,800
And you should never, ever make music or be allowed

1888
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,760
in your microphone with a beat playing ever again, ever.

1889
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,520
I'll kill all of you.

1890
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:40,560
I love it.

1891
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,640
This is bad.

1892
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,280
Pais.

1893
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:48,640
I'm fucking, I mean, I'm like reading the comments right now.

1894
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,640
Like let's read some fucking comments, dude.

1895
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,920
This is like if NWA was good from this guy blank.

1896
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:58,000
That's that's probably, that's like, this is like,

1897
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,160
this is like if NWA was good.

1898
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,200
Whatever, dude.

1899
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,400
I fucking hate all of you.

1900
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,400
Basically don't make music.

1901
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,480
So did he not like the song?

1902
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,120
I don't know.

1903
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,720
All I know is he probably paid for it.

1904
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:17,920
So that's pretty funny.

1905
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,920
He's like in a critical state of, of cringe and bass

1906
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,960
and he's like rotating like unbelievably fast.

1907
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1908
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:28,960
Can't tell which way he's looking.

1909
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,400
Wait a minute.

1910
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:35,840
Fuck.

1911
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,760
There's um.

1912
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,080
I don't know what NWA is.

1913
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:44,160
It's it's it's niggas with attitude.

1914
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,720
The band.

1915
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,080
Oh.

1916
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,880
It's EZE and Dr. Dray.

1917
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:52,480
And who's the third one?

1918
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:55,840
MC Rand.

1919
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:56,560
Mr. Attitude.

1920
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:58,880
Yeah.

1921
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:04,880
And I know that because I know, but I know fuck the police

1922
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,920
and they say their names.

1923
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,080
They say their names in that song.

1924
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:09,680
Lamal.

1925
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,320
Okay, whatever.

1926
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,040
Cool.

1927
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,960
Next voicemail is called Liam.

1928
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,320
Ben equals Dreg.

1929
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,160
Three, two, one, go.

1930
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,000
I almost forgot to say this earlier.

1931
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,680
Ben, you also sound like fucking Dreg in the diss track.

1932
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:28,560
Like when fucking Dreg's doing his funky bad music things.

1933
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,440
That's what you sound like.

1934
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:31,360
Okay.

1935
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,120
Everyone says that my verse is the worst.

1936
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,800
Nobody likes my verse.

1937
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,480
Well, guess what, losers?

1938
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,760
Did you wrote it for me?

1939
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,200
So fuck all of you.

1940
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,160
I wrote like the first two lines and then I couldn't write anymore.

1941
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:50,240
And did you just wrote the rest and I just wrapped it?

1942
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:51,280
Lamal.

1943
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:52,880
I don't remember.

1944
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,440
I don't.

1945
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,160
What a boy.

1946
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,240
The best part.

1947
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,280
What a boy, guys.

1948
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,120
Nobody likes mine.

1949
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:05,040
I think mine was the best because they got bowtoy in it.

1950
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,000
Piece of shit.

1951
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:14,000
Honestly, I saw a lot of people saying that Munchie's verse was the best.

1952
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,240
And it's just not.

1953
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:16,720
I'm sorry.

1954
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,800
I can't even remember everyone else's.

1955
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,160
Munchie's verse is not very good.

1956
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,200
It's like the worst one.

1957
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,440
I think it's worse than mine, to be honest.

1958
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,560
Yeah, I said it.

1959
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,160
Yeah, I fucking said it.

1960
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:26,720
Fuck you.

1961
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,240
Rap battle.

1962
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,600
Two bad ones.

1963
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,440
Next one is called Voice Whale.

1964
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,440
Three, two, one, go.

1965
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,440
That's W-E-I-N.

1966
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:45,840
Yeah, I get it.

1967
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,040
Because last time we had the whale like the aquatic mammal.

1968
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:53,360
And this time the whale like the vocal vocal.

1969
01:46:53,360 --> 01:47:00,320
What is with the, I mean, I ask what is with the shit quality of the voicemails this week, but.

1970
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,000
It does seem particularly bad.

1971
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,600
They knew I was coming back and they were like,

1972
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,000
we've got to make sure he never comes back again.

1973
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:12,720
It does seem especially cringe this time.

1974
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,640
When are we just going to stop taking voicemails?

1975
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,760
Over our cold dead bodies as well.

1976
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,360
Motivation to murder both of you.

1977
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,880
Sick.

1978
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:25,840
Oh, thank fuck.

1979
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:26,880
I don't have to do it myself.

1980
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,240
Just looking out for my bros.

1981
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,200
That's it.

1982
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,840
And I'm back.

1983
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:32,800
What's the next one?

1984
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
Fake fan mage stan.

1985
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,680
Three, two, one, go.

1986
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,600
So I don't follow any of you weirdos on Twitter.

1987
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,480
So I probably missed the info from there.

1988
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:49,120
But I swear last time I remember mage being on the show.

1989
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:57,760
She said that she just wouldn't be on for a while because she was like going to take care of her grandma or something.

1990
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:03,920
But now it sounds like mage just like isn't on the show anymore and she isn't coming back.

1991
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,520
I'm sorry.

1992
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,720
I just miss mage and her weird dreams and her drawings and stuff.

1993
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,000
So yeah, what's the deal?

1994
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,760
Sorry for being a fake fan by.

1995
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:16,960
Okay.

1996
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,240
How angry should I be at this person for not knowing?

1997
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,280
Only mildly?

1998
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:24,880
Yeah, mildly.

1999
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:30,240
I don't can't remember which episode we would have said it, but I know we've said it at some point.

2000
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:30,480
Yeah.

2001
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,520
I'm just saying if you miss mage's work, mage is on Twitter posting her work.

2002
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,160
That's true.

2003
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:36,400
Get on Twitter.

2004
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:41,280
Yeah, if you miss her drawings, YouTube is not, this podcast is not really the best place for them.

2005
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,240
I think she's gone.

2006
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:47,760
I think she's officially out.

2007
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,160
I don't know.

2008
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:50,720
Am I wrong?

2009
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,520
I have no clue.

2010
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,640
I genuinely don't know.

2011
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,440
The door is always open.

2012
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:56,560
She doesn't want to do podcast stuff anymore.

2013
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,320
Yeah, the door is always open.

2014
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:58,720
Of course.

2015
01:48:59,280 --> 01:48:59,440
Yeah.

2016
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,560
That's her prerogative and that's fine.

2017
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:05,040
Yep.

2018
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,920
Who cares?

2019
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,200
Next one is called Homestuck Preservation Follow Up.

2020
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,800
Three, two, one, go.

2021
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:11,920
All right.

2022
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:15,840
Follow up on that whole Homestuck Preservation thing I sent a million years ago.

2023
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,080
I finished Homestuck months ago.

2024
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,520
I love it to death.

2025
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:20,640
Act six is terrible.

2026
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:21,360
Yep.

2027
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,360
Yeah, that's true.

2028
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:29,600
Tom's actually a lifesaver because he mentioned the whole Flashpoint project thing where,

2029
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:32,000
which is actually preserving flash animations.

2030
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:38,160
Somebody decided to take this and apply it to some weird version of Chromium.

2031
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,720
And so there's an offline archive you can download.

2032
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:49,680
Now, in order to get the one that I have, you have to email a bot.

2033
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,600
It's at gimme homestuck at ZohoMail.com.

2034
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:57,920
And you have to ask for an offline archive download.

2035
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,680
And because he doesn't own any of the rights.

2036
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:09,520
And then he'll send it to you and it loads the entirety of Homestuck and ProblemSleuth offline.

2037
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,640
It's a little slow.

2038
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:11,840
It's a little janky.

2039
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,000
Sometimes the save feature fucks up.

2040
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,440
But you can still use the map to sort of figure out stuff.

2041
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:18,800
I don't know.

2042
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,440
Thank you, Tom.

2043
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,840
You put me on the right path.

2044
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,800
Homestuck is preserved.

2045
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,200
I do what I can.

2046
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:24,480
That's awesome.

2047
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,720
That's super great.

2048
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:31,360
Yeah, I'm glad that it exists, that will continue to exist in some form.

2049
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,960
That's kind of appropriate for Homestuck, I think, right?

2050
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,640
That like you can only get it by emailing some bot.

2051
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:40,800
I like that.

2052
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,240
Gimme Homestuck.

2053
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,480
Gimme Homestuck at ZohoMail.

2054
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,160
Gimme Homestuck or Gimme Death.

2055
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,400
Agreed.

2056
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,120
Next one is called Exposed.

2057
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,200
Three, two, one, go.

2058
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,120
Continue as you were, gentlemen.

2059
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:05,840
On our news site we posted an extremely ugly story about how Hippocrite here

2060
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,160
actually turned out to be a transsexual.

2061
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,520
Okay, would you care to elaborate on that?

2062
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,400
It's all true.

2063
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:17,040
The rumors, every and all rumors, even ones that don't make sense.

2064
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:17,840
That's the truth.

2065
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,280
Post up, none up, coin up, give us all the deeds.

2066
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:36,000
My trainer code is 1-8-2-7-9-7-6-2-4-5-6-8 for my transgo game community video game.

2067
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,360
What are the three numbers in the back and what did they just expire on?

2068
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:47,680
Okay, so that's a little blast from the past as before it was trans.

2069
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:50,160
That's mildly amusing.

2070
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,560
What was that, like a million years ago?

2071
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,040
Yeah.

2072
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:55,600
At least.

2073
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,480
At least.

2074
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:56,960
Good times.

2075
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,600
I mean, I could hear Nate, so it was like, wow, what?

2076
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:06,400
So that must be ancient times before COVID, before Gib decided to go trans and spite God

2077
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,080
and cursed us all with COVID.

2078
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,320
It was a necessary sacrifice, I'm sorry.

2079
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,760
I'm sorry.

2080
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,240
Worth it.

2081
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,560
Tom, were you going to say something?

2082
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,600
I just said, I was just going to say it was worth it as well, so.

2083
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:22,240
Okay.

2084
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,520
Yeah, well then we're all in agreement.

2085
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:23,760
Good.

2086
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,320
Next one is called a weeb with a counterpoint.

2087
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,320
Three, two, one, go.

2088
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:36,160
Hey guys, back during the election episode, some doofus came on the voicemails and was saying,

2089
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:42,400
hey, if an anime is bad, and if dubs are bad, doesn't mean that the dubs of bad anime are good.

2090
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:43,520
And.

2091
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:43,760
Yes.

2092
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,000
Generally rightfully, you guys said, no, of course, that doesn't make any,

2093
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,640
that's bullshit, it's additive, it's not multiplicative.

2094
01:52:51,680 --> 01:53:00,080
Counterpoint, the ghost story stuff, which is good, despite being a bad anime.

2095
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,200
Okay, but that's, no, that's not the same.

2096
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,040
They're not dubbing the source material.

2097
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:08,480
It's basically a bridge series, officially.

2098
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:12,560
Yeah, that's not a bad dub, that's a deliberately silly dub, right?

2099
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,920
Like it's trying to be funny.

2100
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:19,360
It's all ad-libbed, most of it's ad-libbed, and none of it is representative of the source material at all.

2101
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,440
I didn't know it was ad-libbed.

2102
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,560
I haven't seen that much of it.

2103
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,560
Is that the one where it's like the voice actors just didn't give a shit, and they said a lot of crazy things?

2104
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,880
Yeah, there's a lot of like, really edgy humor in it, and it's pretty funny.

2105
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,240
It was, I mean, it wasn't on like TV, right?

2106
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:37,680
No, I don't believe so.

2107
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:40,640
Yeah, it is basically just an abridged series.

2108
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:50,240
What's the, there's like one particularly famous line from it, but I don't remember what it is.

2109
01:53:53,200 --> 01:54:00,160
Ghost, ghost stories, there's like the girl who's like really religious and always like makes Jesus

2110
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:04,960
jokes, and then there's the girl who like falls in love with the bunny, and the bunny's like a

2111
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,320
that's the voice of a deep, like a deep voice of a black man and stuff, and

2112
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,040
there's a lot of weird shit in that dub.

2113
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:15,040
I think there's a, I think there's like a pedo joke somewhere about the kid.

2114
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,480
I think that's what I'm thinking of, but I don't remember what the joke is.

2115
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,480
Yeah, that's, no, it's not the same.

2116
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,800
This isn't, that's not a, that's not a bad dub.

2117
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,240
That's just a weird, deliberately strange dub.

2118
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,680
Uh, but good try, maybe next time.

2119
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,680
Next one is called Cross, garlic and stuff.

2120
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:37,440
Three, two, one, go.

2121
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,120
So the garlic house diss track was pretty based.

2122
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:43,200
I thought all of you guys did really great.

2123
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,640
Talk about it, if you haven't already.

2124
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:50,000
I don't know, is there anything fun, cool about production and shit?

2125
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,520
Also super excited for the Brad Garling House lecture.

2126
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:57,600
That's, that's it.

2127
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:58,960
See you next week.

2128
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,320
Good voicemail, solid voicemail.

2129
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,320
Yeah, I guess we didn't talk about that at all.

2130
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:07,200
Cause that, I had actually forgotten that that dropped this week.

2131
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:08,320
Same.

2132
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:16,240
Yeah, it was, uh, this process of that was nobody really knew what they were doing

2133
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,440
at all at any point.

2134
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:23,840
And, um, did we do any work on it before we were there?

2135
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,040
Did we come up with the lyrics?

2136
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,680
No.

2137
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,480
I think, didn't, did did you like, they, they picked the beat, I think.

2138
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,400
I think they had like picked the beat out before.

2139
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:33,120
Yeah.

2140
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:39,920
And yeah, we picked the beat out and I think I had like scribbled some things on a Google

2141
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,480
doc and me and Munchie were working together too.

2142
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:48,400
Cause we were like, we had figured out the, the like the chorus thing.

2143
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:53,680
Like who, who was going in front of who and like we were left to our own devices to come

2144
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:55,120
up with our own lyrics for our part.

2145
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,160
And, um, yeah, I think I had done mine by the time we were there and some of us weren't.

2146
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,600
I think Digi winged it.

2147
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:04,880
Yeah.

2148
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,360
And, and you hadn't written anything.

2149
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,440
So we had to like help you write something.

2150
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,880
Well, like no one, most people hadn't written anything.

2151
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:13,040
Yeah.

2152
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,720
Nate hadn't written anything either.

2153
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:18,720
Like every, everyone else just like figured those out on the fly and I just suck and I

2154
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:19,200
couldn't do it.

2155
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:20,560
Right.

2156
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,280
Confor was just so much shit going on at the same time.

2157
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,960
Like even finding time to do that was like a pain in the ass.

2158
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,040
And then like recording it wasn't all day affair.

2159
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,040
It was just, it was so, it was so stressful.

2160
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,400
We had to cram everything in.

2161
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,840
We didn't even have time to do the final recording at Radcon.

2162
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,440
So we all had to do our final parts individually and get them mixed after the fact.

2163
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:39,760
Yeah, that's right.

2164
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,920
Yeah, the reason it was like that of course was because we, there was a music video associated

2165
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:46,480
with the thing.

2166
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:50,640
I'm surprised that didn't drop and we just had the, did the audio upload.

2167
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:54,160
Oh wait, are we not supposed to say that there's a video?

2168
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:55,520
No, that was part of the Kickstarter.

2169
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,640
It's like music video too for the, for the disc track.

2170
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,000
The disc track is out.

2171
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,960
There is a video.

2172
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,440
Yeah, I was expecting the song to drop with the video.

2173
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,920
I think it will come pretty soon.

2174
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,160
He can't have forgotten.

2175
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:08,720
No, no, no.

2176
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:13,840
That the way it was, it was set up was the, the lecture comes out first, then the music video.

2177
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:15,680
Oh, okay.

2178
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:16,480
It's all linked up.

2179
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,600
So the idea, so the song, the song was ready.

2180
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:23,600
So Nate dropped the song and then the lecture will come out next and then the music video

2181
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,240
after that.

2182
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:25,360
Yeah.

2183
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,360
Okay.

2184
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,160
Very good.

2185
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:28,800
Very good.

2186
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:31,360
Yeah.

2187
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:39,360
God, it's, it, I think I've been kind of stressed.

2188
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,440
I think it's been a source of like subconscious stress for me that like it's been so long since

2189
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:48,880
Radcon 4 and like a lot of the content never came out.

2190
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:54,160
I would not be stressed except for the fact that so much of it hinges on this joke that is like a

2191
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,720
year old and like will it still be funny?

2192
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,640
That doesn't bother me.

2193
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,520
Honestly, that, I'm like, you know, that's in God's hands now.

2194
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:10,720
Whereas things like getting the rest of the lectures out, that's, that's in, it's man.

2195
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,960
We could, mankind can only rely on himself for that.

2196
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,400
And I don't, I don't trust us.

2197
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:22,320
I mean, I can't judge because I haven't gotten mine done either, but I'm going to.

2198
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:22,560
Yeah.

2199
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,720
I mean, I feel like that's an individual sort of thing.

2200
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:27,600
If you've got one to do, then obviously you'd feel stressed about that.

2201
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:33,520
But like, in terms of Radcon stuff, I guess I feel a little bad.

2202
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,840
Yeah, the, I guess the lectures are not technically like stretches, rewards.

2203
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:43,200
There's the, the OVA, which I still have to edit, but there's the OP, which is still being animated.

2204
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,280
So they couldn't, I couldn't release it anyway.

2205
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,280
There's, so that's Mike's use still.

2206
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:51,280
Yeah.

2207
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,840
I mean, that's, that was always going to take a while.

2208
01:58:54,640 --> 01:59:00,640
Then there's the, the dojin, which is the dojin, which we have not really even started.

2209
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:06,960
It's because nobody wants to be the person to draw smut of ourselves.

2210
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,040
Well, none of us is going to draw it.

2211
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,400
We were going to commission someone.

2212
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,040
We were kind of, yeah, we hadn't found anyone.

2213
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,960
I think we just hadn't written anything yet.

2214
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:20,400
I think, I think the holdup for me about that was I kind of thought that like,

2215
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:27,040
it was going to tie in with the final chapter of Road to Radcon was another thing that needs to get done.

2216
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,880
Yeah, it's all on Digi.

2217
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:30,960
So there's, there's that.

2218
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:34,880
And then I, I guess I thought that the dojin was going to tie into that somehow.

2219
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,160
I thought it was.

2220
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,320
Road to Radcon 5 at this rate.

2221
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,240
Yeah.

2222
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,440
Well, oh God.

2223
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:46,960
Well, Road to Radcon Chapter 5 can also be the Road to Radcon 5 Chapter 1.

2224
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,240
See, Bridges the Gap.

2225
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,200
I see, I see.

2226
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:52,720
Can we, can we get on Digi's ass about just finishing that?

2227
01:59:52,720 --> 02:00:01,520
Like, I don't, I want, like I have previously and they just, she just, she's doing strange things.

2228
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,680
Stupid, stupid.

2229
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:08,160
Road, road trips and drugs and strange new people.

2230
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:08,960
And I don't get it.

2231
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,800
And I guess it's fine.

2232
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:11,200
It's just sort of like.

2233
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:14,800
I'm not the only one who has no idea what's going on in Digi's life right now.

2234
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,080
That makes me feel a little better.

2235
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,800
I mean, it just seems like a bunch of stupid bullshit.

2236
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:19,600
I mean, I don't, I don't.

2237
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,720
And that's, that's all I know.

2238
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:22,400
And that, I feel like that sums it up.

2239
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,000
I'm just so fucking lost.

2240
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,840
I don't know what the hell's going on anymore.

2241
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:29,920
I wasn't sure if it just because I wasn't paying attention because I wasn't.

2242
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:34,560
I just want to see the, the, the, the Brony lecture was great.

2243
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,520
And that should come out.

2244
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,320
It really was.

2245
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,440
It really was good.

2246
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:37,840
Yeah.

2247
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:41,120
I mean, again, I can't judge because my lecture's not out.

2248
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,080
Well, so.

2249
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,120
I can judge.

2250
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,040
You can, and Tom can.

2251
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:45,840
You guys can.

2252
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:46,080
Flex.

2253
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,400
For sure.

2254
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:46,880
Flex.

2255
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,360
We, you know, we really do need Road to Radcon 5 though.

2256
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:58,400
And, and then the Dojin and then the, and I think that's like it, right?

2257
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,040
That would.

2258
02:00:59,040 --> 02:00:59,280
Yeah.

2259
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:05,920
After the, the Brad lecture and the music video, the OVA, the Dojin and the Digi's.

2260
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:07,440
That's it.

2261
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,000
Just like, just lots of stuff, you know.

2262
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,960
I mean, Digi wrote the Road to Radcons.

2263
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:16,400
She, she wrote them in like less than a day.

2264
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:16,960
Yeah.

2265
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:21,440
Like she just like, she just like blasted those chapters out like, like in no time.

2266
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:27,520
So like, yeah, you know, uh, I feel like, uh, I don't know.

2267
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:32,000
I feel like she could be gotten to sit down and do it.

2268
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
We would just have to get her at like the, at a time when she was like.

2269
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,320
Go to, go to digi.com and say, please Road to Radcon 5 in the comments.

2270
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:42,720
Right.

2271
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:51,280
Uh, and then yeah, we didn't, we, we, we, I think we tried at one point to decide like,

2272
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:54,080
okay, who's going to write the story of the Dojin?

2273
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,120
Who's going to decide what it is?

2274
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:56,240
What is the story going to be?

2275
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:57,200
Who's going to script it?

2276
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,320
Uh, and we like never came to any conclusions about it.

2277
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:05,040
It's like, how do you, like, and then they fuck like, I don't want to write that.

2278
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:10,240
That's the dojin was not going to be like, uh, anti.

2279
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,120
We, yeah.

2280
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:15,040
It's going to be a little, a little itchy, you know.

2281
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:15,360
Yeah.

2282
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:17,680
Very good.

2283
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:19,040
Wait.

2284
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:21,040
Okay.

2285
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,480
I'm brainstorming this.

2286
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:30,640
The dojin should be, the dojin should be about how we all became girls for Road to,

2287
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:31,360
for Radcon.

2288
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:34,480
Like that should be the, it should be the, the gap.

2289
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:35,680
Wait.

2290
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,080
Oh yeah.

2291
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:39,360
Did I just, did the girl, do, do people even know about the girl thing?

2292
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:40,640
I don't think so.

2293
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:44,800
Well, no, no, no, no, no, we have the calendars out.

2294
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:45,040
Yeah.

2295
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,680
The calendar, we have the behind the scene videos.

2296
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,720
Is the calendar out?

2297
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:49,600
Yeah.

2298
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:51,280
It was shipped in the rewards.

2299
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:51,760
Okay.

2300
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:52,080
Okay.

2301
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,200
It was shipped in the reward.

2302
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:53,680
Wait.

2303
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:57,280
So was it shipped in the rewards with like no context as to like what?

2304
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:57,920
Correct.

2305
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,560
Correct.

2306
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,000
Correct.

2307
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,240
And only the backers know about it.

2308
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,040
Correct.

2309
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,440
So only the backers know about any of that.

2310
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,560
We spoiled that for the majority of people listening to this podcast.

2311
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:13,280
I'm pretty sure in the original Kickstarter promotional video, that was part of the thing.

2312
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,600
Like we're going to be anime girls.

2313
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:18,160
You can get a calendar of us being anime girls.

2314
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:19,200
No one's seen it.

2315
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:22,960
Nobody knows, except for like the small glimpses in that one blog.

2316
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:23,840
That's so god.

2317
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,880
It's so stupid.

2318
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,960
Remember when we were on the beach for an entire day dressed like that?

2319
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:31,360
Recorded.

2320
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:31,920
Yeah, it was great.

2321
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,560
Yeah.

2322
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,080
I was very attacked us.

2323
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:34,320
Yeah.

2324
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,840
A fucking dog.

2325
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,520
I fucked that dog.

2326
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,440
Piece of shit.

2327
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:43,440
Well, it wasn't the dog, it was the owner who just wouldn't wrangle it.

2328
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:43,920
Well, both.

2329
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,200
Well, yeah, I mean both.

2330
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:48,880
Like fuck the dog and fuck the owner for not fucking taking responsibility.

2331
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,520
But whatever.

2332
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:59,040
Okay, well, that's my pitch for, that's my pitch for the dojin.

2333
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,200
Who wants to draw it?

2334
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,840
Email us.

2335
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,480
Don't actually, we'll email you.

2336
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:08,480
We won't actually.

2337
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,320
Fill in the comments if you will do work for free and then I'll be like,

2338
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,080
Oh, that person does work for free.

2339
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:18,560
No, no, no, we'll pay someone.

2340
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,160
We'll pay someone, which means that if you're listening to this, you're not qualified.

2341
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:26,080
Next, next voicemail.

2342
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,040
Tom King's Mr. Miracle.

2343
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,520
Three, two, one, wait, three, two, one, go.

2344
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:37,760
I meant Tom King's run of Mr. Miracle.

2345
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,040
It's on six issues long.

2346
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,120
It's poetic.

2347
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:43,360
It has great, it's beautiful.

2348
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:52,880
And Big Bada, not a kuma, I don't come to comic books, but she is a beautiful little piece of

2349
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,360
that.

2350
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:55,200
She's tall, she's thin.

2351
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,680
They draw her beautifully.

2352
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:00,640
No, she just looks like any other woman.

2353
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,000
It's good.

2354
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:03,440
No, shut up.

2355
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:05,680
Shut up about what's her name.

2356
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:07,120
You're wrong.

2357
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:08,080
You're wrong about that.

2358
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:13,200
But if it's only six issues, that kind of makes me

2359
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,920
think that maybe it would be worth reading.

2360
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,280
Okay, I'll consider it.

2361
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:17,920
I heard you think about this.

2362
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:19,360
So, Tom King's.

2363
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:23,040
Yeah, we got a voicemail last week about, I think it was the same guy.

2364
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:34,720
That unmistakable, that unmistakable Hispanic drawl about Tom King's Mr. Miracle.

2365
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,400
Is this Tom King's Mr. Miracle?

2366
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,760
Because this is a character that's been drawn by other people.

2367
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:44,960
Yeah, yeah, it's a run by Tom King.

2368
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:49,120
Okay, this might be what it looks like then, because I just googled that.

2369
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,040
Let's check it out.

2370
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:56,160
I'll fucking check it out.

2371
02:05:57,200 --> 02:06:00,720
Next one is called Cowpoke Slim.

2372
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:02,480
Three, two, one, go.

2373
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,360
Howdy, y'all.

2374
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:07,280
It's me, The Cow.

2375
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,160
Mario.

2376
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:12,960
I just wanted to call in to thank old Gib here for helping me round up them dusty old cows

2377
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,880
in the dusty old Wild West.

2378
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,160
Y'all was a big old help.

2379
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:19,440
Is my trusty lasso that I loaned you holding up?

2380
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:22,080
I might need her back soon, so make sure she's in good shape.

2381
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:25,760
Well, it's time for me to go down to the old water and hole.

2382
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:27,760
So, as they say in old me humland,

2383
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:30,000
Sayonari, old canary.

2384
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,840
I did that.

2385
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:34,880
I must have been drunk.

2386
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,320
Uh, uh, yep.

2387
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:39,920
Something.

2388
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,520
It's a new character.

2389
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,480
Oh, it's the start of a new arc, a whole new arc.

2390
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,080
Oh, it's going to be span months.

2391
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:47,360
Oh, wait, I get it.

2392
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,880
Connect to all the others.

2393
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:52,320
The samurai was like, please give back scroll.

2394
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:53,840
This guy is Cowpoke Slim.

2395
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:56,480
Please give back lasso to Gib.

2396
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,160
Oh, no, it begins again.

2397
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:01,680
Gib, you lost Cowpoke Slim's prize lasso.

2398
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:04,480
How is he going to wrangle his herds?

2399
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,200
How's he going to wrangle his doggies?

2400
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,440
How's he going to commit suicide?

2401
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:10,960
But I misplaced it.

2402
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:16,240
How's he going to commit suicide so Samurai Sama can resurrect him with the necronomicon?

2403
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:19,120
How's the plot going to happen if something isn't going to happen?

2404
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:22,480
How's the plot going to happen if you were introducing conflict?

2405
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,280
You moron.

2406
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:29,920
Next one is called bring back wonderbread guy.

2407
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,560
Three, two, one, go.

2408
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:36,080
Man, fuck these guys who shit on wonderbread guy.

2409
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,200
He was the best.

2410
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:39,920
The critics, they're all like, wonderbread guy.

2411
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,600
He's a Nazi and he has weird conspiracy theory ideas.

2412
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:45,520
Well, you shut the fuck up.

2413
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:46,480
That's not the point.

2414
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,680
And it doesn't even matter.

2415
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:48,240
I agree that's not the point.

2416
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:51,600
When he was telling his story about losing his virginity or whatever,

2417
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:54,480
and you had to ask your questions repeatedly because he just,

2418
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:56,080
he wouldn't answer them directly.

2419
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:59,600
And his story was just so long and unnecessarily convoluted.

2420
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,400
Does the funnest that I've heard is funnest for a long time?

2421
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,200
It was funny.

2422
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:08,080
I was literally laughing at loud and about his weird ideas.

2423
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:11,200
Even though I disagree on them, I still find it funny to listen to.

2424
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,320
Okay, bye.

2425
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,120
No, I agree.

2426
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:13,680
No, I agree.

2427
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:15,280
I think he was funny to have as a guest,

2428
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:17,440
even though he's annoying as a person.

2429
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:17,840
Lamal.

2430
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,280
No, I want 100% on board with this.

2431
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:23,440
Well, I'm bringing him back.

2432
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,560
Well, no, not on that.

2433
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,760
I wouldn't go that far.

2434
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,440
That's the title of the voicemail.

2435
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:30,640
On board with it.

2436
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,280
Good voicemail.

2437
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:31,920
Good voicemail.

2438
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:35,680
Next one is called Keraskoet.

2439
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,600
Satania, especially.

2440
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,280
I don't know what that means.

2441
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:40,000
Okay.

2442
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,520
Three, two, one, go.

2443
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:43,840
Another comic book recommendation.

2444
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,400
Anything by this French couple called Keraskoet.

2445
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:50,400
They made these very dark stories with beautiful art.

2446
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:50,720
Okay.

2447
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:53,040
And it's a very fresh read and very good.

2448
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,640
I appreciate these comic recommendations.

2449
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,640
I've never heard of Keraskoet or Satania.

2450
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,360
That's French.

2451
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:02,240
French comics.

2452
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,920
There's a huge comic scene in France.

2453
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:05,360
Look at this.

2454
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:06,160
Look at this one.

2455
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:08,880
This is much better than Mr. Mama Luigi.

2456
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:11,040
Mr. Mama Luigi.

2457
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:13,680
Oh, that's interesting.

2458
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:16,080
It does look pretty French.

2459
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:21,040
Yes, it's like hell, just like France.

2460
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,000
Just like France.

2461
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,120
Yeah, exactly.

2462
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:23,360
Yeah.

2463
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,440
Ah.

2464
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,040
It's a great life drawing they do there.

2465
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:32,560
Next voicemail is called Frendle Babin.

2466
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:34,400
Three, two, one, go.

2467
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,880
Hey, PCP.

2468
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:38,560
Have you ever listened to Coast to Coast?

2469
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:43,440
Specifically when George Nore is broadcasting.

2470
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,080
You know, it's a show about the paranormal.

2471
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:50,480
So a bunch of people who are way out there calling.

2472
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:53,520
And George Nore, he's like a real hero.

2473
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,680
He just like, he keeps them talking.

2474
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:59,280
He keeps a narrative line.

2475
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,200
And like, what I'm saying is I'm seeing a parallel

2476
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:05,680
to how you guys have been recently.

2477
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,880
So like, what do you call it?

2478
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,920
Like, this is feedback and recommendation.

2479
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:12,480
I don't know.

2480
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:14,800
Just keep getting weird people on.

2481
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:15,600
It's great.

2482
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:16,000
Thank you.

2483
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,400
Anyway, you have a wonderful 2021.

2484
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:19,600
Peace out.

2485
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,160
I sure hope we do.

2486
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,760
I've never listened to Coast to Coast.

2487
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:25,760
I've heard about it a little.

2488
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:28,480
Thanks.

2489
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,440
Thanks for watching.

2490
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,040
A game theory.

2491
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,240
Glad you like the guests.

2492
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:36,800
Fuck you.

2493
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,560
Coaster Coast is like a coast but made out of coasters.

2494
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:45,360
Instead of sand.

2495
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:46,800
Oh, a coaster coaster.

2496
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,480
Oh, yeah.

2497
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,680
Just fuck me in the ass.

2498
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,560
Next one is called Gibb.

2499
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:58,400
Where's the Lude Twitter account?

2500
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,000
Three, two, one, go.

2501
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,560
Gibb, where's the Lude Twitter account?

2502
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:02,880
Wow.

2503
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:05,680
There it is.

2504
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:06,320
Straight to the point.

2505
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:07,200
I can appreciate that.

2506
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,080
I wish every voicemail were five seconds.

2507
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,680
It's out there on the Twitter.

2508
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:17,600
I feel like not, I don't want to promote it

2509
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:20,160
just because it doesn't have a lot of good stuff on there yet.

2510
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:23,360
It's just a lot of sketches and little bits here and there.

2511
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,760
But it's called, let me find it just because she cares.

2512
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:28,640
It's the PCP.

2513
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,480
You can say whatever you want on this show.

2514
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:30,960
That's true.

2515
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:32,080
That's true.

2516
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:33,360
What's it called?

2517
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:34,320
What's it called?

2518
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,080
Big, at Big Girl Squish.

2519
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:37,920
Big Girl Squish.

2520
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:38,880
Big Girl Squish.

2521
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,920
You can find out what I've drawn.

2522
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:43,680
Find out all the secrets.

2523
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:47,760
You can find out how to have sex.

2524
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,200
Oh, no.

2525
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,880
We don't show that on screen.

2526
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,760
You can finally figure it out.

2527
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,280
The secret knowledge.

2528
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:58,160
Okay.

2529
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:02,560
Next one is called Max Patrick Aylward-Nesbitt.

2530
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,880
Three, two, one, go.

2531
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:06,720
God, it's a minute 30.

2532
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:12,480
Hello, pre-crastinators P and audience.

2533
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:18,240
I've sent this voicemail over electronic mail to plead your wisdom on matters of

2534
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,320
high importance and philosophy.

2535
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:25,760
Furthermore, I wish to bring to the floor a motion on the discussion of the subject thusly.

2536
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,920
Mr. Nesbitt, this is a library.

2537
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:36,560
On the floor is to consider the limitations of what is heterosexual and what is otherwise.

2538
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,840
Or gay.

2539
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:48,160
It is it gay for a cisgendered man to be in sexual relations with a transgendered female person?

2540
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:52,320
What about when it's a cisgendered woman?

2541
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:55,680
All this theater in service of a fucking lame question.

2542
02:12:55,680 --> 02:13:01,280
How gay is it when a person looks on a transgendered person of the opposite gender?

2543
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:02,080
Who cares?

2544
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:03,440
Shut up.

2545
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,400
No, stop it.

2546
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,120
No, I'm done.

2547
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:06,320
No, good try.

2548
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:07,440
Whatever.

2549
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:09,600
It's a very stupid take.

2550
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:10,080
Who cares?

2551
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:11,440
You should think about it a little bit.

2552
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:16,000
Just think about it a little bit and just the obvious answers are the answers.

2553
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,280
Just it doesn't matter.

2554
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:18,080
Oh my god.

2555
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:18,720
I'm annoyed.

2556
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:22,960
I was actually I'm annoyed because I was a little excited because I was like, oh, he's

2557
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,000
gonna like do a thing.

2558
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,440
Oh, this guy is like a eccentric man.

2559
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:28,800
This guy put a little effort into this into this into this voicemail.

2560
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:31,680
A good, you know, he's gonna shoot a shot.

2561
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:33,120
Well, it should have known better.

2562
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:33,600
So good try.

2563
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:34,240
Good try.

2564
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:35,200
I know, I know.

2565
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:39,840
The next one is called Santa came down my chimney.

2566
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,080
So I came down Rudolph's throat.

2567
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:44,960
Three, two, one, go.

2568
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:56,000
I said I was sorry.

2569
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,920
I said I was sorry.

2570
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,360
You said I thought we were cool.

2571
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:12,000
Hey, guys, happy holidays from Cassidy.

2572
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:17,600
So out of curiosity, I went back and had a bit of a gander.

2573
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:22,320
This summer, I gimmick has been going on since August 15th.

2574
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:27,520
And I think that Ben deserves like an eternity credit in the world for playing

2575
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:30,720
along with it for these fucking four months.

2576
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,280
Good on you.

2577
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,520
Feels like yes, did you?

2578
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:38,720
Because of you, I was able to confront my own issues with gender this year.

2579
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:45,200
It's been a crazy butterfly effect from watching somebody with an unkempt beard

2580
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:49,440
like mine giving a lecture on Maddox to looking in the mirror today.

2581
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:55,040
And I just wanted to let you know that you helped change my life for the better this year.

2582
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:56,240
Thank you.

2583
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:59,040
But did you do next time?

2584
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,240
I say one more.

2585
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,000
Did you will never hear this voicemail, Lamal?

2586
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:08,480
I'll personally see to it.

2587
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:11,200
I'm never ready for a sincerity in these voicemails.

2588
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:12,960
It always takes me a back.

2589
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,960
I'm like, oh, God, cringe.

2590
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:15,680
I know, right?

2591
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:19,200
Just waiting for the other shoe to drop the whole time.

2592
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,280
Just like, this can't be real, this can't be real.

2593
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:30,000
In order to express even a moment's genuine sentiment,

2594
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,320
you have to run a four month long character arc.

2595
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,520
Ah, right, right, right.

2596
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:38,080
That's the toll you got to pay.

2597
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,520
Yeah, whatever.

2598
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:47,120
Glad you're a fucking girl now or whatever you have fucking nerd.

2599
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:52,480
Okay, next one is called Funny Joke.

2600
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,080
Three, two, one, go.

2601
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:58,880
PCP, more like HRT.

2602
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:04,400
Okay, I thought I thought he was gonna go HIV, but that's fine too.

2603
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:07,360
Tomato, tomato.

2604
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,520
The huge

2605
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:15,840
reps, I can't think of it.

2606
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:21,520
I can't think of a PCP HRT turning that into words

2607
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:23,440
that is not hormone replacement therapy.

2608
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,480
That rhymes with PCP, procrastinators, whatever.

2609
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:29,840
Shut up, shut up, move on.

2610
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:34,080
Welcome to the next episode of this exciting episode

2611
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:37,280
of the Hormone Replacement Therapy Project.

2612
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,400
It's hypnosis.

2613
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:49,120
You listen and we hypnotize you to make your butt look bigger.

2614
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,200
You know, like a girl has a big butt, you know?

2615
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,760
You know what I'm talking about.

2616
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,800
Ellie is our cut this part.

2617
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,040
No, no, no, no, refurb this part.

2618
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,680
Okay, all right, shut the fuck up.

2619
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:12,320
Next one is called GCCX on Cardfreck.

2620
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,560
Three, two, one, go.

2621
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:17,680
If y'all were anyone listening last week, thought,

2622
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:19,520
hey, yeah, Game Center CX sounds cool.

2623
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:22,240
I want to watch it and don't feel like torrenting.

2624
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,520
You can always watch it on Twitch.

2625
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:28,480
There's a 24 seven Twitch stream on twitch.tv slash cardfreck.

2626
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:32,480
So if you want to watch an episode of Game Center CX

2627
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:34,960
and don't particularly care what games being played,

2628
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:36,960
you can just go watch it there anytime.

2629
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:41,520
This is, of course, assuming Twitch doesn't just obliterate it

2630
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:43,440
due to all the DMCA shit they've been doing.

2631
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:45,040
But hey, for now, it's good.

2632
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:52,240
Interesting. Game Center CX being the show that Tectonic Improv

2633
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:57,280
did the retrospective on that got taken off YouTube for bullshit reasons.

2634
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,680
I love modern internet.

2635
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:00,400
It's so good.

2636
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:05,120
It's so good.

2637
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:08,240
I just love saying yes to cookie popups.

2638
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:12,800
I still haven't gotten a single cookie,

2639
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,480
just by clicking all those fucking things.

2640
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:18,960
A 24 hour stream.

2641
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:26,160
I think I feel like I really would like a Game Center CX

2642
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,160
if it were in English, because that would mean that I could just

2643
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:34,800
kind of have it on and sort of not pay that much attention to it.

2644
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,320
Just kind of watch it passively.

2645
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:38,560
But the fact that it's subtitles

2646
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:41,360
mean that I would have to watch it actively and be reading,

2647
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:44,880
and I just don't know if that's the experience I want to have with it.

2648
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:49,040
It's funny you mentioned the subtitles thing,

2649
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,840
because one of the really jarring things that's happened to me

2650
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:55,360
in the last couple weeks, it started with playing Ghost of Tsushima,

2651
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:58,080
because you can play it in English or Japanese with subtitles,

2652
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:00,080
is I've decided that I hate subtitles.

2653
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:02,080
I don't know why it took me so long to figure this out,

2654
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:05,760
but I'm just so sick of having to read

2655
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,640
while all those gorgeous animation happens,

2656
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:12,480
and I'm ignoring the actual visuals of this visual medium,

2657
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:14,880
and I'm really just like, I really need to just learn Japanese.

2658
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:17,440
I'm so sick of missing all the good stuff that happens in anime,

2659
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,760
because I'm too busy looking at the words

2660
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:22,960
and not paying attention to the animation that people slaved over making.

2661
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,720
This never used to bother me,

2662
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:27,680
but now it's just like it's enraging.

2663
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,920
Dubs are bad because they sound terrible,

2664
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,880
and subs are bad because I can't watch anything anymore,

2665
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:36,640
and I'm just like, no, the only answer is to become the ultimate weeb

2666
02:19:36,640 --> 02:19:37,600
and learn Japanese.

2667
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:46,160
I have never once felt that feeling that you just described ever.

2668
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:48,640
I feel like I've had that feeling.

2669
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,800
I don't think I've ever thought to act on it.

2670
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,800
It's just been like, damn, I didn't really pay attention

2671
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,480
to what they were doing there because I was reading.

2672
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:59,120
Damn, well, I can't be bothered to go back.

2673
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:00,720
Drives me crazy.

2674
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:02,720
Yeah, well, I don't think I've ever been like,

2675
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:07,440
I didn't appreciate the gorgeous visuals because I was reading.

2676
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:09,200
It's like, nah, I get the picture.

2677
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:18,480
I understand the gist of what I saw without carefully examining it or whatever.

2678
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:19,680
I don't want the gist.

2679
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:21,040
I want to see the whole thing.

2680
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:26,000
The point of, I don't know, in a film, if there's a really beautiful shot,

2681
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:32,560
like, I don't need to be, I don't know, I can get the impression

2682
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:39,440
that the shot is meant to give me even while my eye is kind of directed down at the subtitle.

2683
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:41,920
It's just like, it's not even like a legitimate concern.

2684
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:44,320
It's just one of those things that I just like realized was happening

2685
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:48,880
and now I just have like this weird autistic fixation on it and it makes me really angry.

2686
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:57,760
I just, it's the same with, I would probably re-watch

2687
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:01,920
Monben a bunch more.

2688
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:08,400
I've probably watched the whole series like twice, which is a lot for me because with subtitles.

2689
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:12,960
If it were not subtitled, if it were in English and I didn't have to read for it.

2690
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:17,440
Right, we'd be cool if you could just tab over and just continue to absorb that.

2691
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:20,720
Yeah, I probably would have watched it like a dozen times.

2692
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:22,480
That's how much I love it.

2693
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:25,600
Yeah, I feel like similarly about...

2694
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:28,240
Think of all the Japanese podcasts you could listen to.

2695
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,400
Like a whole world would open up.

2696
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:36,640
I think there might, I think there might be one or two Monben's that I have not,

2697
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:40,320
that are like newly translated that I have not seen actually.

2698
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:41,200
I should check on that.

2699
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:47,280
They're like hard to find and keep track of because I think it's just like one guy somewhere

2700
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:49,760
who is doing the subbing of them and like...

2701
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:50,560
What a champion.

2702
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:53,200
Yeah, I don't know why he does it.

2703
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:58,640
Like I don't know, I don't know what he gets out of it, but I'm thankful for his work.

2704
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:01,920
Pretty cool, yeah.

2705
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:05,280
Well, shit, that's the last voicemail.

2706
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:07,120
Thank God.

2707
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,520
Yeah, we did it.

2708
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:11,200
We made it to the end.

2709
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:13,280
Made it to the top of the mountain.

2710
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:24,720
Well, any final thoughts before we sign out till next time?

2711
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:27,200
Wait, I have one thing, I do have one thing.

2712
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:35,440
Because this episode, this episode will be coming out on Christmas, on Friday.

2713
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:36,880
Oh, one mile.

2714
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:40,000
So I'm going to post this in the chat.

2715
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,360
It's time stamped.

2716
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:50,080
Okay, the song, last year, the YouTuber called Tom, No Relation, sent in a voicemail

2717
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:55,120
and we listened to it around Christmas time and it's been taken down.

2718
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,280
You know the song I'm talking about?

2719
02:22:58,480 --> 02:22:59,040
I do not.

2720
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:00,480
I don't really know.

2721
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:04,240
Well, I mean, I want us to listen to it.

2722
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:07,920
Oh, I remember this.

2723
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:10,640
Should I count down?

2724
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:11,840
The Hatsune Miku.

2725
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:13,280
So, oh, I already pressed play.

2726
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:14,320
Oh, right.

2727
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:14,880
Yeah, I remember this.

2728
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:17,760
Okay, well, I'm going to count down three, two, one, go.

2729
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:31,760
I think it wouldn't be a PCP Christmas without listening to it again.

2730
02:23:41,040 --> 02:24:00,800
This is the only version of a song that exists anymore because it was removed from Tom's channel

2731
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,600
for bullying and harassment of me.

2732
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:06,160
No, I remember that.

2733
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:08,000
I remember you saying that.

2734
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:15,680
It's tragic and I tweeted at YouTube saying,

2735
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:16,880
I like to be bullied.

2736
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:18,320
Please let them bully me.

2737
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:19,440
And they didn't answer.

2738
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:47,840
This is a masterpiece.

2739
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:49,440
It's so fucking good.

2740
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,040
Oh, my God.

2741
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,440
This is the whole song.

2742
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:38,800
It's the whole song.

2743
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,800
Oh, it just keeps going.

2744
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:44,800
The extra level is just off the charts.

2745
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:53,200
If you want to hear the song again now,

2746
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:56,160
you have to hear it with Nate laughing in the background.

2747
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:58,080
It doesn't have something to it to prepare.

2748
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,560
It does.

2749
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:30,960
Yes, yes.

2750
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:46,720
I've killed Digi.

2751
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,000
I've killed Nate.

2752
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:48,960
I've killed Mage.

2753
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:51,600
Killed Jesse.

2754
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:53,600
You're the only two left.

2755
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:55,040
Right.

2756
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,360
I was just procrastinating on killing Ben Sane.

2757
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,520
Soon it'll be me.

2758
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:08,800
More, more, more, more.

2759
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:10,480
I can't get enough.

2760
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:14,080
All right, we're fading the hat.

2761
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:14,400
Okay.

2762
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:19,760
There it is.

2763
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:20,240
There it is.

2764
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:21,520
Wait, Tom.

2765
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:21,920
Okay.

2766
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,400
Why was that?

2767
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:22,720
There it is.

2768
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,560
Shut up, procrastinators from the past.

2769
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:25,360
I don't want to hear you.

2770
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:27,440
Past, procrastinators.

2771
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:29,120
The pro-pastinators.

2772
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:30,240
Get them out of here.

2773
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:35,840
Merry fucking Christmas, everyone.

2774
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:38,400
Merry Christmas, Tom, other Tom.

2775
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:39,920
Tom, who made the song.

2776
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:41,040
Not this Tom, this guy.

2777
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:43,440
That guy actually made something, you know?

2778
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:49,120
Merry Christmas for everyone.

2779
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:52,320
God bless us.

2780
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,440
Everyone.

2781
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,200
That's the one.

2782
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:59,440
Good, good night, and God speed you, you black emperor.

2783
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:00,480
Sweet dreams.

2784
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:03,840
Good, see you next, see you in 20, fucking 21.

2785
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:07,360
Before we wrap up, it's Christmas.

2786
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:08,560
It's the season of giving.

2787
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:11,440
So if you would like to give to us on this holiday,

2788
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:14,320
patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2789
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:15,040
That's right.

2790
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:18,480
And donate $5 a month where we can give gifts to you

2791
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:21,280
in terms of multiple bonus episodes.

2792
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,640
All of middling quality, some that are actually even

2793
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:25,360
kind of good.

2794
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:28,960
The latest one.

2795
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,800
I don't know if it's uploaded yet.

2796
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,560
It might not be, but soon.

2797
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:36,720
You can hear me get fucking salty and just bitch about everyone.

2798
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:39,520
So just like this episode and every other one.

2799
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,200
Yeah, but even more.

2800
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:42,720
No, it was like vicious.

2801
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:44,160
Ben St. Unleashed.

2802
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,360
That's the bonus episode.

2803
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:46,160
Oh, God.

2804
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,760
It was too hot.

2805
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,520
It was too hot for YouTube.

2806
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,120
So it's in secret YouTube.

2807
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,080
Uh, that's the trick.

2808
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:02,080
And send us a voicemail at speakpipe.com slash pzp voicemail.

2809
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:06,000
If you think you can do better than these fucking hacks this week.

2810
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,600
A low bar to clear.

2811
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:10,240
You can do it.

2812
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:10,960
I believe in you.

2813
02:29:12,960 --> 02:29:13,600
Anything else?

2814
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:15,760
Are we done?

2815
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,320
No.

2816
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:16,480
No.

2817
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:18,160
Never.

2818
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:18,720
Never.

2819
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:22,640
Not Merry Christmas.

2820
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:24,720
Very Christmas holiday.

2821
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:27,680
Very, very Hanukkah everypony.

2822
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,720
Good.

2823
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:30,800
Happy Hearth Swarming Eve.

2824
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:32,560
Happy Hearth Swarming Eve.

2825
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:35,040
Ah, a unicorn power.

2826
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:36,240
Dab, dab, dab.

2827
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:45,200
Earth's power, I guess.
