1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
My volumetric intake is high and my volumetric output is low.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500
This is a calorie-rich environment for Mike Swimming.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
For Mike Swimming?

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Yeah, for Mike Swimming, the best swimmer in the world.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Mike Swimmer.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Mike Swimmer and Johnny just...

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
He's a Pokemon trainer too.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Yeah.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,500
He has a... he has a Ramareya raid.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,500
He's one of those weirdos who's got like a waterproof thing on his Pokemon Go phone.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Yeah.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,500
He goes kayaking into buildings.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Into underwater buildings.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
He crashes into them and he totals his boat.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,500
He has a... a subnautical kayak.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
With a little dome, he goes...

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
He just... he just has like a little like...

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
He just goes kayaking in like a deep sea dive or like a bell helmet.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Yes.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
I mean he just... like he has the little paddle and he's just like... he's just like spinning it.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,500
The way it works is like his... the sides of his kayak have little like him waterproof glove compartments

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
that you can put your hand in so he can move his arms around like a spaceman.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
You feel like after all this important thing that he's like modded into his kayak,

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
he might as well just get out of the kayak and dive.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Wait, like... like that he's in the kayak.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Like the kayak is around his torso and like his little legs are sticking out the bottom

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
and he's just walking around in like this kayak.

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
They're like... no, no.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Okay.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Like he kayaks out to the sea.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Yeah.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
And then... but then when he gets there, you know, he like puts on his helmet and like he goes into deep sea mode

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
and he just sticks his... sticks his feet through the bottom of the kayak

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
and then just like seals himself shut and just... just submerges.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
So I can feel the purpose of crashing into underwater ruins.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,500
What I... I assume you were going to say was he kayaks down and then he gets out of his kayak

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,500
in his underwater suit and then the kayak just floats to the top because it's got air in it.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
It just leaves him behind.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
How's he gonna get out of this situation?

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
He can't swim.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
He's just gonna... he's just gonna put that to the front of his kayak through like the storefront

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
of like an old civilization.

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
The ancient Mayan burger place.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Exactly.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Oh, fucking Dave Kayak, you're so interesting.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Dave Kayak and Mike Swimmer.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Twin... twin emperors of New Mexico, Canada.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Very nice.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
We will always remember you.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
He left us to his suit in the kayak wars of 1983.

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Wait, wait, it was... it was Mike Swimmer. Who was Kayak?

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Oh, Dave Kayak.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Yeah, Dave Kayak.

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
That's the fusion. The fusion is Mike Kayak.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:18,500
He died... he died the way he lived, ramming his kayak into an underwater ruin.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
What an asshole, dude.

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Yep, he really fucked it.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Okay, let's just play the fucking video game now.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Hello, welcome to the second and best rowdy fuckers cop killers, the movie starring me, Ben Sainte, and...

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
And Munchy.

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
And my nemesis Munchy, he's here.

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
He's here and he's larger than life.

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh, Ben Sainte, I didn't destroy you last time, but I'm here to finish the job.

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I have my guns, I have my grenades, I have all the things that you are weak to.

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Those are not allowed in a Pokemon battle.

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Oh, no, it's you.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
It's Hippo.

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
And you're here.

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'm the rulesman.

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm here to make sure it's a fair fight.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Hippo's here to adjudicate our grudge match.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
I didn't prepare for this. Oh, no.

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Who lives and who dies.

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
We're gonna settle this once and for all, Munchy.

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
It's been a long time coming.

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
You had free reign over this place for far too long.

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm gonna fucking collar you and shackle you.

78
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I'm gonna put you in the stocks in the front of town of our Old West town.

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You're gonna fucking chain me underwater.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm just gonna have to burn there.

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Yeah, anyway.

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Paradoxically, because I'm underwater.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
And I can't burn, but...

84
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
It's not gonna be pretty.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
And the way I'm gonna do this to you is by utterly defeating you

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
in a series of Pokemon battles that we have decided upon.

87
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
That was my one weakness.

88
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I thought that your weakness was guns, but I guess it was just video games.

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm weak to guns and strong to Pokemon.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
So since you started this fight, since you picked this fight,

91
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I get to choose my weapon and it's Pokemon.

92
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,500
But actually, you're probably a lot better at Pokemon battling than me

93
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
because I've never fucking done this before.

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I have never built a team or fought another human being.

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
My first Pokemon is Pokemon Goo.

96
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Pokemon Goo?

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Alright, the fan favorite of...

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Let's go.

99
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Alright, so the way it's gonna work is me and Munchy are gonna have three...

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,500
We're gonna have three sets of best out of three.

101
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
We're gonna fight with teams that we've...

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I mean, I have painstakingly put this team together.

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I have done research and crunched numbers and made spreadsheets

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
and the fruits of my labor.

105
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I wish I was kidding.

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
The fruits of my labor are here

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
and we're gonna compete in the three different tiers.

108
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Little Cup is gonna be first and Little Cup is for unevolved Pokemon.

109
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
It's for the weak bitches.

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
And then...

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm gonna get you good for that one.

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm gonna steam now. You activated my gamer rage.

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I'm like that caterpillar in Mario that turns red.

114
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
You just stomped on me and now I'm red and I'm invincible.

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You're fucked.

116
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Okay, and then second is the underused tier for the pretty good kind of good Pokemon.

117
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
And then third is the ultimate championship, the overused tier, OU,

118
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
for the real super strong boys.

119
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Not the strongest Uber tier.

120
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Way too good for any reasonable battling tier.

121
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,500
But like the soap, the good enough, but not quite overpowered tier.

122
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
That's how it works for anyone that doesn't know about Pokemon.

123
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Like I didn't like 3D.

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I've also made myself a blanket of nails.

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I will wrap around my body right now

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
and I will always have this on the entire time I play to improve my stimuli.

127
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Is that gonna be like your held item as a Pokemon?

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Like a nailed blanket?

129
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Increases your Pokemon's suffering by 100%?

130
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Well, see, relevant to nails, you know how you have the Benz Saint drink?

131
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
I decided to make my own drink.

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
And it's called the Munchie.

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It's comprised of tic-tacs and nails.

134
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
And I blend them together and then I just drink it.

135
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
That wasn't the way there was a Benz Saint drink.

136
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,500
The Benz Saint is hot coffee.

137
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Hot coffee and chocolate protein.

138
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Oh yeah.

139
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,500
And you're tears because you're gonna cry once I'm done pummeling you with my fuck you.

140
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm gonna kill you Munchie.

141
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm not talking about this fight.

142
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm not talking about Pokemon.

143
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm going to come to your house and murder you.

144
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll be waiting.

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
But let's not worry about that.

146
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Yeah, alright.

147
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Open the damn game so I can look at something.

148
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Yeah, let's get it started.

149
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
So, let's have a look.

150
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,500
So Benz Saint, we got Porygon, we got Abro.

151
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
We got some little guy from Dragon Quest.

152
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
It's a mole from Dragon Quest.

153
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
It's Drillber, dude.

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
And we got Red Robin, Red Breast.

155
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
And that guy from an anime.

156
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
It's the monster from Undertale.

157
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
It is, it's the Undertale kid.

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,500
And we got a Kakun with spikes.

159
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
And on the other side we have...

160
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Kakuna with spikes.

161
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
We have Munchie, he's a clown.

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
We got another Red Robin, we got another little kid.

163
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
We got Star Yu, that's the one.

164
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
We got Munchlax, which is his spirit animal.

165
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,500
We got a Kakun egg with spikes and a sword.

166
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I'm gonna kill that sword.

167
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
They're all level 5.

168
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
You're not even gonna be able to fucking breathe.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Let the games begin.

170
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Alright.

171
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Now everyone knows that the entire battle is decided by who you send out first.

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
And everything else after that is just a formality.

173
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,500
So this is crucial, this is crucial here.

174
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Got it.

175
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Go, yellow bullet, mark two.

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
We both fucking protected each other.

177
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
We both knew we were gonna send out Farathorn.

178
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
You fucking bitch, you're not even cool dude.

179
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Yeah, well I thought you had two steel types, so I thought I'd send out a fighting... anyway.

180
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Yellow bullet, yeah right.

181
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Like you think you're cool.

182
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
You're no match for my Juggalo.

183
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
They're staring each other down.

184
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
That's the only one I remember from Pokemon Stadium.

185
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
That's the only one.

186
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
I was gonna do more.

187
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I think one of them is these Pokemon.

188
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Whoa, he used knockoff.

189
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
And the other guy used knockoff as well.

190
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
God, we're so evenly fighting a critical hit, so I'm winning.

191
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, it's true.

192
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
What's he gonna do?

193
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
What will he do?

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Oh my fucking god!

195
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I can't believe you went for that.

196
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Why was yellow bullet faster than the other guy?

197
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
The other guy is cause the name.

198
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Thank you.

199
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
It's a bullet speed.

200
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Thank you.

201
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
This bird, which one?

202
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Level 5.

203
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
What's he gonna do?

204
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,500
You know, I'm...

205
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
You're headband, what do you think I'm gonna do?

206
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
What do you think I'm gonna do, huh?

207
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
What do you think I'm gonna do?

208
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Oh, I can switch sides, yeah.

209
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I can't actually see what you're selecting or hogging over.

210
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I can switch.

211
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh god, I don't know.

212
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I just don't know.

213
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Alright.

214
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Egg bullet.

215
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Both of them are bullets.

216
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Egg bullet, go!

217
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
The iron barbs hurt little bird.

218
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
This little bird is very small.

219
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
He's got thin legs.

220
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Will he be able to actually, with the thin legs,

221
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
probably attack without getting hit by the spikes?

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Oh, you're such a fool, dude.

223
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
You're such a fool.

224
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
You turn.

225
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Dude, you don't even know who fucking brains are.

226
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Oh, I like that you're a clown.

227
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Do you see my little avatar?

228
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah, of course.

229
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
It's Munchie's mom's dildo.

230
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Paralyzed instantly.

231
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
What happened?

232
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Thunder wave.

233
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Why can this egg use thunder wave?

234
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
It's an egg.

235
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Look at his eyes.

236
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It's level 5.

237
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Look at the intensity of his eyes.

238
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
It's so stoned, dude.

239
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Um, fuck.

240
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Nah, fuck you, dude.

241
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Whatever.

242
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
That's stupid.

243
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Oh, he knocked off the item, which was something.

244
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Stealth Rock.

245
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I don't know anything about Pokémon.

246
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
The fuck is all of this?

247
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Dude, I had never heard of none of the moves I'm using

248
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
on any of my Pokémon

249
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I had ever heard of before this shit.

250
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
It's fake.

251
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
It's not real.

252
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
That's true.

253
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

254
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
So they're both...

255
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
They're always getting out of there.

256
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Come on, yellow bullet mark 2.

257
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Show them how to die.

258
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Always getting hurt quick and suddenly.

259
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
With bullets.

260
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
With bullets.

261
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Drain punch.

262
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh, he really drained that dildo

263
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
out of his action.

264
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
There's one ain't nothing.

265
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Dude, you ain't fucking...

266
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
You ain't even heard of my bitch.

267
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
It's gonna be you, dude.

268
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Whoa.

269
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Nice.

270
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Mmm.

271
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Mmm.

272
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Mmm.

273
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Carl's junior.

274
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Mmm.

275
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Whoa, Starry has a little thing on his leg.

276
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
On the back of his leg.

277
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I didn't know.

278
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I was entranced.

279
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
He's not psychic type.

280
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Yes, he is.

281
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
He's a psychic type.

282
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
He's junior.

283
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
You don't know shit.

284
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
That's true. Does he have a psychic move?

285
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Guys.

286
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
What am I gonna do?

287
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
What is he gonna do?

288
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm sure.

289
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
He's probably gonna use... wait, hang on.

290
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Let's check this.

291
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Psychic is ineffective against...

292
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Put away your dictionary, Ben.

293
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
This is a war.

294
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Dude, New World can't know.

295
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Can't know anything?

296
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Can't know.

297
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Good.

298
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Psychic is zero against...

299
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
What even is... oh, I can hover over the guy.

300
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
He's dark and fighting.

301
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
He doesn't look dark or fighting.

302
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
He looks like a little kid.

303
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Oh, rapid spin, of course.

304
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Who will I've been?

305
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
HB45% possible abilities.

306
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Da-da-da-da.

307
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
I could have been looking at information this whole time, but I didn't.

308
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
I know what you're gonna do.

309
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Oh, ah, shit.

310
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
It wasn't what I thought you'd do.

311
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
That's quite powerful.

312
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
This yellow bullet is punching like a...

313
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Storm punches...

314
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
An old lady.

315
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
When she couldn't get inside quick enough.

316
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Knockoff...

317
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
What kind of words you're saying?

318
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Knockoff deals double damage against enemies that are holding an item.

319
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
So...

320
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
That's why it did all that.

321
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Oh, you're done!

322
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I can't believe you're hitting all these.

323
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
That's not how that works.

324
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
What is the hit rate?

325
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
It's 90% hit rate.

326
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Man, this bird...

327
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I know, but that's not how that works.

328
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
How can this bird stand up to a fucking jumping slice with a foot?

329
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Speaking of jumping slice...

330
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
It's a sword.

331
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
It can slice him in half.

332
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
It gets you a bad idea.

333
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Because they can punch me and swords are weak to people who have bones.

334
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh, it's the little...

335
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
It's the mole of my hand.

336
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Dirt bullet! Attack!

337
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Oh, shit.

338
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Oh, I've made a terrible mistake.

339
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Yeah, you fucking retard.

340
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Didn't you know birds can really borrow on the ground?

341
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
They're more powerful against ground.

342
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Yeah, man.

343
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
That bird annihilated that mole.

344
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
He did.

345
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Just like real nature.

346
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
What a terrible mistake.

347
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
You're fucking done. You are done.

348
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
You are done.

349
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
You've made the last mistake in your life, mister.

350
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
That's not true.

351
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
It's not true.

352
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
You've made the last mistake you'll ever make.

353
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
If he's made the last mistake, that means everything he does now will be a good idea.

354
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Oh, no.

355
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I did it!

356
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I've... I...

357
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Well, you know, I'd like to pretend that I predicted that, but I didn't.

358
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
It's Friends General.

359
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
I can't believe this.

360
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
He's super effective.

361
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
What are all these things?

362
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
0.67 times speed,

363
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
1.5...

364
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Attack, 1.5 defense.

365
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
You're done, kid.

366
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
You're done. Use curse!

367
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
You just... you just sat on him.

368
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
That was also good.

369
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, here comes... here comes old yellow boy for backfraction.

370
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Flying kick.

371
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Attack.

372
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Yeah, you know exactly. That's exactly right.

373
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Ah, shit, I knew it.

374
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
I know. I know. I know. I know.

375
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Birds can't... can't withstand a drop kick.

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Especially small little babies.

377
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
You're so fast.

378
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
You're so fast.

379
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I can't even see his movements.

380
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Yeah, you do got this.

381
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Don't away.

382
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
I've got... I've got fucking bones inside here.

383
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
He brought a knife to a Pokemon fight.

384
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Yeah, that's what I thought.

385
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
That was the only thing I could do.

386
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Using knockoff is really good because you always want items.

387
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Knockoff is awesome.

388
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
I am fucked.

389
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
And the crowd goes...

390
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,500
And the crowd goes, uh, get on with it already.

391
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Hey, I'm trying to fucking figure out.

392
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
He hasn't even used his Porygon yet.

393
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
He could use all of those.

394
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
He didn't.

395
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Maybe he used it.

396
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Oh, this looks like it's...

397
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
It's over for Munchy.

398
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
His little friend going to be beaten to death with one of them.

399
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I can't believe you've hit Clyde at all of those.

400
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Uh, yeah.

401
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Well, it means 90%.

402
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Dude, do you know...

403
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how that works.

404
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,500
You don't know how many times people have died in these very chairs that we sit in.

405
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
One point for Ben.

406
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Bing!

407
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Are you in?

408
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Are you seeing my precious neon bullet?

409
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Neon bullet.

410
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Oh, the little leg's going this way and that way.

411
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Yeah, yeah, man.

412
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
He's kicking like pretend footballs, one after the other.

413
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
That's his intimidation strategy.

414
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Ah, shit.

415
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
So we're doing a rematch.

416
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Now we've got Porygon vs. A knife.

417
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Can physical...

418
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Can Japanese steel...

419
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
...steal slice a computer?

420
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Fold it a thousand times.

421
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I think I can...

422
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I can't slice a fucking program in that.

423
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I think I've seen this in an animal before.

424
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
You just gotta believe...

425
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Yeah, what else people got seizures?

426
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,500
If you mix circuit boards in with your Japanese folded steel, you can slice computer programs.

427
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
That's what I know.

428
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
That doesn't fucking matter.

429
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I don't care if I move last.

430
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Oh, yeah, you're slow as fuck anyway.

431
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Oh, no.

432
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I wonder what my switch is.

433
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Oh, look, it doesn't exist.

434
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh, dear.

435
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Okay, okay.

436
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Ability download? Holy shit.

437
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
You could destroy my computer.

438
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
If I download something, I'll do it.

439
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,500
You could download a virus so that it looks like Ben won.

440
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Yes.

441
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
It's Dirt Boy.

442
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
No!

443
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Dirt Boy is worse than dirt.

444
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
That's why he digs it.

445
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
You act like something's gonna happen when in fact you know nothing will happen.

446
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Oh fuck Shadow Sneak, I'm such an asshole.

447
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
You can't escape from the shank.

448
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
You can't be fucking gay, dude.

449
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
That's what I learned in college.

450
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Yes, whatever you do, whatever you go in life, just please, for God's sake, don't be fucking gay, dude.

451
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Okay, okay.

452
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Will a knife stab up yellow bullet this time?

453
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Will he be able to get the slice on him?

454
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Look at that.

455
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
He's not even wearing plate armor.

456
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Yes, oh no.

457
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Oh, what?

458
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I just wanted to, yeah, I got that crit, duh.

459
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Why did you do that?

460
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,500
I wanted you to flinch, but I forgot I went fucking, shut up, dude.

461
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh, he's getting flustered.

462
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Now time for Carl.

463
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Carlton.

464
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Now time for Carl.

465
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It is time for Carl.

466
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Geez, I don't even know.

467
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I don't even know what star you is.

468
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Bubblebeam.

469
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Is it a star or is it you?

470
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Don't fucking check me out.

471
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
It's like that Austin Powers movie.

472
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
With those Asians.

473
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Fuck you, fuck me.

474
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
You know?

475
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
We're all one big happy family.

476
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Yeah.

477
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Oh, fuck!

478
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
God damn it!

479
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Something happened.

480
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah.

481
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I fucking missed, dude.

482
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
I saw it.

483
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
High jump kit.

484
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
You avoid it and then something else happened.

485
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
What happened?

486
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
You'll never know unless you replay it.

487
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, he kept going and crashed.

488
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,500
That's the stakes of which you do with the jump and hop.

489
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
That's the push and pull of being gay.

490
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
If you jump up, you're gonna fall down.

491
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
But every time before, you can fall.

492
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Of course, friend junior with the fire punch.

493
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Out of the fucking nowhere.

494
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
You know what they say?

495
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Fire is your best friend, junior.

496
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Especially if you like to kill people.

497
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Abracadabra?

498
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
What are these?

499
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
These are not even a thing.

500
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Oh, that berry juice though.

501
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Oh no, it's too powerful.

502
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Big body.

503
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Friend junior is the greatest person alive.

504
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
This is going in the complete opposite direction.

505
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
The greatest person alive, yeah.

506
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Oh god, I don't know.

507
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Friend junior is just too powerful.

508
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,500
He sent out his computer to fight Munchie's friend.

509
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
He tried to attack, but it didn't work.

510
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
That's it?

511
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
I'm fucked.

512
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
You're fucking gay, dude.

513
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
That's what you are.

514
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Hey, whatever, man.

515
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
I'm so...

516
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
This text goes by way too fast for me to understand what's happening each time.

517
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
He's using his tri-times, two times.

518
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Oh, he's gonna body slam me.

519
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
What? Wait, really?

520
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I can't believe that.

521
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Holy shit.

522
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
He could come back.

523
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
He could come back at any moment.

524
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
No, yeah, this is it.

525
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
This is it.

526
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I also could do this.

527
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Or maybe I'm gonna do this, bam!

528
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh no, but he didn't.

529
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I screamed.

530
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
The little bird, he's a red-rubbin' red breast.

531
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
He's used to the winter.

532
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh no!

533
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
He sliced you, because he's seen many winters.

534
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
He knows the ice better than you do.

535
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm...

536
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Fuck you, dude.

537
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Oh shit, it's mirror time.

538
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Bird's first birds.

539
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
It's bird against bird.

540
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
It's a bird-fight bird world.

541
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Uh...

542
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Dear...

543
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Maybe I'm faster.

544
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I am.

545
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Because of your ability, bitch.

546
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Well, don't you have the same ability?

547
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Yeah, it's true.

548
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Oh shit, a bird comes up against an egg.

549
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
The next one...

550
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
There's a new bird in that egg.

551
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
I'm not sure if I have any

552
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
meaningfully useful

553
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
powers to do here.

554
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
If all else fails,

555
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
you can slice the bird in half

556
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
with a sword.

557
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm gonna sweep him.

558
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
I'm gonna sweep Munchie's whole team

559
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
with bird bullet.

560
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Bird bullet is gonna rip through...

561
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Is a fucking paralyzed

562
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
little guy.

563
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Oh no.

564
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Oh no, he had an accident.

565
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
He had a little bird accident

566
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
and got paralyzed.

567
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Oh shit, he's got times three attack.

568
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
That's like more than

569
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
about one. I just feel like this is fucking

570
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
bad for me. Hold on.

571
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Yeah, it's bad for you.

572
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Yeah, you're gonna die.

573
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Yeah, your mom's gonna be real mad if

574
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
your dildos get broken and she can't

575
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
do what she's gonna do.

576
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Hmm...

577
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Hmm...

578
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
They're staring each other down.

579
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Are you ready?

580
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Are you prepared to die

581
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
right now? Oh dear.

582
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Quick use big

583
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
fucking hit.

584
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Nah, I think

585
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
he's got this actually.

586
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
No! No!

587
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
It didn't do it all.

588
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
It didn't do it all.

589
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Come on bird bullet, please just overcome

590
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
your paralysis.

591
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Like Kirito

592
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
in that show

593
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
that I've never seen

594
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
but that anime guy keeps talking about it.

595
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
That one guy.

596
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
That one Shella.

597
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
A knife versus a bird. I honestly don't know

598
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
which bird is quick.

599
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
If my paralysis

600
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
doesn't fuck me over again,

601
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
I think I win. Yeah, I think you do too.

602
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Oh dear. Oh my,

603
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
oh me.

604
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Oh, I did it!

605
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm killing it! There it comes!

606
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Here it fucking comes bro!

607
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
I can't believe this!

608
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
I did it!

609
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
I can't believe it!

610
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I'm the champion of little cup!

611
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
He did it! He's the champion!

612
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Fuck! Oh no!

613
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm a disgrace.

614
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Swords dance bird bullet.

615
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
That's all it took. A little bird killed

616
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
your whole family. How do you feel?

617
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Oh well, I mean, I would like

618
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
to have my family back but obviously that's too...

619
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
It's too much.

620
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Alright, now it's time for you, you.

621
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Oh, should we have a little

622
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
interview, Ben? What do you think of that?

623
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I think

624
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
that

625
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I was...

626
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I was, you know,

627
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
I didn't even try. Everything I said before

628
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
about making my team

629
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
really carefully

630
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
and making spreadsheets and crunching numbers

631
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
and doing hours and hours of research.

632
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
None of it was true. I just picked whatever.

633
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
I just went with what my heart told me.

634
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
You know what, paid off.

635
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Are you in on this? Are you in this new fight?

636
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Uh...

637
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Basketball vs. Monotype.

638
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Oh no, Bensate vs. Munchie. There we go.

639
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Basketball?

640
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Basketball and Monotype.

641
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Alright, let's go through this team.

642
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
We got, we got

643
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Play-Doh coming out of one of those things.

644
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
We got Blastoise.

645
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
We got Catgirl.

646
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
We got that thing for this.

647
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
It's a boy, thank you very much.

648
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Okay, it's the onion from that movie.

649
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
We got Big Crocker Boy.

650
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
He's gonna bite you, slice you

651
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
with very small eyes.

652
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
And Snorlax,

653
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
because he's fat.

654
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
And then, on the other teams.

655
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
We got a very tall

656
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Pikachu.

657
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
We got

658
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Brunswink.

659
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
We got...

660
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
What the fuck is that? This is like a slicey moon.

661
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
It's like that one enemy

662
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
from the moon in Dark Cloud.

663
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
You know the one. Nobody knows the one.

664
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Sailor Moon.

665
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Yeah, Sailor Moon, that's the one.

666
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Then we got, oh, it's a bunch of

667
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
roses. It's a bouquet.

668
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
And now we got two swords.

669
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
He's got extra swords this time.

670
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I agree, Florgis.

671
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Florgis is gross.

672
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
And we got Crobat, because, you know,

673
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
nobody likes Crobat.

674
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Because whatever, I didn't care

675
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
about that last slot.

676
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Crobat is actually the key to this

677
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
entire...

678
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh, I see.

679
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I see.

680
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
I see.

681
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
What do you think?

682
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Which Pokemon will you play?

683
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Will they play which Pokemon?

684
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Go!

685
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Beef Bullet!

686
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I like how you didn't fucking go for it.

687
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
What did you think I was gonna go for?

688
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Spaghetti versus

689
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Big Pig.

690
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Let's have a look. We got Bug Rock.

691
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
So it's gross.

692
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
That's what it is. And we got Ice Ground.

693
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
So he's gonna...

694
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
He's gonna...

695
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
I don't know what he's gonna do.

696
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I got the defense. I got

697
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
the offense. I got the fucking

698
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
beans. I have the beans in my hair.

699
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Oh shit, this Bug Rock has Hyper Beam.

700
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Don't say that.

701
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
It's got Hyper Beam, dude.

702
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Yeah, dude, you fucking piece of shit.

703
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
I got a little Bug have Hyper Beam.

704
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Wait, does he actually...

705
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
You're not supposed to tell me...

706
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I can't tell you what they have.

707
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
I'm gay as written on your ceiling. Did you write that in your sleep?

708
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Cause that's what your concess was

709
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
telling you?

710
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Let me just look up real quick

711
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
and confirm that.

712
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Oh shit.

713
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Big Pig used Earthquake.

714
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Cause he's...

715
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
You fool. You absolute...

716
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
You absolute monster.

717
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
He actually did it.

718
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Shut up.

719
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Oh god, you...

720
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
You need to use a...

721
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
What's the moss from Dark Cloud? Dark Souls?

722
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
The moss?

723
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
What are you?

724
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
No, the green moss is not green moss.

725
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
It's like purple or whatever.

726
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
My game was crashed.

727
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Oh really?

728
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Oh, it's crashed for me too.

729
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Oh...

730
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
You wanna just start a new one

731
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
and do exactly what we did?

732
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do that.

733
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
That seems...

734
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Okay, we'll just get it right back to where we were.

735
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
We're doing a big old Swifty Do.

736
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Uh, here's something.

737
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Alright, well let's do the half-time show.

738
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Yeah.

739
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Put in like a little...

740
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Put in like a...

741
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I'll put in music.

742
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
And a gif. That'll be the half-time show.

743
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
And then we could be the guys in the box saying...

744
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Well that wasn't...

745
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Well that was not a fucking...

746
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Well, well, well...

747
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
He passed the ball...

748
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
And he scored, but will he do it again?

749
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
What do you think?

750
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
I don't care.

751
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
He is gay.

752
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
That's why he's playing football.

753
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Oh...

754
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Football's gay.

755
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Damn...

756
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Damn, you can't just say that.

757
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
On TV.

758
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
TV?

759
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Internet v...

760
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Oh, no.

761
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Internet vision.

762
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
You have it, I have it.

763
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
But will they accept it?

764
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
No.

765
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
It's the onset.

766
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

767
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I had to think for a second.

768
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
But the seconds are weaknesses.

769
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
You see when my mom taught me...

770
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
If you told me one thing, it was this.

771
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
You always steal.

772
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
You have to steal.

773
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
And we're back.

774
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
There was a technical hip-skilly,

775
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
and now we're just re...

776
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
We're redoing the past.

777
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Hopefully there won't be any random changes

778
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
in what happened.

779
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Now, okay, we're back.

780
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Okay, now we're back exactly where we were.

781
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
We got a toxic pig.

782
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
We got a spaghetti earthquake...

783
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
I hate sex so much.

784
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Spaghetti.

785
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I feel like going. I have to say it.

786
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I hate sex.

787
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Shit!

788
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
That reminds me of a drill tweet recently.

789
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
It said,

790
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
quote,

791
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
history will show that leaving the EU

792
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
was the right move for Britain.

793
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And also,

794
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I don't believe in sex.

795
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Signed the Brexit asexual.

796
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
God fucking dammit!

797
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I...

798
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
What?

799
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Ooh!

800
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Coming or coming out.

801
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Black and red, like my friends.

802
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
All my friends.

803
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
He's ground and dark, he's dark-

804
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Don't say that!

805
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
And...

806
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
He got hit with a carbon-earthquake

807
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
and he killed him.

808
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
He killed him, it's fine.

809
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Well, it's not fine for you.

810
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
God, that was terrible.

811
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
What an awful exchange.

812
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Why do you mix me and want to touch a little kid?

813
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Well, that really hurts my feelings

814
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
and also harasses me.

815
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Um...

816
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I think you're probably...

817
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
What if you get off to touch your kids now?

818
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah, appropriately.

819
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
One time I rub against someone

820
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
in the subway station and I'm pretty sure

821
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
they called me a Jew.

822
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
There we go.

823
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Well, that is a terrifying screech

824
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
of a fucking bouquet.

825
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Uh-huh.

826
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
It's just like a rosary.

827
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
It's like a rosary of evolution.

828
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
It's like a rosetta stone.

829
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
You nerd.

830
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
It knows Japans.

831
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
You friggin' nerd, Munchin.

832
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
I forgot.

833
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
It knows how I'm going.

834
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
I forgot how the ground is-

835
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
You forgot about fairy types?

836
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
The best type?

837
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Oh no.

838
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Big fat friend or...

839
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
It's not fucking fairy anymore.

840
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
He grew up into normal friend.

841
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Friend was my father's name.

842
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Call me... Jimmy.

843
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Moonbyist.

844
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
That's what you call an average attack.

845
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
It's sort of effective.

846
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
But...

847
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Snorlax has got like a million hit-pins.

848
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Hit-pins.

849
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Hit-pins.

850
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I've got a million pints, dude.

851
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Oh shit, he's got an item.

852
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
What?

853
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Oh, it's the U.S. government.

854
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
It is the U.S. government.

855
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I can't wait to destroy it.

856
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
I can't wait to just tear it apart and dismantle it.

857
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Who will win? Flowers or authority?

858
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Oh my god.

859
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Yeah.

860
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
It's like the 60s all over again.

861
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
They put in the flowers in the barrels of the guns.

862
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
I don't know what...

863
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Is that super effective or not?

864
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I don't know what Celebi is for.

865
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
For gay rights.

866
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Or...

867
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Is for...

868
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
In the morning.

869
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Baton pass.

870
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

871
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Oh dear.

872
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Just when you thought being gay wasn't bad enough,

873
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
you had to throw in...

874
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Being extra gay.

875
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Extra gay.

876
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
The new product from...

877
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Pokemon The Gay Company.

878
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
I know exactly what to do.

879
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
You are stupid.

880
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
No! Fuck!

881
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
You are stupid.

882
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Shut up!

883
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Did you know I was going to do that?

884
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Yeah, of course.

885
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
What else did you do?

886
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Dude, he's going to use an old type attack.

887
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Dude!

888
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
You steel ghost.

889
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Son of a fucking bitch.

890
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
You set me up, Munchie!

891
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
You fucking set me up!

892
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm going to fucking kill you, bro.

893
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm going to kill you, bro.

894
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
I'm going to kill you, bro.

895
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
He's ready.

896
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I'm going to shoot you with sword bullet, right?

897
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Fucking now! No! How are you so fast?

898
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
I'm deceptively fast.

899
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Oh boy.

900
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
It's really getting heated.

901
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
This is it for me.

902
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
There's no coming back.

903
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
That's a fiery heating punch.

904
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
How can I stop this?

905
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
How can I stop, friend?

906
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
How can I stop this?

907
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
How can I stop, friend?

908
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I killed friend Junior.

909
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
That friend is here for revenge.

910
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
No!

911
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Oh!

912
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
He's burned.

913
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
It's leftovers won't do shit now.

914
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
They get burned away.

915
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
That's not true, though.

916
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
No!

917
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
All you got to do is start believing in fairy tales.

918
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Because I'm a fairy tale.

919
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
And you're about to be my tale.

920
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm going to fucking grind you into the paste that you are.

921
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
You are a pasty white boy.

922
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
And I'm going to rape you.

923
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Because I'm black.

924
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
And that's what we do.

925
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Munchie, please. Please.

926
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Just have mercy.

927
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Oh, God.

928
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Aspene, fire punch.

929
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
This is a, surely a,

930
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
clearly a match.

931
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
This is clearly a match.

932
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
This is clearly, definitely a match.

933
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
It's a match between two people.

934
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
A neck?

935
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Maybe you should switch into your ground type.

936
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Oh, wait, he's dead.

937
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
That burn will kill him.

938
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
That burn will kill him.

939
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
But not before

940
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
sealing my victory.

941
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Is that, like, a thing

942
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
where you're going to bring out a seal?

943
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Ah, shit.

944
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Ah, whatever.

945
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Ah, god damn it.

946
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Spaghetti vs. the moon.

947
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
I just want to be, I just want to be extra

948
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
careful, so let me just give this to you.

949
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
I just want to be extra careful.

950
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Let me just give you this to you guys.

951
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Let me just give this to you guys.

952
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
He's going to protect Stovework

953
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
and I'll talk to him.

954
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
So I can, you know,

955
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
you know how it be.

956
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
This is an intense battle.

957
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Fucking neck bullet.

958
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Neck bullet.

959
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
I love neck bullet and neck bullet mark, too.

960
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
How does he shoot his neck

961
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
without killing himself?

962
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Well,

963
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
he's a long guy.

964
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
He is the bullet. He's just comprised

965
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
largely of neck.

966
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Where does it end?

967
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
It's a girl.

968
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Oh, fuck this.

969
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Why did I like girls on my team? That's why I'm losing.

970
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
That's why I'm losing this fight.

971
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
You're going for the Pokémon

972
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
that arouses you more than the Pokémon

973
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
that will save your life.

974
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
This Pokémon arouses me just fine. Thank you very much.

975
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Thank you very much.

976
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
He does have a very, he does have

977
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
an infectious smile.

978
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Oh, no.

979
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
I've made a terrible mistake

980
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
over and over again.

981
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
That's what life is all about.

982
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
For you.

983
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Oh, of course he is protect.

984
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Munchy.

985
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Oh, that burn. That burn will do it.

986
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
He's sticky webbed.

987
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
He's rocked. He's burned.

988
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
He needs a nice hot bath, but he doesn't have one.

989
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
No!

990
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Oh, yes!

991
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
I can't believe this.

992
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
I can't believe this.

993
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
That's what old Hammurabi told me

994
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
when he fucking killed me.

995
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
It's kind of close.

996
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
It's kind of close when she has one extra Pokémon,

997
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
but it's already damaged.

998
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
What will Ben do?

999
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
What will he...

1000
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
If he's smart, yeah, and if he's smart

1001
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
then he'll fall right into my trap

1002
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
and he's a trap.

1003
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
No, come on, though.

1004
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Yeah, you fell right into my trap, buddy.

1005
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Oh, shit.

1006
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Well...

1007
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
You can't not psychic a bat.

1008
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
That's what they always say.

1009
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
And you're going to try and do what you think is right,

1010
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
but you're going to be wrong.

1011
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Because I also know what you're going to do right now.

1012
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Oh, my God.

1013
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Are you scaring me?

1014
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
You see,

1015
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
when God created me, he said,

1016
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
all right, I was having fun

1017
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
with my Play-Doh game people,

1018
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
and I thought it was going to be funny,

1019
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
but this prank has gotten out of control,

1020
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
and I need you to undo my gamer prank.

1021
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
That's right.

1022
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Oh, I see.

1023
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
That's neck bullet one.

1024
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Correct.

1025
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
It's big Pikachu.

1026
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
The evolved form of Pikachu.

1027
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
No!

1028
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Oh, what?

1029
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
That electric wasn't even good.

1030
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Time to bring out the...

1031
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
It's like you think that you're cool.

1032
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
It's almost like that.

1033
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
It's a ring around the rosies.

1034
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
It's almost like that you think you're cool.

1035
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Because the rosies are in the ring.

1036
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Foolish.

1037
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
What a mistake.

1038
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I can't...

1039
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
What a mistake.

1040
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
We're just...

1041
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
There we go. That's all I needed.

1042
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
That fucking minus special defense.

1043
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
No, come on.

1044
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Don't...

1045
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Don't fuck around with me, though.

1046
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Yes!

1047
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I'll kill you.

1048
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I'll kill you, though.

1049
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Here, I'm going to keep them for can fodder.

1050
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
No lie.

1051
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Dammit! God fucking dammit!

1052
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
That's no lie.

1053
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
He used protect against nothing.

1054
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1055
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
We'll smiley face punch him.

1056
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Will he win?

1057
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Also, I hate florgas.

1058
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Oh, he's toxic.

1059
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
You're dead, boy.

1060
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
You don't have anti-dote.

1061
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Oh, I'm...

1062
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I'm terrible.

1063
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
This whole battle has just been one mistake after another.

1064
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
I don't care if Shuckle fucking dies.

1065
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Who cares about Shuckle?

1066
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Nobody, that's who.

1067
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
We got three Pokemon each.

1068
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
It's an even match.

1069
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Kind of even...

1070
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Digimon.

1071
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Digimon.

1072
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Here he comes with his big attack.

1073
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
You fucking nerd!

1074
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
You fucking nerd, are you serious?

1075
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
I forgot.

1076
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Did you really just do that?

1077
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Did you really fucking just use

1078
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Dragon Pulse on fucking florgas?

1079
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
I forgot.

1080
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
You infinite bastard.

1081
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
You're a fucking...

1082
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
What? Holy shit.

1083
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
You fucking retard. I'm still going to win even though I'm gay.

1084
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Maybe I spoke too soon.

1085
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Listen, you can't judge someone

1086
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
just based on their sexuality, alright?

1087
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Wait, what?

1088
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
I can't.

1089
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Damn.

1090
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
You can get most of the information.

1091
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
If there's one thing I know

1092
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
it's that being who you are

1093
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
is not...

1094
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
It's wrong.

1095
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Agreed.

1096
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Oh, that special defense is really...

1097
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Okay, I know what to do.

1098
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Oh, you didn't let me do it though.

1099
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Okay, shit.

1100
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Oh, shit.

1101
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I think it's gonna die.

1102
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
It's not gonna go...

1103
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
What even is aura sphere?

1104
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Is it a physical psychic?

1105
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Or is it a special fighting?

1106
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
It's a special fighting.

1107
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
I think you can do it now.

1108
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
You have faith in me? Come on, bad bull.

1109
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Yeah, roost! Yeah, roost!

1110
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Oh, keep roostin'!

1111
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Roost all the time.

1112
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Roost Bolton.

1113
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
There we go.

1114
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Is that what you were looking for, you son of a bitch?

1115
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
He's bored.

1116
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Oh, I didn't mean to do that one,

1117
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
but it doesn't matter anyway.

1118
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Doesn't it?

1119
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
No, it doesn't.

1120
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
You're just gonna keep...

1121
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
I think, Ben,

1122
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
the amount of healing you're gonna need to do...

1123
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
No, look at that. I'm making progress.

1124
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Oh, yeah?

1125
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Don't even fucking try with this dragon pulse.

1126
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
It could go either way.

1127
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Oh, bad bullet.

1128
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
Oh, bad bullet.

1129
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Oh, bad bullet.

1130
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Bad bullet.

1131
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
You can do this all day, dude.

1132
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
I can do this all day.

1133
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
But you're gonna have to damage me eventually,

1134
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
and that's when you're gonna die.

1135
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Hang on, how much... Roost has 10 out of 16s.

1136
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
That's a lot of roosting you can do.

1137
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
Shit, I can only roost 10 more times.

1138
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,500
I'm gonna need at least 100 for this plan to work.

1139
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Shit.

1140
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
It's more than 5, sir.

1141
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
As soon as he gets a crit,

1142
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
it's over.

1143
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Yeah, dude.

1144
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
You got this under control.

1145
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I've been waiting my whole life for this battle.

1146
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
Oh, man.

1147
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
That's sick.

1148
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Just end me.

1149
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Please.

1150
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Please put me out of my misery, Munchy.

1151
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Alright, now I've had enough.

1152
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I've had enough. You got this one.

1153
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Okay, I've had enough.

1154
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I'm gonna give you this one, Munchy.

1155
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Oh, yeah.

1156
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
I'm gonna let you have this one.

1157
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
You deserve it.

1158
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,500
One point for Munchy

1159
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
towards this round.

1160
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Alright, rematch.

1161
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Let's not mess around.

1162
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Yeah, let's take this one

1163
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,500
seriously, though.

1164
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Yeah, for real, for real.

1165
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Absolutely, 100%.

1166
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Oh, dear.

1167
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
It started off with a superb effective.

1168
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
I forgot about moves.

1169
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Only you remembered that the video games

1170
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
were not catered to retards.

1171
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Yeah, I wish I could remember that.

1172
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
I wish I could remember that.

1173
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
But, you know...

1174
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
When Shigeru Miyamoto

1175
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
first swore...

1176
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
No, god damn it! Why?

1177
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,500
When it just happened, it was a shadow boy.

1178
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
And you got superb effective.

1179
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
When he first set foot on the moon,

1180
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
he said, from this day forward,

1181
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
I will not, if you do games,

1182
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
will be minority repellent.

1183
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Thank god for that.

1184
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Oh, no, this is...

1185
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,500
Is that what they said in the minority report?

1186
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Oh, that's what they said

1187
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
in, uh...

1188
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
last week, tonight, with John Oliver.

1189
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
When he was interviewed.

1190
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Are you just gonna have all your guys get damaged

1191
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
and then go home?

1192
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Yeah, sure.

1193
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Why not?

1194
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
This trap...

1195
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
is trapping you good.

1196
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
It may be paralyzed and a boy.

1197
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,500
And act like you know how things are.

1198
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
You act like you know what things are,

1199
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
except you don't.

1200
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
I know one or two things.

1201
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Can beef boy kill the trap?

1202
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Find out.

1203
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Well, I don't know if you know if you realize,

1204
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
but he's a trap because it's a girl,

1205
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
but it's not.

1206
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
And that's why it's a trap.

1207
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
I know what that trap is.

1208
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
You just want to put your doll in it,

1209
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
and then you realize, where do you put it?

1210
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Well, you realize

1211
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
that there's a wonderful thing called boy pussy.

1212
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Alright, take that out of the video.

1213
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Wait, no, what is that?

1214
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Tell me about that.

1215
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I'm wondering.

1216
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Take that out of the video.

1217
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
I'm the one who has the footage.

1218
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
I can edit it all day.

1219
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Both of you look like the coolest guys

1220
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,500
with their boy pussy.

1221
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Yeah.

1222
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Uh, let's...

1223
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Let's try something radical.

1224
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
No, no, you're not.

1225
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
Let's try something radical.

1226
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
That's pretty radical.

1227
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Shoot that bat with your gun.

1228
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
It's Digimon.

1229
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Oh shit, electric.

1230
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,500
Can you Thunder Shock Big Blue?

1231
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Yeah.

1232
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Maybe.

1233
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Amphor off the slowest fuck though, dude.

1234
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Um...

1235
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Yeah, well...

1236
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,500
So...

1237
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
So what though?

1238
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
What was that?

1239
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
It didn't do anything.

1240
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
It got rid of the stealth rock.

1241
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
What the hell's the stealth...

1242
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Dude.

1243
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
The greatest commenter of all time.

1244
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
What the hell's the stealth rock?

1245
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,500
I don't know.

1246
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,500
I'm here to provide moral support

1247
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
for me and no one else.

1248
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
People have laid a clever trap

1249
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
and megablastoise.

1250
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Dude, look at my eyes.

1251
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,500
You think my eyes can see?

1252
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
Fuck you, I'm blind, dude.

1253
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
How can our eyes be real

1254
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
if we can't even see?

1255
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
Exactly.

1256
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
How can the sea be real if we can't see?

1257
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
The sea.

1258
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
That's true.

1259
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
A.

1260
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Don't even fucking try it.

1261
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
You're stupid and it won't work.

1262
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Oh, for God's...

1263
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Oh, please. Oh, no.

1264
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Okay.

1265
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Wait, it's Wish?

1266
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
That's cute. He wished that his sword buddy

1267
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
would come and save its own life with health.

1268
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
And he did.

1269
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
He's alive.

1270
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Oh, that wasn't good enough.

1271
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
The sword danced.

1272
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
I've really...

1273
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
I've really fucked up.

1274
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Oh, dear.

1275
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Try this one for size.

1276
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
He's got times three.

1277
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Try this one for size.

1278
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Oh, sacred sword!

1279
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Ooh, that's good.

1280
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
No.

1281
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
No!

1282
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Sadistic is not going to work, by the way.

1283
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
I hope you realize.

1284
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Yeah, I do.

1285
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
I know ghosts.

1286
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
I know ghosts.

1287
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
I ain't afraid no ghosts.

1288
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
I am.

1289
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
They are real.

1290
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
And they're real.

1291
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
The one time I saw a ghost and I said,

1292
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
Dude, why do you do this to people?

1293
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
And they said, I just want to be loved.

1294
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
And I cried.

1295
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
And they said, you know what, I'm going to write a story about this.

1296
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
I'm going to post it on a creepypasta.wiki.

1297
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
And I'm going to get a lot of updates.

1298
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
God, I can help you become famous on the internet.

1299
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
That's what I wanted to do.

1300
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
My name was Ben St.

1301
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
And he never got famous on the internet.

1302
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
And he became a ghost and he went back in time.

1303
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
And that's who I met.

1304
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Munchie, you know what?

1305
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Before, I was debating whether I should

1306
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
Swords Dance or Shadow Sneak.

1307
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,500
And if I had Swords Dance,

1308
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,500
then that fucking sacred sword would have killed friend.

1309
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
And I would be home free.

1310
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
God fucking dammit.

1311
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
The whole match was decided right there by not

1312
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Swords Dancing.

1313
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Shit.

1314
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
You really screwed the pooch on this one.

1315
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
I sure did.

1316
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
You guys

1317
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
are better at commentating your own match

1318
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
than I am.

1319
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
We actually know what our Pokemon are doing.

1320
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
The text goes

1321
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
by too fast so all I can do is go

1322
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
eh.

1323
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
You know?

1324
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
That's all we need, dude.

1325
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
I lifted one weight yesterday

1326
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
and my arm is like broken.

1327
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Nice.

1328
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Was it one kilogram?

1329
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
It was one centimeter.

1330
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
That's very dense.

1331
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Just like

1332
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
someone.

1333
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
I want to insult someone

1334
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
but can't decide so

1335
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
I'll just leave it up to interpretation.

1336
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Fuck.

1337
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Bitch. Ass.

1338
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,500
You act like you know what shit happens

1339
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,500
and you don't know how shit happens.

1340
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
You just know that you are a little boy.

1341
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
Chomp his neck. Chomp his neck.

1342
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,500
You've got the teeth, I think.

1343
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
No!

1344
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,500
God, it read me like a fucking book.

1345
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Read you like a

1346
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
bestseller.

1347
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
Jesus.

1348
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Jesus.

1349
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Dude.

1350
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,500
You don't even know how weirds are.

1351
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Can Kamina eat roses?

1352
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
I don't think he's a vegetarian.

1353
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
I think,

1354
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
yeah, you need that guy.

1355
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
He is a vegetarian.

1356
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Or is he a vegetable?

1357
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,500
He is. He's gross.

1358
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,500
Find out next time.

1359
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
On the next episode of

1360
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Dagen

1361
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
Dragon.

1362
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Dragon Kid Boy.

1363
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,500
You know what's called

1364
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Dragon Ball Z

1365
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
because he went through

1366
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
26

1367
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
drafts

1368
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
and the first one was Dragon Ball A

1369
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
and it wasn't very good so he did it again.

1370
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Well see,

1371
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
what you gotta understand about Dragon Ball

1372
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
that was made by a crazy man.

1373
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
A crazy man

1374
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
in a cave and that guy

1375
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
was just up to no good.

1376
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
Hmm.

1377
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Let me get out the damage calculator here.

1378
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Pokemon is

1379
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
boring.

1380
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Right?

1381
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
I was about to yawn really loud

1382
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
but then I stopped.

1383
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Damage calculator.

1384
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
A little bit of good indicator of my current feelings.

1385
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Just kill the swords or something.

1386
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Use your brain powers

1387
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
and your psychic.

1388
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
Use the death note.

1389
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,500
You can see his name.

1390
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
No, that's not gonna fucking kill me, faggot.

1391
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Yeah, you think you're cool, dude.

1392
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
God.

1393
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
Damn it.

1394
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
See, you just gotta have to

1395
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
you have to see with your mind's eye, dude.

1396
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
I forgot my bat boy

1397
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
is so dead.

1398
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Nope.

1399
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
That doesn't matter.

1400
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
I'm special.

1401
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
You sure are, man.

1402
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
I'm special, though.

1403
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
You used U-turn.

1404
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Which means

1405
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Pikachu's here.

1406
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Get some nice free damage there.

1407
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
They're going once.

1408
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Going twice.

1409
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
It's souls to

1410
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,500
US government.

1411
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Oh, no.

1412
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
That crocodile's cry

1413
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
sounds like her beginning of a rock song.

1414
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,500
It sounds cool.

1415
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Oh.

1416
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
You dummy.

1417
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
Oh.

1418
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
I've been completely outclassed.

1419
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Ah, shit.

1420
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
Yeah, I'm not gonna...

1421
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
No.

1422
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,500
I like how that was resisted, by the way.

1423
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
Nope.

1424
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Hey, you did something

1425
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
with your life.

1426
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I fucking did it.

1427
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Shit.

1428
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,500
It's 2 vs 4.

1429
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Yeah, 2 vs 4.

1430
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Friend

1431
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
is a...

1432
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
It jumps really high.

1433
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
I'm a little...

1434
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
It's kind of like when you

1435
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,500
fall into the flower bed.

1436
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,500
You're doing fucking this shit.

1437
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
I wish

1438
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
you had knocked off my left over.

1439
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,500
She worked really hard on those flowers.

1440
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
You can't just roll around on them.

1441
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,500
So that's why it didn't work.

1442
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
And it was protected by the mother

1443
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
of friend.

1444
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
That's the lore behind that

1445
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,500
attack.

1446
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,500
So this is what we're doing, huh?

1447
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
Yeah, this is your fucking

1448
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
doing.

1449
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
It's almost like

1450
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
I'm your parent, so I'm disappointed in you.

1451
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
I forgot that you had one.

1452
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
The fact is that you had another Pokémon.

1453
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Oh, you got a wish.

1454
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
And is he gonna do more?

1455
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
Is he gonna do more health getting?

1456
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Was he a doctor?

1457
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
Doctor bullet?

1458
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Doctor bat?

1459
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
Come to bat? Go to bat with a doctor?

1460
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
What is he doing?

1461
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
He's gonna stab you

1462
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,500
with his U-turn.

1463
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
And run away.

1464
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
I'm not letting

1465
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
this match go. I can't.

1466
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
I just can't let it go.

1467
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
There you

1468
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,500
got that, dude.

1469
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
This fucking flower

1470
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
is tough as nails.

1471
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
But not as hard as nails, because it's a

1472
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
grass and, well, it's not made of

1473
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
grass, it's a fairy.

1474
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
But it is made of grass, I think.

1475
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
But that doesn't mean it's a grass type.

1476
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
How does it not mean it's a grass type?

1477
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
I don't get it. But the fuck is a fairy?

1478
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,500
We got wings.

1479
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,500
We got little

1480
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
feminine

1481
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
wings. Damn!

1482
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
You're just gonna say that about him?

1483
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Well, it is a female, I mean.

1484
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Damn!

1485
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Damn, dude.

1486
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
What the fuck? In 2016?

1487
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Dude, are you higher something, dude?

1488
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Well, no, actually,

1489
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
I am on the second floor, so...

1490
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
If I jumped out of my window, I could

1491
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,500
be seriously hurt.

1492
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Oh, what? Shit!

1493
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Ah, fuck. Ah, Christ.

1494
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
It's spaghetti.

1495
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Back from already.

1496
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,500
It's over is what it is.

1497
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
It's over!

1498
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Yeah, sure.

1499
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Do whatever you want, stupid.

1500
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
More.

1501
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Brave bird.

1502
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
That's not even true.

1503
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
We're in a rocky helmet, like a piece of shit.

1504
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
Those are illegal.

1505
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,500
Uh...

1506
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
Those are illegal in our society.

1507
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
Nah, dude.

1508
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Yes.

1509
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,500
Oh, god. Why do I just keep...

1510
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Why do I keep doing these things?

1511
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,500
Oh, bad boys.

1512
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,500
He's got webbed.

1513
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,500
I think that means you can't leave.

1514
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
No, it reduces my speed,

1515
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
but not for Bat Bullet,

1516
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
because he is, um...

1517
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
A flying. He's a flyer.

1518
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
He is an up-and-laid ride, this guy.

1519
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,500
Hmm.

1520
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,500
Just use kill.

1521
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
That's the best move.

1522
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,500
Yeah, that is the habit.

1523
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
Munchy.

1524
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Munchy reaches into his pocket.

1525
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,500
Here, Shuckle. He'd take it.

1526
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,500
It tosses a gun into the battle.

1527
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,500
He did say he had grenades.

1528
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
It's possible.

1529
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,500
It's probable.

1530
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,500
It's Pokemon!

1531
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,500
That's the theme.

1532
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Pokemon!

1533
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Oh, man.

1534
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
In Verbank City,

1535
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Roxy, the gym,

1536
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
it's like her band is playing on the stage.

1537
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
And, um...

1538
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,500
It's awesome, because the song they're singing goes like

1539
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:55,500
P-O-K-E-M-O-N

1540
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,500
Pokemon!

1541
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,500
That's the song, dude.

1542
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,500
I'm so proud of you.

1543
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
That's the fucking song.

1544
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Finally.

1545
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Finally free of the menace of Shuckle.

1546
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
You got cheerleaders and cheerfollowers.

1547
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
Foolish.

1548
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
Oh!

1549
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Yeah.

1550
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,500
I'm gonna turn this shit around.

1551
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,500
You turn it around 360 or 180?

1552
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
I don't even...

1553
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,500
know...

1554
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
what that means.

1555
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Turn it around 360 or 180. Which one?

1556
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
Oh, shit!

1557
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Ah, shit. I'm fucking dead.

1558
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
I'm dead.

1559
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
I am dead.

1560
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
Holy shit, you are dead. You only got one big fat friend.

1561
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
And he's nearly dead himself.

1562
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
This is intense Pokemon.

1563
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Um...

1564
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Will he do Moon Blast? Will he do Protect?

1565
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
I gotta open up the damage calculator again.

1566
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Fire Punch.

1567
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
We retaliate.

1568
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
The moves that he has shown he has.

1569
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,500
I forget, I forget if friend goes before...

1570
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
who cable and...

1571
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,500
I can't remember.

1572
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
Wait, I can look.

1573
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
I know I'm gonna look it up.

1574
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,500
What?

1575
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
I'm gonna look it up in the fucking...

1576
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Yeah, we're both damage calculated right now.

1577
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Yeah.

1578
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
Yeah, boot cable it moves first.

1579
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
I think I got it.

1580
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
What's the name of your Pokemon?

1581
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,500
I'm very confident that Moon Blast will kill friend.

1582
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,500
Goddamn it!

1583
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
What?

1584
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,500
Oh!

1585
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,500
Why did...

1586
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
What happened?

1587
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Why did that?

1588
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
I still lose though.

1589
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
I still lose.

1590
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,500
Oh yeah.

1591
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
Oh my god, I fucking did it.

1592
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
I can't believe it.

1593
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Dude, just because you've won the battle doesn't mean you're...

1594
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
You're not gonna win.

1595
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
It's a point for them.

1596
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
That was so...

1597
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
That was so close, holy shit.

1598
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,500
We're gonna do a deciding round for this round.

1599
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,500
This time there's a special rule.

1600
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
You gotta die as quickly as possible.

1601
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,500
Shit.

1602
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
God...

1603
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
Fuck.

1604
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
I can't believe you predicted.

1605
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
Of course.

1606
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Of course.

1607
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Look at me.

1608
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
Just look at me and you'll see.

1609
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
You'll see the reason why.

1610
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Foolish.

1611
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Foolish spell.

1612
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
That was a foolish spell you cast.

1613
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Goddamn.

1614
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
I know, I know in my heart what I must do.

1615
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
No.

1616
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
Don't do it.

1617
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
I know in my heart what I must do.

1618
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
Give up.

1619
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Fuck.

1620
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
Digimon.

1621
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
You should blast his oise.

1622
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,500
Blast his oise out of his head.

1623
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
He had...

1624
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,500
He had scald, he had dragons something.

1625
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,500
And he had punch.

1626
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,500
Yeah, I did have punch.

1627
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,500
Do you guys want any?

1628
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Because I brought some for everyone.

1629
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
I would love some punch right now.

1630
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
I can't be sober for this.

1631
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
You have punch coming from Blastoise's back thing.

1632
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
You just spray it.

1633
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,500
Yeah, it's Hawaiian punch though.

1634
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
Eww.

1635
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
With just a tad of nails.

1636
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
And battery acid.

1637
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
Oh, that's okay.

1638
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
I made just for you, Ben.

1639
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,500
Because I know that you're inhuman.

1640
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Because no one know my little face like that.

1641
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,500
That's what they say when you're having...

1642
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
That's what they say when you're having sex

1643
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
is you're inhuman.

1644
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Because you're probably in...

1645
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Unless you're into Pokemon.

1646
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Yes, which I, of course, am.

1647
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,500
Yes, which I, of course, am.

1648
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,500
Yes, which I, of course, am.

1649
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
Ooh.

1650
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Okay, you can't kill a bat.

1651
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,500
What a fucking piece of shit.

1652
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Nobody can kill a bat.

1653
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,500
Nobody can kill a bat.

1654
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
Nobody can kill a bat.

1655
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
I got my utility out.

1656
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,500
Don't worry.

1657
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,500
It's all in the plan, dude.

1658
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
It's all in the plan, Stan.

1659
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
Impossible.

1660
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,500
Could it be that Ben would win this game as well,

1661
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,500
and then be the guy

1662
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,500
who wins both games?

1663
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,500
And then, is there another game after this?

1664
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Yeah, yeah.

1665
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,500
There's the OU. There's the OU tier.

1666
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,500
I owe you an apology.

1667
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Thanks.

1668
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,500
Nice.

1669
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,500
Shit.

1670
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
What's good against grass?

1671
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,500
Nothing.

1672
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Fire?

1673
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
You can't...

1674
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,500
Smother a fire with a leaf.

1675
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,500
Oh god.

1676
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Okay.

1677
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
You were a dummy if you think

1678
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,500
that you're anything other than a dummy.

1679
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,500
For what?

1680
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,500
The sin that you've just done.

1681
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,500
The fucking...

1682
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,500
You are a ghoul, and you're about to see...

1683
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,500
No, because this time,

1684
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
this time I fucking know what I'm doing.

1685
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
I know how to beat you.

1686
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Sacred sword!

1687
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Yes! God damn it.

1688
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Yes, I've learned.

1689
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,500
I've learned from my mistakes.

1690
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
I sliced him in twines.

1691
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
I can't believe this.

1692
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,500
I'm using the sacred power

1693
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,500
of being a fucking dick.

1694
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,500
I killed friends.

1695
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Okay, okay.

1696
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,500
What a shame.

1697
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
None of that look at sword guy.

1698
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
He's kind of like his two eyes or his eyes,

1699
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
and then the scarf is like

1700
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,500
Zoidberg's lips.

1701
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Yeah.

1702
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
He's really goofy and stupid.

1703
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,500
Yeah.

1704
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,500
Well, I mean, originally he was just

1705
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,500
two swords,

1706
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,500
so I don't know how good that design was

1707
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
to begin with, but...

1708
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Well, with that, you could at least

1709
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,500
just pick him up and whack him on a guy.

1710
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,500
That's true.

1711
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
Make a move, boy.

1712
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,500
Oh god, I don't know. I know you've got Shadow Ball.

1713
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
I know that's ghost type.

1714
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
No, I don't. No, I don't, dude.

1715
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of here.

1716
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
He's got Shadow Ball.

1717
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
It's ground type.

1718
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
Just make a move, dude. Just make a move.

1719
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1720
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
I'm dark.

1721
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,500
Pokemon, yeah.

1722
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Oh, yeah.

1723
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
Alright, alright.

1724
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,500
If you can kill bouquet boy,

1725
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
really quick.

1726
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,500
Oh, bouquet boy.

1727
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,500
If you can kill him really quick, you win

1728
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
because he's tough.

1729
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,500
There we go.

1730
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,500
Oh fuck, I forgot.

1731
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,500
I forgot about Shadow Ball's ability.

1732
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,500
But Moonblast could potentially counter it

1733
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
by reducing the other thing.

1734
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
Oh.

1735
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Oh.

1736
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,500
Yeah, yeah.

1737
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,500
Okay, okay.

1738
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Just keep doing the same attacks over and over.

1739
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,500
I'm good.

1740
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
The trap

1741
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,500
will sprung.

1742
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
Sure was.

1743
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,500
Sure was.

1744
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
Oh.

1745
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,500
Oh no, did you have?

1746
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,500
Oh, I thought so.

1747
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,500
Okay, okay, okay.

1748
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
Let's see.

1749
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,500
Defog.

1750
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
Was that what would happen?

1751
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,500
Yeah, I got rid of him.

1752
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,500
He was a size shocker.

1753
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,500
He was a worst size shocker.

1754
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
Super effective.

1755
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Plus 6%.

1756
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
That's it.

1757
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,500
And then Bat Bull is going to

1758
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
flap his wings again.

1759
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,500
Oh no.

1760
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
0.75 evasion.

1761
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
Sometimes special attack is lower than 1.

1762
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
So he's going to switch up with Spaghetti Boy with this.

1763
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Oh, that was a mistake, dude.

1764
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
No, Shuckle's going to hit him.

1765
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Shuckle's not going to know what hit him.

1766
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
Shuckle's not going to know what hit him.

1767
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,500
He's going to shoot him.

1768
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,500
He's going to get him with his braper power.

1769
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
You're going to throw rocks at him again.

1770
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,500
He didn't let the rocks always critical hit.

1771
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
That's quite bad for Spaghetti.

1772
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,500
There's more rocks.

1773
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
Haven't you realized yet

1774
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
that Shuckle is the only thing

1775
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
that's coming from winning?

1776
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
Are you saying that when I destroy Shuckle

1777
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
you'll become more powerful

1778
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
than I could possibly imagine?

1779
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.

1780
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Now we can really use the protect

1781
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,500
on itself.

1782
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,500
Ooh, nice.

1783
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
Roosting up there with the rocks.

1784
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Being a brave boy.

1785
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
He's coming down with it.

1786
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
With the sickness.

1787
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
Down with the sickness.

1788
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Protecting himself again.

1789
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
He's very good at that.

1790
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
He wears his safety gear.

1791
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
Really?

1792
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,500
Protect stops me from defogging?

1793
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,500
What a bunch of bullshit.

1794
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,500
Whoa, dude.

1795
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500
That is big. Protect.

1796
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,500
This is fucking nonsense.

1797
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
What's happening right here?

1798
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,500
Just defies all...

1799
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
Oh my god. There's no way out.

1800
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,500
There's no way out, is there?

1801
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,500
He's just gonna keep using this.

1802
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Look how low your evasion is.

1803
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Aw, you're fucked now.

1804
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,500
Just keep using those rocks.

1805
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,500
Just keep using them.

1806
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
What do you mean, yeah?

1807
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
It's the weakest part of the one that's gone.

1808
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,500
You don't have a...

1809
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
You don't have a prayer.

1810
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
Shuckle is it.

1811
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,500
Shuckle is your final bastion.

1812
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
But now it's the rock song.

1813
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,500
Yeah, you act like that's gonna kill me.

1814
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,500
Eat that fucking bat hole.

1815
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
Eat that fucking bat hole.

1816
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
But you know what? I'm making a statement right now.

1817
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,500
Eat that bat hole. You're big enough.

1818
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,500
Here we go.

1819
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,500
Chomp, chomp.

1820
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
No, my black sludge.

1821
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,500
You're smarter. You're smarter.

1822
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,500
That's a song.

1823
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Why are you doing this?

1824
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500
Why'd you stop?

1825
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Careful, you're gonna get content in the aid.

1826
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,500
You can do it, come on.

1827
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,500
Come on.

1828
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,500
Man, man, this is it.

1829
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,500
This is truly it.

1830
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Are you at the end of your rope?

1831
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
This is the best of times, and this is the worst of times.

1832
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Ooh, nice dead.

1833
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,500
This bat, even though Ben didn't care about this bat,

1834
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
is winning every single game.

1835
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,500
Yes.

1836
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Oh.

1837
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,500
Sword versus sword dance.

1838
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,500
Can you slice him up?

1839
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,500
Slice those onions.

1840
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,500
You'll cry, but he'll be dead.

1841
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,500
True.

1842
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,500
This is intense.

1843
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,500
It's so intense that I can't even...

1844
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
Stay awake.

1845
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Nice.

1846
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
They're doing swords dancing,

1847
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
but one of them is actual swords, so that one looks better.

1848
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
Damn it.

1849
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,500
He's got times for attack, but no health.

1850
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,500
What will happen?

1851
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Only time will tell.

1852
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,500
I didn't mean...

1853
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,500
The time has told.

1854
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,500
The time has told me what I need to do.

1855
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
You can do it.

1856
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,500
Now he's got priority.

1857
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
Oh, God.

1858
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Wow, it all comes down to this.

1859
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,500
So Ben wins round two.

1860
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Wow.

1861
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,500
I won little cup and underused.

1862
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,500
All right.

1863
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
Now it's time for the ultimate battle.

1864
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,500
The ultimate battle of wits.

1865
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Oh, boy.

1866
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,500
Let's have a look at these guys.

1867
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
We got on Munchie's team, we have...

1868
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,500
Of course you're using slow boat Munchie.

1869
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,500
Of course you're using slow boat.

1870
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Hey, slow bro, dude, fuck you.

1871
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,500
Oh, shit.

1872
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,500
We got...

1873
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,500
Huge bird, different from small bird.

1874
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,500
We got...

1875
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,500
Latino.

1876
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,500
We got...

1877
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
Slow boy.

1878
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,500
We got big fucking mess of

1879
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,500
tangled cables.

1880
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Fucking mess.

1881
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,500
And we got...

1882
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,500
That big guy.

1883
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,500
We got a Tyrant Godzilla.

1884
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,500
We got Godzilla.

1885
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,500
And on the other side, on Ben's team,

1886
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,500
we have a little girl with a big

1887
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
weird jelly underneath.

1888
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,500
It's diamonds.

1889
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,500
She's a diamond girl.

1890
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
She's a diamond in the rough, dude.

1891
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,500
We got chocolate pudding

1892
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,500
demon.

1893
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,500
We got

1894
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,500
egg with leg.

1895
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
Egg with leg.

1896
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
We got that guy.

1897
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,500
Slow boy.

1898
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,500
We got

1899
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Power Ranger, we got Super Sentai here.

1900
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Steel Samurai, one of them.

1901
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,500
And we got a Latino too.

1902
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,500
So...

1903
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
That's pretty good.

1904
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
I have not seen these Pokemon

1905
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
ever used.

1906
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
But I don't play Pokemon, so...

1907
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,500
Well, you're about to see them used

1908
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,500
and abused.

1909
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,500
They're foolish potential.

1910
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,500
Nice.

1911
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,500
Foolish.

1912
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Fucking foolish, dude.

1913
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,500
And we're off with bird versus...

1914
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,500
Oh, we're not.

1915
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,500
We're friend versus bullet.

1916
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
Pink friends

1917
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,500
attack each other.

1918
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
Pink friends attack?

1919
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,500
So we got...

1920
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,500
I've got choice here.

1921
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
This is an even match.

1922
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,500
It's a one paralyze, believe me.

1923
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,500
Disabilities don't count.

1924
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Oh, now he's paralyzed.

1925
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Egg with leg.

1926
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
It doesn't fucking matter.

1927
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,500
Yeah, barely.

1928
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,500
I like egg with leg.

1929
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,500
You mean melon bullet?

1930
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
My bro.

1931
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
My bro melon bullet.

1932
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,500
What tricks does this idiot have?

1933
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,500
That is quite the moustache.

1934
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,500
It doesn't even start from his nose.

1935
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
It starts from his eyebrows.

1936
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,500
Yeah.

1937
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,500
Moustache like that before?

1938
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,500
No, sir.

1939
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
What's he gonna do?

1940
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,500
It's a grass type.

1941
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
First grass and steel.

1942
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,500
This can only mean many things.

1943
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,500
This guy...

1944
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,500
He's acting good.

1945
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,500
Really, he's just a fool.

1946
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
There's fucking shit tons of spikes everywhere.

1947
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
What is he doing with his spikes?

1948
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,500
He's trying to random up my ass

1949
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,500
because he knows I love being gay.

1950
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,500
I mean, you do.

1951
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,500
True.

1952
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,500
But sometimes you just gotta look inside yourself and say...

1953
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500
What bird?

1954
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,500
What pumpkin?

1955
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,500
I don't think anything's actually happened yet.

1956
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
I'm not sure though.

1957
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,500
Dude, this is...

1958
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,500
I'm totally winning right now.

1959
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,500
I've got my spikes out.

1960
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,500
I've paralyzed his dudes.

1961
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Who gives a shit about any of that gay shit?

1962
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,500
He doesn't have a single prayer.

1963
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,500
Dude, has anyone used nut type?

1964
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,500
Oh, it's chocolate pudding.

1965
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,500
Ah, steel type immune to toxic.

1966
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,500
Oh no.

1967
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,500
Oh yeah.

1968
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,500
Oh no.

1969
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,500
Oh yeah.

1970
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Oh no.

1971
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,500
They're switching out thick and fast.

1972
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,500
Trying to figure out the best combo potential

1973
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
setup movement.

1974
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,500
But they're just gonna keep going in and out

1975
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
with their Pokemon.

1976
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
In and out and in and out, I say.

1977
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,500
That's what they're doing.

1978
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
Pokemon balls flying like hither and thither.

1979
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
It's like that one show.

1980
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Pokemon.

1981
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
Yeah.

1982
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,500
Except in actual the show Pokemon

1983
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,500
had a real battle.

1984
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,500
I really feel like all my planning

1985
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,500
paid off.

1986
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,500
You know, when we agreed to this battle

1987
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
in like an hour, you were like,

1988
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
okay, got my teams and I was like,

1989
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,500
oh my god, he made them so fast.

1990
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,500
He must know exactly what he's doing.

1991
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,500
But turns out he's just a fucking nerd.

1992
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,500
And I spent like two whole days putting these teams together.

1993
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,500
And it paid off.

1994
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,500
Listen man, listen man.

1995
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,500
All that matters is that I have my pride

1996
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,500
at the end of the day.

1997
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,500
All I need is my pride.

1998
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,500
But you lost everything.

1999
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,500
My job.

2000
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,500
My wife.

2001
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,500
All video games.

2002
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Pride comes after and before fall.

2003
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
Oh my god, he turned into a jet ski.

2004
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,500
Misogyny.

2005
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Wow.

2006
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,500
I didn't realize he could have an airplane.

2007
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
You didn't know about that?

2008
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,500
You didn't know about planes?

2009
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Wait, dude, is there a Twin Towers Pokemon?

2010
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
There is, as a matter of fact.

2011
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
It's called...

2012
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
Well, it starts out as...

2013
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,500
A single.

2014
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,500
A single building.

2015
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
It did evolve into two.

2016
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,500
Yeah, it's awesome.

2017
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,500
When given the U.S. Constitution

2018
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,500
and traded.

2019
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
Yes.

2020
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
It's weak to flying.

2021
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,500
Yes.

2022
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,500
Oh shit.

2023
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
The sandstorm, these spikes, this leash.

2024
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,500
Misogyny's having a hard time.

2025
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,500
Oh, but he used boom!

2026
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
And he got like...

2027
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Oh, am I gonna get him? I got him!

2028
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,500
I've been one the first round.

2029
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,500
Yeah, I think so.

2030
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,500
Hang on, it's not over yet.

2031
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
I think it's over.

2032
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,500
It's over.

2033
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,500
I've got fucking three spikes

2034
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,500
and a stealth rock out and he just lost his...

2035
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
Whoa, that's like all his health.

2036
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
That's clearer.

2037
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,500
Half his health in one big swell.

2038
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,500
It does look cool though.

2039
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,500
I like that bird.

2040
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
I think it's supposed to be like a

2041
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
Kestrel or something.

2042
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,500
Nothing.

2043
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Or a weirdly waddly

2044
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,500
bird with a thing on his head.

2045
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
A Unibird.

2046
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
Unicorn bird.

2047
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
But a backwards side head unicorn?

2048
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
I can't believe this!

2049
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,500
How did you know I would stay in?

2050
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,500
Um...

2051
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,500
Uh...

2052
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
I don't know.

2053
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
I don't need your lies.

2054
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
I used S.C.A.L.D. because it would

2055
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,500
be effective against anything.

2056
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
True.

2057
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
Well, I guess except for the slow bro.

2058
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,500
Um, whatever.

2059
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,500
It's S.C.A.L.D. like you get a boiling pan

2060
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,500
and you just throw it at the Pokémon and they go

2061
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,500
Ah!

2062
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Regardless of what type they are.

2063
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
Because nobody likes putting

2064
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
their face in a boiling pan of noodles.

2065
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,500
Except for the noodles.

2066
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,500
But they don't get those because it's just water.

2067
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,500
Oh boy.

2068
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
That waifu is

2069
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,500
times two speed and attack.

2070
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,500
I mean, no special.

2071
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,500
That's what it is.

2072
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,500
Oh god, I was paralyzed.

2073
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
That was bad. That was a bad time to be

2074
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,500
paralyzed. I'm still gonna win.

2075
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,500
Paralyze really does occasionally make the game

2076
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,500
really interesting.

2077
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
By preventing anything from happening.

2078
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
Well, yeah, you're like, I'm sure I can do this.

2079
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Oh wait, I can't. Whoa!

2080
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
You know.

2081
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
Whoa, bro.

2082
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Slow bro.

2083
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
Pherothorn is fucking OP.

2084
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,500
He is insane.

2085
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
I can defeat him. I know.

2086
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
Ever.

2087
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
And you know why I didn't use him on my team?

2088
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,500
What? Because he looked ugly.

2089
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
He's so good.

2090
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
He doesn't look terrible.

2091
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,500
He looks like Metacross.

2092
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
Why don't you just use Metagross then?

2093
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,500
Because it's not a situation.

2094
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500
He was in my first draft, but I didn't like that one very much.

2095
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,500
He's got those, that springly, sprangly

2096
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,500
thing going on.

2097
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,500
He sure does.

2098
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
These Pokemon cries are weird.

2099
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
Yes they are.

2100
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
It's like they're crying for help.

2101
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Almost.

2102
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
Most things do.

2103
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
I had ridden a creepypasta about this.

2104
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,500
Yeah. You turn around.

2105
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,500
Oh, they're red with blood.

2106
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
Oh.

2107
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
Their eyes went red with blood.

2108
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,500
They went bloody and attacked everybody.

2109
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
The spikes became real spikes.

2110
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
They were real spikes.

2111
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
And they shut it on my computer.

2112
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
Wait, what?

2113
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Pikachu paralyzed me for real.

2114
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Oh no. It's hyper realistic

2115
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
Slowbro.

2116
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
Zoom in on Slowbro's

2117
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
hyper real face.

2118
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Damn it.

2119
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Has Ben got all his Pokemon alive?

2120
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
Yeah.

2121
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Wow.

2122
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
His team

2123
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,500
completely counters mine.

2124
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
We should have used

2125
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
Vile Plume.

2126
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
Yeah, Vile Plume's nice.

2127
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
I gotta do it.

2128
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
I just need to fucking go for it.

2129
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
There's nothing I can do.

2130
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Just stab him with your head.

2131
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
You got spikes on it?

2132
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Yeah, there's nothing I can do.

2133
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
No, no, no, no.

2134
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,500
What?

2135
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,500
Super effective. Not even quite.

2136
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
Not even at all.

2137
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
You clearly have magic guard.

2138
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,500
No.

2139
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,500
Soft boiled leftovers.

2140
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
No.

2141
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
I want to

2142
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
defeat.

2143
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
It could move.

2144
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
It's crazy.

2145
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
No.

2146
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,500
Come up to the home stretch,

2147
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
ladies and gentlemen.

2148
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
Don't you have two packet men?

2149
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
No.

2150
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,500
Wife who keeps getting beaten like the wife she is.

2151
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,500
No.

2152
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,500
Oh.

2153
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,500
But he could come back

2154
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,500
because he's continually healing.

2155
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
If you sweep with...

2156
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Okay, okay, I got him.

2157
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
No, I can't.

2158
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,500
I gotta do so.

2159
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
Sweep up.

2160
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,500
Sweep up with that broom.

2161
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,500
Is there a broom Pokemon?

2162
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,500
Is it OP? It should be.

2163
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,500
Yeah, it should be.

2164
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,500
It's abilities and it swoops away all the hazards.

2165
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Come on and crit. Please give me a crit.

2166
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
If now is the fucking time.

2167
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
Oh no.

2168
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
It's a battle of attrition.

2169
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
What does that mean?

2170
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,500
I think it's irrelevant here.

2171
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
You know, it's a battle

2172
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
for fucking gay people who don't matter.

2173
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
Like the war in Afghanistan?

2174
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,500
No.

2175
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
The Afghanistan people are just goons,

2176
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,500
so I don't care about them.

2177
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,500
Gugliayistan.

2178
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,500
Gugliayran.

2179
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Okay.

2180
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
What I'm doing right here

2181
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
is not what I should be doing.

2182
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Um...

2183
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,500
You know, what would be really cool

2184
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,500
is if you two were both recording

2185
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
and you could...

2186
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
there would be like onscreen

2187
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
like what are you hovering over?

2188
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Like what are you gonna do?

2189
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,500
But instead I'm just looking at

2190
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
what happens afterwards.

2191
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
I am hovering really intensely right now.

2192
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
Yeah.

2193
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
You gotta figure out what to do

2194
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
in case you wanna be gay

2195
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
or in case you wanna be straight.

2196
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
That's what all decisions come down to.

2197
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,500
It's not right or wrong, it's being straight.

2198
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
You care straight.

2199
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
Shit.

2200
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Damn it.

2201
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Oh.

2202
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
Oh.

2203
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
This bell is fucking terrible.

2204
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
He punched him, he punched him,

2205
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
he gonna slap him in the face.

2206
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
But instead,

2207
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
he's soft-boiled.

2208
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
Quick, use attack.

2209
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
That's all I can do.

2210
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
You can just attack.

2211
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
These turns are lasting a year now.

2212
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Yeah.

2213
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Um...

2214
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
Hang on, what the fuck does stored power do?

2215
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
It's psychic type, okay.

2216
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
Yeah, sure, sure it is.

2217
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
Sure it is.

2218
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
A melon bullet is used all four of its moves

2219
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
so I can see all of them.

2220
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
Oh, pink one.

2221
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
Oh, I've made a mistake.

2222
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,500
I have made a mistake.

2223
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,500
Ah, damn.

2224
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
Super mega.

2225
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,500
It sure did grow.

2226
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500
It's got those...

2227
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Those little dingley doodles.

2228
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Are you not entertained?

2229
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
Well, you shouldn't be because

2230
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,500
this is very interesting.

2231
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,500
I might speed up

2232
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,500
or cut out in between

2233
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
nothing happening.

2234
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,500
Yeah, me.

2235
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,500
But I won't, probably.

2236
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,500
Some of this is real important.

2237
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,500
Oh no.

2238
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,500
What a shame.

2239
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,500
Oh dear.

2240
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,500
Oh dear.

2241
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,500
Oh, Nisama.

2242
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,500
Oh.

2243
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
Fuck, Mudboy's dead.

2244
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,500
He looks cool.

2245
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Oh Nisama.

2246
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,500
Taunt?

2247
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,500
Taunt?

2248
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,500
I mean, you can't...

2249
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,500
No, I just, like, I think

2250
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,500
there are no different games with taunt.

2251
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,500
What?!

2252
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Whoa! Is he gonna sweep?

2253
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,500
I'm not gonna be able to sweep.

2254
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,500
You can, you killed a guy.

2255
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,500
No, I'm not gonna be able to.

2256
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
Just use your grenade.

2257
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,500
Just use my life grenades

2258
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,500
and start off shotguns.

2259
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
Sort of grenades.

2260
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
Yes, exactly.

2261
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
They explode real good.

2262
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2263
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,500
Yeah, I know, I know.

2264
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
I should have done this years ago.

2265
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
It's Red Ranger.

2266
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
Use Dino City.

2267
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
I forgot about paralysis.

2268
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,500
But I'm still gonna die.

2269
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
There's nothing I could possibly...

2270
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
Oh!

2271
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
He got his power.

2272
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,500
There's nothing I could possibly do right now.

2273
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
What, is this depressed chi?

2274
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,500
Instead of munchy?

2275
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,500
Shit, shit, shit.

2276
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,500
There's nothing I could possibly do right now.

2277
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,500
Shut the fuck up, I'm gonna kill you.

2278
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,500
There's nothing I could possibly do right now

2279
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,500
to impact this situation.

2280
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
Okay.

2281
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Let's just end the game then.

2282
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Alright, well he caught him with a big

2283
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
swish.

2284
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Well, there's actually nothing I could do now.

2285
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,500
I'm gonna make you...

2286
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,500
No! No!

2287
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,500
Oh, oh...

2288
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,500
Just one more whank, I mean punch.

2289
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,500
God damn it!

2290
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,500
Did he get paralyzed again?

2291
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
Oh, he did.

2292
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,500
Yes!

2293
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,500
Let's have a look at Waifu's stats.

2294
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
She's got 10 soft boils left.

2295
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
So that might be enough to survive this whole match.

2296
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,500
What will Ben be doing?

2297
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
Basically giving valuable information to my opponent.

2298
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,500
Well, he can hover over, right?

2299
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,500
No, he can't!

2300
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,500
Can he not? No!

2301
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
I mean, I can see some things.

2302
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
I can see the moves he's used before.

2303
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,500
I can see his possible

2304
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,500
speed values.

2305
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,500
But you can't see how many times he's used the...

2306
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,500
Alright.

2307
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,500
Yeah, I can see how many times.

2308
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,500
Okay, so there you go.

2309
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,500
I'm totally in the right.

2310
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
Oh no, if this were a judge and a jury,

2311
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
then you would be the jury.

2312
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
And I'd be the gesture.

2313
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
I'd be jury Seinfeld.

2314
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
I like that show, it's a good show.

2315
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
I've never seen it.

2316
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
Oh no, I'm dead.

2317
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
Thank you, thank you.

2318
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
Oh no.

2319
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Oh no.

2320
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
Ben St. Wins Ding Ding.

2321
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
Oh no.

2322
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Is this the first round of this one?

2323
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
Yeah, that was the first round.

2324
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
So how do you think that went munchy?

2325
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,500
I hate him.

2326
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
Ben, do you have any words?

2327
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Do you have any words?

2328
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
I...

2329
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
I almost fucked it up and let him

2330
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
his Clefable sweep.

2331
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
And then...

2332
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,500
I got real unlucky with paralysis,

2333
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
but there was never any chance.

2334
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Nobody has any

2335
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
fucking clue what they're doing

2336
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
when they face me.

2337
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,500
No one. No one has the single clue.

2338
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
Not one person in the entire fucking world.

2339
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,500
Starting off with the Japanese man

2340
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
versus the Mexican.

2341
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
Jeez, yeah.

2342
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
Because he's got a lot of hair, right?

2343
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,500
And the Japanese man

2344
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
is a power ranger.

2345
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
Of course, of course.

2346
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
There's my reasoning behind that.

2347
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,500
Oh, and he jumped on a bird's head.

2348
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
That's gotta hurt the bird.

2349
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,500
Fuck.

2350
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,500
Ooh, he's on burn.

2351
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
He's getting insulted.

2352
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,500
Sick bird's bird.

2353
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
It's okay, I know exactly what to do.

2354
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,500
Are you gonna do

2355
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,500
win game?

2356
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
It's my favorite move.

2357
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
What the fuck?

2358
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,500
Why didn't that work?

2359
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
Sucker punch. What else didn't work?

2360
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,500
Wait. Why didn't that work?

2361
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,500
Sucker punch doesn't work.

2362
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,500
Oh my god, it's because your priority's higher, isn't it?

2363
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
It's because you have double...

2364
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,500
Oh, god.

2365
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
You used it twice and it fell both times.

2366
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,500
It's complicated.

2367
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Maybe you should just lay...

2368
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
lay off the sauce.

2369
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
I keep tapping over, but I'm not supposed to

2370
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,500
because I'm recording and I hate that.

2371
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,500
Lay off the sauce.

2372
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,500
That was fucking abominable.

2373
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,500
Like the snowman.

2374
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,500
That was the worst.

2375
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,500
That was the worst B'sharp has ever performed.

2376
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
That was pretty quick death.

2377
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,500
Alright, so we're starting with Munchy getting

2378
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,500
an advantage with the Pokemon amount.

2379
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
But anyways, we all know that doesn't mean Jack.

2380
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,500
Oh no.

2381
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,500
Oh, it parallelsed.

2382
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Oh no.

2383
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,500
Oh no!

2384
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
Why does he use many spikes?

2385
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,500
Holy fucking shit.

2386
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,500
Three in a row.

2387
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500
Paralysis is like 25%.

2388
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
So that is

2389
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
statistically

2390
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,500
Paralysis and abominable.

2391
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,500
Okay, good.

2392
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,500
I like it.

2393
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
Yeah, you think you know shit.

2394
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,500
You think you know fuck shit.

2395
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
Damn it.

2396
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500
Everybody knows shit fuck.

2397
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
You know what I'm gonna do.

2398
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,500
You know what I'm gonna fucking do.

2399
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,500
Something about his skin.

2400
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
This is not a whole lot you can do, buddy.

2401
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
It looks like a chocolate eclair

2402
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,500
or like a glazed chocolate donut

2403
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,500
or something.

2404
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
I like it.

2405
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
But he's got a skull face.

2406
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
I don't eat donuts with skulls.

2407
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,500
That's not cool.

2408
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Oh shit.

2409
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
Whatever.

2410
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,500
Well what? Flash fire.

2411
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,500
He's immune to fire attacks

2412
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
and if he gets hit by one

2413
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
his fire gets

2414
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
stronger.

2415
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
Impressive.

2416
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
Impressive.

2417
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
Two frags in two seconds.

2418
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,500
Impressive.

2419
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,500
You thought I was gonna

2420
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
thunder wave.

2421
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,500
Nah, I just didn't fucking care about

2422
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,500
what bird.

2423
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,500
What bird?

2424
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
Turned down for bird.

2425
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
Oh no.

2426
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
Oh dear.

2427
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,500
The stakes are never higher.

2428
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,500
Oh no.

2429
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,500
Never higher than right now.

2430
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,500
And he's missing a little bit

2431
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
of mud.

2432
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
Mr. Saturday, it's you.

2433
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,500
Mr. Saturday.

2434
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,500
And it's Mr. Saturday.

2435
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,500
I predicted you bitch.

2436
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
Oh no.

2437
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,500
He's hurt by poison but don't worry

2438
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,500
because he's about to reek.

2439
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,500
It was all just an elaborate meme.

2440
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
He's going to 9-11

2441
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,500
with a meteor.

2442
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,500
It was all just an elaborate meme

2443
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,500
to get you to get a boner.

2444
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,500
That's what you did.

2445
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
You got a boner.

2446
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
No.

2447
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,500
No.

2448
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,500
He played you like a damn

2449
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,500
piano.

2450
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,500
Shit.

2451
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,500
He played you like a damn video game.

2452
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
It's pretty fun.

2453
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
Pink buffet.

2454
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,500
Bullet, I mean.

2455
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,500
Oh fuck.

2456
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,500
You're one point faster

2457
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,500
than me.

2458
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Well you know.

2459
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,500
You're one point faster

2460
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,500
than me.

2461
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,500
Well you know.

2462
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,500
I don't.

2463
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,500
Bullish.

2464
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,500
Yeah, truly.

2465
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Boom.

2466
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,500
Truly.

2467
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,500
I did it. I fucking did it.

2468
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
Truly.

2469
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,500
Well it is Godzilla.

2470
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,500
I didn't realize that when I said it was Godzilla before.

2471
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
Yeah.

2472
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
Oh, it got a Gmail

2473
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
message.

2474
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,500
Someone subscribed to my Twitch account

2475
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
at munchie

2476
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,500
at twitch.tv

2477
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,500
slash munchie wears tiny hats.

2478
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,500
Whoa.

2479
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,500
I'm subscribed to you.

2480
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
Yeah, you're a newly ascended master.

2481
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,500
That's what we call our followers.

2482
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,500
Newly ascended master.

2483
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,500
I would go, but I don't know what you do

2484
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,500
on that channel.

2485
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,500
What do you do?

2486
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,500
Advertise.

2487
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
Sometimes I play video games.

2488
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,500
Other times I twiddle on my clip

2489
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,500
and I do nothing.

2490
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,500
Which one of those is better?

2491
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,500
Yeah, man.

2492
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
Go on.

2493
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,500
Well, if you're

2494
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,500
in it to win it, then you know

2495
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,500
how to bebop and scat all around

2496
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,500
Manhattan.

2497
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
Yes.

2498
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,500
Godzilla dead.

2499
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,500
Oh, Godzilla.

2500
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,500
Egg with leg.

2501
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,500
Comin' at ya with his face.

2502
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
Spikey though he is.

2503
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,500
He has a soul that is very soft

2504
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,500
and nice.

2505
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
He has a hard outer shell

2506
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,500
and a soft inner shell.

2507
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,500
Hold on, I gotta open up the damage calculator

2508
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,500
again.

2509
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,500
I gotta open up

2510
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,500
the damage calculator.

2511
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,500
One plus two is three

2512
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,500
damage.

2513
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,500
Yeah, you don't know that.

2514
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,500
Ah, it dunes.

2515
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,500
I think I know what your calculator is.

2516
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,500
It's not that good.

2517
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,500
I need to blow my nose

2518
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,500
but there's nothing in sight.

2519
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,500
There's nothing in reach.

2520
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,500
I can't blow my nose.

2521
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,500
It's just gonna slowly come out and go into my beard

2522
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,500
and I'm gonna have to just deal with it.

2523
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Meanwhile, in Pokemon,

2524
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
nothing is happening still.

2525
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
They're staring each other down.

2526
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,500
The waifu is staring at Mellon Bullet

2527
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,500
and he's doing a little hip, hip, hip,

2528
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,500
hip, hip, dance.

2529
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,500
He's not intimidating at all.

2530
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,500
It's very cute, actually.

2531
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,500
Mellon Bullet is doing a little shakey-shake

2532
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,500
because his legs are made of springs.

2533
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,500
It's got spring legs.

2534
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,500
They're vine springs.

2535
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,500
Vine springs.

2536
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,500
As actual.

2537
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
Actual.

2538
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,500
And now we got Slowbro who, honestly,

2539
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,500
his design is annoying.

2540
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,500
You are the worst person.

2541
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,500
Yeah, it looks like Ben do, don't you think?

2542
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,500
It looks like a Pokemon

2543
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,500
that's just like, I'd rather have anything.

2544
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,500
Anything else.

2545
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,500
Tentacruel is my favorite

2546
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,500
water Pokemon, I think.

2547
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,500
That's a good Pokemon.

2548
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,500
He's big and he's a fucking evil guy

2549
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,500
because he's got angry eyes.

2550
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
Angry eyes are the best types of Pokemon.

2551
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,500
He should be a genre

2552
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,500
of angry eye to recall.

2553
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,500
I completely 100% agree.

2554
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,500
Like Voltorb? Voltorb's pretty great.

2555
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,500
It's perhaps okay.

2556
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,500
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta

2557
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,500
put the kibosh on this waifu situation

2558
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,500
before it gets out of hand.

2559
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,500
Just waifu situation.

2560
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,500
Yes.

2561
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,500
Oh, dear.

2562
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,500
That's more than I

2563
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,500
can prepare to accept.

2564
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,500
Oh, no!

2565
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,500
Taunt ended.

2566
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,500
That's not fair.

2567
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,500
That can't happen.

2568
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,500
That, that can not happen.

2569
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,500
What the fuck?

2570
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,500
Yes!

2571
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,500
That was, that was

2572
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,500
alright. I thought Munchy had a chance

2573
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
but now he only has a moustache

2574
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,500
and a guy.

2575
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,500
And everyone knows that

2576
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,500
a Mexican can't defeat a diamond

2577
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,500
in the rough.

2578
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,500
Well, it's not that rough.

2579
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,500
It's like a park, you know,

2580
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,500
bench.

2581
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,500
It's like quite nice.

2582
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
Gigadran.

2583
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
Yes.

2584
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,500
Well, wait a minute. Maybe it's not Mexican.

2585
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,500
Maybe it's Jamaican and it's got dreadlocks

2586
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,500
and that's a lot of dreadlocks.

2587
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,500
Maybe it's not any nationally, huh?

2588
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,500
Maybe, maybe it just wants to live

2589
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,500
its life just like you and me.

2590
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,500
I don't believe that anyone wants to live

2591
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,500
their life just like you or me.

2592
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,500
I think they have to be different

2593
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,500
and identifiable and

2594
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,500
ridiculable.

2595
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,500
The main quality I look for in people is

2596
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,500
ridiculable.

2597
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,500
You gotta be able to laugh at something

2598
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,500
and if you can't, it's not very funny.

2599
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,500
Not very worth your time.

2600
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Okay, we got friend version 2.0.

2601
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,500
Something bit his butt

2602
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,500
and he stood up but he didn't do

2603
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,500
anything about it.

2604
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,500
We got 3 vs 1.

2605
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Oh no.

2606
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,500
I used healing wish

2607
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,500
and I sacrificed plane bullet

2608
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,500
to give melon bullet a second lease on life.

2609
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,500
Oh, it's over.

2610
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
Now he's got a leech on friend.

2611
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,500
Oh, it's over.

2612
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Yeah, man.

2613
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,500
He's got a leech on friends life.

2614
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,500
The video's over.

2615
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
You thought I was

2616
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500
cruise?

2617
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
Roll the credits, bro.

2618
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
Oh, it's over.

2619
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,500
I swept it.

2620
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,500
I fucking swept this tournament.

2621
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,500
Oh, no.

2622
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,500
Swipped it under the rug.

2623
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
Nobody'll know about it.

2624
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,500
Oh, no.

2625
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,500
It's over.

2626
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,500
It doesn't actually do.

2627
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,500
All my planning

2628
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,500
paid off.

2629
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,500
Oh my god.

2630
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,500
Guys, you know,

2631
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,500
champion will be out

2632
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,500
three days later than it

2633
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,500
otherwise would have been,

2634
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
but at least I've beaten my chief fucking Pokemon.

2635
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
I would say it was a worthy cause

2636
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,500
because you're happy about it, but I don't care.

2637
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,500
Cool.

2638
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,500
I wouldn't watch this video.

2639
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500
I'd leave a comment saying no.

2640
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,500
End it.

2641
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,500
It's okay. Nobody watches

2642
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,500
Rowdy fucker's cop killing.

2643
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,500
Enough of this.

2644
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,500
The first one got is like the least.

2645
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
Oh, yeah. No, yeah.

2646
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,500
It has like 2000.

2647
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,500
I've still never gone back and watched that,

2648
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,500
even though I had the time.

2649
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,500
Oh, god.

2650
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:15,500
Now, hold on.

2651
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
The grand finale is going to be something special

2652
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,500
that I prepared just for you.

2653
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,500
Wait, there's more?

2654
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,500
Just a very quick thing.

2655
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,500
Did Ben win every single...

2656
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,500
Yeah, he did.

2657
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Win every single type of match.

2658
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
Yes.

2659
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,500
You were fun.

2660
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,500
I'm the best. Wait, random?

2661
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
Oh, okay.

2662
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,500
I'll do it.

2663
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,500
Wait, they're different levels?

2664
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,500
Yeah, a little bit.

2665
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
Well, we got Polirath,

2666
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
which is a cool guy,

2667
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
and Zekrom, which is a fucking

2668
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,500
dark drill.

2669
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,500
Oh, and you can't see the enemy's Pokemon.

2670
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,500
Why aren't they all like that?

2671
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,500
No clue. It was random.

2672
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,500
You're not allowed to know what you have.

2673
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,500
Oh, my god.

2674
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,500
Yeah, I can see what I have.

2675
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,500
Down at the bottom.

2676
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,500
Wow.

2677
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,500
I don't know what you're looking at,

2678
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,500
but I'm looking at some real fucking intense shit

2679
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,500
on my side.

2680
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,500
You pretty much always get the big guys in this.

2681
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,500
I like Polirath's little

2682
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,500
little leg crease.

2683
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,500
What the fuck is that?

2684
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,500
It's awesome.

2685
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
Oh, my god, I love Kling Kling.

2686
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,500
Let's look at...

2687
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,500
He's so good.

2688
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,500
What does Zekrom turn into a little guy?

2689
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,500
It's a substitute.

2690
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,500
Oh, god, what's good against steel?

2691
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,500
Fighting ground

2692
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,500
and fire.

2693
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,500
Kling Kling vs. Magnemite.

2694
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,500
OTP.

2695
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,500
Oh, my god, it's war.

2696
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,500
It's why, why?

2697
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,500
No, it's not.

2698
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,500
It's Zed.

2699
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
It's the Z Snake.

2700
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,500
Shit.

2701
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,500
What is one level 81

2702
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,500
level 76?

2703
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,500
That's kind of unfair.

2704
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,500
Are you...

2705
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,500
Don't fuck with me, Kling Kling.

2706
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,500
Shit.

2707
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
Oh, no.

2708
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
Dang, I didn't go that well.

2709
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,500
No, yeah.

2710
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,500
Not even close.

2711
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,500
That fucking legendary

2712
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
bug snake

2713
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
friend.

2714
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,500
What is it?

2715
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,500
Oh, you did it.

2716
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,500
Oh, yeah.

2717
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,500
Extreme speed on Zygarde.

2718
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,500
You did it. You absolutely did it.

2719
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,500
Sylveon.

2720
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,500
That's just a whatever.

2721
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,500
I've seen him before.

2722
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
Oh, wow.

2723
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
Does one of you have the god?

2724
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,500
That's close enough.

2725
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Yeah.

2726
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,500
Oh.

2727
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,500
I hate Sylveon.

2728
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,500
Sylveon always fucks with me.

2729
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,500
I don't like it.

2730
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,500
We used to use it to accelerate.

2731
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,500
What are you talking about? I don't even know what that means.

2732
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
You need to find your soul and you need to go faster.

2733
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,500
Oh, is that...

2734
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,500
Is that all that did?

2735
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Wow.

2736
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,500
You got two legendaries

2737
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,500
from the same game already.

2738
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,500
Three.

2739
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,500
No, yeah, yeah, yeah. From the same game.

2740
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
We have three legendaries altogether.

2741
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,500
Wow.

2742
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
So much he has no legendaries yet.

2743
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,500
As far as I know.

2744
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,500
That seems like a bit of a wish.

2745
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,500
But he's still

2746
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,500
giggle with.

2747
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,500
Man, all my Pokemon are so fucking big.

2748
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,500
I know, dude. They got big and meaty.

2749
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,500
Just like your fucking butt.

2750
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,500
Yeah.

2751
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,500
Oh, it's egg face.

2752
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,500
This is the meme one.

2753
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,500
I want to zoom in, but I can't.

2754
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,500
I don't want to look at the entire video.

2755
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,500
Just one of his faces.

2756
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500
I just want to see his face.

2757
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,500
But he's so pixel-y.

2758
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,500
I like his dance.

2759
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,500
He's a happy fellow.

2760
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,500
Yeah, he's not going to be too happy when he's dead.

2761
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,500
Come on, Zekrom.

2762
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,500
Hang in there.

2763
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,500
Oh, God, Leechsea is so good.

2764
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,500
Look at this, Zekrom.

2765
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,500
Zekrom is a

2766
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,500
dragon electric.

2767
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,500
Nice job, dude.

2768
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,500
How do you have two?

2769
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,500
I just do, dude.

2770
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,500
How did you have two citrus berries?

2771
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,500
Oh, you got harvest.

2772
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,500
I just do, dude.

2773
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,500
You got harvest.

2774
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,500
I just do, dude.

2775
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,500
The rest of my team

2776
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
is not prepared to deal with Executor.

2777
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,500
Executor?

2778
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,500
I'm not

2779
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:25,500
prepared for this.

2780
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,500
It doesn't count.

2781
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,500
Shit.

2782
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
Shit.

2783
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,500
Well, you know,

2784
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:35,500
you know what they say,

2785
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,500
if you can't eat them, beat them.

2786
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Well, you can eat them.

2787
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,500
He's a coconut.

2788
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,500
What?

2789
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,500
I don't understand this at all.

2790
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,500
You can eat coconuts all day.

2791
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
It's a ferraligator.

2792
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,500
Yes.

2793
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
There's now Ode his name,

2794
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
so I don't like it.

2795
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,500
Check him a little typey charty.

2796
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,500
Yeah.

2797
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,500
The news is not good.

2798
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,500
But maybe.

2799
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,500
Wait.

2800
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,500
Wait.

2801
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,500
Nobody will wait.

2802
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,500
No, it's bad.

2803
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,500
It's all bad.

2804
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,500
Okay, I've only got one choice,

2805
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,500
and I am...

2806
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,500
Oh, my God.

2807
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,500
Why don't those two work together?

2808
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,500
Never mind.

2809
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,500
No!

2810
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,500
Oh, wow.

2811
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,500
How the fuck?

2812
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:43,500
That was quite the meatier.

2813
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,500
Didn't do shit.

2814
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
Also, why is my...

2815
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,500
Why is my...

2816
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,500
Why is my special attack not...

2817
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,500
Oh, it's because it wasn't here.

2818
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,500
No, man.

2819
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,500
See?

2820
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,500
Ironhead.

2821
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,500
What the fuck?

2822
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:05,500
Oh, it's running around on you.

2823
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:09,500
Straight from chuckling to what?

2824
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,500
God damn it.

2825
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,500
Come on, come on, come on, boy.

2826
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,500
Ah, shit.

2827
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:17,500
What is that?

2828
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
Mellowetta?

2829
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,500
I've never seen a Mellowetta before,

2830
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
but it is fucking cool.

2831
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,500
Is that a legendary? I hope it's not.

2832
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,500
Yeah, it is.

2833
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,500
It's a mythical.

2834
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:33,500
It looks like a little Indian girl,

2835
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,500
like a Native American,

2836
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,500
with feathers in her hair, you know?

2837
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,500
Yeah, a little band.

2838
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,500
No, it's me.

2839
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
No, it's me, too.

2840
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,500
Thanks, Dad.

2841
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,500
Thanks, Dad, for saying that you know.

2842
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,500
Here we go.

2843
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,500
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

2844
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,500
Oh, that was...

2845
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,500
What is it with meatiers of not being effective

2846
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,500
and how can people just throw actual meatiers

2847
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,500
into the planet

2848
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
without ruining everybody?

2849
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,500
It should be illegal, you know.

2850
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,500
Draco Meteor is a special attack?

2851
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
What the fuck?

2852
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
Dragon Dance raises attack,

2853
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,500
but Draco Meteor is a special attack.

2854
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,500
What a broken game.

2855
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
What a broken game.

2856
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
It is a broken game.

2857
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,500
It doesn't even work.

2858
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,500
Dude, I unboxed this game

2859
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
from my loot crate,

2860
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
and dude, not even fucking...

2861
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,500
I'm refunding it.

2862
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
Yes!

2863
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,500
I didn't think that would actually work.

2864
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,500
It's 4 vs 3.

2865
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,500
Well, Ben has one Pokemon he hasn't shown yet.

2866
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,500
I want to see what it is.

2867
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,500
I really...

2868
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:41,500
Show it, show it, show it, show it.

2869
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,500
Ben?

2870
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,500
No.

2871
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,500
Come on.

2872
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
What if it's really good?

2873
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,500
I flinched him.

2874
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,500
I did it, though.

2875
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,500
Show it, show it, show it.

2876
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,500
We gotta see it.

2877
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,500
Oh, it's Luna.

2878
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:01,500
It's Luna.

2879
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
It's Luna.

2880
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,500
I actually like that Pokemon.

2881
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,500
It's funny.

2882
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,500
It's got a beak.

2883
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,500
Oh, I think...

2884
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,500
Yep.

2885
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,500
Okay.

2886
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,500
Here we go.

2887
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,500
I don't know what aura break means.

2888
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,500
Come on.

2889
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,500
Come on.

2890
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,500
Yes, yes.

2891
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,500
Can I do it? Oh, no!

2892
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,500
Oh, wait, no.

2893
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:31,500
I'm super fucked.

2894
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,500
I'm super fucked because your last Pokemon

2895
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,500
is whatever name is.

2896
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
Silvio, hey.

2897
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
Sephiroth.

2898
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,500
Use meteor again.

2899
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,500
No, no, no, no, no.

2900
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,500
Oh.

2901
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,500
Da-da-da-da-da.

2902
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,500
Shit.

2903
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:55,500
What a weird wish to have.

2904
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,500
I wish for more hit points.

2905
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,500
Why did you just wish for the other Pokemon to die?

2906
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,500
I agree.

2907
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:05,500
Pokemon don't know what's best for them.

2908
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,500
Well, this could go

2909
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,500
every single direction.

2910
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,500
But upward,

2911
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,500
because I don't really like that.

2912
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,500
I don't like...

2913
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,500
I like getting it up

2914
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,500
in a sexual way.

2915
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,500
Oh, dear.

2916
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,500
This is it.

2917
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,500
This is the one.

2918
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,500
Whoever wins this wins the whole thing.

2919
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,500
Doesn't even matter about the other ones.

2920
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,500
Only now do you know this.

2921
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,500
What are my options?

2922
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:41,500
Oh, no!

2923
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,500
Oh, my God.

2924
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,500
I have a choice band!

2925
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,500
No!

2926
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,500
What's that?

2927
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,500
I shouldn't have said that.

2928
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,500
I'm dead.

2929
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,500
I can't believe it.

2930
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,500
I can't believe it.

2931
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,500
Then one anyway.

2932
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,500
Yeah.

2933
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,500
Damn it.

2934
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,500
Shit.

2935
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
I really screwed the pooch on this one.

2936
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,500
You want to do another one?

2937
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,500
One more.

2938
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,500
Random battle?

2939
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,500
Yeah, of course.

2940
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,500
There's no such thing as not random battles.

2941
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,500
Check it out, dude.

2942
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,500
It's Goo Goo.

2943
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,500
What a Goo at Pokemon.

2944
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,500
Nope.

2945
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
Not actually.

2946
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,500
It has been Goo'd.

2947
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,500
Ew, it's dripping.

2948
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,500
I love how it's dripping.

2949
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,500
Yeah, I love how it's 3D model actually drips.

2950
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,500
Look at this piece of shit I have.

2951
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,500
I'm just going to send it out so I can die.

2952
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
Oof-a-zant.

2953
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,500
Look at this meme.

2954
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,500
Wait.

2955
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,500
That's like a turkey.

2956
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,500
Damn it.

2957
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,500
What the fuck is tailwind?

2958
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,500
It doubles your entire team's speed.

2959
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,500
Oh.

2960
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,500
That's cool, I guess.

2961
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,500
I don't know if it lasts if you switch.

2962
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,500
There's three turns.

2963
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,500
It doesn't.

2964
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,500
So it lasts through switching.

2965
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,500
God damn it, Goodra.

2966
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,500
Dude, just gotta-

2967
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,500
Goodra, would you please?

2968
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,500
Please, Goodra.

2969
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,500
Goodra, would you fucking please?

2970
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,500
Just work with me.

2971
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,500
Goodra, why?

2972
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,500
I shouldn't have stayed in this long.

2973
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,500
Okay, yeah, it's fine then.

2974
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,500
No, actually that sucks.

2975
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
Yeah.

2976
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,500
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

2977
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,500
He's got extra smooths.

2978
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,500
Whoa.

2979
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,500
Hey, come on.

2980
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,500
That's so cold.

2981
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,500
Get it together.

2982
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:13,500
You know, I'd sully this commentary with-

2983
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,500
I wanted to throw you off your guard.

2984
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:19,500
Get your act together right now.

2985
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,500
Oh, Samorot.

2986
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:25,500
Oh, but I shot you.

2987
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,500
Uh...

2988
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,500
Die.

2989
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,500
I will fucking die.

2990
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,500
Sellaby again.

2991
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,500
Yeah.

2992
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
Ooh, Altaria, it's a big fluffy baby.

2993
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:45,500
Correct.

2994
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,500
Took me a second and I had to cough,

2995
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,500
but I've come to the conclusion that yes, you were right.

2996
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,500
Um, um, um, um, um...

2997
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,500
We're just looking at it.

2998
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,500
It's just so cool.

2999
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,500
I've never seen better.

3000
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,500
Seen better what?

3001
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,500
Seen better what and where and when?

3002
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,500
So I can go and I can kill it so I can be number one.

3003
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,500
Big, big fluffy wings.

3004
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,500
They're hypnotizing.

3005
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,500
It's the floatiest ass Pokemon I've ever seen.

3006
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,500
Why's it got to be down on the ground?

3007
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,500
Oh, shit.

3008
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,500
Why did I do that? It was foolish.

3009
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,500
It was foolhardy and I should be shot.

3010
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:29,500
You, you, you've, you've done it now.

3011
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:33,500
Check this shit right out, Boyo.

3012
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:35,500
Bam.

3013
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:37,500
Whoa, it's even fluffier.

3014
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,500
Look how big.

3015
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:41,500
That's all I have to say.

3016
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:43,500
Look how big.

3017
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:45,500
Look how big.

3018
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:47,500
That is the biggest fluff I've ever seen.

3019
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,500
I've...

3020
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,500
No!

3021
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:53,500
Don't kill it.

3022
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,500
It's too cute to die.

3023
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,500
Here.

3024
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,500
It's too cute to die.

3025
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,500
Here.

3026
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,500
Here.

3027
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:05,500
Oh, thought you would switch.

3028
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,500
Yeah.

3029
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:09,500
Why would I, why on earth?

3030
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,500
I...

3031
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,500
I don't know.

3032
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,500
It's so foolish.

3033
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:17,500
Okay. Okay, though.

3034
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:21,500
Alright, this, this battle is for the entire thing.

3035
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,500
Yeah.

3036
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,500
No.

3037
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,500
No, come on.

3038
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,500
You can just say I, that didn't count, but I'll work.

3039
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:31,500
This isn't, this isn't real.

3040
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:35,500
Well, of course it's not, because it's a Porygon.

3041
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,500
Porygon.

3042
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:41,500
How did, how did they render Porygon to, so...

3043
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,500
No!

3044
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,500
They just put him inside the computer.

3045
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,500
They just put him inside the computer.

3046
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,500
Yeah.

3047
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,500
Oh, yeah.

3048
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,500
Oh, it's, it's, it's, it's you.

3049
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,500
Yeah, it's waifu, dude.

3050
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,500
It's clear fabley.

3051
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:59,500
No!

3052
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,500
More like dead fable.

3053
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,500
That was a fable of a previous time of the past.

3054
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,500
In the past it's dead, it's gone.

3055
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,500
Yeah.

3056
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,500
As in dictionary.

3057
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:11,500
You're gonna be like the history books.

3058
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,500
I don't have anything.

3059
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:17,500
Oh, shit, is, won't she gonna come away with a win after all this?

3060
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,500
Will he win?

3061
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,500
Yeah.

3062
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:23,500
Oh, this is funny.

3063
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,500
Syllaby, use rape.

3064
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,500
It's super effective.

3065
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,500
Super effective.

3066
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,500
Against the matriarchy.

3067
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:37,500
It's Armaldo, that's pretty cool.

3068
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,500
He's got funny eyes.

3069
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:43,500
Why are all my pokemons slow, asshole?

3070
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:45,500
Like all of them were fucking slow.

3071
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,500
They were all super slow.

3072
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,500
Is that a fucking emperor?

3073
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:51,500
Is that a fucking emperor?

3074
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:53,500
He's dead.

3075
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,500
And Munchy takes the victory!

3076
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,500
Get out.

3077
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,500
Get, get out.

3078
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:01,500
Munchy for the ultimate win.

3079
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:03,500
We didn't even see the other Pokemon yet.

3080
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,500
What other Pokemon did you have?

3081
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:07,500
It was...

3082
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,500
Samurai and that, that light fish.

3083
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,500
It was, it was some fucking bitch.

3084
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,500
And a bird.

3085
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,500
And it was another bitch, and it was another bitch.

3086
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,500
Ben, it's been great playing with you, but you know,

3087
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,500
if you mess with the best,

3088
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,500
then you get the horns.

3089
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:25,500
Oh, god.

3090
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,500
Well, the ultimate winner is...

3091
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:29,500
is Munchy.

3092
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,500
Yep, everyone, press one in chat if I do throw in Ben,

3093
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:33,500
and even though he beat me,

3094
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:35,500
in some battles it's not good.

3095
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,500
Everyone, press one in chat,

3096
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,500
if I'm gonna seal Ben away in my cage.

3097
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,500
My cage is shaved.

3098
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:43,500
Munchy, I work so hard.

3099
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,500
Don't take it away from me.

3100
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,500
Don't take it away from me.

3101
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,500
We'll let the viewers decide by their ones.

3102
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:51,500
Their ones will seal you away.

3103
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,500
Forever.

3104
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,500
You know, Yu-Gi-Oh, that's gonna be you.

3105
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:57,500
Just buried in a mountain of ones.

3106
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,500
Just fucked over.

3107
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,500
Just fucked over and over by ones.

3108
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,500
Guys, I forgot to let the viewers know,

3109
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:07,500
but if I won, then you had to make Vincent real,

3110
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,500
so you better get on with it.

3111
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,500
Oh, that's right.

3112
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,500
The deal that I never agreed to,

3113
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,500
but which I will nevertheless honor,

3114
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,500
because of what an honorable samurai I am,

3115
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,500
is that if I won...

3116
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,500
Wait, what the fuck was it?

3117
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,500
If I won...

3118
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,500
No, no, no, no, no.

3119
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,500
If I won, you have to make Vincent real from your comic,

3120
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,500
and if you win, then I get to make you

3121
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:31,500
Ben-Saint real,

3122
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:33,500
Ben-Saint real.

3123
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:35,500
If I win,

3124
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,500
then you get to make me real.

3125
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,500
Yeah, I remember.

3126
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,500
Okay, deal's a deal.

3127
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,500
Vincent is coming to a store near you.

3128
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,500
Not as a product,

3129
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,500
just as a guy.

3130
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:51,500
You'll see him in a store.

3131
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,500
He'll be buying something.

3132
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,500
At one time, the beta uprising

3133
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,500
will truly begin.

3134
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,500
It will.

3135
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,500
It already has.

3136
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,500
Our anti-sex crusade begins now.

3137
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,500
My name is not important.

3138
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:11,500
One of the important is what I'm going to do.

3139
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,500
I was just about to quote that

3140
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,500
drill tweet about the Brexit asexual again,

3141
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,500
but then I remember that I already did.

3142
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:19,500
I already said the Brexit asexual.

3143
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:21,500
It's such a good...

3144
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,500
Okay, I don't know how to end this.

3145
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:25,500
Alright, alright.

3146
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,500
I've had a fan...

3147
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,500
Yeah, it's been a good time.

3148
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,500
And you know what?

3149
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,500
I never competitively battled before,

3150
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:35,500
but in the days that I spent training

3151
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,500
for this engagement, I got really into it

3152
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,500
and it was really cool.

3153
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:41,500
It was way easier to get into

3154
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:43,500
than I thought it would be.

3155
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:45,500
I thought it would take weeks or months.

3156
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:47,500
I thought it would be like League of Legends

3157
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:49,500
where you can play your whole life

3158
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,500
and still be a piece of shit.

3159
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,500
No, I just looked up some stuff

3160
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:55,500
and figured it out.

3161
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:57,500
Well, it's partly team setup

3162
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:59,500
and then everything beyond that is mind games.

3163
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:01,500
It's just Minecraft.

3164
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,500
Yeah.

3165
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,500
If you're going to play anything with them,

3166
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:07,500
play Terraria.

3167
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,500
It's much better.

3168
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:11,500
I played that years ago.

3169
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,500
Get the Pokemon mode for Terraria.

3170
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:15,500
There will be Pokemon.

3171
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,500
Yes, exactly.

3172
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:19,500
Okay.

3173
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:21,500
Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.

3174
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:23,500
This has been the rowdy fucking cop killer.

3175
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,500
No, the rowdy fuckers cop killers.

3176
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,500
Fuckers cop killers

3177
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:29,500
with Ben St. and Munchy Shatsky.

3178
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,500
Yeah.

3179
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:33,500
Oh, no.

3180
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,500
Munchy Shatsky.

3181
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,500
Another one.

3182
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,500
Full name, Munchy Shatsky.

3183
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:41,500
And Hippocrite.

3184
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,500
Acting as...

3185
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,500
Orlando, Florida.

3186
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:47,500
That's his last name.

3187
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,500
Orlando Blue.

3188
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,500
Alright, are we calling it?

3189
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:53,500
Yeah, and from the bottom of my heart,

3190
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:59,500
I wish you a Merry Christmas night.

3191
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:03,500
I wish you a Merry Christmas, Chan.

3192
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:05,500
Okay, goodbye.
