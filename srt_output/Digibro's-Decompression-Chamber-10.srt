1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,800
All right, so on this week's show I'm going to do something a little, I'm going to try

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,040
something a little different and if I don't like it or if it seems if it comes off as weird and

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,080
inauthentic then I'm going to stop you know before I get too far into this podcast. You know I've

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:45,880
been listening, I always listen back to the decompression chamber after I post it and the last

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,160
episode I enjoyed it, I enjoyed getting to decompress and like make all these points about myself and

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,720
but you know I feel like I've been on on the defensive a lot on this show and just in general

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,160
this show is it's always one of two things it's always either me talking about how great things

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,320
are going and all these like amazing plans I have or how awesome my life is or defending myself

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,800
or the way I've done something from either someone or I don't know from the world at large

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,360
I always feel like this this show is kind of self aggrandizing and you know I've the biggest

11
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,280
accusation I get all the time like the biggest criticism people have of me is that I have a

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:38,040
giant ego or that I'm uh or I'm arrogant and stuff like that and I it's it's weird for me hearing

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,240
those complaints because I don't really think of that as a problem like and I explained this on a

14
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,960
on a previous episode you know on the the decompression chamber how like that egos kind of

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,240
what keeps me afloat and what helps me to get through um and I don't really understand how ego

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,680
is a problem it's like I'm doing something I like and I'm enjoying myself and uh you know

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,920
like where where does it become bad for me I understand how it can be bad for for someone

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,000
else for the audience like I can understand how it could it could piss you off to listen to someone

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,600
be so like kind of smug and self-satisfied and enjoying themselves too much maybe um especially

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,040
if you feel like you're not enjoying yourself in the same way I get that I get it as a reason not

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,760
to like me but as a criticism like as a constructive criticism it's not helpful because the ego

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,520
is not damaging me at all it's not hurting me it's not hurting uh you know what I'm doing

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,800
so I want to talk about I want to criticize myself on this episode I don't know how well this is

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,080
gonna go I'm not good at it not because I'm so egotistical that I can't see my flaws but because

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,560
a for me when people talk about their problems um I don't know there's always something weird

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,040
about it it always comes off as kind of kind of fake and half-hearted it's like well you obviously

27
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,440
well you obviously you know I don't know how to fucking phrase this I'm bad at even talking about

28
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,840
the concept of talking bad about myself it's like these are these are thoughts that are kind of

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,800
internal to me you know it's like if I talk about a problem I have with myself then the question

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,080
becomes why am I not fixing it you know like if if it's something I recognize as an issue

31
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,320
then either people are going to tell me how to fix it or I already know how to fix it but I'm not

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,000
for some reason and it's like to me those this kind of things should are things you internalize

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,680
because you know as soon as you admit it you feel like you have to work on it or something and um

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,240
maybe that's like maybe that's what I'm getting at here maybe I'm afraid to work on these issues

35
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,880
or I feel like it's wrong to to brag about your problems you know to like to to be like huh I'm

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,800
so shitty you know it just comes off I was like well dude then fucking fix it you know if it's such

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,200
a big problem then why the fuck are you complaining about it on the internet as opposed to fixing it

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,520
but but at the same time I don't necessarily feel that way when other people complain about themselves

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,080
I do sometimes especially if people complain about themselves all the time that I'm just like

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,040
at some point I just kind of think well if all you if all you ever do is have this issue why are

41
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,240
you not putting everything you have into resolving this issue you know especially for people who have

42
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:39,320
more issues than not like if your life is nothing but you know self-criticism and and constantly

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:47,240
worrying about like how shit you are then how is your entire focus not trying to fix those elements

44
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:56,600
you know but but nonetheless I have I have things about myself that I like look I look at me and I

45
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,960
think god I fucking hate you for that you know I hate that you do that um and some of them some of

46
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,240
these things are not even things that I that I so much hate about myself because I enjoy doing them

47
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,840
like I enjoy being shitty in some ways I just know that it's it's bad of me or for me to do these

48
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,800
things so for instance one that comes to mind immediately uh because I experience this all the

49
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,880
time especially on procrastinators like either on the show or in the chat which is that I am

50
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:38,760
incredibly full of shit I am just absolutely full of shit um in like most arguments I get into

51
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:47,000
because I don't have many convictions I don't really like have a stance like a concrete stance

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,600
in the world that I'm like fighting for or arguing for I will just argue whatever side of an issue

53
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,280
is currently interesting to me you know or like if someone phrases something in a way that I find

54
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,240
questionable then I'll take the opposite stance you know just because I find what they said

55
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,120
questionable even if I don't even really care or I'm not really on that side this comes up a lot

56
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,120
when I argue with Nate where I'm not really arguing with Nate because I disagree with him

57
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,840
but because I don't like how he's framed his argument you know and you you'll hear this on

58
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,560
procrastinators all the time and it happens in the chat where we'll get into these long arguments

59
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:37,240
and then at some point he realizes that I don't actually disagree with like the overall point

60
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,800
he's trying to make I just hate how he's argued it and therefore at that point it all just like the

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,760
the discussion breaks down and it just becomes why the fuck are we arguing you know because I'll

62
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:56,440
argue all day because I don't mind arguing you know I'll keep I I just want I guess I have

63
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,800
more of a problem with language than I do with ideas you know like any idea can be presented

64
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,640
in a way that I'll end up agreeing with it if you if you word it correctly you know if if

65
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,880
if I understand where you're coming from and I and I think that the way you've presented the

66
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,520
idea makes sense which is why again I have that abradolph linkler mindset of just every every idea

67
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,080
makes sense to me it's just a matter of of putting it in the right terms you know there's very few

68
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,880
arguments that I like really have a hard line stance on like the idea that there is no objectivity

69
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,760
in art like that's one of the few things that I have always taken the same stance and will always

70
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:45,240
argue the same way but when it comes to social issues political issues just general discussions

71
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,840
especially discussions like about words and language I'll just play whatever side of the field

72
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,640
I find most entertaining to me at the moment you know and sort of derail things so here's an example

73
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,680
from today where I was sort of pseudo arguing with mumke in the pcp chat because mumke is now

74
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:15,640
officially a part of the pcp and um I think this was today it was over the fact that everyone in

75
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,480
the pcp has started showing interest in like uh making games in one form or another not not

76
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,960
literally everybody but a bunch of members like a bunch of people have been talking about uh game

77
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,000
ideas that they have going into 2017 and I was joking that 2017 is the year that we all start

78
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,160
making games and then Nate was talking about how you know he's made a game before and how it's

79
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,840
incredibly difficult and the all this stuff and I was like uh you know well the game I'm

80
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,080
positing uh is is you know incredibly simple like the whole idea of it is that it's simple

81
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,560
you play it with one button because it's not really a game and uh and like you know someone

82
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
asked like what's the gameplay and I said there is no gameplay and mumke was like it's not a

83
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,120
fucking game then and he came in with this argument about how it's like you know uh you've all heard

84
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:09,800
the game what is a game what isn't a game debate and like I have no stake in it I don't care either

85
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,240
way and the way I put it to mumke was like I argued with them for a little bit and I was literally

86
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,240
arguing both angles at the same time like I will simultaneously agreeing with him that it's not a

87
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,600
game but also disagreeing that the the definition of a game should be so limiting because I'm so

88
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:36,120
uninvested in it that I just I just want the argument to be presented in a sensical way like I

89
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,040
like to me giving a shit about whether like what is considered a game is like completely

90
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,040
retarded like I don't I think like even having that argument is like I could not possibly care

91
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,680
less about anything in the world and I don't think anything matters less in the universe

92
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,360
than like the label of what is or isn't a game who fucking cares because I'm very anti labels in

93
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:08,200
general I hate that everything is so like sequestered into mediums and genres and stuff when so much of

94
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,240
the best stuff out there is stuff that breaks those conventions and is like stuff that that is not

95
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,880
easily classifiable into you know into um categories like that I just generally hate labels and

96
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,280
categories but at the same time I do agree that it's not really a game like by standard definitions

97
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,120
of like like what is a game it shouldn't be called a game the thing I'm talking about so like

98
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,760
yeah I see it both ways and I can argue both ways and I'm only arguing because I think it's funny

99
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,800
and I'm totally full of shit so so I'm like literally arguing both sides of the field against

100
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,640
him and he was just like what like he was just like you know like fuck you you're a fucking idiot and

101
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm like yeah I know like I know I'm being an idiot like I just I'm this happens all the time on

102
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,280
PCP like when I said something like uh how do you even know that I'm uh that I'm trying to speak

103
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:16,120
English in my videos you know like stuff like that where yeah of course I'm speaking English in my

104
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,960
videos but I'm just like I'm I'm broadening it out to like such a philosophical level just to

105
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,680
like win the argument and by for my like for me winning an argument doesn't mean proving I'm right

106
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,160
it just means like proving that being right doesn't matter that neither like like that that if you

107
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,080
argue something hard enough if you argue it to like a broad enough scale then it's all meaningless

108
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,160
you know that's like why I was such like a nihilistic mindset about everything because

109
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,800
you can kind of win every argument that way just like it only matters if you care and if

110
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,520
you don't if you if you bring the argument to a point where you make it apparent that you don't care

111
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,320
then it's all meaningless it all it all means it all just goes out the window and that's the way I

112
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,760
argue because I have no convictions I don't care about any side in any argument I don't care about

113
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,640
being right I don't care about like you know actually progressing the conversation I just care

114
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,480
about playing these little lingual games and you know and saying fuck it all and having any

115
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,480
stances lame like that's kind of how I end up spiraling my conversations

116
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:38,760
now I enjoy doing it so that's why it's a problem that like I don't know what the solution is

117
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,680
because I do think it makes me a total douchebag and it makes me impossible to talk to it's like

118
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,840
when you get to that point in the argument you're just frustrated and especially because

119
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,320
you know it always makes me look like the winner even if I'm not even if like you know in any

120
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,960
conventional sense of a debate I'm just making an ass of myself but there's never a sense of me

121
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,880
like admitting that I've lost you never get to a point where I'm like okay you've out argued me

122
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:14,280
because all I do is take the argument to such an extreme and broad place that there's no way to win

123
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,400
it's just over like you all I've done is removed the game out from under you you know um I've just

124
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:31,080
made myself above it all and even if you see me as like obviously wrong and and just a dick you know

125
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,800
it doesn't affect me it never makes me feel like I lost or feel like the bad guy you know and that's

126
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,920
why something like the pokemon race where you know the real drama is ben versus Nate in that race

127
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,880
right like Nate they both tried they tried really hard and they had a sincere you know dedication

128
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,640
the reason that that video is entertaining is because Nate tried so fucking hard that when he

129
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:05,000
lost it had a real gravitas to it but no one likes competing against me because I won't take it

130
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,640
seriously because if I did win I would of course lord it over everyone I would brag to the end of

131
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,520
the earth and I'd be like I'm the greatest guy ever but if I lose it doesn't matter because nothing

132
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,240
matters and I don't care about anything and I have no stakes in anything and and uh and it's all meaningless

133
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:32,360
so yeah I guess it's kind of like Nate was talking about how one of his in the in the

134
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,400
pokemon sun and moon podcast how he really hates the rival how because every time you beat how he

135
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,160
just goes like wow that sure was a fun match you know like we sure are buddy buddy pals and he's

136
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,440
like there's no sensation of victory from from like beating someone like that and that's me

137
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,640
that's who I am is that guy who when I lose it's like well you know playing games is for idiots

138
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:06,760
but when I win it's ha fuck you you lost um yeah and I think that just I think it makes me a total

139
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,680
douchebag and uh you know it's hard it's a hard thing to call someone out on so I think that's why

140
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,280
I've never quite been you know people get frustrated with me in the moment in things like that but it's

141
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,480
hard to express the overall problem of like why what like what is what is it that I'm doing that

142
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,320
you can sense I'm being a dick but you're not sure why this is why it's because I have this

143
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:38,040
affectation that nothing matters to me and and like and it's just a defense mechanism it's a way

144
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,600
to make it so you never have to feel aggravated or a sense of loss you know I never feel like

145
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,800
I've lost anything because I refuse to take anything seriously um but it also means that

146
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,880
you know when I taste victory it's only like it's always backhanded I mean I always feel

147
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,880
like a dick even when I win at something just because you know I only celebrate victories

148
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:13,080
that I was like bound to win anyways so I don't know uh yeah that's that point I guess that was

149
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,000
fun to talk about I think I rambled and repeated myself a lot but maybe you'll hear more about me

150
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,760
talking about why I'm a total dick in this uh the compression chamber

151
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:29,960
okay

152
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,040
all right I guess we'll mix this up a little we'll we'll jump back and forth between different types

153
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,200
of stuff in this this podcast this time it's gonna be more about a certain a certain fear of mine

154
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,240
I don't know if I'll call this a character weakness because it makes me sound like the

155
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,000
good guy in this scenario um whereas the last one was just me being a dick but uh it is a

156
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:06,120
it is sort of a weakness of character I guess um you know you often see this trope in media of the

157
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:14,680
character who um tries way too hard to be strong like someone who tries to take on the weight of

158
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,800
everything on themselves and to never crack and to always look like you know to try to be the rock

159
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,240
the person who never sheds a tear in front of anybody or shows any fear you know in front of

160
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,280
their crew so to speak because they're trying to hold everyone else together you know and there's

161
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,880
always this sort of this the sense of almost fear um that that person is one day going to

162
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,400
snap under the pressure that they're not that like all that all that strength and resolve you know

163
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,800
they eventually the hardships they're facing will eat away at them and it'll just break them

164
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,200
you know and sometimes these characters are presented as heroes and as the strongest people

165
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,560
sometimes are the ones who you're the most concerned about and usually there's you know what

166
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:14,040
what holds these people together is that there's someone that they find that they can show their

167
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,720
real insecurity to that they can break down in front of you know I'm thinking the first thing

168
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,600
that comes to mind when I think of this you know it's not quite a perfect example because this

169
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,440
character kind of flies off the handle would be in arreca seven when you have uh uh what's his name

170
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:42,040
you have talho and the guy the guy who holland who uh you know both of them are sort of inauthentic

171
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,000
around everyone else but you know like because because holland's always putting on this this

172
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,680
character of being this like larger than life figure but when he's with talho he can emote

173
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:01,240
and have those moments where he just kind of breaks down and um you know there's a lot of

174
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,040
characters like that in media and I'm always afraid that I might be one of those people

175
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,600
and I realize that because I'm comparing myself to a heroic trait then this sounds like you know

176
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:21,640
this sounds like egotistical self aggrandizement but I I don't know that it's that the people around

177
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:28,120
me are weak or that I just perceive everyone is weak you know because I'm so egotistical I feel

178
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:35,480
like I'm supposed to be stronger that I'm supposed to present myself as someone who is flippant and

179
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,760
doesn't care and is is unaffected it doesn't get emotional and never feels you know hardship

180
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:51,000
because everyone around me seems to be dealing with worse you know and I always feel like I have to

181
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,960
be the one person who is not complaining you know the one person who is doing okay so that

182
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,440
everyone else feels comfortable like like you know we're not all on a sinking ship someone

183
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,200
steering it upward you know and I want to look like that guy I don't even know how much I do

184
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:18,040
look like that guy you know and I I do know that like for for the pcp you know Nate has often said

185
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,560
for instance that he sees me as sort of like you know a beacon of of hope that this group is going

186
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,040
to do well because I'm succeeding so much and I seem to be having such a good life that it's like

187
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:36,920
we can all do it you know um and I want that I want to look that way but there are lots of things

188
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,560
that you know that bother me that are that are that go wrong or that I just feel emotional so

189
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,960
there's oftentimes you know several days in a row where I just feel like total dog shit and just

190
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:58,360
and don't even want to you know deal with anything and this decompression chamber is helpful for that

191
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,280
and that's kind of part of why it started because again as I've said in previous episodes um you

192
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,320
know the sort of incentive to have a show where it's just me is that there is no none of the

193
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,640
putting on airs that comes from talking to another person there's none of the turning myself into

194
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:23,960
someone else and it's not that I'm always completely vulnerable to my audience but um and it's it's

195
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,520
it's funny too because I know that most of the people I'm talking about who I try to be strong

196
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:36,040
in front of listen to this show anyways you know um so this is kind of an admittance to everyone

197
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:43,240
in those people probably again I don't think anyone sees themselves as relying on me or possibly

198
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,440
is relying on me you know maybe no one is you know it's just how I feel like I have to be

199
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,760
and part of it I would say this this sort of mindset originated from my teen years because

200
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:02,840
of the fact that I am the eldest of three brothers and my dad is exceedingly strong

201
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,040
he like me puts on that character of like everything will work out and part of the reason

202
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:18,040
for that is that my mom you know while she is a very you know tough person she is comparatively

203
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,840
in terms of like emotions she's very emotional you know she will be worried very intensely

204
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,480
worried she's very pessimistic she's very um you know if things are going wrong she expects them to

205
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,360
go very wrong and my dad has always been someone who's constantly reassuring her he's always playing

206
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,600
the oh it's not that bad it's gonna be okay I know what I'm doing I know how we can get out of this

207
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,280
you know my dad always has that optimistic mindset just to counterbalance my mom's pessimism

208
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:59,000
and when I reached a certain age I realized that I too have to do that for my mom you know because

209
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,720
she will become concerned if me or victor or shade you know if it seems like things aren't

210
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,640
going well for us or if we're concerned about something you know it it becomes almost a bigger

211
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,880
concern for her than it ever was for me you know so I won't talk about hardships my mom even though

212
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,360
I know she wants me to I know she would want me to and she would want to help but I feel like

213
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,400
things that I can deal with that like are that aren't that big a deal to me become a bigger deal

214
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,240
both for me and her if I tell her you know so I won't say anything I'd rather come to my dad who

215
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,800
is you know who will who will be able to deal with it you know but even him the problem with my dad

216
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,440
is that there's just too many problems he has a difficulty understanding and he has his like you

217
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,440
know he's the type of person to like give advice and it kind of expect you to take that advice even

218
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,720
if you know to me it's like well I know what I'm doing you know I'm just here to vent I don't I

219
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,000
don't I don't know I don't have an easy time venting to my parents I've never been able to

220
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,440
tell them about anything going like wrong with me um not because they're not you know they're

221
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,680
totally there for me I just personally would rather keep it to myself you know because I don't feel

222
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:25,880
like um like worrying them will help me more I feel like I should deal with it you know and then

223
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,280
I've also got two little brothers who you know I wanted to be a role model for who I wanted to be

224
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,840
strong for so I you know again have always put on that face of like being a leader I've always been

225
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,720
the leader of my brothers you know they've they've followed me through whatever I've been doing all

226
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,680
these years you know um we're always very close they're always right right behind me and I've

227
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,160
always been sort of a leader amongst you know friends I have and stuff like that I've always

228
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:02,280
been someone who constantly reassures everyone and and unlike my dad who does it with this sort of

229
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,240
brazen manly confidence my dad's just like you know he's a man of the house kind of guy he's the

230
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,560
kind of guy who's like you know this is what we're gonna do and it's gonna work and we're gonna do

231
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:22,120
it and he's very confident I on the other hand approach everything in a much more sarcastic way

232
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:32,040
where to me it's more about my dad suggests like believe in me because I know what I'm doing and

233
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:41,400
I will get it done for me it's more like um you're silly to be thinking of like this is a problem

234
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:48,680
like I constantly make people like I make people out to be overreacting anytime they're they're uh

235
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,320
they're complaining about something I always make it out like of course things are gonna work out

236
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,240
you know like yeah no shit everything like everything's good everything always goes well

237
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,480
you know if you just give it time everything always goes well like that's the way I present

238
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,120
things as if that's a given and like I think DeVu is the person who's called me out on this the most

239
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,080
because the fact that I like you know he is often like has problems with things that I'll just be

240
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,600
like eh you know if you just give it like five minutes it'll work and then like it doesn't work

241
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,800
and he's like you always say that's gonna work it you know you're like you're wrong like half the time

242
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,600
but like because I I I approach everything in this way that I'm just like eh you know everything

243
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:42,120
always works everything's good the world makes sense you know um that's just my way of reassuring

244
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:50,520
people like trying to make them feel like uh like nothing's nothing's ever that big a deal

245
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,760
whatever thing you think is a big deal it's actually not a big deal and everything makes

246
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,320
sense and it's all gonna work you know um that's just kind of my approach to life and

247
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,800
to to bring that back a little bit to like you know what I was initially talking about just

248
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,720
I feel like I constantly have like I'm constantly putting on this persona of like

249
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,520
everything goes perfectly for me everything makes sense and flows in a logical manner and um

250
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,920
you know I I know that like DeVu really likes in spite of the fact that he calls me out on the

251
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,360
way I approach you know uh the other thing like he's he's very much about the idea that like if you

252
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,480
exude confidence then the confidence will come you know like if you're if you're always thinking

253
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,560
that you're doing things right then you'll end up doing things right and uh and I kind of act the

254
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:54,440
same way but I have I have doubts about it you know like things aren't always perfect for me

255
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,080
things aren't always great things aren't always working out sometimes I just I'm just like I

256
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,560
don't know what the fuck I'm doing you know I have no idea what I'm doing with my life or

257
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:14,280
I'm just I'm just angry or anxious or bored or like just upset about something and I never feel like

258
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,040
there's someone I can talk to about it because if I do then it breaks the charade it breaks the

259
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,160
image it breaks the idea that you know that there is someone who's doing it all right and that like

260
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,640
you know I I sort of want to be this symbol of like what you're all hoping life can be

261
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,320
you're all hoping you can live your dreams and you can do art and make money and be happy

262
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:48,600
you know and I don't want to suggest to you that even after all that effort and all that work

263
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,280
it's still gonna be shit like half the time because you're just a fundamentally broken person

264
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:01,080
who has you know problems with addiction and you're not satisfied with your body and you never

265
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:09,080
leave the house and you you know you never get laid at all for years on end and you know

266
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:18,040
and you sit around and drink alone and sometimes stare into space all day and the only sense of

267
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,520
accomplishment that you ever feel is when you throw together random 10 minute vlogs

268
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,880
and you're so self-satisfied about your own content that you'll put something out you know

269
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,600
every single day and feel like you're getting something done when all of it is just like

270
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,360
pennies in the ocean of actually accomplishing something when you could be if you put your

271
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,320
mind to it like putting out you know like more mainstream content that you know everybody

272
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,640
wants and you know you could make and it would make you more money and it would help out you

273
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,640
and all your people and you'd be moving way faster towards anything you wanted more money better

274
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,680
place you know getting all your fucking friends down here but because you're so stuck in this

275
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:07,240
this mood driven mindset where all you do is you just I'm just talking about myself by the way

276
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I don't know why I'm still in the second person but like maybe it was just easier to rant about

277
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:20,760
that if I'm talking if I if I pretend it's not me but you know I I'm so governed by moods I'm so

278
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,000
impulsive I just want to do whatever is interesting to me right now and I never want to do anything

279
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,160
that's like takes setup or time or work or effort you know the reason I put out videos every day

280
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,120
is not because I have an amazing work ethic in fact it's pretty much the opposite the reason I

281
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,440
put out videos every day is because I just attach myself to every flight of fancy that I have and I

282
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,880
just want to do that and that works decently for me because people do watch those videos and enjoy

283
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:58,760
them and that's great but I could be if I set my mind to it making stuff that everyone would enjoy

284
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:05,160
all the time you know I could be having a video every third day on the digi bro channel you know

285
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,080
with a hundred thousand to five hundred thousand views and that would be growing at such an exponential

286
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,840
rate if I had videos coming out that frequently of that level of quality so many people would start

287
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,360
tuning in that I'd have way more ad revenue way more patreon money devout get a raise devout would

288
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,320
have a car you know my friends would be able to we'd all be fucking moved in somewhere you know

289
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,640
and doing these things that we've been talking about that we've been slowly making progress

290
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,240
towards for years but because none of us just buckles down and just does the fucking thing

291
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,080
you know we we all kind of like slowly get it done while we pussyfoot around and procrastinate and

292
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,400
you know worry about other shit that we haven't just like just buckled down and made the thing

293
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:57,160
because we're all flawed people who can't just do that you know none of us has the mindset to just

294
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,720
become a purely engine of success and I keep painting myself like one I keep making it look like

295
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,000
hey you know someone's at least got their stuff together enough that they're they're still rising

296
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,360
through the ranks you know I'm making I'm doing it but I could be doing so much better and you know

297
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,080
and of course I agonize about it every day every day that I you know when I fucking spend a week

298
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,160
what the fuck have I done this week I don't know and I know it's because it's a holiday season but

299
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:31,720
this is why vacations freak me out and I shouldn't take them anytime I'm like I'm just gonna not do

300
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,800
work for a week then at the end of that week it doesn't matter what the reason is that I didn't

301
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,280
do work for that week it doesn't matter that I was hanging out with family or that I was like

302
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,320
trying to take a sabbatical or that's like oh we have enough work done there's no reason to do more

303
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,560
except that there's always a reason to do more because if you do more then more will come out of

304
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,560
it that's why Casey Neistat has the do more tattoo on his hand and the work harder tattoo on his arm

305
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:03,480
because he sees those and he goes you're right I should just work it doesn't matter that I don't

306
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,760
have to you know complacency will kill you it killed him he talks about that you know how there

307
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,200
was a two-year period where he didn't do shit because he had two million dollars from selling

308
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,680
his show to HBO and it made his life miserable it was the worst he felt because he wasn't working

309
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,560
you know and every time I take a week off and I don't work and I look back at it I'm just like

310
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:29,160
what the fuck am I doing why am I why I don't care about the fucking holidays why am I sitting

311
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,720
around for five days drinking and fucking making vlogs about my dream anime stuff that comes into

312
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,400
my head like out of nowhere and I make a vlog and then I feel satisfied well I made a video

313
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,200
today so what does it matter yeah I could I could I could be done with the next part of

314
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:51,000
shaft uh studies you haven't even started on the next video yet I could be done with it I could be

315
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,760
probably I think I could be done with it yeah I could be done with that if I've been working

316
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,760
on it this whole time since finishing writing shinbo in the 2000s um you know I could be started

317
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,160
on the next thing I could be using this this last week of the year to write uh you know videos for

318
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,480
all of january to have ready for devu so he has work so he knows what he's doing you know

319
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,920
um so we don't start january with this whole clusterfuck of the goddamn plebe in the weave and

320
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,520
then who knows what my channel ends up being for the rest of the month oh god

321
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:39,880
that was too much decompression you unzipped me me

322
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,920
this might end up being a longer decompression chamber because I'm still in the same night

323
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,600
and I'm already on a third recording so uh you know I don't know how long this might go on for

324
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:04,040
but I want to expand a little bit on the idea of complacency and also to share one of the

325
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,680
the pieces of advice I've gotten that stuck with me the most out of anything I've ever heard

326
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,080
you know sometimes you have those those things that someone says to you or I mean I don't know

327
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,920
if you have this but I've I've had a few of these instances where someone said something that like

328
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:27,400
just has replayed in my mind forever and this one by far the most um so just because it's

329
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:35,080
remained true over all the years which is that I was talking to ghost lightning once my friend who

330
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,000
I've often described as my mentor fellow anime blogger who um who I visited for a time in the

331
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,400
Philippines in 2011 and uh we were talking about probably some project I was trying to do like

332
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,840
some you know I was probably telling him about some idea I had that I wanted to get off the ground

333
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:01,960
but that I was like probably bitching about how I wasn't doing it and um honestly sometimes I'm

334
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,720
shocked by the level of patience that ghost lightning had with me because it's a level of

335
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,080
patience that I wouldn't have had like that current me would not have for a like 18 year old

336
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,800
complaining about the things that I would complain about um you know with the lack of

337
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:26,040
self-awareness but I I'm sure I was bitching about something and I about how I was not in the mood

338
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:35,560
to do it and he like like really hit me hard with his line he was like you always let yourself

339
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,000
be controlled by these moods and like you need to stop that like I don't remember exactly the

340
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,520
phrasing but the advice was to stop letting myself be controlled by my mood and it was like mind

341
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,240
blowing to me because I never thought about that that that's like a thing that you have to fight

342
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,960
like that like what it means to me in many ways what it means to be an adult or to be like mature

343
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:09,320
and to be able to like handle your scandal as the phrase goes um is the ability to work through

344
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:16,040
what you don't feel like doing you know to do it anyways even though you don't feel like it because

345
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:22,440
it's necessary or it's the right thing to do or it will you know benefit you that to me is like

346
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:30,440
that's the entire definition of what it means to be like you know uh to be um to be an adult who

347
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:39,800
gets things done because I mean that's entirely what work is you know work is when you do a thing

348
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,760
you don't want to do because you understand the long-term benefits of it and uh you and you know

349
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,560
can make progress and you know in the time since then I mean it was a while before I that that advice

350
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:00,040
like haunted me but I did not beat that for a long time you know I did not get past that problem of

351
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,480
having you know just letting my mood completely control me because I would if you know I would

352
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,840
only do things I was in the mood for and like I would be in certain moods for days on end or just

353
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,440
like very rarely actually be in the mood to get something done so you know it was a big problem

354
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,680
that I would let myself be so controlled by whatever mood I was in and I've I've learned how

355
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:30,200
to beat that I now know how to put like to say to override my mood and just fucking do something

356
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:37,400
and the funny thing about moods easy to change it's it's it's actually like you know you can

357
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,520
be in a mood you can be in like a rut you can be think like I'm bored and upset or something and

358
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,440
you can stay that way all day but if you actually flip the switch in your mind where you realize

359
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,400
like I can change this then it's it's pretty easy to do for me it's often a matter of just

360
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,440
throwing on the right music and like getting out of my chair you know I've had days where I'm like

361
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,960
sitting there for hours just like just kind of you know ruminating on something negative and

362
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,280
just being in a shit mood and then like I realize I'm listening to depressing music and sitting in

363
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,760
a chair and you know and eating cheese balls all day and then like at some point I go wait let's

364
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,000
stop this and I just like throw on some onomatoguchi and get up and like do some push-ups or go for a

365
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,080
walk or go eat something and I come back and I feel completely different you know you can do things

366
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:35,080
to affect your mood and oftentimes just working through it will make you feel better just like

367
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:40,680
for me actually getting something done always feels good it doesn't matter like sometimes

368
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,680
I get something done and I feel great and then I immediately going back to feel like shit as soon

369
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,160
as I'm not working again but like working on something always feels good it's always a pick

370
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,920
me up you know I'm never sad when I'm doing a decompression chamber because I'm recording

371
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,040
you know I'm having fun making a recording so you know that at least an hour out of my week

372
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,400
that I'm recording this podcast is a time I'm feeling pretty fine you know and sometimes

373
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,840
the result of that can change how I felt from before especially if I've just made something

374
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,640
that's actually like really beneficial like anytime I write a digi bro video I feel great

375
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,320
afterwards because it's like um sometimes they come out of nowhere it's it's you know I feel

376
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,600
like shit all day and then suddenly I finally get an idea that I really want to do and I do it and

377
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:34,360
it's like this has made my whole month because you know I only really have to have a video every week

378
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:42,600
and if even if I spend like two days completely agonizing over getting the video like you're

379
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,360
coming up with an idea that I want to do and it's like just sucks those two days are grueling

380
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,560
and then I write that video on the third day then that weight is gone it's like oh now I've

381
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,800
saved the week and the rest of the week is fine I don't feel that pressure anymore you know like

382
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,600
accomplishing things and working can be so you know can really get me out of those moods and um

383
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,920
so I still am someone who lets myself be governed by moods a lot but I know how to fight it but the

384
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:19,240
problem is that I face now is complacency and I really do think that like when people talk about

385
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:26,120
complacency it sounds so phony right to hear someone who's like successful say that like

386
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:34,200
that success can be a problem but it really can because hunger and like desire for more

387
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,360
is such a huge motivating factor to like it really pumps you up and like makes you want to keep

388
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,560
working and again working is the best feeling I have you know it's the thing I want to do the most

389
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,440
I feel lazy when I'm not working I feel shitty when I'm not working I feel like I'm not going

390
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,680
anywhere like my life is stagnating and nothing's really happening you know it's only when I'm

391
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,240
accomplishing more than I have already done that I feel you know reignited either in the form of

392
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,040
making more money or feeling like I'm making creative progress like I'm getting better you know

393
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:17,000
those are the best feelings but when you're complacent it's when you realize that yeah you could be

394
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:25,000
getting better you could be making more money but you don't have to that's the danger that success

395
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,960
can bring is when you don't have to so you you just you think well it doesn't matter if I just do

396
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,560
whatever I'm in the mood for it doesn't matter if I spend all day you know being a shit because I

397
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,600
know by the end of the month I'll get those videos written you know at some point this month I've

398
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:51,160
got to have a huge burst of creativity where I write four videos in a short span of time and

399
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,880
that's all I really need you know it's enough to make the money to keep the channel growing to keep

400
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:03,000
me but it's not progress it's stagnation and when these periods happen when I have like

401
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,160
times where I don't really care about what's going on it tends to even though the same amount of

402
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:14,600
stuff is coming out you know I don't feel like it's getting better and it's not necessarily the money's

403
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:20,200
not going up you know you can tell at times when I'm very passionate when I'm like really getting

404
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,320
things done it seems like I make more money even though there's no real logical reason for that to

405
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,040
be the case and maybe I'm wrong maybe it's just the way I look at the statistics depending on my

406
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,920
mood just feels that way you know and it feels like like I'm not getting anything done when I let

407
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:44,600
myself be lazy when I let myself go uh you know I already wrote the videos for this month so rather

408
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,480
than writing the ones for next month or rather than writing something even bigger and better rather

409
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,800
than getting a new thing done and expanding on my creativity I'm just gonna sit around you know

410
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,680
because I can why not but that's the thing sitting around makes you feel like garbage

411
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,160
these meat makes me feel like garbage makes me feel like nothing's happening makes me feel like

412
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,840
I'm not doing anything like I'm just stagnating like I'm getting worse as a person or or remaining

413
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:20,440
the same you know um this is what happens to me with like diet and weight loss and and quitting

414
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,600
things like the reason I keep going back to smoking um you know I bought a pack of cigarettes

415
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:34,520
yesterday just because I had a like what always happens is I think why do I have to stop like

416
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:42,600
nothing is making me stop the only reason to stop is this vague sense that I'll be better if I do it

417
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,960
you know but there's no there's no actual pressure to there's no pressure to stop eating out so much

418
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:55,560
there's no pressure to eat better to to look better to feel better you know all logically I should

419
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:01,480
just want those things but because I'm already like I'm already meeting my own demands for success

420
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,920
I don't feel like I have to do any of that who cares why do I need to look better why I need to

421
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:14,760
feel but then you know but then at the end of the day I'm sitting on my couch for hours at a time

422
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:23,720
going like I have no social life I feel kind of sickly and fat you know I'm not eating well

423
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,360
I feel wrong I feel imbalanced my head hurts because I've been smoking too much you know

424
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,120
and all of that is what puts me into the mindset of like well you know I gotta numb this somehow

425
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:41,240
let's either you know take a couple Advil or take drink as many beers as I can you know and then

426
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,680
and then drinking feels great but then there's that moment when you're drunk and then you can't

427
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,760
get anything done and you're like well now I'm useless so I guess I'll just go to bed and then

428
00:45:52,760 --> 00:46:01,880
sleep for you know 12 hours every fucking day complacency is dangerous and you know I think a

429
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:10,920
lot of people view their vision of what success is is like you reach this level and then it's a

430
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,560
plateau from then on of happiness but there is none of that because if you plateau you become

431
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:26,200
unhappy the second you stop fighting is when you lose your drive to become better and to to keep

432
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:33,400
being good it's when you you you kind of realize the bare minimum you have to do and you just decide

433
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:40,520
to do that and that's when you stagnate and I'm not saying this is all happening to me because

434
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:48,040
the only reason I feel any of this stagnation is that my life is so open-ended and I work so fast

435
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,760
that's the only reason this happens because if you look at like the content I'm putting out you're

436
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,520
like well wait you're trying new things all the time you've got like all these new series you keep

437
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,000
opening up you know after dark so it's doing new things you've got all these you know new things

438
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,240
going on in digi bro where's where's the stagnation well the problem is that all that stuff only takes

439
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,000
up a small part of my day you know the amount of time I spend working on these videos and stuff

440
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,800
that's like a few hours the day is 24 hours long every day is a long day you know I sleep probably

441
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:29,960
10 to 12 hours of those so like you know it's not not as long but the time that I'm not making these

442
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:37,880
videos or consuming anime for these videos or like doing research is time I'm not doing anything

443
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:44,600
that's the stagnation time I do not monopolize my time well you know and like Casey Neistat with his

444
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:51,160
do more and work harder if you watch that guy's video about his fucking schedule he's never not

445
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:59,720
doing something never you know he's always either working or making movies or spending time with his

446
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,080
family or uh or you know traveling or doing whatever and he he works even when he travels

447
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,000
like on planes and stuff he only sleeps like four hours a night uh he's always you know he

448
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,600
works out every day he runs consistently he's always happy healthy and working harder and getting

449
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:25,560
better all hours of day you know so even though yes I still work enough to innovate I still do

450
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,720
enough to make progress because I can work so fast and I get things done so quickly

451
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,120
because I'm like a fucking engine I'm just a machine that cranks out stuff

452
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:46,280
nonetheless there's a lot of every day that is just sitting around feeling wrong you know

453
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:54,040
and that's the part of me that I have a problem with that's harder to communicate to people

454
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,720
and it's harder to be like to make people understand that like

455
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:08,520
being satisfied with with with my career does not mean that I'm satisfied with my life because I

456
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:16,440
know I could be doing more and doing better and not letting my mood control me you know fucking 10

457
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:30,040
hours out of the day well it's been almost a month since I recorded the first 50 minutes that you

458
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:36,920
just listened to of this podcast I recorded it at the end of December and I spent a lot of time

459
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,160
really deliberating about whether or not I was going to release it whether I was going to continue

460
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,520
the episode a big part of me just wanted to delete it not let it see the light of day

461
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:55,960
because I just I feel so weird about talking about these things and you know

462
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,080
listening to it back I couldn't help but feel like somehow I came off as even more arrogant

463
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:09,480
and self aggrandizing when complaining about myself than I ever do when bragging about myself

464
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:16,200
it's quite incredible but I ended up deciding I wanted to post this particularly when I came

465
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,240
up with this last section I wanted to record this for the last like week or so and I finally have

466
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:33,640
time now that rad cons fully over and I've had a day to sleep and do stuff so I want to talk about

467
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:40,920
the hedgehog's dilemma as described in Neon Genesis Evangelion something that connected

468
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,680
with me very strongly back when I watched the show and which still does which is the idea that

469
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,720
you know when two hedgehogs try to get close to one another they end up stabbing each other

470
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,560
with their pins and the closer they get the more it hurts and so they just try to avoid people

471
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:06,920
altogether I think this is generally true of human relationships the closer you get to someone

472
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:14,040
the more it's going to hurt you and I feel like the more aware of that you are the scarier it

473
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,720
becomes I think most people are able to form relationships because they mostly see and focus

474
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:25,320
on the good you know even though they might fight with someone or or have problems with them

475
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:33,560
they really you know internalize the idea that they they love the person or they're close to them

476
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:43,080
and I try to do that as best I can but I always have this the sensation when it comes to

477
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:53,800
you know with with other people of like I I kind of how about I put it this way I feel

478
00:51:53,800 --> 00:52:01,720
the pins going into me and I don't make any sound I don't scream you know I don't tell them

479
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:09,240
that it hurts I just let them get closer and I feel the pain and I don't say anything I just

480
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:19,400
eventually turn and go the other way I just eventually leave all at once and um you know

481
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,480
this is a big problem in my life in general and what I'm trying to rectify and that was an extreme

482
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,200
example of of me taking this kind of action but let me let me break it down in a in a more simplistic

483
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:39,560
way I have some friends who when you let's say get into a fight with them or if there's something

484
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,920
they disagree with you on fundamentally some of my friends will just let it roll off of them

485
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:51,640
they might form a general opinion of you like you know if you repeatedly piss them off

486
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:58,440
then they generally think that guy pisses me off but they don't think about the individual reasons

487
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:05,560
why I want to say that Nate is like this you know he doesn't ever seem to bring up like hey when you

488
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:12,440
did this that pissed me off he can if pressed but he will more have a general idea of like you've

489
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,880
pissed me off in this way a bunch of times you know but but not really focus on the specifics too much

490
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,640
then I have friends who will get pissed off about very specific things and will let you know

491
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,480
they will tell you they will hold it against you then is a good example of this you know you'll

492
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:37,320
have heard it on the pcp he will hold a grudge about specific things and he will keep reminding you

493
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:44,520
of that thing until you've done something to rectify it or to placate him now I I don't know how

494
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,320
many other people are like this I'm sure everyone is on some level but this is generally how I operate

495
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:57,000
is that I get mad about specific things and I stay mad about them but I don't say anything

496
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:05,160
I just bottle it all up I just can because I don't want to me the best way to deal with it is to just

497
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,680
let it go right if we keep arguing about it we're just going to keep getting more heated

498
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:18,840
but at the same time what I'm failing to realize is that you know some things can actually be resolved

499
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,680
sometimes an infraction can be talked through and reach a conclusion and that's what I'm trying to

500
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:32,520
do more of I'm trying to you know bring up when I have an issue because I have this tendency to

501
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:39,640
just sit back and accumulate all these different little incidents or someone's making me mad

502
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,640
and I don't tell them just how mad those incidents have made me it just builds up and builds up and

503
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:52,040
I've got this this list and I'll tell other people you know I'll be like I can't believe what this

504
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,040
guy said to me today you know and tell them the story but I don't bring it up to people's faces

505
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,200
this is true of absolutely everyone if you're listening to this and you're thinking he's

506
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,960
talking about me I am because I'm talking about everyone I know anyone who does anything that

507
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:14,680
makes me mad I keep tally I've got them all in my mind and I've told other people about the things

508
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,280
that you've done that made me mad but I probably haven't told you and you'll know if I have

509
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,760
because again I'm trying to rectify this I'm trying to become someone who lets you know

510
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,440
you know when I've got a problem and tries to resolve it and tries to come to terms with it

511
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,400
because I've been so bad at that in the past and what I basically have done with some people

512
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:43,640
in my life is just let all those little things accumulate until I just cut ties you'll remember

513
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:51,320
on a previous podcast I talked about my friend D I just called him D this was a guy who was a part

514
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:59,000
of my circle of friends and over time everyone developed a problem with him everyone I knew

515
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,440
had an issue with D because just he would constantly do things that made everyone pissed off

516
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:12,680
it was just like a never-ending cycle every time we saw him he would do something to make someone

517
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:20,760
mad and it got to a point where me and my friends would literally just sit around and shit talk D

518
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,200
all day it was like the number one thing we did as a group was to talk about how much this guy

519
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,840
pissed us off and the reason we did that is because D was the kind of person who you could not

520
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:37,800
like make realize his faults you know and if you did if you brought something up if you

521
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,760
made him realize that he defended you he would apologize and he would try to do something for

522
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,480
you but I don't I don't want that I don't want people trying to do things for me I just want

523
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,080
you to recognize that you've done something wrong and then to not do it again but D's not like that

524
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,440
he would do it again you know he would he would never recognize what the mistake was he would

525
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:04,040
think he fucked up in that instance and try to rectify that instance without realizing that he's

526
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:12,040
just doing the same mistake over and over again now obviously D is someone who you know I'm probably

527
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:19,320
better off without having him in my life but so long went by that I just didn't even confront him

528
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:26,680
and I would just sit back and cowardly wait for someone to do it I just wanted someone to finally

529
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:32,760
snap on him and give me an excuse to ride that wave and just you know have him out of my life

530
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,640
for a while we thought it was gonna be my mom of all people because you know all my friends hung

531
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,800
out at my house and D had done enough things that pissed off even my parents that my mom had straight

532
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:50,200
up said like if he does one more thing that pisses me off I'm kicking him out and I literally

533
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:56,200
hoped that it would happen I spent like days just thinking God I hope he fucking does something

534
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,640
that pisses off my mom so she'll kick him out and I won't have to you know because I wouldn't I was

535
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:07,880
I just couldn't bring myself to do it myself I'd rather just let these things wither away I'd rather

536
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,200
let people who I don't you know who I don't want to talk to anymore I'd rather just ignore them

537
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:21,080
until they go away and eventually D actually did piss off my brother Victor badly enough

538
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:28,920
that he excised him from the group he flew off the handle on D you know and uh and I just

539
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,640
like you know I let it happen and I rode the wave and I just never talked to him again like I didn't

540
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:39,880
even really make it clear that I also had a problem with him but the fact that I never tried to contact

541
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,440
him I think he you know got it and he kind the way the way it went down it was kind of like he

542
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,760
had done an infraction on our whole household you know he'd been kicked out of the house and uh

543
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,320
I haven't spoken to him since it's been like two and a half years maybe no about two years I guess

544
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:02,840
so you know that's the way I deal with problems ignore them until they go away until someone

545
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:10,120
deals with it until you know I can just burn the bridge break the ties or just they they stop

546
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:15,320
trying to contact me you know this is how I've avoided a lot of people online when there's a

547
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,640
lot of people who I you know was friends with for a little while then decided I wasn't really getting

548
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,400
out of anything out of the relationship or that it was just annoying or that I didn't want to

549
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,640
participate anymore so I just stopped talking to them stopped responding to their messages you know

550
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
they'd message me here and there I'd never respond you know I don't tell people hey I don't want to

551
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:40,360
be friends with you anymore I just let it let it go but there are some relationships I do want to

552
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:47,480
protect there are some people like everyone in the pcp who you know I want us to to continue to

553
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,440
work together to continue to be friends to continue to have things to do and so I think it's dangerous

554
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,680
when you know if some if I get mad at someone like that someone who I I actually care about

555
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,840
and I just hold on to that anger and don't say anything and let it fester and build because

556
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,040
what happens when you do that when you don't confront the issue is that it just builds on itself

557
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:15,000
because there's been no resolution so all I can do is think about that thing over and over again

558
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,040
and just keep thinking like you know and then if something like that happens again that it just

559
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:26,040
builds on to the pile and I haven't let the person know that it bothers me you know I haven't told

560
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:33,560
them hey you have to stop doing this or else you know eventually you know I'm gonna it's gonna

561
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:39,960
feel like the cons of knowing you outweigh the pros and I have to let people know that and I hope

562
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:46,760
I can do that you know and I know it's like it's kind of a selfish way of thinking in the first

563
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,800
place even that like I'm the gatekeeper to our friendship but I do feel like you know this is a

564
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:59,320
horrible thing to say but I feel like I treat relationships in the same way that I treat

565
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:08,680
watching anime that every episode that we go through together I take stock of is this worth

566
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:15,640
continuing you know should I keep keep you know interacting with this show or should I drop it

567
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:23,720
and I feel the same way about people like you know if I feel like I'm net gaining from knowing you

568
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,000
from having your relationship with you then I'll keep it going and as soon as I start to feel like

569
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,320
you're a drain on me you're you know you're taking more energy than giving then I just drop it

570
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,640
and uh and I've dropped a lot of connections there's a lot of people there's a lot of

571
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:50,920
unresponded to mail in my inboxes on every social media site you know there's lots of people who I

572
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,680
just stopped talking to and then that last mail they sent trying to reconnect came and I just didn't

573
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:04,600
bother responding and uh you know I've probably lost a lot of connections I that I you know that

574
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:11,800
that are worthwhile that way but it's just I have such a hard time facing people facing the issues I

575
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:24,440
have you know and part of it is that I'm a harsh critic you know I am a harsh mean person who will

576
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:32,040
tell you exactly what I think is the problem in no uncertain terms you know if I have to

577
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:38,200
if it comes down to it and I'm going to tell you like what I think it's going to be brutal and harsh

578
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:43,240
and there's a lot of people I don't think can take that and I will say that one of the great

579
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:49,960
things about the pcp members in particular is that we can all take it you know we harshly

580
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:56,040
criticize each other all the time we criticize each other right on the show sometimes and there are

581
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:01,960
some criticisms that some of us can't take and we'll get mad about you know there are certain

582
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:08,280
things that I would avoid saying to certain members of the pcp but if it was something

583
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,480
that it came down to like this is a make or break for our friendship you need to know I have this

584
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,840
problem with you what allows me to be friends with those people is that they can hear that and

585
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:25,080
understand it you know and if they couldn't then that would be the end that's what I really value

586
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:31,400
out of people to give an example of a case where that you know it wasn't that way my ex-girlfriend

587
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:39,240
the whole time I was dating her like six months I had an endless litany of issues with her you

588
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:45,240
know there were so many things she did that made me mad that made me think I want this over but I

589
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,120
would never bring any of them up because I didn't think she could take it because her mindset would

590
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:56,120
not have been to hear those things and to say okay I'll try to you know to change or I'll try to

591
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:01,720
make this work instead what she would have said is well I guess I'm just a terrible person and

592
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,600
you know I guess you hate me and I guess we should break up and I didn't want to break up in spite

593
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:14,520
of all those issues you know but when we finally did break up then it was like well you know all

594
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,680
I had to think about was all the problems you know she she is another person who later tried to

595
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:27,240
contact me and I just ignored it I just didn't respond I didn't you know I just said well I've

596
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:38,680
already excised you from my life you are already gone to me you know so you know I really want to

597
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:48,440
cherish the connections I have with people who can take it who can you know hear that they've

598
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:54,360
done something that that makes me mad and then think you know to weigh the consequences to say

599
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:03,560
how much do I value my friendship with digi and if the answer is enough to change something to or

600
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:11,240
to rectify this problem then you know then to go through with it and I hope that I can change

601
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:19,080
for other people too you know again I'm I'm a very selfish person I do view these at a very one

602
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:27,320
sided lens it's like if you make me mad then it's then it's over if I make you mad then you know

603
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:32,600
I don't know how you'll take it I don't know if there's people who like I've never had the sense

604
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,680
that I've ever pissed anyone off enough that they stopped being my friend and that's what makes me

605
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,960
wonder if I'm just like a shit person you know for for thinking and acting this way because I

606
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:50,040
don't know anyone who's done this to me I've never had anyone just stop talking to me seemingly

607
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:58,440
out of frustration with me I've never had anyone at least not in my adult life maybe in high school

608
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,240
but even then I can't really remember you know I can't remember a time when someone was just like

609
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:10,680
ignoring me clearly out of the fact that they you know didn't want to talk to me anymore I don't

610
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:15,800
even know if people interpret me ignoring them that way I'm sure some have I'm sure to some people

611
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:26,040
it's been very clear you know um but you know I feel like I'm just an asshole and that I look at

612
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:35,480
people in a different and perhaps wrong way and I kind of resent myself for it

613
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:48,760
this whole fucking podcast has been very heavy for me it's I mean I don't feel like these things

614
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,640
would probably be as heavy to other people because a lot of this probably sounds like

615
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:02,600
either relatable or you know maybe maybe it doesn't sound like a big issue to someone else

616
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:08,600
because you're not experiencing these things they might just sound interesting you know it might

617
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:14,040
like I doubt anyone heard what I just said and thought wow you're a monster they probably thought

618
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:19,640
huh what a different way of looking at the world or actually that's exactly how I think

619
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,840
but for me it's like you know I'm literally describing to you things that I absolutely

620
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:33,880
hate about myself that's what this whole podcast has been you know trudging up the elements of me

621
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:43,800
that I most hate and explaining them I really hate that I have such a tendency to just abandon people

622
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:50,920
to leave people at the wayside to not talk about my problems to hole up in my you know in my room

623
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,600
in my space you know that's what I do when I'm when I when I don't want to face a problem I just

624
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:02,200
sit in my room you know I don't leave when I don't want to like go out into the world when I don't

625
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:09,480
want to speak to someone I just fucking I just become a hermit and that's what I always return to

626
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,960
I feel like I've been in this state for much of my life I feel like I've been retreating from society

627
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:20,600
for most of my life hiding you know hiding in this this safe cozy room surrounded by all this

628
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:28,120
cutesy imagery and cute anime girls trying to like pacify and distract me trying to give me

629
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:34,280
something to look at other than myself and the world outside and all the things that I fear

630
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:41,080
you know and this isn't even getting into my broad paranoias you know these are problems I have just

631
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:48,520
with with myself that are very specific but on a on a more broad scale I'm also extremely paranoid

632
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,240
about everything and I hate that about myself too but it's it's in so many different forms

633
01:08:53,880 --> 01:09:02,600
like I have an utter paranoia that everyone in the world is constantly judging me or wants me dead

634
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:09,000
or that society is ultimately going to side against me at some point you know I have I guess

635
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,640
sort of a persecution complex like I spent I've spent a lot of time thinking about like

636
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:22,040
how I would explain myself uh in in like court or to a police officer for for any number of

637
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:30,680
reasons involving society changing like I always feel like you know one day I'm gonna be the the

638
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,320
main character in 1984 or something you know like the the the person who has broken society's

639
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:43,480
rules in such a way that I'm going to have to stand trial and that in spite of my perfect logic

640
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:51,160
and arguments the system will fail me you know I'm always afraid that that everyone's out to get me

641
01:09:52,840 --> 01:10:00,760
that nothing's really on my side and you know I have I have a really hard time talking to people

642
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:07,800
about my problems talking to people about what's stressing me out you know at the very least

643
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,880
you know it's nice to have friends I can bitch to bitch and complain to and at least I have had

644
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:20,760
that I've pretty much always had you know someone around that I can just talk to in isolation

645
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:27,240
and complain about things you know I'm glad I've got friends living with me you know like Ben and

646
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:33,960
DeVue and my brother Victor who I can talk to and like share some of this stress and they can go

647
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:44,440
yeah I I get why that's a problem you know but at the same time living with other people you know

648
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:52,360
is exactly what causes these stresses and I'm there's there's parts of me that's constantly going like

649
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:59,560
should I just fucking run away and be by myself would I be happier by myself or by forging

650
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:09,800
new connections or by embracing the ones I have more you know we just did Radcon 2 and from the

651
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:16,760
outside Radcon 2 probably looks like a big party where we all just have fun and make stuff but

652
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:25,400
Radcon is incredibly stressful it is it it's just a powder keg of stress and fucking you know

653
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:32,280
intensity and everyone was feeling it I think I mean the amount of times that we were all just

654
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:39,720
standing around going oh god I want to die I wish I was dead you know I mean we joke about those

655
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:46,040
kind of things all the time whenever we're stressed out but like we always mean it you know when

656
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:53,240
someone is standing around saying I want to die even as a joke it means they're stressed out it means

657
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:58,920
that they do want to die on some level you know I don't think that phrase is ever completely a joke

658
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:04,760
I don't think anyone ever says the phrase I want to die and doesn't mean it on some level

659
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,720
and we were just standing around parroting it back and forth at each other for days

660
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:19,480
because what Radcon is is not just hanging out with your friends it's living with nine

661
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:28,280
extreme personalities who all have their own ways of living their own desires and are thrust into an

662
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,800
ultimately uncomfortable situation of living in a house with a bunch of other guys for fucking a

663
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:42,360
week you know sleeping in the open in on couches you know five people in one room and I don't even

664
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:47,640
have a lot of that problem I slept you know in my room by myself a lot of the time but I had to

665
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:53,400
organize all of it I have to drive everyone around you know figure out what everyone is eating what

666
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,800
everyone can afford you know everyone's got different levels of income different interests

667
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:04,920
different you know ways of life and we've got one car and and there are two cars me and Victor's

668
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:12,040
you know and different sleep schedules you know I want to be up all night Ben is always up all

669
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:18,520
night Nate wakes up early you know we're trying to we're just trying to force all these people who

670
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:24,920
live very different lives to live enough of the same life for a week to get a bunch of stuff done

671
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:32,280
and I've said this before that the best to me the best possible future for the pcp

672
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:39,960
is for us all to live in the same area not in the same house because living with other people

673
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:47,320
is kind of a nightmare you know every single every little difference between your lifestyles

674
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:56,600
is is monumental and sometimes it's not that big a deal you know um like me and Ben live on

675
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:02,840
opposite sides of the house and we rarely interact because Ben almost never wants to go out for any

676
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:09,960
reason he doesn't want to you know he stays in his room he doesn't want to do anything so that's fine

677
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:16,200
but like DeVu he needs food all the time DeVu eat like just goes through tons of fresh food so

678
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,520
you know I end up driving him around and we'll go to like the store or something

679
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:27,560
we'll drag Ben along sometimes and it's just like that little tiny incongruence in our lifestyles

680
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:34,200
that I only need to grocery shop every two weeks or so but he needs to every like five days to a

681
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:41,880
week is a problem you know because it means that either I have to get in my car when I don't want

682
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,880
to and drive from the grocery store or he has to go a few days without food you know waiting for me

683
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:54,120
to be willing to take him it's such a small thing but it causes stress for both of us you know

684
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,840
and I'm think you know DeVu tells me I need groceries and I'm thinking about that in the

685
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,520
back of my mind well I'm trying to get all this other stuff done and he's you know sitting around

686
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:09,320
hungry for a couple extra days living with other people is just a non-stop source of issues unless

687
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:14,920
you're trying to live together you know you're trying to do one thing like when you get married

688
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:20,040
and you have a family then it's like you are unified in your goals you are trying to mold your

689
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,880
lives around one another but I'm not trying to do that with the PCP I want to work with them I don't

690
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:34,440
want to live with them or like them you know and when you put us all in one place together like that

691
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:40,120
then it's not just us working together it's us living together and it is stressful you know it's

692
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,000
not like we got into a bunch of big fights I mean we did get into some pretty heated arguments

693
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,840
you know uh those of you who've listened to the apescape video will hear a part where like me

694
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:56,200
and DeVu get into an argument and I straight up leave the room because I was so heated you know

695
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:03,720
um sometimes stuff like that happens it's and it's kind of just a powder keg it's it's a bunch

696
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,760
of heated personalities you know and it was even more stressful because we had the only way to make

697
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,680
radcon happen was to base it around work you know and like I've talked a lot about how I love working

698
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:19,880
and I love working with these guys but man I would much rather I would much rather if we had just

699
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:26,920
spent a week hanging out you know if it was just a week of us hanging out not having cameras not

700
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,520
working on stuff that would have been great but we couldn't have afforded that we could not afford

701
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:37,480
you know four months after the previous radcon to have everyone pay for flights again to come down

702
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:43,320
here and do this thing for a week you know what made us able to do it was the Kickstarter and the

703
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,960
Kickstarter needed a product we can't just run a Kickstarter for us hanging out I don't think

704
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,440
I don't I don't think we'd that would work out maybe I should have tried

705
01:16:54,760 --> 01:17:01,080
but it's such a shame you know it's a shame we didn't just hang out it's a shame we put ourselves

706
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:05,880
into an even more stressful situation where we had to get certain videos done on certain days

707
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:13,320
videos that involved watching stuff with each other you know we and so many people had so many

708
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,720
projects they wanted to get done and everyone wanted to be a part of everything so you've got

709
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:24,520
you know what should be like two person let's plays that are just fun and relaxing turn into

710
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:30,520
nine person chaotic nightmares where everyone's screaming over each other you know it's just

711
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:37,080
not a good way to live you should not live with with eight other extreme personalities

712
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:44,040
and and little resources you know with everyone living in the same space and and not having enough

713
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:52,200
cars to go around and it really made me like you know realize like yeah I the ideal way to live

714
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:59,000
would be all of us in the same area but I do not want to live with these guys I don't want us to

715
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,760
all share a roof I don't want and the problem is that that's the only reason that we're doing that

716
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,960
with me and Ben and DeVue is just simply that we can't afford it you know we can't afford we don't

717
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,480
have the money to all live in the same area if we did we'd just be doing that you know the only

718
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,480
reason we all live in this house is that we were able to split the rent extremely cheap

719
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:27,480
and um you know Ben would not be able to afford his own place definitely not DeVue could probably

720
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:32,440
not you know I don't pay him enough I don't make enough to pay him enough and really the only

721
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:38,280
reason I can't afford my own place is because I pay DeVue like I would have enough money to get my

722
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:45,480
own place but because I hire him because I want to have him employed by me you know I am putting

723
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:52,520
myself in his position where I have to split rent and have to live with him and Ben so you know

724
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:58,760
it's it's a very weird position to be in and I just want us to be as fast as possible I want

725
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,920
us to be in a situation where we can all have our own places and we can live near each other and just

726
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,200
you know work together and hang out because those are the things that that friends and business

727
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:16,280
partners should do you should work together and you should hang out those are fun things hanging

728
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:23,160
out is fun you know I had a lot more fun in the later half of Radcon when it was just Jesse here

729
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:28,520
because even though I love all those guys you know I would love to hang out with Hippo every other day

730
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:33,560
you know I he's so much fun to hang out with I love hanging out with Nate you know I love hanging

731
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,800
out with Munchie he was super fun I did I had never really had a chance to hang out with Munchie

732
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:43,080
until now and he was really you know he was great to have around but having him around along with

733
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:50,520
everyone else was hellish you know and I'd love it if we all just kind of lived in a space in a

734
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:58,760
in a in a play in one city you know and I could go hey let's go to lunch on Monday you know and

735
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:05,160
catch up and hang out and have a good time hey let's go play a video game we don't even have to

736
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:12,120
record it if we don't want to you know when we were uh when Jesse when Jesse was the only one

737
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,760
left we spent a lot of time playing video games me and him and Ben spent one whole night recording

738
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:22,200
let's plays it was really fun um and then we did a bunch with Victor we were playing through all the

739
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:28,680
tony hot games and Jesse was getting really stressed out about the fact that like you know

740
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:35,000
he's trying to beat these games but he keeps failing at certain challenges and just getting mad

741
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,520
and being like I just want to rush through this game because of the fact that we didn't have enough

742
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,240
to talk about to keep the podcast interesting you know because it's we were recording it so

743
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:48,040
there was this kind of need to be entertaining and Jesse feels that even more strongly than I do

744
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:52,760
like I was perfectly willing to just like kick back and relax and let it be like a goofy video

745
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,720
that wasn't really meant to be something all that serious but I've noticed watching Jesse that when

746
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:03,720
you turn a camera on him he transforms you know Jesse cannot stand not being an entertainer

747
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,640
when when there's when there's something recording at least that's how it seems to me

748
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,000
so you know I could see him getting stressed out and I was it's on some level I was like I just

749
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,480
want to watch you play tony hawk you know I don't care about the lens play I don't care about this

750
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:23,000
whole conceit that we have to be you know working on something I'm just enjoying sitting here

751
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
reading comics and watching Jesse play tony hawk and I'd love to be able to do that and for that

752
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:37,400
not to require a seven thousand dollar Kickstarter and living in the same house and you know if if

753
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:43,080
I'm hungry I better take Jesse because we're we're you know he's not going to be able to eat otherwise

754
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:48,200
but then he's you know like does he want to he has to eat it whenever I'm hungry you know because

755
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:57,960
he's kind of stuck with me you know that's I guess most people probably know about these things I mean

756
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:07,480
I had a lot of issues living with my family you know and living with Ben and DeVue has ultimately

757
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:12,920
been less stressful than living with my family was on some levels because while I didn't have to

758
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:18,840
worry about them too much you know my parents there was one of the biggest stresses in our lives

759
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:24,520
was that we all ate dinner together and I'm not even sure why we did it for so long I guess just

760
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:28,440
because shade was still growing up we all just felt like you know like it was something we had to

761
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:34,200
connect with as a family or something but just for the longest time and also because I was cheap

762
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,720
and Victor was poor so like the idea that we got a free meal every day was a was definitely a plus

763
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,840
but the most stressful thing in our family is that none of us have the same taste

764
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:49,080
uh you know my mom's a vegetarian my dad quit red meat at some point now he's a vegan they're

765
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:54,680
both vegan now now that they live together alone um you know and me Victor and shade all of different

766
01:22:54,680 --> 01:23:02,200
tastes we're all picky and we would like just spend like almost an hour like every day trying to

767
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:08,120
figure out what to make for dinner like arguing about what to make or deciding and like none of

768
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:12,360
us could really cook well and everything we made turned out kind of mediocre and it was just like

769
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,120
and and we go to the grocery store and argue so much about like what we were gonna get and it was

770
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:22,360
just it was just this huge amount of stress that's only caused by the fact that we live together

771
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,840
and have decided to do this thing together and as soon as I started buying my own groceries that

772
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:33,000
all went away that whole thing went away that huge source of stress went away you know and like the

773
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,280
stresses I have now living with Ben DeVu Victor and shade are comparatively minor um but I still

774
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,360
can't help but think man if we each had our own place it would be such a weight off of our shoulders

775
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:51,160
you know like I feel like DeVu would really thrive on his own you know and he's like because he has

776
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:56,440
a huge problem with the cleanliness of the house me and Ben are fucking slobs you know we don't do

777
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,400
anything and I could tell it really bothers DeVu and he doesn't want to have to be the only person

778
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,320
cleaning because it sucks you know because he's the only person who cares so obviously we're not

779
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,440
gonna do it because we don't care but it sucks for him because why should he have to do it all

780
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:17,080
just because we're slobs you know so like you I would love for him to be able to have his own

781
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:21,960
place I think he'd be happier that way you know and I'd be happier we'd all be happier

782
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,960
and so we've all been talking about this whole idea of where are we all gonna move like where

783
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,280
are we gonna go are we still gonna have a place together are we all gonna move into separate

784
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:37,000
houses in some other town there's no reason to stay in Virginia Beach this place is kind of blows

785
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,360
and as we've been talking about it I've kind of come to the realization like I don't know how much

786
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:50,520
I care about whether we all you know live in the same place in the same house you know like

787
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:55,240
I would prefer we had our own places as soon as possible and I know not everybody can afford it

788
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:00,440
but at the same time the level of compromise that we have to go through to to be in the same place

789
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:06,520
like um you know the two main cities we've been looking at moving to are Austin and Portland

790
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,520
and I personally would love to go to Austin because that has a lot more to offer me personally

791
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:15,240
it's a much more music-centric city and I'm a big music guy it's got lots of events you know

792
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:20,600
and Portland is fun and cool and I mean it has those things it has music it has events but it's

793
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:27,960
just not quite the same level and Austin just seems more attractive to me overall but like

794
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:33,320
if we are sharing a place then it's kind of everyone's decision you know if we're all if

795
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:38,440
me and Ben and DeVue have to share a play a room or whatever uh or whoever else we bring you know

796
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:42,920
Ben would rather go to Portland and some of the other PCP guys would rather go to Portland and

797
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:49,240
I'm sitting here thinking like am I going to keep compromising in order to have us all you

798
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:55,000
know live together or should I just go fucking live in Austin by myself you know I could do that

799
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,160
if I wanted to and I don't know I don't know the answer yet but I know that there is one clear

800
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:08,360
solution that will make all of these problems go away and that's making a lot more money if we all

801
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,720
made a lot more money none of this would be an issue you know if each of us could afford our own

802
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:22,840
place in the same city done there's no problem there's no issue you know if I could afford to both

803
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:30,680
live by myself and pay DeVue enough that he could live by himself no issue so that's

804
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,280
that's the that's where I'm going after this you know this whole podcast has been mired and

805
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:44,680
what are my current issues and the solution to a lot of my problems to the problem of stagnation

806
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:49,480
to the problem of complacency that I talked about earlier to the problem of not wanting to

807
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,640
live with other people but you know still wanting to maintain relationships with those people you

808
01:26:53,640 --> 01:27:00,440
know with the least strain possible the problems all the problems I've talked about if I just make

809
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:08,680
a lot more money those problems go away whoever said money can't buy happiness is a fucking idiot

810
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:18,200
peace out

811
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,260
you

812
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,440
You
