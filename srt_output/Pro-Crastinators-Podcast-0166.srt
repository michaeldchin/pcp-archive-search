00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Welcome, one and all, to the Republican first debate of the season, and boy,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
can I not wait to tell you my thoughts on politics and whatnot. We've got a staunch member of the good old...

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is there a good old party? Isn't there a term for Republicans?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, the GOP.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ben, front runner.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As your Republican president, I would burn each and every one of you for fuel.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A bold proposal, but an inevitable one. Hippocrit is here.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's me a cow, moo. That's the symbol, right? That's the animal.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's the kind of thing that I would crack down on as a Republican president. No more of this.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
These cows running for public office has to be stopped now. We can't trust them, they're shifty. Tom Oliver?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I have no idea why we've been calling Souls games and their Elk Souls-like, because I just watched an interview of the guy who made Neo,

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and apparently some headed Sony calls them Massacor, and I think that's the fucking best name ever we should use it.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I mean, Hippo has a name. Dark Demon Blood.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, Dark Demon Blood. Now with Sekiro, it'd be like Dark Demon Blood Shadow.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So it's clunky, but it's cool.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The point is that it's for all the games, even the ones outside of FromSoft.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Massacor sounds like it would also apply to something like Super Meat Boy, or I Want to Be the Guy.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
True.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Maybe it does.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or Dynasty Warriors.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, is the implication here how hard it is?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know. It was weird because it was just like an IGN video that I was just looking for footage, because I'm making a video on it right now.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dude, Crash Bandicoot is so Massacor.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And they just translated it as talking about they had a bunch of influence from Bloodborne.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They're like, yeah, the guy from Sony who pioneered the Massacor genre and worked on Bloodborne.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm like, what the fuck? Where did this come from?

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Just to be clear, that's a play on Massacist as opposed to Massacor.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Which is what I was first thinking.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a masochism and hardcore.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's that one?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hatred would definitely be a part of that new anime girl school shooter game.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That definitely counts.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, that's like a year old or something.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I gotta play those on an IGN.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I forget the name.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a JRP, what's the word?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Game maker, not game maker, RPG maker.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It was made in RPG maker and it's a school shooting game where you play as a girl.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's like a choose your option game, I think, where you just like visual novel style.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You walk into the classroom, a turn based battle starts, you have one command shoot.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There are like 20 enemies on screen.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They're all named like student A, student B, student C.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You just go shoot, shoot, shoot.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know, to be fair, I didn't look at much.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not like that.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But you know what game is like that?

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Page one of the champion.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now that I think about it.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's a massacre game.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's in a massacre core kind of sense.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Indeed, exactly.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, by the way, also Munchie is here.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was going to say you impotent whelp and then talk about how I was creating the Neo Progressive Bull Moose Party.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But the moment has passed and no one remembers the opening premise of the joke of this episode.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going for you.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You know what?

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, thank you, Nate.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I appreciate it.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're welcome.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You've got my endorsement and my subservience in all things.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to kick things off.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to kick things off with Steam versus the Epic Store.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
People have been talking about like something about like some bullshit or some sort of bullshit go along.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I love Boogie.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Dude, I love Boogie so much.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Was Boogie talking about this?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What does he have to say about this episode?

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Isn't Boogie, you know what?

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't even know.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't remember if Boogie is a shill for the Epic Store or if he hates the Epic Store

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and talks about how much he hates it.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Either way, fuck him.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm guessing the latter, but I don't know.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's an idiot.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I haven't really looked into too much of like what people are angry about.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I just think that it is strange that people are angry at all because every argument I've seen is like,

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
well, that doesn't matter.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like it doesn't matter that there's excuses on PC.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, here's just the first thing.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because it's like you don't have to buy a console.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What is happening right now?

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll set the ground layer.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Please.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Steam is a place where you buy games online on PC.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Whoa, wait, stop.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hold on.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wait, can you repeat that?

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Steam.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Computer?

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then there's this game called Fortnite, which owned by Epic Games.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They made an Epic Store.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We're moving so fast.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And they also have a big PC gaming store where they're buying up deals with certain indie

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
games and larger games and whatever to have games exclusively on their store.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And there's a big like war going on, I guess.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And people are like championing Steam because it has like a shopping basket.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And that's it.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't really know what the people championing Steam really have going for them other than

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
there's many features in Steam, but Steam has also been...

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Convenience, maybe?

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's the main thing, I would think.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's annoying to have to get a second thing.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, it's not even that difficult.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The reason I have like so much like disdain for the fact that there's a war about it is

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that you know that image of like the artist puts his cake on the table and he sees another

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
cake and he's like, oh, shit, that's a big cake.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's a better cake than mine.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then the viewer comes and he says, holy shit, two cakes and I'm the two cakes guy.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I see two stores, they're both good.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They're both fine.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They both have stuff on them.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They both have good deals and free shit.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I'm like, hey, I can download these free apps, put them right next to each other on

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
my desktop.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can easily see all the games.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can just click.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I want them to compete to make the things better.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like I don't see like any argument I've seen is like, that's not important.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What do I think of this?

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What a good argument, but I can't as to why it's bad that there's two as opposed to one,

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
except that it's just mildly annoying to have two things.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What is the nature of this outrage?

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm a little bit confused.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So like, you know, the ever store exists and then people got mad somehow in the ether.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, what do you...

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, here's like the basic gist, I think, is that the Epic Store is buying a lot of

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
exclusivity deals with certain games.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And that means people are having to download the Epic Client to play those games.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And that's the extent of like the problem with that.

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I feel like I don't really see how it could be like a big problem unless you have like

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
a large steam wallet that you want to purchase things with.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There were some games that were promised on Steam that then...

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There was at least one.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I forget what it was.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Shenmue 3 was the last big one.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That was supposed to be on Steam and then it was like people had bought it on Steam,

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but then they just moved it to Epic.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They refunded everybody.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The first one that did that was a big one was Metro Exodus.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There were a bunch of pre-orders on Steam.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, so if they refunded everybody, I mean, that is like...

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, they didn't even refund them.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If everybody who pre-ordered is still going to be able to play it on Steam, it's just going forward.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can only get it from the announcement point on Epic.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, really?

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It doesn't sound so bad then.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's one thing when you bought it with the idea of it going on Steam, but the only thing

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that gives you really is an addition to your Steam library list, Steam achievements and

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Steam trading cards and a lot of Steam bullshit that I really have never cared about at all.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know, Steam friends and curation.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Obviously, the Epic store is new and it doesn't have a lot of stuff in it.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I play games, I buy them to play them.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't really go...

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you think about it as a metaphor for a store, I don't go to the Steam store to be on Steam.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just go there to look at what's there, if there's something I want, I buy it and then I play it.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The entire community Steam stuff is completely uninteresting and I don't give a shit.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I totally agree.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think having a lack of that is not an issue for me.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
As a pure video game store thing, there's nothing to be upset about really.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I did a bunch of vlogs about this on IM Games last month or so when it started getting really hot.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
My takeaway from it for me personally was this is the epitome of a first world problem.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To get bent out of shape, you have to move your mouse cursor over 5 pixels to click on a different launcher.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's just not a big deal.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I understand that people are inconvenienced by the idea of like,

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I am invested in the Steam ecosystem and now there are these games that I want to play that I can't play on Steam.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
To be clear though, these are not permanent exclusivity.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a six month to one year exclusivity period and then there can go on Steam.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Video games don't matter after the first six months though.

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In that case, you shouldn't even fucking buy the game in the first place if it's only good for six months.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Fuck that.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's a bit more multi-layered because the reason that a lot of these developers are moving to Epic and taking the deal in the first place

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is not only the cash advance they get for signing an exclusivity agreement,

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
but Epic gives you way more money.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
As a developer, you get 88% as opposed to on Steam where you only get 70%.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So they take a much smaller cut and that's like their big drop.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want that pressure to be on them.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
As everyone knows, generally competition is a good thing.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What's bizarre is that Steam has done nothing in response to this.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They have not made a statement.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They've probably been working on it.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They've just sat on their asses and done nothing like they have done basically for the last five to ten years.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's Gaben's MO in life in general.

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hey, here's a conceptual issue that I have with this concept.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not really a major complaint, but it's like the things remain unideal and this does nothing to improve the situation.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So UniqueNameSaurus made a couple of videos that I found reasonably interesting about piracy.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know if I agree with every single thing he said in a while, but there was one point that he said that was pretty cool

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that I agreed with or at least made sense to me.

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He was talking about anime releases and exclusivity deals with various licensing companies.

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So if you have exclusivity deals for any given show, like for example, Evangelion is finally out in the West,

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and Netflix has it solely, I think, and it's kind of fucked up.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh my God, guys. Evangelion is on Netflix. I can finally watch it.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I could never watch Ava before, but now I can watch it because it's on fucking Netflix.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do you guys know?

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't think you could buy it. I don't think it was on print anywhere.

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you guys know about Love for Terrorism and Evangelion?

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Buying anime.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What?

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What about it?

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I hope it's real.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was finishing a point, by the way.

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, sorry. Continue, continue.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay, all I was going to say was just taking Evangelion as an example.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It actually is still a monopoly that doesn't allow for any of the kind of competitive forces that we would want to improve the product

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
if you have these exclusivity deals, because there simply is no ability to compete.

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And what you would want, theoretically, is every service can produce the show

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and they can each try to make it as presented as best as possible.

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The perfect world is one where the best service is the one that people go to.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And then if everybody could have Ava, if Amazon had Ava and Netflix had Ava, it's just two.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's not perfect, but it's more than...

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I mean, for example...

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If Amazon had Fly Me to the Moon in their version, then people would be like,

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
oh, I'm going to that one.

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And there's a new dub they used.

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Maybe the other service might use the old dub.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then we could see, oh, this did much better.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That shows us that the people liked X more than Y, whichever one does better in that situation.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, that's the sort of thing that you would want, this kind of proliferation

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
among different platforms to solve.

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But we have in no way done anything to fix that issue.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And I don't have a solution.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But that would be the main thing I would want something like this to solve,

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
but it does not, at least the way it's operating currently.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But then again, with Tom's point about it being a time exclusive,

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
maybe that will eventually help.

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I mean, all you can really do as a creative is to be obstinate

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and not let people do stupid things,

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
even if it means you're not going to get as much money

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
like the guy who made Calvin and Hobbes.

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No adaptations ever, please, ever.

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And that's why Calvin and Hobbes has not been ruined.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay, that's a cool idea.

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But now that he's dead, which I assume he is,

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
let's work with his estate and get a Garfield crossover

238
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
with Calvin and Hobbes movie on the big screen.

239
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
As a massive fan of Calvin and Hobbes, that idea repulses me.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mean, who's to say Hobbes is not Garfield?

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Exactly.

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The people eat it up.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Lasagna and whatever Calvin and Hobbes were into.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They're kind of fit.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Y'all breakers?

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sledding.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Lasagna on the sled.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's the name of the show.

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, on a lasagna pan.

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He could sled in a lasagna pan.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's perfect.

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Excellent.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I already want to end this podcast.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is horrifying.

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Anyway.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Before we pivot away.

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The interesting thing about a perfect ideal world,

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
like a perfect ideal service, Gogg, the underdog hero,

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
the greatest service of all time, no DRM.

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They have stepped up to the plate and they're like,

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
hey guys, we're going to make a new application for Gogg Galaxy,

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
which is like their version of Steam.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But they're completely revamping it.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And what it's going to do is it's going to tie into Steam and Epic.

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So you launch Gogg and you have access to your Steam, your Epic,

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and you're gone.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Now we're talking in one place.

268
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I really love that.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's the good shit.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because those guys have always seemed to be like, yeah,

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
we just want this to be good.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Like the reason they started was all these old games

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that they wanted to play, they just couldn't play.

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's really difficult to get a fucking working version

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
of populist at the beginning or whatever.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Right.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They loved that game.

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And it was like, oh my god, Gogg, they care.

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They care about this sort of thing.

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They care about making the games accessible and easy to use.

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I'm sure they're big into archiving.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's just a nicer feeling than Epic.

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And those guys are owned by...

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's the CG project read, guys, right?

287
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The Witcher.

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah.

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay, that's great.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's great.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's great.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's great.

293
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's great.

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's great.

295
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's great.

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's great.

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's great.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's great.

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's great.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's great.

301
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's great.

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's great.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's great.

304
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's great.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's great.

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's great.

307
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's great.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's great.

309
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's great.

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's great.

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's great.

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's great.

313
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's great.

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's great.

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's great.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's great.

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's great.

318
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's great.

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, it's great for destruction.

320
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's just auego.

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's great!

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's great.

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's great.

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's great.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's great.

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's great.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Great.

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fantastic.

329
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
All right, good lip shake.

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's good.

331
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's great.

332
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I actually...

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I actually heard Marc in here, you and I.

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Marc taught me how to do doorstrokes in�루.

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I think I also did really cool.

336
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And you never did one in the future though.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Any ideas in there?

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No.

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No.

340
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No, with regards to the WCS, why did you...

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
You mentioned the Witcher, didn't you?

342
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,400
It was his Demon Souls playthrough,

343
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,920
there's a wall in Shrine of Storms that you can jump over,

344
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,280
and it was not intended to be there by the developer.

345
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,740
And, but people use it to skip like two thirds

346
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,080
of the entire route, which if you play Demon Souls,

347
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,400
it's like a huge thing, you should not be able to do it,

348
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
but you can with this exploit.

349
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,120
And Miyazaki, you know, creator or whatever,

350
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Dark Souls Man was asked like,

351
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,160
hey, in an interview that Matthew highlighted,

352
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
it's like, if you were making the game, like originally,

353
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,880
would you have kept that there,

354
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,720
or would you have like removed it?

355
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
He's like, if I was back in time making it then,

356
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,120
I would have removed it,

357
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,080
but I would never remove it now,

358
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,440
because it's a part of like the ecosystem,

359
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,120
and it's part of the identity of the game,

360
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,560
which is this whole thing I always talk about,

361
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,480
how art is created and then shown,

362
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
and so you need to preserve that vision,

363
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,480
and I am so terrified of our modern day

364
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,960
of like patching things,

365
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,600
and removing little things like that,

366
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,560
that add personality and color to games.

367
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,600
Oh, I feel so much as being lost in time,

368
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,440
and it's very sad.

369
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,960
Kind of like the whole World of Warcraft vanilla thing,

370
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,040
how that just got patched,

371
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,960
and they brought back vanilla recently.

372
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
Oh, is that recent?

373
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,360
Is it out now?

374
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,920
Yeah, I think it's out now, pretty sure.

375
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,280
I don't think it comes out until like August.

376
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,160
There's like a closed beta that people are playing.

377
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
Soon, yeah.

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,520
This is responding to those people's concerns,

379
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,720
and frankly, I kind of feel bad for,

380
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,320
maybe there's like a couple people out there

381
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,680
who loved like vanilla plus like one patch.

382
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,080
They thought like that was the best version of the game,

383
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,920
but like where's their, you know, non-vanilla,

384
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
vanilla plus one version.

385
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,920
I mean, it's a sad feeling knowing that

386
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,680
I will never be able to play what I perceive

387
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,640
to be the best era of Team Fortress 2 again.

388
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,040
Like I have this game in my Steam library

389
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,760
called Team Fortress 2,

390
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,080
and it functions much the same way

391
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,560
that the game that I used to play does,

392
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,720
but with such minor tweaks that just here and there

393
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,440
over and over and over again,

394
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,520
that make it feel weirdly alien to me,

395
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,480
even though on the face of it,

396
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,360
almost all of it is the same.

397
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,680
And you know, the thing about these games,

398
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,600
the thing about these games is I'm aware

399
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,440
that like this is a trade-off,

400
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,280
we're sacrificing like preserving history, I guess,

401
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,400
for like the ability to upgrade games,

402
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,920
which is a fantastic ability, it's true,

403
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,800
but you know, all I'm lamenting

404
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
is the thing that's being lost there.

405
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,960
This is kind of why I don't want physical copies

406
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,480
of games to go away, because I mean,

407
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,280
with a physical disc, like the 1.0 is burned to the disc.

408
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,760
So you disconnect from the internet.

409
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,480
And I buy digital, but I should buy physical

410
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
for that exact reason.

411
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,320
But then again, it's annoying though,

412
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,400
because sometimes you put like,

413
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,440
if it's a PS3 or PS4 game,

414
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,080
I mean, I guess you can turn the internet off,

415
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,640
but if you put a disc in, it'll say,

416
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,560
ah, this is the version 1.0 version of the game.

417
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,640
It'll require you to upgrade before you can play.

418
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
You have to update before, yeah,

419
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,280
and it'll just patch all this new stuff onto it.

420
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,160
That's just, that's a symptom of this larger,

421
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,600
like they're just like, everyone's online,

422
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,680
you have to be able to upgrade now.

423
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,360
But just having the disc gives you the option

424
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
of going back to the 1.0 if you want to.

425
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,280
Whereas the digital, they're kind of fucked.

426
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,480
Something to mention about the World of Warcraft thing though,

427
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,280
as much as I want to give Blizzard Activision credit

428
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,880
for listening to people.

429
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,720
Never forget that Jon Tron video

430
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
where they shut those boys down.

431
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,040
They did famously go on stage,

432
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,560
tell everybody you don't want this at all,

433
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,600
and then people, I forgot about that.

434
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,240
When people made fan versions of these vanilla servers,

435
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,960
they litigated and shut them down,

436
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,880
only to turn around and monetize exactly

437
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,240
what the fans were doing for free anyways.

438
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,400
I mean, oh, they have the right to do that legally.

439
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,000
I get the business incentive, but-

440
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
You're still a bit of a cut.

441
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,440
It makes them, they're very much,

442
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,320
like the guys running World of Warcraft,

443
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,440
they weren't the original guys who made it.

444
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,600
They're sort of like, the story writers

445
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,800
have been like kind of stupid over time.

446
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,120
There's like, they clearly don't have the same reverence

447
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,000
for the original game as the people who play it, the game.

448
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,560
They just sort of like up their own arse.

449
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,400
I mean, a few of them, I forget the names.

450
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,560
Even people who make a game, even the original,

451
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,320
like they have a very different experience

452
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,160
of like the people who first played it.

453
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,840
Like this Demon's Souls example.

454
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,480
Man, I just, it annoys me on such a,

455
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,440
this actually ties into just like the FF7 remake thing.

456
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,240
People just look at the, they think they understand

457
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,680
that like, they look at a vanilla WoW versus like new WoW,

458
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,720
and they're like, what's the difference?

459
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,040
They look the same to me,

460
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
because they weren't there, man.

461
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,400
They weren't in the trenches.

462
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,440
They didn't experience what it was like

463
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,640
to be part of that community.

464
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,640
And I would never speak to like what the vanilla WoW community

465
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,200
was like compared to like the new people,

466
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,440
because I don't fucking know.

467
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
But I do know about some things, like like FF7.

468
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
And to people who just say like, shut up.

469
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,520
It's like, it's then, you know, it's...

470
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,640
Shut up, just to consume product

471
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
and then be excited for the next product.

472
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
At least when people make the argument that like,

473
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,840
it's an upgrade, well, not even,

474
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,040
I won't use the word upgrade because that implies positivity.

475
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,040
People will say like, it's a reimagining.

476
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,720
It's a new version for new players.

477
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,880
I mean, at least that's like an honest argument

478
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,320
you can make that like, okay, sure.

479
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,280
So we're admitting that it's totally changing tons of shit.

480
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,560
And that's, you know, I need to just deal with that

481
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,400
or not play it.

482
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,520
At least in the case though of FF7,

483
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,560
like it's not an online always connected game.

484
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,720
So you can always go back and play, you know,

485
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,560
the PS1 version.

486
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,520
Thank God for that.

487
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,560
Thank God for that.

488
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,920
Imagine if this was like, oh, FF7 was always connected online

489
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,000
and now it's just become this, you know?

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,880
Games are gonna be like that more and more.

491
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,080
Yeah, I mean, Stadia is, if that becomes successful,

492
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,480
we're all fucked.

493
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Again, this comes down to artists being obstinate

494
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,120
and refusing to bow down to sing the things like this.

495
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,800
If I ever make a game, I mean, you know, whatever,

496
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,320
if I ever make a game and I want it to stay how it is,

497
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,400
I will definitely always have the original version

498
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
like accessible.

499
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,760
Like if I have a website like download patch 1.0,

500
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,240
I mean, Minecraft does that and that's great for Minecraft.

501
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,160
You can download these original alpha.

502
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,840
Minecraft's surprisingly incredible about it.

503
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,920
For such like a big company like Microsoft,

504
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,400
they are surprisingly excellent about it.

505
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
They probably just kept that ethos.

506
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,240
I mean, I don't know for sure,

507
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,720
but like based on the way that Notch made it originally,

508
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,840
he seemed like a kind of guy who cared

509
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,920
about that sort of thing.

510
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
They probably kept that in place.

511
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,160
Maybe he like had something in the contract

512
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
when he sold Mojang.

513
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,120
He's like, no, you gotta keep this shit up.

514
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,960
Yeah.

515
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,960
I mean, the thing is, guys, to everybody out there,

516
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,840
ex-former professional programmer

517
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,160
work with a ton of,

518
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,680
it is so common for people to preserve old versions

519
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,280
of software because they know that when you're doing

520
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,720
professional, I don't know, engineering work or whatever,

521
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,040
you've got old software, you need to be able to support.

522
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
And after a while, it's true.

523
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Things can get phased out and not supported

524
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,560
by newer releases.

525
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,240
We have all this engineering software, we did,

526
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,400
that would connect with each other

527
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,520
and you have to make sure that your versions are compatible

528
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,680
and that was always a headache.

529
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,920
But you can always go back and get like,

530
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,920
the old, old versions of things, they still exist.

531
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,800
And all I'm advocating for is that we preserve that

532
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,400
for games as well, if possible.

533
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,600
That'd be, it wouldn't even be hard, frankly.

534
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,000
You just have to have the code,

535
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,760
have the fucking data available to people to download.

536
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,680
People are smart, we can figure it out.

537
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,040
The problem is these companies don't see games

538
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,400
as art to be preserved, it's just business.

539
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
And so they don't care.

540
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,960
Why preserve this thing when we can just turn around

541
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,360
and resell it to you in 10 years all over again.

542
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,640
It kind of reminds me of like,

543
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,160
it's a little bit like how Apple feels

544
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,640
such a need to control all their patents

545
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,400
and data and versions of everything.

546
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,720
And like, I understand that from a business side,

547
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,920
but the cost is like people's ability to, I don't know,

548
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,880
like it's a black box.

549
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,520
You can't get in there and see what's being changed

550
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,120
and I don't know, make tweaks or something.

551
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,800
Maybe people can, I'm no expert on Apple products

552
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,840
or services, but this is my understanding, yeah.

553
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,600
Nothing's built to last anymore.

554
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Yeah, I don't know.

555
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
Planned obsolescence.

556
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,600
Planned obsolescence.

557
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,240
Planned obsolescence.

558
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
Planned obsolescence.

559
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,080
Put that on a shirt.

560
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,520
Speaking of planned obsolescence,

561
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,560
all I was gonna say was I was listening to H3H3's interview

562
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,520
with Vsauce briefly the other day.

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
And speaking of planned obsolescence,

564
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,200
he, as basically a futurist himself,

565
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,400
I was encouraged to see that he agrees with me

566
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,080
that immortality for human beings

567
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,600
is probably not a good idea

568
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,240
from like a growth of the species perspective.

569
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,840
Not because I want people to die,

570
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,840
that is unfortunate and a moral bad thing that happens,

571
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,960
but it is a pragmatic step

572
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,200
to make sure that ideas are continually evolving

573
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
and to not go krypton,

574
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,480
because that's what happened in Superman.

575
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,040
That's why krypton went to shit,

576
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,640
because everybody lived forever

577
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,800
and their society was stagnant and shit.

578
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,080
But just saying that, that was pretty cool.

579
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,600
I'd never watched Vsauce, but after that,

580
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,280
I was like, I could get into this man.

581
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,480
If you're like Michael,

582
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,920
but you don't like Vsauce,

583
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,560
you should check out Ding, formerly Dong,

584
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,160
which is a YouTube channel where he just shows off

585
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,520
weird maths toys and is really funny,

586
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,360
because he's a creepy crazy man.

587
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,480
I love him, he's great.

588
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
He is creepy and I love the,

589
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
when he talks weird in Vsauce,

590
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,920
it's kind of like off-putting,

591
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,000
because it feels so, I don't know,

592
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,600
but what I want him to be is my weird uncle

593
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,760
who talks funny and do his weird eyebrow raises.

594
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,240
He really plays into that on Ding,

595
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,960
like being the creepy uncle, like crazy man,

596
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,280
excited about stupid maths shit.

597
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh, I love him.

598
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,240
He did a video in April and he said,

599
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,840
well Christmas is nearly around the corner

600
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,560
and I thought it would be a great time

601
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,040
to talk about this thing

602
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
that has nothing to do with Christmas.

603
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,720
He just made it a Christmas episode for no reason.

604
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,160
Oh, see, it's funny, it's good.

605
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,400
I like it a lot.

606
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,280
He really won me over with this one clip

607
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,280
on the H3 podcast, way to go Vsauce.

608
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,440
Is there a guy named like Vsauce3?

609
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,480
Are there like multiple versions of this manner?

610
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,520
Vsauce Michael is the only good one.

611
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Vsauce, Jake, and Vsauce, and Vsauce, Paul.

612
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,400
I don't remember their names, or Kevin or something.

613
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,360
Are you say they shit munchie?

614
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,440
They're shit.

615
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,280
I say they're shit.

616
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,200
Good to know.

617
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,320
Yeah, I believe you.

618
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Vsauce3 is Jake and he went on,

619
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,480
he went full jauntron and making like a big set.

620
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,280
Uh-oh, racially.

621
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,840
No, no, he had like this video,

622
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,400
which was basically a very basic Vsauce video

623
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,040
about like some very understandable stuff.

624
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,240
But he like obviously spent like thousands of dollars

625
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,720
on a set and costumes and things.

626
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,080
And it didn't get a lot of views and he got depressed

627
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,360
and he was like, man, you just didn't need

628
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,680
to do all of that stuff.

629
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,280
You weren't talking about anything very interesting.

630
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,680
I don't know what's going on with him.

631
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,280
The last I saw, he was like working

632
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,880
with Casey Neistat on something.

633
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
But that was a while ago.

634
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,960
They're gonna say working to KFC.

635
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I don't know.

636
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,800
Maybe that too.

637
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
Gotta pay back, bro.

638
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,840
You're working with Casey Neistat,

639
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,120
things are going pretty well.

640
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,240
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,400
One content creator I quite cherish,

642
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,640
which I feel is almost awkward and embarrassing

643
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,120
to admit because he's popular,

644
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,520
and therefore the subject of must-needed ire,

645
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,600
I listen to and I follow CGP Grey a lot.

646
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,480
And so I hear him talk about rubbing shoulders

647
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,720
with all these sorts of people about Vsauce

648
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,280
and all the different versions and clones of Vsauce

649
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,080
going to VidCon and about how he knows

650
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
and interacts with these people.

651
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,200
And it's interesting to hear it from the horse's math

652
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
because I don't really interact with any YouTubers

653
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,120
that we consider popular outside of him.

654
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,400
So, and because he's a reclusive guy himself,

655
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,480
it's sort of like two layers of filteredness

656
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,280
that I'm just hearing about these dimmy gods on earth

657
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,520
who couldn't bend people to their will instantaneously

658
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
if they requested it.

659
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,720
Do you ever see that Bill Wertz clip?

660
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,760
You know, I just did a bad thing.

661
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,320
Everybody knows Bill Wertz.

662
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,160
Of course.

663
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,480
When he was, he accepted like a webby or whatever it was.

664
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,320
Yes, yes, yes.

665
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,080
It just seems so like not,

666
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,240
no, a little bit judge anybody

667
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,560
even goes to these.

668
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,480
I mean, I would go to if I was him,

669
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,560
but he just, man, he's one of us, dude.

670
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,000
He didn't give a fuck about this award.

671
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,160
Or he was like, thanks.

672
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,320
And then he peaced out.

673
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,400
I mean, I've always like loved the idea

674
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,320
of like not doing that exact thing.

675
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,240
Yeah, yeah.

676
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,080
Like just saying things.

677
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,920
Reminds me of you a little bit.

678
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,080
Musician, freak of nature.

679
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,560
Disturbing to look upon, yeah.

681
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
I can sink into what happened.

682
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,800
Give goes up, wins his webby.

683
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,680
Just goes up there in his I'm just being cool T-shirt.

684
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,400
Yes, of course.

685
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
It's a little nod, a little.

686
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,600
And then just goes away.

687
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
It proceeds to dab on all the haters at once.

688
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,440
That's the way.

689
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,800
I know when the last straw gets 27 million views

690
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,680
and they'll be the true bill where it's desperate.

691
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,560
Imagine the first like dab at the Oscars.

692
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,600
I bet it's probably already happened, yeah.

693
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,080
Years ago, yeah, yeah.

694
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,780
God, I hope it's me again.

695
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,580
Hey, you know, speaking of AGD-DGUQ,

696
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,220
the thisfastgamer.com,

697
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,820
I have like trouble watching,

698
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,140
well, I don't have trouble watching speedruns,

699
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,340
but like I always like to watch a speedrun

700
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,260
like of games that I played as a young'un.

701
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,820
Because obviously when you're a young'un, you're stupid

702
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,860
and you don't play games really fast.

703
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,300
But then it turns out that all the games

704
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
like PS2 games of that era,

705
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,220
you can't really play them fast

706
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,820
and a lot of things you can't skip.

707
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,820
It's like I look up speedrun of like Sly Cooper 2.

708
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,700
World record like five hours long.

709
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,820
Like that's not fun.

710
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,180
Same with like, yeah, like FF7 or Kingdom Hearts 2.

711
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,740
They're like eight hours long or something.

712
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,580
It's like I'm not sitting down.

713
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,180
I mean, all my childhood favorites

714
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,820
are pretty good speedrun stuff.

715
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
It's mostly like SNES stuff.

716
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,420
So that's like the golden era.

717
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,900
I was watching the Secret of Mana speedrun the other day.

718
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
I've been replaying it with the new collection on Switch.

719
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,740
It's pretty cool.

720
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,300
I'll play the sequel, Legend of Mana,

721
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,460
whatever it's retitled or something.

722
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,380
And like specifically watching them do things.

723
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,220
First of all, when you're young and you play a game,

724
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,420
you're probably just gonna miss a lot

725
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,740
of like mainline content.

726
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,060
I know I did.

727
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,300
Watching like Mario RPG or Secret of Mana,

728
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,740
it's like, oh my God, there's all these things

729
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
I didn't know about.

730
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,580
That's pretty dope.

731
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,740
And then also just watching them

732
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,500
just break the game wide open with like these,

733
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,580
especially if it's like not glitchless,

734
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,500
but like if they don't hack the game,

735
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,620
they just use whatever mechanics are available to them.

736
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,660
It's like, wow, so cool.

737
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,620
I wanna do that too someday.

738
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,420
I could be a strong boy.

739
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,860
And I could now probably beat Secret of Mana

740
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,180
in a couple hours shorter than intended

741
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,740
with a couple of these tricks I've learned.

742
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,100
Watching games where they make heavy use of glitches,

743
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,260
like Nintendo 64 games,

744
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,460
it's always like makes me feel like weirdly

745
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,260
how could you make a game this poorly?

746
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,700
Even though I know that these are like professionals

747
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,780
who have spent their entire lives

748
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,300
to break these beloved games.

749
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,620
They were helped to get on.

750
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,460
Which for a lot of the intense purposes

751
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,300
is functioning completely fine.

752
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,620
Do you ever watch the Summoning Salt like History of?

753
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,460
I love those, yeah.

754
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,580
Yeah, like the parts where like,

755
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,500
he'll explain the mechanic,

756
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,820
like how like everyone was looking for a long time

757
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,140
for a way to skip the bridge to Ganon's Castle

758
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,340
in Ocarina of Time.

759
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,500
And then like an incredibly esoteric fucking method

760
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,500
was discovered and it just changed the whole game, yeah.

761
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,100
Or the way when it was finally discovered

762
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,940
how you could beat Mario 64

763
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,420
without collecting any stars, but the last one.

764
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,620
Yeah, that was great.

765
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,420
Speedrunners are like the modern day equivalent

766
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,580
of our ancient ancestors.

767
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,940
Like the ones that first discovered

768
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,420
that you can plant seeds and then reap the wheat.

769
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,540
No, fucking dumb.

770
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,380
No, because it's like how would you possibly think

771
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,380
to eat a berry or to like consume anything?

772
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,220
Like when you come into existence.

773
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,580
Because it's bright and colorful and you're like,

774
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,500
we've got instincts, you know, we're based on.

775
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,780
No, listen, impossible.

776
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,700
And that's what speedruns like, you know,

777
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,300
you just backflip into the same wall

778
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,340
over and over and over again on the 50th one,

779
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,020
you now clip into the last level

780
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,780
and instantly gain the star.

781
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,780
That's what agriculture is like, you know.

782
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,660
You're a human out in society and then you just backflip

783
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,260
into the ground over and over and over again

784
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,820
and assume enough, your family is fed

785
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,460
and you're the king of a primitive society.

786
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,620
I mean, it's not like people just go into a game,

787
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,860
like speedrunners or like hackmasters go into a game

788
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,300
and just like jump into shit.

789
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
I mean, some obviously do just for fun.

790
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,380
They find things, but like, you know,

791
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Pan and Koic, the famous man, watch for rolling rocks

792
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,420
in 0.58 presses.

793
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,500
Half a time it doesn't work that way.

794
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
Yes.

795
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,260
Yeah, like I watch all of his videos,

796
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,460
even the ones that are like really mathematical

797
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,140
and like, you know, when he's just explaining

798
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,220
how walls, floors and ceilings work

799
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,300
and how they push Mario like every frame.

800
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,660
I still love that blue coins video.

801
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,940
Yeah, and like all of these things

802
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,060
and they use like a system of like recording the game

803
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,100
through and a specific emulating thing

804
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,780
so that they can look at the code that's running

805
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,380
and see the numbers at like in real time.

806
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,340
And so they can see like visually

807
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,260
without really having to jump into every wall,

808
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,380
what walls could be jumped through

809
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,500
if you had enough speed.

810
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,740
And the question is how to get enough speed

811
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,820
or something.

812
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,660
And then they find a way.

813
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,500
Yeah.

814
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,340
They break that shit.

815
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,340
So you can hack into the mainframe to find secrets.

816
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,140
Every cell often when I'm walking down the street

817
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,460
and this is real, Kaz can attest to this.

818
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,900
Sometimes I've just like gone to a wall.

819
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,980
That kid who no-clipped all the way to school.

820
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,220
I mean, I've like pretended to no-clip through walls

821
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,780
on many occasions.

822
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,420
Where I'll just go up to wall trying back to it

823
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,740
and just go hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.

824
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,060
I feel like, stop, stop.

825
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
I think I've seen you do that.

826
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,940
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.

827
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,860
That kid whose dad worked at Nintendo

828
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,700
and had all the hacks.

829
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,100
Do you do like the backwards long jump?

830
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,260
Like, yahoo.

831
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,700
No, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, exactly.

832
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,860
Yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

833
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,460
That kid who, what is it?

834
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,700
Back jumped up the stairs at light speed

835
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,860
and got past the infinite staircase.

836
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
AKA the escalator going down.

837
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,300
Yeah, that's good.

838
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,980
Actually there is that one clip of a dude doing that

839
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,660
that's like famously posted or whatever.

840
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,500
For real, oh my gosh.

841
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,100
Well, okay, kind of, it's like.

842
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,140
Okay, I don't know if this is like

843
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,980
reverse footage. I don't know if it's possible.

844
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,900
It's like a dude, he does like a pose

845
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,380
at the bottom of a staircase.

846
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,500
And then like, he like moves backward

847
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,180
and his feet are moving in like a seemingly impossible way.

848
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,740
And he's like going backwards up the staircase.

849
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,540
And there's like a webm that's called like, you know,

850
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,580
MarioStairGlitch.mp4.mpg.webm, or whatever it is.

851
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,460
.mpreg, .normalpreg.

852
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,700
My favorite encoder.

853
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,060
.ntr, yahoo, it's all good.

854
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,060
Hey, well I have a slight tangent,

855
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,940
but this is actually all very much in keeping

856
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,780
with the subject that I wish to discuss today

857
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,700
on this episode, which was the concept

858
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,820
of spiritual successors, which kind of ties

859
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,180
into like preserving history and a little bit

860
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,020
and all that, because I just beat bloodstained

861
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,380
Ritual of the Night for my Nintendo Switch.

862
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,940
Hell yeah. Oh, you played on the Switch?

863
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,700
I've been hearing bad things about that version.

864
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,460
It is not good on the Switch.

865
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,060
There have been, okay, I've had one fatal glitch

866
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,620
where it just died and I had to restart the game

867
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,540
and lost progress, so that's not good that that happened.

868
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,380
I guess you backflip and you won too many walls, huh?

869
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,500
That's exactly, I went too many QPUs over

870
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,140
and just lost track of who I was spiritually.

871
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,380
I have no basis for comparison.

872
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,140
I don't know if it looks better on the PlayStation

873
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,780
or on PC or anything.

874
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,380
I gotta tell this game looks like ass.

875
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,220
I gotta watch those digital foundry videos, dude.

876
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,300
I should check those out, because I'm actually curious,

877
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,540
because I got a man in this game looked horrible

878
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,900
in my humble opinion, specifically the color design,

879
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,740
I thought was quite bad and the models

880
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,380
were not very impressive, and all the animations were,

881
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,340
they were fine and all that.

882
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,660
Because it wasn't sprites, it's 3D models

883
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,020
in a 2.5D perspective or whatever.

884
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,460
Just quite unattractive.

885
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,100
All the enemies look bad.

886
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,700
I miss the sprites intensely.

887
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,180
Sprites are infinitely better compared to this.

888
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,540
We're still in this awkward, transitionary phase.

889
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,220
I get why they did in 3D, but not great.

890
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,180
There was a bunch of ego posts of video

891
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,620
like a month ago or whatever about like,

892
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,820
we improved the visuals to me.

893
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,500
Yeah, I saw that.

894
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,860
That was okay. It didn't look very impressive.

895
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,220
I'm not, I've not been following this game very closely

896
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,540
whatsoever, I knew of its existence,

897
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,740
and I knew that people didn't like the way that it looked.

898
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,180
I had never seen it before.

899
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:15,100
And then I watched that video of him rather like,

900
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,940
pompously saying like, oh, listen,

901
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,420
you haven't seen my true form.

902
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Listen, we've listened to criticism.

903
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,420
And here it is.

904
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,540
We've unveiled the new graphics.

905
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,940
And to me, they looked as bad as what I was imagining

906
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,780
that people were like.

907
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,220
It looked like people were saying.

908
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,060
It looked terrible.

909
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,540
To me, it looked like they applied filters

910
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,860
and maybe updated some of the textures.

911
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,220
I mean, probably a lot of them.

912
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,340
But the models were the same,

913
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,540
the animations were all the same.

914
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,340
And both of those I don't really care about.

915
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,740
The models were pretty ugly and clunky.

916
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,140
Okay, none of this is to my main point

917
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,340
because while there were many graphical glitches,

918
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,020
there were many kind of gameplay glitches,

919
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,420
like items that get stuck in walls,

920
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,900
and sometimes it was kind of weird when enemies dropped them.

921
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,700
And again, I had one game breaking glitch

922
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,020
where it stopped I to restart the game.

923
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,540
The thing is though, I loved the game

924
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,420
because I really don't give much of a fuck about,

925
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,340
like it reminded me of that Samus Returns remake

926
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,020
for the 3DS or whatever.

927
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,700
There was a 3DS game about on par

928
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,900
with this fucking Switch game in my estimation.

929
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,980
And you know, this is made by Kickstarter.

930
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,100
I haven't gone over the numbers to judge like,

931
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,020
okay, was my experience good enough

932
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,740
to justify the amount of money they make?

933
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,020
Like have they given their backers rewards?

934
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,460
And those are all valid concerns,

935
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,980
which I'm not even dismissing.

936
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,500
My point simply is that I have been a huge

937
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,220
Castlevania specifically Egavania fan

938
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,780
for a million years, ever since I played Castlevania,

939
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,700
fucking Circle of the Moon on GBA way back in the day.

940
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,540
I loved him ever since,

941
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,220
played every Egavania that exists.

942
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,020
Does history still like Egavanias?

943
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,860
Has the worm turned on us?

944
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,340
I think there's so bad rap these days.

945
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,020
I think they're somewhat contentious

946
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,540
from what I understand.

947
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,860
I feel like for a while,

948
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,700
it looks really nice.

949
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,540
That definitely looks really nice.

950
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,700
It was like the best game on PlayStation.

951
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,660
Everyone loved it shit.

952
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,300
And then there was a million imitators.

953
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,260
I feel like maybe like the years and years of imitators

954
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,540
soured people on the whole formula a little bit.

955
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I think that's probably a large part of it.

956
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,980
I think the ego raptor kind of started turning that

957
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,740
when he did the Sequelitis on Castlevania

958
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,340
and kind of shit on the RPG ones

959
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,820
and saying that the classics were better.

960
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,140
I think that kind of started shifting

961
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,740
that's understandable in a big way.

962
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,580
You know what?

963
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,020
Now that I've played a lot more games since I played,

964
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,860
I mean, whatever,

965
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,100
I played Order of Ecclesia in college,

966
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,500
which was where you play Shanoa.

967
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,380
That was like the last real Castlevania game

968
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,540
and or the last main Egavania.

969
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,980
There's been a couple like Lords of Shadows,

970
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,980
piece of shit, don't care, no interest,

971
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,140
tried them, terrible.

972
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,260
And this one was the next,

973
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,860
this is like really the continuation.

974
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,500
So it's a spiritual successor, right?

975
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,860
Castlevania is basically dead.

976
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,220
At least the game, the style of game that I cared about

977
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,180
that Konami used to make, Konami, whatever.

978
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,100
They're not making video games anymore basically at all.

979
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,980
That's fine.

980
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,780
So it's up to the little guys to make it

981
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,980
with kick starters and whatever we got.

982
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,220
Played the game, I beat the game like an hour

983
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,300
before we started filming.

984
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,380
I beat like the true final boss

985
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,380
and I'm at like 99.8% math completion

986
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,220
and I've been trying to find that last 0.2%

987
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,340
and it's pissing me off.

988
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,100
I can't fucking find what room I missed,

989
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,420
but that's okay.

990
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,540
I am loving it.

991
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,300
Oh, and I was gonna say to someone's point

992
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,060
about like the old games being better.

993
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,540
It is very much on my mind that I'm able to like RPG style

994
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,420
brute force many of the bosses in this game

995
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,060
that like I'm not using skill.

996
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,980
I'm using like stats and the ability to just use potions.

997
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,820
And so that's pretty embarrassing

998
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,940
to realize I'm doing that.

999
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,180
But whatever, man.

1000
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm just loving the game overall.

1001
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,220
Maybe I'll do like a hard mode game.

1002
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,740
You talking about the blood stains?

1003
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,700
Yes, that's correct.

1004
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,540
That's correct.

1005
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,940
What was the other one, the like NES version one?

1006
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,060
No, that was all for this, wasn't it?

1007
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,900
Yeah, and I also-

1008
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,580
There was Curse of the Moon, right?

1009
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,420
Curse, that's right.

1010
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
It's like Bloodstained Curse of the Moon.

1011
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,100
I got that game as well.

1012
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,020
I played it all the way through

1013
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,260
and that's like a classic NES.

1014
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,700
I got to the final boss and like died on it a couple of times

1015
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,260
and I was like, I'll come back and beat this later.

1016
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,060
I feel like I basically got 100% out of it

1017
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,620
though I didn't quite beat the final boss.

1018
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,180
So I'm a relatively inexperienced on Bloodstained stuff now.

1019
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,820
I've played the two games that exist for it.

1020
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,420
Yeah, you could say I'm an epic gamer.

1021
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,020
I'm gonna go for at least 100% completion of the map,

1022
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,580
but I mean, that's very little left to do.

1023
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,380
Okay, but none of this is to my point.

1024
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,060
My point is I respect the effort that made Bloodstained.

1025
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,660
I legitimately, I'd use the word loved

1026
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,140
because it's so nostalgic.

1027
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,620
The idea of exploring the castle, completing the map,

1028
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,660
getting these power-ups.

1029
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,100
I mean, and I love Metroidvanias.

1030
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,900
They're like my favorite genre, if you wanna call them that.

1031
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,780
But it makes me feel nervous about the future of games

1032
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,740
because the point I wanna make about them

1033
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,260
is like Konami, big company, lots of people,

1034
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,020
they said like, fuck video games.

1035
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,060
They're not sustainable anymore, whatever.

1036
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,100
We're not gonna emphasize them

1037
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,700
at least the way we used to.

1038
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,740
And so the Igavenia, like the man behind them,

1039
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,580
the Igavenia style, it's like,

1040
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,500
okay, well I'll take care of it.

1041
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,340
It strikes me as almost hopeless.

1042
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,780
I feel hopeless about the future of games

1043
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,180
because it's very rare for a game like Bloodstained

1044
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,740
to be created and it seems far more common

1045
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,060
for things to just go away and never come back

1046
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,940
in my experience.

1047
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,100
And I don't know, I feel, again, love the game

1048
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,340
but it just made me think like, oh, I wish this happened more.

1049
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,300
I wish this seemed like a realistic hope for the future

1050
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,460
that there would be more.

1051
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,620
I mean, there've been a ton of Metroidvanias

1052
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,780
that have come out over the last couple years.

1053
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,420
Yeah, and what we were just saying,

1054
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,780
like the fact that they were constantly iterated upon

1055
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,100
sort of eventually made people get tired of the genre.

1056
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Well, true.

1057
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
How much iteration is too much iteration?

1058
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,620
I think how many more?

1059
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,460
Chidoration.

1060
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,180
I can only play like one video game

1061
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,060
before I'm just sick of the whole medium.

1062
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,540
And frankly, I'm not even specifically,

1063
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,020
like this goes to what we were discussing before.

1064
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,180
I'm not specifically talking about Metroidvanias.

1065
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,460
Like, Metroidvanias are like,

1066
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,740
Hollow Knight came out like two years ago,

1067
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,860
like best game I've played in years.

1068
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Would you say that Hollow Knight is more of,

1069
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,620
actually, no, I guess it is more of a Metroid-like

1070
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,820
than a Castlevania, isn't it?

1071
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,300
I mean, I definitely just put it in that.

1072
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,940
You level up by getting health upgrades

1073
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,300
and things like that, but you don't get like XP to spend.

1074
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,140
Unlike some people, I find the Metroidvania label

1075
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,140
to be very useful, and so I'm happy to apply it to both games.

1076
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,460
I know what you're talking about when you say it.

1077
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,300
Indeed.

1078
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,140
I know what you're talking about,

1079
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,380
but I do prefer the distinction

1080
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,060
between Castlevania and the Metroid,

1081
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,340
just because anything with XP feels a lot different.

1082
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,180
There is a distinction.

1083
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,020
Sure.

1084
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,020
I mean, absolutely.

1085
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,420
The ability to grind through an area

1086
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,180
to get more powerful is like a big gameplay difference.

1087
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,820
It is a big gameplay difference,

1088
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,060
and actually one of the things that I love about,

1089
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,580
like Aria of Sorrow Castlevania did the thing

1090
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,580
that I love most about, like, Igavenias,

1091
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,300
and Bloodstains of this, Order of Ecclesia did this.

1092
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,540
Portrait of Ruin, I think, did this.

1093
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
It's become, at least I think Portrait of Ruin did.

1094
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,620
It's become way more popular as time has gone on.

1095
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,780
Yeah, Portrait did do it.

1096
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,900
And it's the thing that even Symphony of the Night

1097
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,420
didn't do, and so I think this is an improvement.

1098
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,020
It's that every enemy in those games

1099
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,340
can give you the power of that enemy.

1100
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,860
So the game, it's not just like,

1101
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,900
where Symphony of the Night, you gotta get through the game,

1102
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,420
find the totems that have the relics or whatever

1103
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,700
that you need to access certain powers.

1104
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,820
I like better in the new game.

1105
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,940
The enemies feel like a real important part of the game

1106
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,820
because every single enemy drops a soul

1107
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,620
or a shard in this game or whatever,

1108
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,740
a sigil or something that gives you a specific power.

1109
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,980
And so it's like, oh wow, I can really connect

1110
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,020
and kind of even role play if I want to

1111
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,340
as a specific current magic user.

1112
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,540
I did like that in, I mean they did,

1113
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,940
was it Aria of Sorrow they did that in?

1114
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,780
Yeah, Aria of Sorrow.

1115
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,580
That was pretty cool.

1116
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,740
A lot of the abilities were bad.

1117
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,140
A ton of them were shit.

1118
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,100
A lot of them were just reskins of other ones.

1119
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,180
But still, the fact that it sort of turned it

1120
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,780
into a collectathon, you gotta catch them all.

1121
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,900
Yeah, I mean the great thing about a system like that

1122
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,300
is that it kind of gives the grinding a higher purpose

1123
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,260
because you're doing a lot of backtracking in these games.

1124
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,740
It's actually, I just re-released a video

1125
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,700
in Ion Games talking about this in relation to Metroid

1126
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,580
because this is something that Metroid totally misses

1127
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,260
is that when you're going back and forth in Metroid,

1128
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,420
the enemies are just impediments.

1129
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,460
They don't give you anything.

1130
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,860
So when you're doing your backtracking in those games,

1131
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,300
you're just like, oh, I gotta get past those cracks.

1132
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,260
What is your incentive to kill any enemy in Metroid?

1133
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,260
There's literally none.

1134
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,340
Exactly, and in Castlevania there's always new abilities

1135
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,780
and all these enemies that potentially give you something.

1136
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,940
Even above, just the fact of killing them to get experience,

1137
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,700
which can cap out and to get their soul

1138
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,660
just so you have the power,

1139
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,860
there's I think a very important system

1140
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,020
of you can level up the souls.

1141
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,180
If you get more souls from a certain enemy, it powers it up.

1142
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,340
So you feel like every enemy you kill

1143
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,140
has real weight to it

1144
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,060
and is actually improving your character.

1145
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,620
And I gotta say, to me,

1146
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,700
that's one of the best things you can do.

1147
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,180
That's like, even if the game goes.

1148
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,020
I don't know.

1149
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,060
Just like Pokemon Go.

1150
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,780
I mean, kind of like that.

1151
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,620
Hollow Knight, for example, doesn't have EXP,

1152
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,060
but it does have money, and money is very important.

1153
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,300
But later in the game, you can run out of money,

1154
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
or you can buy everything you need to buy,

1155
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,380
and then you hit that wall

1156
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,140
of there's nothing to grind for anymore.

1157
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,380
But a game like this, I'm not saying it's perfect,

1158
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,740
I could understand why people like other systems differently,

1159
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,260
but that is a relatively unique benefit

1160
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,740
of having this system in place.

1161
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,740
I've got so many weedles,

1162
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,980
I don't know, I can't even count them at this point,

1163
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,020
but every single time I do, I get candy,

1164
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,380
and then I can transfer them,

1165
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,460
and then I can upgrade my weedles and the cocooners,

1166
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,380
then I can upgrade my cocooners and the B-drills.

1167
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,100
I get that sweet, sweet EXP every single time.

1168
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,740
I wanna catch every Pokemon.

1169
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,180
I do see the appeal of killing enemies in your way,

1170
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:09,180
being beneficial in some small way with EXP or something.

1171
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,900
But there's something.

1172
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,620
There's something maybe specifically

1173
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,300
about the Metroid games that I enjoy,

1174
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,740
that the platforming and the ice beam

1175
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,020
and the speed at which you can dodge past enemies

1176
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,580
or the powers that allow you to just jump

1177
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,780
and screw attack, kill enemies,

1178
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,700
just sort of makes the obstacles less of a,

1179
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,060
it's more fun.

1180
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,580
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's more fun,

1181
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,540
but I definitely prefer the feeling of progression

1182
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,260
through being able to easily and nonchalantly

1183
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,540
smash or dodge or run past enemies

1184
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,380
that were once big annoyances.

1185
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,980
Well, there's definitely a lot of mobility upgrades you get

1186
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,380
in most Castlevania II, which is to this point,

1187
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,260
which I very much enjoy.

1188
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,940
Let me just give you one highlight,

1189
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,780
which actually, you could do something like this

1190
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,740
exactly in a Metroid or a Hollow Knight,

1191
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,340
and there are moments like it, but it's what I love.

1192
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,740
It's that you can get to the end of the game in Bloodstain.

1193
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,100
I guess this is minor spoilers, but nothing major,

1194
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,140
just a small little fun thing I liked,

1195
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,540
part of the progression.

1196
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,820
It's that early in the game,

1197
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,580
there's just a big blood fountain,

1198
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,180
and it just seems like a set piece,

1199
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,140
and it's like, oh, wow, this is, you know,

1200
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,580
ooh, spooky, you know, Vampire Castle or whatever,

1201
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,980
big blood fountain.

1202
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,500
And if you look on the map,

1203
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,460
you can see that there's actually a hole at the bottom,

1204
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,180
but you can't get through that hole,

1205
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,860
and it's like, hmm, I wonder what that's about.

1206
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,500
That definitely is gonna be something later.

1207
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,780
It's a symbolism for my incel lifestyle.

1208
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,340
Exactly.

1209
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,180
Damn.

1210
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,220
So later in the game, later in the game,

1211
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,180
you gotta find new ways to progress to explore.

1212
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,940
A hole covered in blood, think about it.

1213
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,780
Makes sense.

1214
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,620
Makes sense.

1215
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,460
Throw up.

1216
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,220
There's a vampire, there's a vampire lady,

1217
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,740
and it's specifically said that like, hey,

1218
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,100
you know, there's a vampire who can like,

1219
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,220
absorb blood without even sucking on you,

1220
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,580
without even touching you, she can suck your blood.

1221
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,580
How does that work?

1222
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,060
So you go hunter down, and you kill her,

1223
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,580
and you get her soul or her shard or whatever,

1224
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,020
and it lets you like, absorb blood from enemies.

1225
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,540
So now, if you ever up against an enemy,

1226
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,100
you use this spell or whatever,

1227
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,500
and it just, boom, it sucks blood from them,

1228
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,140
you get healed, they take some damage.

1229
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,060
If they have blood, it doesn't work on like, skeletons.

1230
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,540
So that's already pretty cool.

1231
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,420
But if you go to this one fucking place,

1232
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,180
the big blood pool, and you use the spell,

1233
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,980
boom, you use the thing, and it's like a little thing,

1234
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,940
you absorb all the blood, and there, it's empty,

1235
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,700
and you got a place you can advance now,

1236
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,140
progress the game, it's awesome.

1237
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,580
You know what I like about that?

1238
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,420
Yeah.

1239
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,620
Is that probably means that in the game, right,

1240
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,220
in like the game's enemy data,

1241
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,980
there is probably a tag that someone had to go through

1242
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,260
in every monster entry and manually edit

1243
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,540
to specify has blood, does not have blood.

1244
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,420
That's a super specific ability,

1245
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,460
like whether or not you can drain blood from them.

1246
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,340
So yeah, every enemy probably has that switch toggled.

1247
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,980
And it should, like, I basically 100% of the game

1248
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,300
in terms of exploration.

1249
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,860
I haven't done every little thing.

1250
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,020
Oh, you know what?

1251
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,220
I'll just say while we're talking about blood,

1252
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,060
so we can move on.

1253
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,480
But like, the moment I had, after I beat the game,

1254
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,660
beat the true final boss, and I just came back,

1255
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,420
because in the end credits, I noticed that I see,

1256
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,140
there's a little image of Miriam sitting at a piano

1257
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,860
with a little familiar that you get throughout the game.

1258
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,700
It's this little like pink pixie thing,

1259
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,860
Cognazzo or something,

1260
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,180
which I think means like song or something.

1261
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,940
And she's sitting at a piano playing it,

1262
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,860
and I'm like, I remember that piano.

1263
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,460
I never did anything with that piano.

1264
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,620
I tried to play it, but she didn't,

1265
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,180
I'm gonna go back and do that.

1266
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,500
So I go, I equip the little pixie fairy.

1267
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,460
I equip, or I, you know, I get fucking Miriam.

1268
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,380
I go to the piano, I sit down,

1269
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,340
and not only does Miriam start to play the piano,

1270
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,420
but the little pixie fairy starts to sing along

1271
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,820
in a live-action English voice,

1272
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,660
sing like a song to the main theme of Bloodstained,

1273
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,660
which is, that's just classic Igorvania

1274
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,500
putting that stuff in.

1275
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,860
And by the way, I tested it.

1276
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,220
If you sit there and you play without the fairy equipped,

1277
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,380
she still plays the piano medley,

1278
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,540
but there's no voice saying along.

1279
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,020
But then if you equip the fairy,

1280
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,460
then it does sing along, and you get the full,

1281
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,820
I was, that was the moment when I,

1282
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,260
I reflected at this moment of like,

1283
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,580
even figuring out the difference between

1284
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,260
having the fairy and not having it,

1285
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,940
I reflected on like, wow, this game was awesome.

1286
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,380
And I had such a great time playing it.

1287
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,220
I love these details.

1288
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,700
I sat back in my chair and I said,

1289
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,700
maybe video games can be art after all.

1290
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,260
Exactly, exactly.

1291
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,180
I was, I felt lots of gratitude,

1292
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,180
and it was a great, it was a great game.

1293
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,620
Highly recommend it, highly recommend it.

1294
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,300
Ben, something you just said remind me

1295
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,980
of something in my own life when you were saying

1296
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,020
that you had to tag every single enemy

1297
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,540
if it has blood or doesn't have blood.

1298
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,100
That reminds me of something that you may relate to.

1299
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,540
I was doing my favorite activity just earlier today,

1300
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,060
and that's duplicating code unnecessarily

1301
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:45,380
and cluttering up a mini Python file.

1302
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,220
Excellent.

1303
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,020
That's my favorite, yeah.

1304
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,060
So I had joy, much like, you know,

1305
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,340
tagging if blood, do this.

1306
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:57,340
I was tagging if dismembered limb of slime zodia,

1307
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,340
then add to this unwrap trading card pack function.

1308
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,860
Is that true?

1309
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,700
Yes.

1310
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,540
How much of this is made, okay.

1311
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,380
No, Ben.

1312
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,300
Wait, are we getting, are we getting sea creatures?

1313
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,100
Indeed we are, Ben.

1314
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,260
So it's not a-

1315
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,580
No!

1316
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,420
Oh, no.

1317
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,300
And by no I mean, yes.

1318
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,020
So it's not a playable game,

1319
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,060
but the trading cards are there,

1320
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,660
and you'll be able to assemble slime zodia

1321
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,940
and smelt it together for some disastrous results.

1322
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,620
What happens then, I wanna know.

1323
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,260
Well, I'll have you know that even if you are a goon

1324
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,980
of GitHub sorts, you will not be able to understand

1325
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,540
or to read the flavor text I have written

1326
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,980
for the Forbidden 111, or the Forbidden Stuffed Cross

1327
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,980
that you can, that you can smelt

1328
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,700
by smelting together 128 double stuffed crust pizzas.

1329
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,420
You will not be able to read it,

1330
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,900
because I put it in a specific off,

1331
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,500
like an off GitHub Python file

1332
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,420
that I've given exclusively to Magic,

1333
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,780
so you will have to literally get it in game

1334
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,460
in order to understand and to read the flavor text.

1335
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,420
Or else you will not be able to read it, yeah.

1336
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,940
So okay, this is an announcement.

1337
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,420
Click on the link in the description.

1338
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,900
Do it, do it now.

1339
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,740
Do it now.

1340
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,500
Yeah, is it on slimecorp.net?

1341
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,020
No, listen, they don't own the scan.

1342
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,420
They don't own everything that happens in it.

1343
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,260
This is not, they don't own the city.

1344
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,220
Well, I'll have to send them a memo and we can fix that.

1345
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,340
Yeah, Ben, listen, come back, please, God, come back.

1346
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,340
I was, you know, I've been, you know,

1347
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,220
I churned out the last Vapors 3

1348
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,100
and I've been working on like commissions and stuff.

1349
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,260
I think, I gotta like draw a cover for Vapors 2

1350
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,540
before the kickstart and stuff.

1351
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,220
Oh, maybe after that I'll like take a step back

1352
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,300
and just go back to coding for a while.

1353
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,300
That sounds like it could be a kind of change of pace

1354
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,140
that I need.

1355
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,980
Code, you just gotta put in some FaceTime, you know?

1356
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,060
Wait a minute, I've got a controversial subject

1357
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,860
to bring up regarding this.

1358
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,940
And it's, Ben, I was just thinking about this.

1359
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,580
And I was just wondering what the hell took so long

1360
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,060
to get a new chapter out.

1361
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,620
I was trying to crunch the numbers

1362
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,780
to see when the last chapter had come out.

1363
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,780
And interestingly, this is a big call out

1364
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,740
that I'm about to do.

1365
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,060
I couldn't help but go to your Patreon,

1366
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,020
which I noticed your Patreon exists specifically

1367
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,500
to finance creation of these comics.

1368
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,340
So I was thinking like.

1369
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,340
That is the stated, that is the stated goal.

1370
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,940
And I, now I do not back you or anyone on Patreon

1371
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,700
or anywhere else because I'm a hero.

1372
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,780
However, Michelle does, and I was encouraging Michelle

1373
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,060
and all her cohorts to grill you and to force you

1374
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,900
into submission, to produce faster content.

1375
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,820
Do you know how long it's been

1376
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,980
since like the last chapter, whatever came out?

1377
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,180
Yeah, don't, yeah.

1378
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,300
You think I haven't thought about this?

1379
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,620
I was saying, I'm sure you have.

1380
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,340
I'm sure you think about more than anybody else,

1381
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,540
but nonetheless.

1382
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:10,540
It was like, well, you're talking about since Vapors 2?

1383
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,580
I was thinking like since your last, you know,

1384
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,220
big comic release, which I guess would be,

1385
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,220
no, wasn't it the champion was the most recent one?

1386
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,060
There was, well, there was, okay, there was the champion

1387
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,660
and then there was Beast Capades

1388
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,060
and then there was Endless War.

1389
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,900
So those are some things.

1390
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,020
Nobody loves Beast Capades more than me.

1391
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,340
Oh, I forgot about Endless War, that's true.

1392
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,900
Yeah, those are things that happen in the interim.

1393
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,140
Yeah, I know when you crunch the numbers,

1394
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,100
it comes out to like less than a page a week,

1395
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,060
which is bad.

1396
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,860
But, you know, remember that Vapors 3

1397
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,860
is not the only thing that was going on in that period.

1398
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,860
That's true, that's true.

1399
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,220
Although if I was your patron,

1400
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,020
I would, you know, up the pledge insanely, Ben,

1401
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,860
because I just loved Vapors 3.

1402
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,940
I thought I wasn't gonna go there.

1403
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,420
Okay, but I mean, I talked about this the other day

1404
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,860
or two weeks ago when I said like, you know,

1405
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,620
I had been working on Endless War a lot

1406
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,340
and then I had realized like I'm pretty sure

1407
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,860
that like my patron, I mean, technically,

1408
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:17,140
if you patron me, you support anything that I do.

1409
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,860
Is that what's stated there though?

1410
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,740
It, yeah, what's explicitly stated

1411
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,700
is that it's about, it's that it's for comics.

1412
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,660
And eventually I was like, you know,

1413
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,020
I'm pretty sure most of my patrons

1414
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,940
are patrons for the comics.

1415
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,260
This is why I'm like, I need to get a comic out.

1416
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,780
I need to get the next comic out.

1417
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,180
The reason this is on my mind

1418
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,740
is because I just did an update of my Patreon

1419
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,380
and I was like, I wanna make,

1420
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,540
I mean, to me it's, I wanna be super clear

1421
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,500
exactly what I owe these people,

1422
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,440
specifically so that no one can bother me if I'm, you know,

1423
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,640
as long as I'm abiding by the agreement,

1424
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,600
I want there to be no room for anyone

1425
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,700
to get on my case about anything.

1426
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,560
But I mean, as a non-pagent of yours,

1427
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,920
I am just here selfishly demanding

1428
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,560
that you produce things faster for me

1429
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,540
because they're good and they're my favorite thing you do.

1430
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,540
And I want Biscopades now, Ben, now.

1431
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,200
Soon.

1432
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,280
Okay, good.

1433
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,120
Excellent.

1434
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,200
There you go.

1435
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,280
Fantastic.

1436
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,120
Yeah.

1437
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,000
Okay, that's it.

1438
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,840
All right.

1439
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,680
Okay.

1440
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,520
Did my due diligence.

1441
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,840
To go back to video games.

1442
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,680
Of course.

1443
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,480
There was an article that I stumbled upon on Twitter

1444
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,960
that blew my mind to shit a few days ago.

1445
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,000
So you guys know about Eve online.

1446
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,840
You ever heard about Eve online?

1447
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,880
Yeah, I know that.

1448
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,120
That's like people are very, very heavily involved

1449
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,400
to the point of having whole societies within the game.

1450
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,080
It's like literally another world.

1451
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,160
So there was an article from PC Gamer.

1452
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,000
Oh, shut up.

1453
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,520
Mr. Beetong, Mr. Beetong did a video.

1454
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,280
Was it specifically about Eve online

1455
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,960
or was it about emergent gameplay?

1456
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,280
Or was it the one about Shandification?

1457
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,880
There's one of his videos.

1458
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,800
It might be the Shandification one.

1459
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,640
Go check that out.

1460
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,480
I don't know.

1461
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,920
There's one where he talks about emergent gameplay

1462
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,920
and he talks about Eve online and the war between,

1463
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,200
oh fuck, there were the band of brothers

1464
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,480
and some of the band of sisters.

1465
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,600
Two like player driven factions that were like

1466
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,880
not actually part of the game at all.

1467
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,760
It was like purely a user driven faction system

1468
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,760
that emerged and like a war rage

1469
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,440
between these two factions for years and it was sick.

1470
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,280
It's fascinating.

1471
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,280
It's okay, but I found this article on PC Gamer

1472
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,760
talking about something that happened

1473
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,080
a couple days ago in Eve online.

1474
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,440
And it doesn't read like an article about a video game.

1475
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,840
It reads like a wiki article

1476
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,400
on like an actual like piece of fiction,

1477
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,680
but they're talking about like real people.

1478
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,640
It's fucking insane.

1479
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,360
So I'm gonna link the article right now,

1480
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,320
but I will attempt to summarize it.

1481
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,840
The idea here is that most games,

1482
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,840
like when they do a big content update,

1483
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,680
they like make a big deal out of it at E3

1484
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,920
and you wait like a year.

1485
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,120
Eve online just sicked an entire alien race

1486
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,680
on the entire galaxy with no warning at all.

1487
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,680
People just woke up and half their shit was destroyed

1488
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,760
and there was this huge guy.

1489
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,440
The board fucking invaded all at once.

1490
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,400
Yeah, three days ago.

1491
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,760
Yeah, that's basically the board.

1492
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,600
Three days ago.

1493
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,800
And there's the article goes in on how like

1494
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,440
there was a huge like a war going on

1495
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,640
between two faction, two player factions.

1496
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
They prematurely ended the war

1497
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,480
and teams started fighting the fucking invaders.

1498
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,440
Like basically all of their like systems they had programmed

1499
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,040
to like keep track of like their bases and things

1500
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,760
because like it's a huge fucking galaxy.

1501
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,120
None of it was even like coded with the understanding

1502
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,200
that NPCs could trigger things like this.

1503
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,160
So none of the like preparations

1504
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,080
for keeping their shit safe was prepared

1505
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,880
for this NPC invasion.

1506
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,160
And like the entire like population

1507
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,440
is in turmoil right now.

1508
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,800
And it's fucking fascinating to think

1509
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,600
that something like this is like real and happening.

1510
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,640
It's like the most like interesting article

1511
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,240
to read through this like these people

1512
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,840
are like this guy's like a diplomat

1513
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,120
for this player faction, the test alliance

1514
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,320
and like the Imperium.

1515
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,800
And there's these huge big things

1516
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,440
and like they have to like completely change

1517
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,000
how they're playing this game

1518
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,160
because there's this huge new third party

1519
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,360
that was not accounted for by anyone.

1520
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,600
Like an AI party.

1521
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,440
Yeah.

1522
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,880
And it's just like, and like again,

1523
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,480
like Eve online had the like the balls of like

1524
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,960
no one is gonna know this is gonna happen

1525
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,800
until it's too late.

1526
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,800
We're not gonna hype it up or anything.

1527
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,040
It's just dropping.

1528
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,200
Not to be.

1529
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,360
Just like an alien invasion would do.

1530
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,200
They wouldn't announce it.

1531
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,040
Exactly.

1532
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,960
Yo, let me just not to be overly like,

1533
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,440
not to have overly high expectations

1534
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,360
for something like this,

1535
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,760
but this is in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.

1536
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,320
The main premise of like,

1537
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,800
I think episode one of Deep Space Nine,

1538
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,520
Commander Sisko takes over and a wormhole opens.

1539
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,120
And it's all like a spiritual thing.

1540
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,680
There's some religious stuff going on.

1541
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,120
But more importantly to me is that this wormhole

1542
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,000
has incredible gigantic tactical implications

1543
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,960
because it opens directly

1544
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,200
to the heart of the Delta Quadrant.

1545
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,680
So everything in Star Trek takes place

1546
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,800
in the Alpha Quadrant.

1547
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,920
This is the Delta Quadrant

1548
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,040
that had never been explored by anyone

1549
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,080
in the Alpha Quadrant at this point, I think.

1550
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,200
And like the fucking, like what this does,

1551
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,200
it opens directly onto a gigantic like opposing force.

1552
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,160
What's it called?

1553
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,120
Not the Federation, something, something else.

1554
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,560
I'll look it up and those guys were like,

1555
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,280
like it just now there's a direct hold

1556
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,120
that leads from like the center

1557
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,600
of this enemy races territory.

1558
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,840
Or it's like, it's more than one race,

1559
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,160
like an entire, they control the entire Quadrant

1560
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,000
versus the Alpha Quadrant.

1561
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,280
And like, okay, what I was gonna ask is,

1562
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,440
so in that it's Star Trek obviously.

1563
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,840
So like battle tactics are relevant,

1564
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,920
but mostly it's about diplomacy

1565
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,200
and there's some assassination stuff that's attempted

1566
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,240
because like every organization has leaders

1567
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,960
and people you could theoretically try to take out.

1568
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,440
I'm wondering, is there any like ability

1569
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,000
to do stuff on that level

1570
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
or is it purely like NPCs we need to kill

1571
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,520
and get their HP to zero?

1572
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,640
I don't, it doesn't really specify.

1573
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,440
Cause like this is all happening in real time.

1574
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,800
This reads like a news report.

1575
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,520
Is there any chance we could negotiate?

1576
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,080
What if we could form an alliance with them?

1577
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,920
God damn it.

1578
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,080
Like listen to this, it says,

1579
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,700
as it says like as tasks scrambled

1580
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,640
to muster pilots into action, reports quickly spread

1581
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,100
that attacks like this were not just happening to them,

1582
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,280
but elsewhere throughout the NullSec reasons of new Eden.

1583
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,360
Chinese Alliance fraternity had to,

1584
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,000
had at least one of their own star bases sieged

1585
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,960
while the Imperium had to prematurely end a war campaign

1586
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,160
against the rival empire.

1587
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,440
So it could quickly retreat home

1588
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,480
and mount a defensive its own stations.

1589
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,320
Meanwhile, pandemic court had a special structure

1590
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,520
they built known as a jump bridge outright destroyed.

1591
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,720
More and more reports are coming in by the hour

1592
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,880
leading to an unprecedented ceasefire

1593
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,320
between all of Yvonne line's warring factions

1594
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,040
as they focus on defense.

1595
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,640
All warring factions, incredible.

1596
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,080
That fucking um, um,

1597
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,920
Vite,

1598
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,760
Vite was right.

1599
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,480
The Watchmen, yeah, exactly the same thing.

1600
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,320
The only thing that can unite us.

1601
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,400
Azimandius was right all along.

1602
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,240
He was right.

1603
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,480
It's just, I mean, I know like the moment to moment

1604
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,160
gameplay in Yv is not anything to write home about.

1605
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,560
You know, it's very kind of like,

1606
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,680
like super hardcore nerdy,

1607
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,080
but like just, just the meta of it

1608
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,920
is just so fucking sick.

1609
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,600
And it makes me wish I was like 10 times more gay

1610
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,760
so I could get into this game and enjoy it.

1611
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,440
Yeah, I wish I had been there.

1612
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,160
I wish I'd been like a long time player

1613
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,040
just doing my fucking, you know,

1614
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:26,880
running my freighter.

1615
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,120
Oh, you know, I'm just, you know,

1616
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,600
I run freight from the Imperium to the other guys.

1617
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,440
I'm neutral.

1618
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,040
So, you know, and then all of a sudden on the horizon,

1619
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,280
all these alien ships suddenly appear

1620
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,440
in an unprecedented invasion

1621
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,720
from a fucking other quadrant or whatever.

1622
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,120
And everyone scrambles and is forced to fucking,

1623
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,120
oh my God, that's incredible.

1624
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,960
That's so cool dude.

1625
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,800
A fucking cooler shit.

1626
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,760
A fucking lecture, a lecture on Yvonne line stories

1627
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,080
would be the best thing.

1628
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,960
Yv totally deserves a lecture.

1629
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,440
It's one of the most fascinating gaming worlds out there.

1630
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,800
Anyone know how old Eva's?

1631
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,320
Is it like 30 years old or something?

1632
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,160
It's not 30, I don't think it's that old.

1633
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,600
It's probably at least 20.

1634
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,560
It's gotta be pushing that.

1635
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:06,560
I mean, I, the first time I played Yvon line

1636
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,960
cause I tried it out was in like 2006.

1637
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,960
Okay, it was released 2003.

1638
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,640
So it is 16 years old now, it looks like.

1639
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,480
Yeah.

1640
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,320
Fascinating.

1641
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,160
Sounds about right.

1642
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,120
Plays from the star system and tests this whole region.

1643
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,560
Every fucking dude who played Yvon line

1644
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,160
just had their 16 year subscription justified.

1645
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,600
They are now part of the glorious human campaign

1646
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,040
to fight off this evil entity that needs to be destroyed

1647
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,880
and prevented from assimilating us into their collective.

1648
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,720
It's so cool.

1649
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,560
So cool.

1650
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,400
If I were.

1651
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,240
Imagine, wait, imagine you rush home.

1652
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,680
Mom, mom, I can't go to school today.

1653
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,720
The Imperium is being attacked by the fucking the others.

1654
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,800
I can't go to school.

1655
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,320
I can't pause the game mom.

1656
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,440
There's no pausing in Yvon line.

1657
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,800
For that to be true, you would have had to start playing

1658
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,640
when you were one year old or else you'd be early then.

1659
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,480
They started early then.

1660
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,320
They started early.

1661
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,160
You'd be over 18, okay.

1662
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,360
No, I'm a man child.

1663
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,880
My mom still makes me go to, you know,

1664
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,080
cram school or something.

1665
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:04,920
Prep school for it.

1666
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,760
It's still going to cram school.

1667
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,600
Yeah, that's right.

1668
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,720
It's games like Yvon line.

1669
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,760
No, this is normal school, but this is dating college

1670
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,120
begun by the legendary Chris Chan, who you know.

1671
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,040
One day I'll learn.

1672
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Games like Yvon line and like 2P2T are so enchanting to me

1673
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,280
because of the like the real,

1674
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,920
like you can't describe another way than history

1675
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,080
between players in these virtual spaces.

1676
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:29,920
Exactly.

1677
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,720
The platonic ideal of a multiplayer game

1678
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,880
is one where the gameplay feeds into the community

1679
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,440
and the role playing, which is being, you know, conducted.

1680
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,600
And that's sort of one of the pillars in those wars.

1681
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,520
Just that's for that.

1682
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,800
The gameplay is merely a subject of the role play

1683
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,560
that's being happening and indeed online.

1684
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,560
It just seems to be like a masterful execution of that.

1685
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,760
Listen to this.

1686
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,720
At the time of publishing this story, CCP games,

1687
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,400
the company who made Eve hasn't even acknowledged

1688
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,280
that half of Yvon line is actively on fire.

1689
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,080
That initially led many to believe

1690
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,920
that this was all some kind of horrific accident or bug,

1691
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,000
but now the consensus is that this invasion was planned.

1692
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,560
After all, Eve's online card expansion is called invasion.

1693
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,960
I reached out to CCP games personally

1694
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,560
and the spokesperson said to me,

1695
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,840
they reached out to the drifters for comment,

1696
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,680
but they rejected our hailing frequency.

1697
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,760
The drifters.

1698
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,840
You motherfucking role play pieces of shit.

1699
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,680
God damn it.

1700
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,680
Give us some answers.

1701
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,680
If I were the devs, the what I would do or if I were the devs,

1702
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,920
I would make the alien invasion like basically an AI invasion,

1703
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,920
like a robot like swarm or something so that, you know,

1704
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,080
they could behave like completely deterministically

1705
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,800
and basically just be a fucking computer program,

1706
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,880
which they are.

1707
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,720
Yeah.

1708
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,560
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1709
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,840
And that, you know, to decrease that dreaded cognitive dissonance.

1710
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,840
No, what's the word?

1711
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,680
Neo.

1712
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,520
Neo.

1713
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,360
Ludo narrative dissonance?

1714
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,840
Ludo narrative dissonance.

1715
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,640
That dreaded Ludo narrative dissonance.

1716
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,200
That's my opinion about that.

1717
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,040
By the way, the name of the bad guys from Deep Space Nine

1718
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,080
is the Dominion.

1719
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,400
The Dominion runs the Gamma Quadrant.

1720
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,240
Oh, shit.

1721
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,080
I said the Delta Quadrant.

1722
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:20,920
Did I fuck?

1723
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,240
It's the Gamma Quadrant.

1724
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,640
Oh, I look like a fucking idiot, man.

1725
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,840
God damn it.

1726
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,680
I'm so sorry.

1727
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,080
It's in Star Trek Voyager.

1728
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,320
They're in the Quadrant, the Delta.

1729
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,680
You're gonna have to take a Star Trek of a short pier.

1730
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,720
Role playing is simply the highest form of art.

1731
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,720
Guys, don't buy in a munchies pro role play propaganda.

1732
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,800
I love these role play.

1733
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,880
Trying to lead you down a dark path.

1734
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,680
Now, role playing is like, you're an artist,

1735
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,440
you're making a character,

1736
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,680
but you are just pretending to be that character.

1737
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,800
Like, all art is role playing.

1738
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,880
You're making the shit up.

1739
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,800
God, strike me down if I ever even consider

1740
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,640
the possibility of being any person

1741
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,080
other than what I am.

1742
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,560
As much as you may wish for that not to be the case.

1743
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,400
But what are you then?

1744
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,240
Unfortunately it is.

1745
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:17,560
So I hate to harp on about it more than is necessary.

1746
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,840
However, it's relevant to the conversation of role playing.

1747
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,360
When I was writing things for Endless War,

1748
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,280
for characters that I had to act out as though I were them

1749
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,600
in multiple different Discord accounts,

1750
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,960
logging in and out literally probably hundreds of times

1751
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,320
in the course of a really long text conversation

1752
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,800
that I had fabricated between two Discord users

1753
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,520
don't actually exist.

1754
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,840
It was really like, you know, the advice is to, you know,

1755
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,360
just sort of like get into your character's head

1756
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,920
and you know, write from their perspective

1757
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,280
and you know, just really understand what's like to be them.

1758
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,240
But like the actual like physical act of logging in and out

1759
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,600
is like insanely helpful just to like

1760
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,720
to really ram that into your fucking skull.

1761
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,680
But like, yeah, you know what?

1762
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,040
You really are this person, you know why?

1763
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,320
Because you're in a Discord account,

1764
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,680
look down at the bottom left,

1765
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,320
like that's the avatar of the character that you're role playing.

1766
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,160
Like it's a really like acting it out

1767
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,400
in a like a literal role play scenario.

1768
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,840
Like I felt like genuinely helped me write four things,

1769
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,520
like write the dialogue.

1770
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,760
It just felt like it was more, like I actually,

1771
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,760
I believe for a moment that I was indeed in two.

1772
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,240
I believe in multiple occasions.

1773
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,200
Yeah, dog.

1774
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,880
Hell yeah, dude, hell yeah.

1775
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,800
Hey, by the way, we just briefly in there

1776
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,320
mentioned 2B2T, I just want to give a shout out to our boy

1777
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,520
fitMC who is blowing up these days

1778
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,440
with his fucking Minecraft videos.

1779
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,880
Is that like 350,000 subs now?

1780
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,240
He's always been big dude.

1781
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,360
When we last talked to him, he was at like 200,000.

1782
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,520
He's like doubled since we last talked to him.

1783
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,360
That's pretty good.

1784
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,880
Well, of course, much congratulations.

1785
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,400
Kind of thought Minecraft was on the decline.

1786
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,440
Not while this boy's on the case.

1787
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,280
It's kind of like on a sort of research.

1788
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,880
Minecraft, I don't know if Minecraft could ever really

1789
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,040
be considered on a decline.

1790
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,000
Like even if it is literally going down, it's always.

1791
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,840
It's acceleration.

1792
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,680
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

1793
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,000
Was not, was like less fast than before or something.

1794
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,400
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I've had to.

1795
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,640
It's acceleration had to slow down because like it just,

1796
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,360
it's saturated the population.

1797
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,800
There was like no more, there was like less, you know,

1798
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,200
new territory to expand into.

1799
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,040
Yeah.

1800
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,240
I guess that was inevitable as you do.

1801
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,680
Yeah.

1802
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,240
Well, good job to fit.

1803
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,080
Yep.

1804
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,760
I have been like on Twitter.

1805
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,760
I saw FitMC was like doing like a 2B2T.

1806
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,000
Like there was a war going on with Edyka.

1807
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,840
That's true.

1808
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,480
And his boys jumping into the server.

1809
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,080
And FitMC was backing him up and it was all cool.

1810
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,520
And then it was like, ooh, Edyka guys.

1811
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,760
Too bad about that, unfortunately.

1812
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,600
Yeah.

1813
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,720
I didn't.

1814
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,040
RIP.

1815
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,880
Yeah.

1816
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,720
I didn't know anything about Edyka really.

1817
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,600
I'd seen, I don't know, maybe a month or two ago.

1818
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,240
I saw people, you know, being, you know,

1819
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,960
concerned about him and like I saw a bunch of tweets

1820
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,920
from his that seemed to suggest a person

1821
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,440
who was maybe not stable.

1822
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,520
His behavior was erratic for sure.

1823
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,560
Yeah, yeah.

1824
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,400
This was clear.

1825
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,400
All I know him from is like the things one YouTube poops

1826
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,400
where he would like chop up his reactions to things.

1827
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,800
And he seemed like a pretty happy, funny, cool guy.

1828
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,000
So like, I don't know what was going on with him.

1829
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,760
I did hear a couple of times that he was like depressed

1830
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,600
or he'd said things,

1831
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,440
but I never really followed his content.

1832
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,240
The term bipolar has been thrown around.

1833
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,280
I don't know if that's true,

1834
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,760
but it certainly seems to fit the profile.

1835
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,160
He seemed like, I don't know, from his tweets,

1836
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,880
it almost seemed like he was like,

1837
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,800
I don't know, maybe even schizophrenic or something.

1838
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,120
Like he just seemed like, you know,

1839
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,120
really kind of detached at times.

1840
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:12,080
He talked about being a God and it's hard to tell

1841
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,640
exactly how much sincerity.

1842
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,000
I mean, how, I don't, obviously you can't diagnose

1843
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,320
this from tweets, but you know.

1844
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,080
But they're just to be clear.

1845
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,600
I have nothing, but I mean,

1846
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,240
there were times in the past where like he went missing

1847
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,880
and then a bunch of YouTubers made videos

1848
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,780
being like, dude, Etika is missing.

1849
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,900
Like is this a hoax?

1850
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:29,740
Who knows?

1851
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,580
Like what's going on?

1852
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,860
Is this some kind of prank or ARG or something?

1853
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,820
You know, on the subject,

1854
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,100
this is my more controversial opinion here, I suppose.

1855
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,020
It's that one, I really, I legitimately liked Etika.

1856
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,980
I'm really sad about what happened to him.

1857
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,540
Felt pretty emotional about it at a time.

1858
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,020
So that's horrible.

1859
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,220
I've said this before, but like he just subbed to me

1860
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,580
and I was like, oh, that's pretty cool.

1861
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,420
He seems like-

1862
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,540
Wait, Etika subbed you?

1863
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,660
Yeah, with his remaining channel.

1864
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,780
He had subbed to my main channel.

1865
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,860
Maybe for my smash videos, I don't know,

1866
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,260
but I thought that was really cool.

1867
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,420
That is cool.

1868
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:05,340
Well, yeah, obviously, he was in the midst of an episode

1869
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,180
when he did that, or else he must have been.

1870
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:12,340
But I've heard on the subject of this,

1871
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,740
I've heard a lot of people saying that like,

1872
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:18,100
it was fucked up what the internet did

1873
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,420
of like joking about Etika's mental state,

1874
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:25,500
or like being overly just calling him like a faker,

1875
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,420
like Keemstar, I think people were saying that he called,

1876
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,500
he did call him a faker, as I understand it.

1877
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,300
And like just doing it for attention or publicity stunt.

1878
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,540
But so that's all, you know,

1879
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,940
question of like varying degrees of like questionable

1880
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,500
or possibly moral things to do, I guess.

1881
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,980
But I think we're missing the point

1882
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,580
if we're gonna say that like the problem here

1883
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,700
was that this internet creator

1884
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,100
was getting too much negative feedback from the internet.

1885
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,860
And they weren't like, the internet is in no position

1886
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,980
to know how serious or fucked up.

1887
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,900
Like, I agree, it seems serious with this guy.

1888
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,620
People probably should not like joke.

1889
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,660
I mean, he died, so in hindsight.

1890
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,380
Yeah, it was pretty fucking serious.

1891
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:09,420
But I mean, what responsibility does like the people,

1892
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,780
basically what I'm saying is,

1893
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,860
I don't think we should really take away from this

1894
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,580
that like people need to not joke

1895
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,460
or not take things seriously.

1896
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,460
You know, actually, maybe that would even be good.

1897
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,020
My real point is that there's no hope for that.

1898
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:25,180
That no one should, he needed like people in his life

1899
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,860
that helped him as opposed to trying to get.

1900
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:32,860
You can't blame the, I don't know, this is kind of,

1901
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,020
I guess this sort of relates to my argument

1902
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,500
about Meat Man a couple of weeks ago.

1903
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Like, you know, if you're mentally ill on the internet

1904
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,060
and you're acting in a way that is erratic and weird,

1905
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,300
like nobody on the other side of the keyboard

1906
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,740
knows what's going on with you.

1907
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,100
They're gonna react how they're gonna react

1908
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,740
and like you can't, you know, you can't be like,

1909
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,100
oh, well, the internet at large

1910
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,300
should have done this, this, and this.

1911
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,140
Like it's not something you can dictate or control.

1912
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,140
I feel like there's gonna be people like Philip DeFranco

1913
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,900
and others like him who will come out

1914
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:12,900
and do like a big moralizing like the internet failed Edeca.

1915
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,060
It was like their responsibility.

1916
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,820
I can already, I mean, he's probably already made that video.

1917
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,140
And I just think that that's not the solution, I don't think.

1918
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:21,980
That's not gonna fix anything.

1919
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,020
Yeah, you can only really be responsible for yourself.

1920
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:24,860
Exactly.

1921
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,140
Like I err on the side of caution with things like this.

1922
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:27,980
Yeah.

1923
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,940
I mean, if I was following him and I saw all this stuff,

1924
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,620
I would probably not joke about it

1925
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:37,620
because I mean, I can't like speak to how like clear it was,

1926
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,100
how he was feeling or how I would have interpreted

1927
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,720
what he was saying, but like to err on the side of caution

1928
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,200
is to like not like laugh at someone

1929
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,560
who's potentially joking about how they're depressed

1930
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,640
because it's more likely that they are actually depressed.

1931
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,000
We're in no position to know if they're joking or not though.

1932
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,640
I mean, I well, again, sometimes it's clear.

1933
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,320
I mean, it's harmless.

1934
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,640
It's harmless to act concerned when they are joking.

1935
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,480
Yeah.

1936
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,080
But it's harmful to act not concerned

1937
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,440
when they aren't joking.

1938
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,280
That's true.

1939
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,520
And to like Ben's point, like we said

1940
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,440
with our last discussion about this kind of stuff,

1941
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,240
like I totally agree that like the snowflake

1942
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,760
never blanes itself for the avalanche,

1943
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,440
which does strike me as like kind of what happened here.

1944
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,960
I just like, and this isn't to be callous or like unfeeling

1945
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,440
because I really, this affected me kind of a lot

1946
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,040
like more than I expected it to and made me very, very sad

1947
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,400
and other things that you have no position to trust me on

1948
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:42,400
but I'm going to say anyway that like it's just not helpful

1949
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,280
to frame things this way and yeah, like the probably this,

1950
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,760
this has to be something that some people are in a situation

1951
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,160
where being an internet creator,

1952
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,760
like it has these consequences right now,

1953
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,880
we cannot change that this is the sort of thing

1954
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,220
that people do when you know, people make jokes,

1955
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,600
people don't believe you, people talk shit.

1956
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,240
And like someone who's vulnerable to that,

1957
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,360
it's just inevitable.

1958
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,360
Like do we blame the ocean for drowning people who you know,

1959
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,120
like lose and again, this word blame

1960
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,200
of like moral accountability.

1961
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,800
I agree every individual kind of bears

1962
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,800
a little bit of responsibility on it.

1963
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,120
I agree with including me.

1964
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,600
I mean, I kind of chuckled before I had a joke about this

1965
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,240
just earlier this while I'm still sad about it.

1966
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:35,240
So I feel like, you know, when someone, someone like

1967
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,960
if you care about Erika and he's dead

1968
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,600
and you're really upset,

1969
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,480
you're gonna wanna blame something.

1970
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,820
You're gonna wanna like, you know, you're gonna be emotional.

1971
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:50,120
I think it's overall better that they just yell

1972
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,520
at the internet, quote unquote,

1973
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,800
rather than like specific people.

1974
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,120
Cause like, I don't know.

1975
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,680
And in the same way that like somebody might have

1976
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,160
like an episode and you know,

1977
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,160
they may not say what they mean or you know,

1978
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,680
mean what they say and you're like,

1979
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,160
if you can, if you can understand

1980
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,520
that they're having a thing and it's like,

1981
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,400
that's not too like the things they're saying

1982
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,240
are not actually what they think,

1983
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,480
then you can let it slide.

1984
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,600
And I feel like in the wake of something emotionally,

1985
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,520
you know, not traumatizing, but you know,

1986
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,120
it affects people, they'll react in certain ways.

1987
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:31,120
And I think getting mad at like a vague like sense

1988
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,400
of like, or like being moralizing.

1989
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,080
I don't think it's, it's like cynical.

1990
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,520
I don't think it's entirely like a devoid of emotional.

1991
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,680
I don't think it's necessarily cynical.

1992
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,560
I mean, I agree with you that anybody who feels any kind

1993
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,440
of way cause they like the guy, like that's fine.

1994
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,560
You're feeling those feelings I can't argue with,

1995
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,240
but it's the people who didn't really know Attica

1996
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,480
and now are like making a case that like it's the internet.

1997
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,800
That's what I got annoyed.

1998
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,840
I wouldn't know who said, who didn't know him

1999
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,920
or didn't know his situation unless they said so.

2000
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,040
I mean, there's that one guy who made,

2001
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,120
you know what, I won't get into it.

2002
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,840
Like I saw H3 roasting a guy who would like,

2003
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,520
he didn't actually do this, but he made a video titled

2004
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,000
like Attica Ouija board ghost like conversing.

2005
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,760
And this is like two days.

2006
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,700
Now he didn't actually do that,

2007
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,840
but he had titled the video that way.

2008
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,160
So it was cut and he had made a video a couple of days before

2009
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,200
where I believe he called out Attica for faking or something

2010
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,760
and said that he wasn't really dead.

2011
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,440
Now I don't, you shouldn't muddle those two things

2012
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,280
because no one knew for sure exactly what was going on.

2013
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,680
But to have made fun of him before

2014
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,640
and then to be proven wrong

2015
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,880
and then to title a video like that.

2016
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,280
That says, that is just a scumbag move.

2017
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,120
It's a little scummy.

2018
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:49,960
I mean, I would do that.

2019
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,480
I'll call out some specific people

2020
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,200
and blame them for Attica's death,

2021
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,480
even though the things I'm gonna criticize them for

2022
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,480
are things they did afterwards.

2023
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,320
From my justice, okay.

2024
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,420
But still, I think we should retroactively blame them

2025
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,140
for it.

2026
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:04,980
I'm sure they're not the only ones who did this,

2027
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,220
but people saw a couple of people on Twitter

2028
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,220
making it all about them.

2029
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:12,180
Like Boogie, of course,

2030
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,140
professional coward and appeaser,

2031
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,900
being like, I think it was like-

2032
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,540
Mental health, yeah.

2033
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,820
It was like, the tweet that I saw was like,

2034
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,660
you know, like, you know, so sorry to hear,

2035
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,420
so sorry to hear about Boogie.

2036
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,860
You know, bullying is terrible.

2037
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,460
You know, I have experienced bullying.

2038
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,420
Fortunately for me, I experienced so much bullying

2039
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,820
that I became hardened to it.

2040
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,380
You know, unlike poor, poor Attica,

2041
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,220
who just wasn't-

2042
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,060
There are some points to that.

2043
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,380
I mean, I don't hate Boogie the way you do.

2044
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,700
He wasn't bullied nearly as much as me,

2045
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,140
which is maybe true.

2046
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,620
You know, that might be true.

2047
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,780
That fucking Boogie was bullied and shit still.

2048
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,980
He fucking makes this like sad tweet,

2049
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,860
humble bragging about how much he's been bullied

2050
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,260
and stuff in response to this Attica thing.

2051
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,260
You know who else did the same thing?

2052
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:02,260
And this was a big disappointment to me,

2053
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,340
was fucking Holly Conrad.

2054
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,180
Your favorite content creator, as I understand it.

2055
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,940
My favorite content creator,

2056
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,220
who, you know, is known for several things,

2057
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,060
but most recently for being the other woman

2058
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,780
in the Jared scandal.

2059
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,260
And I was very disappointed because I'm very much on,

2060
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,780
I'm fucking on Jared and Holly's side in that.

2061
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,620
So it's disappointing to go and see Holly

2062
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,380
embarrassing herself with tweets about like,

2063
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:33,180
talking about how like cancel culture is what killed Attica

2064
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,620
and like, you know, it's bad and toxic.

2065
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,620
And I, you know, I've been,

2066
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:41,220
I also have been the victim of like the internet hate mob.

2067
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,220
You know, we have to end this.

2068
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,380
Isn't that kind of true?

2069
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,900
Well, well, I mean, first of all,

2070
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,540
I mean, cancel, being canceled didn't kill Attica, right?

2071
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,140
How would she know about his story though?

2072
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,980
Cause I think, I believe that part of the reason

2073
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:58,140
that he was feeling down and whatnot to this degree,

2074
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,100
I like, I think it was disproportionate,

2075
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,580
but it was because he had, honestly,

2076
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,420
it's kind of complicated,

2077
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,020
but he had like been involved with like a cult

2078
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,860
in some weird way.

2079
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:09,460
I don't know if that was specifically responsible.

2080
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,300
I didn't hear this.

2081
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,500
I mean, that's, that's the word that,

2082
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,860
I don't know if that's actually necessarily an accurate label,

2083
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,140
but like he had, he had done, you know,

2084
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,420
honestly, I don't even fucking know,

2085
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:19,620
but I know that he had done things

2086
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,420
that people were criticizing him for

2087
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,660
and he felt bad about it.

2088
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,940
And I think that was like, so I would see where that comes

2089
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,300
from if that's totally true.

2090
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,140
I don't know.

2091
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:29,980
I'm kind of talking out of my ass,

2092
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:30,820
but that was my understanding.

2093
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,820
I just think for Holly to come out

2094
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,380
and basically imply like, guys,

2095
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:38,500
what the reason Attica is dead is the same thing.

2096
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,700
That happened to me too.

2097
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,700
That happened to me and Jared.

2098
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,620
It's like, fuck off.

2099
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,500
It happened to her more so, I'd say, than Attica.

2100
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,540
I don't think Attica was getting,

2101
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,020
like the reason I was so shocked,

2102
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,180
cause I don't think Attica had done that much.

2103
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,500
Yeah. Well, exactly.

2104
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,140
That's why I don't think it's like,

2105
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:56,140
it has nothing to do with what happened with her and Jared.

2106
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,740
I see a thread of connection here.

2107
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,180
I see something.

2108
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,140
You could draw that same thread

2109
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,900
to like anyone with a following online.

2110
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,180
It isn't the point, the fact not that it is true,

2111
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,820
but rather that it's just, it's sort of rude

2112
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,860
to just make this person talk about you.

2113
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,700
Well, okay.

2114
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,860
To take the most charitable interpretation

2115
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,460
as I so often like to do,

2116
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,020
couldn't she be saying that like, this thing is bad.

2117
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,100
I've experienced this.

2118
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,180
Here's another example.

2119
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,180
Guys, let's get rid of this bad thing.

2120
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:25,020
It's happening.

2121
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,260
We're seeing it.

2122
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,100
I understand that.

2123
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,780
Well, maybe, but then think,

2124
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,900
what if that bad thing,

2125
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,540
what if you don't think that that bad thing she's blaming

2126
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,580
is what actually is responsible?

2127
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,420
Well, that's fair.

2128
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:40,580
Her actual motivation for making that assertion

2129
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:44,020
is just that some unrelated bad thing happened to her.

2130
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:47,260
She's mad about it and she wants to take this death

2131
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,460
and use it to decry this unrelated thing

2132
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,820
that she is opposed to.

2133
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:54,940
I mean, it's sort of equitable to like a shooting happens

2134
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:58,220
and then everyone says the stance on gun control.

2135
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,060
Yeah, it's the same thing.

2136
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:01,420
And it's like, you know, fair enough,

2137
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:06,420
I would just, I just don't like seeing that like immediately

2138
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:09,580
like some sort of agenda being pushed.

2139
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,860
I mean, even if it's a good cause,

2140
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,100
I just like someone's dead, like, I don't know.

2141
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:15,940
I felt personally I knew.

2142
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,260
Like why do you need to feel the comment on the death?

2143
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,980
I didn't even like, I mean, I retweeted like the news report

2144
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:22,820
that Erika died.

2145
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,340
I felt gross doing it, especially,

2146
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,100
I tweeted about this afterward.

2147
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,260
I like, I read to it and I said, like,

2148
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,900
I always liked Erika, I respected him,

2149
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,700
which she was, yeah, it was, it was breaking news.

2150
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,900
But the thing, like, I rarely comment on serious stuff

2151
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,340
like this, but I liked Erika a lot.

2152
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,220
But okay, but the point, like, after that,

2153
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:42,100
I, my brain, like, this was a response to my own tweet.

2154
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,020
I saw that the, oh, wow, this is getting lots of numbers.

2155
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,900
Hooray for me, getting lots of numbers.

2156
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:50,380
Like my brain did that exercise and then I was like, ew,

2157
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,460
I want to be deceased.

2158
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:53,460
This is gross.

2159
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,420
And so I said, like, I mean, this,

2160
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,740
this was almost a virtue signal

2161
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:59,340
because I'd already done it, but I was like,

2162
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:02,140
I really wish I could get no social cred from this,

2163
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,700
from this thing.

2164
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,940
I want to puke when I, when my brain thinks, hooray,

2165
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,860
positive numbers, but, you know.

2166
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:12,140
I mean, in some small way, you posting it at all,

2167
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,460
like, regardless of numbers would still be

2168
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,660
like a social cred thing to show that you care about Erika.

2169
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,900
Well, in, well, you know, existing within the attention

2170
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,260
of the economy, one cannot help, but, you know,

2171
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,380
have their, you know, have their...

2172
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,820
We're incentivized, all right.

2173
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,660
Yeah.

2174
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,540
Yeah, what, like, you, you can't post something

2175
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:34,340
on social media and not have that action tied

2176
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,660
to your, you know, social worth or whatever.

2177
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:40,700
Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's not really

2178
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,100
that big of a problem, but it is like, you know,

2179
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,540
it's a bit like, oh yeah, when you catch yourself doing it,

2180
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,620
you feel a little stupid.

2181
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,820
I just like, I fear, I fear the future

2182
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,580
where I do more and more of this sort of thing.

2183
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,780
And I begin to not have any, you know,

2184
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:57,460
revulsion to my own capitalization on such things,

2185
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,380
which was not, I was not cynically approaching this

2186
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,740
to be clear, I am very, very sad

2187
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,060
about what has to edit, it's fucked up, obviously.

2188
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,300
The worst thing possible is to find yourself

2189
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:11,260
being like okay with faking concern for clicks

2190
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:13,100
and views and all that.

2191
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,260
Man, it's fucked up.

2192
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,420
I was real upset when he died, it was fucked up, man.

2193
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,380
He was a cool guy, and it's like, I'm with everybody else.

2194
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,140
God, this was so predictable.

2195
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:24,060
Did you guys know he'd been in like the hospital

2196
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,420
for these kind of issues twice already

2197
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,620
and been released both times?

2198
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,580
I know that we can't like keep against his will,

2199
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,780
but I just like, I wish that the machinery

2200
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,180
had worked better to save this fucking guy.

2201
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,340
I mean, let's talk about that.

2202
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,140
Okay.

2203
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,100
How would it work better?

2204
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,420
I'll give you what I would want.

2205
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,380
What would that look like?

2206
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,620
How would what work better?

2207
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:48,540
The internet or like medic, or the hospital?

2208
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:53,060
I don't know, I guess mental health in America, I suppose.

2209
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:53,900
I mean, maybe.

2210
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,020
America is real, it's super hard, as I understand,

2211
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,460
to like commit people against their will

2212
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,140
to like any kind of mental institution.

2213
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,860
And I don't even know if necessarily I would want that.

2214
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,020
I'll tell you exactly what I would want

2215
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:05,980
in a perfect world, though.

2216
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:09,900
In a perfect world, I wouldn't want like the government

2217
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,780
to like lock this guy up until he's healthy enough to live.

2218
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:15,180
I would want his friends and family

2219
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,940
to be so concerned about him

2220
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,780
and so like willing to move heaven and earth to save him

2221
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,380
that they, not that he wouldn't take that much,

2222
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,980
but that they're like, you know, like whatever,

2223
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,660
like man, your cousin's gonna stay with you

2224
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,380
and like take care and make sure you're okay

2225
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,740
because you need our help and we're gonna do it.

2226
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,420
I mean, I don't know if there was anyone in his life

2227
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:33,620
who could, like his little brother had like died

2228
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,940
and I think committed suicide like years ago.

2229
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:37,920
It might have been older brother

2230
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,020
and it might not be suicide, so I might be speaking wrong.

2231
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,220
I'm sorry about that if I have that wrong.

2232
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,700
But like he was fucked up about his brother's death

2233
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,140
and for this to happen.

2234
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,340
Like I would have liked his brother to be around

2235
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,420
and like, you know, be able to help him

2236
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,580
and get him on the right track.

2237
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:56,140
I sometimes get the sense that that like family

2238
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:59,060
or like best friend that's super there for you

2239
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:02,260
is like pretty fictional.

2240
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:05,460
Like that very often does not really happen.

2241
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,300
Like people have their own shit going on.

2242
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,500
I don't think anyone would do that for me,

2243
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,220
not to be me, anyone in my friends or family,

2244
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,060
but I think I'd be in a similar boat.

2245
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:13,340
Like even if they would think that,

2246
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:18,460
like they're just never right in the like mindset

2247
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:22,100
to go that hard on trying to save someone.

2248
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:27,100
Imagine being that cousin and like your family is like,

2249
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,500
hey, you know, our boy, Attica or whatever.

2250
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,740
He's having mental stuff.

2251
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,820
He's having suicidal ideation.

2252
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,300
He's in a rough spot.

2253
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,100
We're gonna leave this guy,

2254
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,100
like you gotta take care of this guy.

2255
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,020
Like imagine, I mean, imagine having to,

2256
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,620
imagine having to like take care of someone like that

2257
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:49,340
who like doesn't want you to

2258
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,420
and like will like fight you on it

2259
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,260
and will try and like undermine you

2260
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,100
and like they're in a mental state to perceive you

2261
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:57,460
as the enemy and like they're constantly

2262
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,500
on the verge of a breakdown

2263
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,060
and you're the one who's there

2264
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:03,260
and you've gotta be the one to like deal with it every time.

2265
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:04,420
Like it's exhausting.

2266
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,500
I'm not sure that Attica was in that place,

2267
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,700
but it definitely could happen.

2268
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:08,700
So I'm waiting.

2269
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,860
You know what, I shouldn't have used,

2270
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:11,660
I shouldn't have said Attica, I don't know the details,

2271
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,940
but imagine doing, I'm just,

2272
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,580
it pictured someone who was like,

2273
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:17,340
like genuinely suicidal, like long-term,

2274
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,620
like imagine dealing with that person,

2275
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,940
especially if you're like not a professional in the field.

2276
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:25,700
I mean, look, I'm again, maybe controversial.

2277
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,900
I am prepared to say that like with our society,

2278
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,420
with the amount of freedom that we aim to preserve,

2279
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,420
some people will fall through the cracks

2280
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,900
and that's not good, but compared to a society

2281
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,500
where we, I don't know, force people to get locked up,

2282
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,980
it might be a cost I'm willing to pay.

2283
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,860
Nothing's perfect.

2284
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,100
Nothing's perfect, exactly.

2285
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,580
So you gotta pick your poison and I don't know.

2286
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,420
I don't know, man.

2287
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,340
You know, if someone's gonna,

2288
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:52,740
if someone's, you know, I mean, it's tragic.

2289
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,580
Yeah.

2290
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,100
But if someone is, you know, for whatever reason,

2291
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,900
whether mental illness or, I mean,

2292
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,780
I guess it would generally be mental illness, but whatever.

2293
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:03,140
You know, if someone's dedicated to killing themselves,

2294
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:06,540
like they can, they can do, yeah, yeah,

2295
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:10,300
it's hard to be, it's hard to make that impossible

2296
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,140
for someone who, you know, wants to do it.

2297
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,220
I think that's, yeah, that's what this was.

2298
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:16,060
Yeah.

2299
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:16,900
I don't know, I don't know.

2300
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,700
If you're fucking dedicated to the cause or whatever.

2301
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:22,180
I just wish people, I don't know, man.

2302
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,340
I feel like the answer to this,

2303
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:28,900
well, I think the problem largely is due

2304
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:32,300
to like social media and the kind of negativity you can get.

2305
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,620
So I get that that's like an issue and you can,

2306
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:35,940
I don't know, you can humiliate yourself

2307
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,100
and you can be attacked from every corner of the globe

2308
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,500
all at once, you know, justified or not.

2309
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,340
It's just something that can happen now.

2310
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:45,060
And I don't know, like I feel like in the situations

2311
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:48,260
like this, the kind of solution is to like,

2312
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:51,660
in whatever way, regain perspective.

2313
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,920
And if you've got like, you know, a malfunctioning brain

2314
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,460
as people with mental illness do, not to disparage them,

2315
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:59,460
like I understand that can be border impossible

2316
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,740
or just difficult or whatever.

2317
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,740
But like, if you're like, if you just go away

2318
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:05,820
from the internet for like a week, let's say,

2319
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,540
and you're just like, you know, hanging out with your family,

2320
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,580
maybe you go on vacation somewhere or something.

2321
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,660
And it's like, oh, you know, life's okay.

2322
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:12,860
Life's not terrible.

2323
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:15,420
It's the fact that you've got like an online job though

2324
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:17,060
that makes you pretty vulnerable

2325
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,500
to the constant waves of assault of this stuff.

2326
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,140
And I don't know.

2327
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:25,900
It seems like really, really harsh on,

2328
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:31,420
really hard on the people who are streamers generally,

2329
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:36,420
where they have to be like doing multiple hours a day

2330
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:38,780
playing games or whatever it is they do.

2331
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:43,660
And like holidays are such an impossibility

2332
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,700
that they're always hooked into whatever's going on.

2333
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,060
They're always online.

2334
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,700
They're always entertaining.

2335
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:53,940
And they, I mean, they work really hard

2336
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,980
and they get a lot of money for it.

2337
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:00,100
But I can't help but wonder if there's so many

2338
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,300
of these streamers are like really fucking themselves up

2339
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,140
due to this.

2340
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,100
Mentally, I would be, yeah.

2341
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,940
Mentally, yeah.

2342
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:09,060
Even my little bit of streaming I do now,

2343
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:11,220
there's, you know, there's a little bit of anxiety

2344
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,020
and kind of pressure that goes along with it,

2345
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,020
such that I don't want to do it full time.

2346
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:17,020
That sounds, not great to me.

2347
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,860
I would never want to be a streamer, just this way.

2348
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:23,060
Imagine being on camera like eight hours a day

2349
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:26,780
for a full work week, live on camera.

2350
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:27,620
That's not for me.

2351
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,460
That's not for me.

2352
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,300
Yeah.

2353
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,140
Yeah.

2354
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:30,980
I don't know, maybe one day I'll whore myself out.

2355
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:35,420
What are these internet things are good hobbies?

2356
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:37,620
That's why making videos I think is healthy.

2357
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,180
It still ties into the whole machine,

2358
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:41,740
but it's like you produce, you edit down

2359
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,900
what you don't like out of it.

2360
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,940
It's less stressful.

2361
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:45,780
I don't know.

2362
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,580
I just like that better personally.

2363
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:49,420
What were you saying, Munchy?

2364
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,420
You were trying to.

2365
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,140
Just to pivot away from this.

2366
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:52,980
Sure.

2367
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:56,660
To go back to fit MC to springboard off of him

2368
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:57,780
into a tangent.

2369
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:02,340
I said this before, but seeing worlds collide

2370
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,740
on your Twitter timeline or in YouTube comments

2371
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,300
specifically related to this,

2372
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,580
where just you're on some video

2373
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,980
and you're enjoying your life

2374
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,420
and the content creators inside of it.

2375
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:17,620
You scroll down and you see that another part

2376
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,500
of your brain, another part of the people

2377
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,620
and another content creator is on this other content creator

2378
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,060
that you're like, oh, it's the same.

2379
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:26,820
And when it's your own content,

2380
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,900
like how it was for when I saw fit MC

2381
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:35,620
coming on the PCP, what the fuck?

2382
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:40,120
That's so bizarre of a thing for my perspective

2383
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,980
to have this like 2B2T YouTuber that I follow

2384
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:46,380
coming on my podcast.

2385
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,780
That was strange.

2386
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:52,220
And I had a moment like that earlier today

2387
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,980
when I was scrolling through the comments

2388
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,980
of the latest episode when, who do I see?

2389
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:00,980
But fly away now, what?

2390
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:05,380
For those of you with a, Ben, give me a way

2391
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:06,420
to describe a brain.

2392
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:07,820
What's a way to describe a brain

2393
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,620
that's a, you'd never forget something.

2394
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:13,100
Wait, a way to describe a brain that's what?

2395
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,180
Never forget something.

2396
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,300
You know, there's smooth brain.

2397
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,140
A steel trap.

2398
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,180
A steel trap.

2399
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:18,620
A steel trap, mind.

2400
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:19,460
Steel brain.

2401
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,300
Steel brain.

2402
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,100
For the steel brain, if you may remember that name

2403
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,820
from my Deagle Nation lecture,

2404
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:28,100
as he was a key member of Team Gamer Food.

2405
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,180
And I can only assume that he just found

2406
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:31,660
the PCP through that.

2407
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:35,540
And then it has just been like following us since then

2408
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:38,260
and just now has decided to comment,

2409
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,620
what, fly away now, listen, I understand

2410
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,060
that from your perspective, you've been living life

2411
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:45,220
for years and that you are far removed

2412
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:48,620
from whatever saga that you were once in at that point.

2413
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:51,340
But to me, you're still fucking crazy, dude.

2414
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:53,380
You think you can just comment on the PCP?

2415
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,700
That's insane.

2416
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:58,020
Fly away now, isn't the PCP, what?

2417
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,540
So shout out to Fly Away Now,

2418
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,380
what I think is listening right now.

2419
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,540
Dude, you should be on the show.

2420
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:02,460
Yeah.

2421
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,300
What?

2422
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,700
That's crazy.

2423
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,020
That's crazy, talk.

2424
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:07,820
I don't know what you think.

2425
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,420
PCP, I'm sorry.

2426
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,580
Film C, we just lurk in the shadows.

2427
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,540
Fly away now, just lurk in the shadows.

2428
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:15,420
Who else?

2429
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,540
Who other?

2430
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:17,820
When is PewDiePie finally gonna comment?

2431
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,020
He's gonna comment that I love the door.

2432
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,740
PewDiePie Notch?

2433
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:25,780
We know Notch is watching our Primo Minecraft discussions.

2434
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:26,620
He's here.

2435
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,380
Yeah, Notch is a Mumkey Jones fan.

2436
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:32,340
Like, he's probably all up in the war.

2437
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:34,020
The thing about Notch that's fascinating.

2438
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:39,020
I mean, we had everyone's favorite Florian Hemsel.

2439
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,300
Indeed, indeed.

2440
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,580
Hey, you know, news about Florian Hemsel,

2441
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,780
he's a lib now.

2442
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,820
I'm so excited.

2443
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:47,580
We did it, gamers.

2444
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:50,340
We made him, he put out a video being like,

2445
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:52,860
yeah, I used to be edgy and like triggering the libs,

2446
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:55,300
but actually I think maybe they make some good points.

2447
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,660
Wow, that's going to change.

2448
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,100
And I left a long comment being like,

2449
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,900
here's my favorite left tubers.

2450
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:01,740
No, not to mean that.

2451
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,580
Don't go watch them and get radicalized.

2452
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:04,420
Get radicalized.

2453
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:07,020
He's gonna make a game now, the binding of capitalism.

2454
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:10,100
Ah, I'm just curious, was this,

2455
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,780
did this seem like, you know,

2456
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,260
well thought out and legitimate or was it, you know,

2457
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,020
kind of, okay, okay, good.

2458
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,420
Yeah, it's just him being like,

2459
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:19,180
so you know, here's the stuff I used to say

2460
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:22,220
and here's some thoughts I have about politics nowadays

2461
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,900
and how they're different from what I used to think.

2462
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,140
Sounds reasonable to me.

2463
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:28,540
You could like check your subscribers.

2464
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,500
I'm 99% sure.

2465
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,060
In fact, I say that looking at the feature

2466
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,740
where I can do it right now.

2467
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,020
And I'm just scrolling through,

2468
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,340
like what if I just see someone who I just,

2469
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:38,980
like I'll lose my shit on.

2470
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,500
Like I don't think that's like impossible right now.

2471
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,300
You can sort by most popular.

2472
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,020
You can sort by the most subs.

2473
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,860
Most subscribers, yeah.

2474
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:50,220
So you can just see who is your most subbed person

2475
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,380
who subs you.

2476
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,900
You can't do that on Twitter though, I wish you could.

2477
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,780
There are, I think apps you can use to do that though.

2478
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:57,940
I haven't looked for apps

2479
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:59,620
and I haven't found any that are free.

2480
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,460
Okay, maybe I'm wrong.

2481
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:03,660
I can only find in the past 28 days here

2482
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,100
on YouTube right now.

2483
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,100
I'll try and find, okay.

2484
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,820
Oh, that's the new fucking creator studio thing.

2485
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,700
They're probably removing that fucking functionality

2486
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,140
like everything else with this.

2487
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:14,860
Did you guys, okay, time for a call out.

2488
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,500
Once again, do you guys watch Creator Insider?

2489
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:23,340
They're like the quote unquote unofficial YouTube team

2490
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:25,620
like update shit.

2491
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,620
Everyone who does YouTube should watch them

2492
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,740
because they just release information

2493
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:31,380
that you're not gonna get anywhere else

2494
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:33,540
about like literally what YouTube is doing.

2495
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,180
It's the thing that we all wanted for years

2496
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,260
about like, why doesn't YouTube just make a YouTube channel

2497
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,140
and make announcements about their changes?

2498
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:39,980
Well, that's what they are.

2499
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,180
That's exactly what they are.

2500
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:42,900
And they're often shitty and terrible

2501
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,180
and I hate everyone who works there

2502
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:48,860
but they do in fact release good information to know

2503
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,400
if you're gonna do YouTube shit.

2504
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,300
And they have been, I wanna use the word shilling.

2505
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,020
They've been shilling the YouTube studio beta

2506
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:59,020
as opposed to like the studio classic.

2507
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,580
And I know it's not their fault.

2508
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,940
Like YouTube just decide they're gonna update the studio.

2509
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,340
It's like the new thing.

2510
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:07,780
And they're gonna get rid of the classic studio pretty soon.

2511
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:09,780
And I am dreading that day

2512
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,180
because I fucking hate the new YouTube studio.

2513
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:14,980
So let me just give you one, here's one reason

2514
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,140
why I hate the new YouTube studio.

2515
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,820
Dude, did you bro subscribe to me?

2516
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,940
What? Oh my God.

2517
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:22,260
He's got 363,000 subs.

2518
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,100
This won't even be a big deal for most people

2519
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,820
but for me it's infuriating.

2520
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:28,940
It's okay, every month when I'm going over my finances

2521
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:31,820
and the PC piece finances, which I do every month,

2522
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,540
there is a thing that you can do

2523
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,540
where you set up like exact dates of when you want

2524
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,660
your like income earning to be for your analytics.

2525
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:39,740
This is easy to do.

2526
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:40,900
You click the little calendar.

2527
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:44,380
It works relatively well on the studio beta

2528
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,860
and the classic, so that's fine.

2529
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:47,660
You can find the window of like a month's earnings.

2530
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,620
No problem, get the information you need.

2531
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:53,780
The problem is on classic you have the option of

2532
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:56,900
you can have that block of time that set number of days

2533
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:58,380
you wanna get your analytics from.

2534
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,060
You can then go to the top right,

2535
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,820
click on your account, switch account,

2536
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:03,340
and you can switch accounts.

2537
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:04,580
And if you do it on classic,

2538
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:08,460
it retains that date window when you switch between accounts.

2539
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,380
I have a lot of YouTube accounts that I go into

2540
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:13,700
for this stuff and great, done, easy.

2541
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,300
On fucking studio beta,

2542
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:18,140
it resets the goddamn time window,

2543
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:22,940
so I have to manually set it again for every fucking time.

2544
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:26,340
Now, the one advantage is they have slightly more options.

2545
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:29,300
You can go into a menu and select like a previous month,

2546
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,220
a little bit easier, but I still have to click

2547
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:34,220
an extra fucking button that I didn't have to in classic.

2548
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:37,260
For that reason alone, I hate the new one

2549
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:38,300
and it's fucking annoying.

2550
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:41,340
It just lacks features the other had and I was used to.

2551
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,020
And I'm gonna cry and bitch about it forever.

2552
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:47,780
And everyone who pushes the studio beta, fuck you.

2553
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:48,780
You're a bad person.

2554
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:49,620
This is my-

2555
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,740
I mean, it makes you look at better,

2556
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:54,500
but right now the beta leaves a lot to be desired.

2557
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,980
Yes, exactly.

2558
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,460
I'm gonna fucking rabbit hole right now.

2559
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,420
Okay, so I went to our subscribers

2560
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:01,780
and I'm looking at everyone's sword by most popular.

2561
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,340
On the PCP, I assume.

2562
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:04,260
Yeah, of course.

2563
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,780
A shocking revelation.

2564
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:09,900
Drumroll, please, for the top subscriber

2565
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,540
that we have to the PCP.

2566
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,500
Drumroll, please.

2567
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:14,500
Digi bro.

2568
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,420
We did it.

2569
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,340
But also, okay, among these,

2570
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:23,620
among these are, again, just like someone that I know,

2571
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:25,980
I already know who you are and you're watching the PCP.

2572
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:27,100
What the fuck?

2573
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,780
Deadly Comics is described to the PCP.

2574
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,220
Deadly Comics was great.

2575
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,620
What, huh?

2576
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:34,460
What do you mean what?

2577
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:35,300
That's pretty cool.

2578
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,220
He's my best friend.

2579
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,580
I love Deadly Comics.

2580
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,300
He's a subscriber of mine as well.

2581
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,140
We see him around, I think.

2582
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:44,900
I remember this boxing video from years ago.

2583
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:47,180
I can't even believe that it's real.

2584
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:48,020
The person makes this-

2585
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:48,860
Do you remember, do you-

2586
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:49,700
Real?

2587
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:50,540
What?

2588
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,460
Do you remember he animated the give-and-take

2589
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,420
jumping up and down?

2590
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:56,140
Yeah, that was him that I put in my fucking video on.

2591
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,780
Yeah, that's because he was a subscriber

2592
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:00,460
of like give-and-take reviews or whatever.

2593
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,620
He's had a lot of really funny innovation work

2594
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,460
since then.

2595
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,300
If you guys don't keep up with him,

2596
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:06,420
it's fucking fantastic.

2597
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,780
No, yeah.

2598
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,660
What, guys?

2599
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:10,580
What?

2600
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:12,140
What's happening?

2601
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:13,340
I don't understand.

2602
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,300
Why are these people subscribed to the PCP?

2603
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,620
The dick show's subscribed to the PCP?

2604
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,220
What's happening?

2605
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,860
Hey, what do you know?

2606
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:22,380
That's, I mean, obviously that's,

2607
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,900
those guys, they don't know much about us or care.

2608
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,540
They obviously just subbed for the,

2609
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,220
for the, you know, lecture did you did.

2610
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:30,220
For the piece, don't say that, dude.

2611
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,100
The fucking, the collabs and the works.

2612
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:32,940
Yeah, okay.

2613
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:33,900
All right, we'll see.

2614
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,740
Damn.

2615
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,540
And people like Fly Away Now are like,

2616
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,100
like people who I care intensely about,

2617
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,740
but like don't have like, you know, subscribers.

2618
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:41,540
I can just go through here and find,

2619
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,700
okay, like text talks.

2620
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,660
I already knew that he was a fan,

2621
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,380
but like, I didn't know he was a fan.

2622
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,060
That would have been crazy.

2623
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:50,020
Yeah, I'm looking at Deadly Comics' newest video, Milk Dust.

2624
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,860
Ooh, I love it.

2625
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:51,700
Got bite effects.

2626
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,540
Looks sick.

2627
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,380
Deadly Comics is good.

2628
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,220
Pass analysis.

2629
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,580
Glorious, glorious.

2630
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:56,420
Yep, we got him.

2631
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,060
Got him.

2632
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,220
Frankly, there's not a lot of accolades on the PCP.

2633
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,180
There's some, for sure.

2634
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,140
And that's cool.

2635
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:06,180
Okay, the fucking like exponential like drop

2636
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,780
and like, oh, you know, you got Digibro at the top

2637
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,660
with like almost 400K.

2638
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:14,020
And then like almost immediately, it's like,

2639
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:14,860
oh, that's like 1.0.

2640
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:15,900
It was down to zero.

2641
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:16,740
Yeah.

2642
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:17,580
I mean, you know, for understand me.

2643
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:18,420
That's fine.

2644
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,260
I mean, it's not like, you know.

2645
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,100
I mean, how many.

2646
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,860
You're not less valve of a PCP fan.

2647
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:22,700
Yeah, most subscribers.

2648
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:24,540
The YouTube population has Digibro level subscribers.

2649
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,580
Yeah, not much.

2650
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:28,540
The most, the most curious one of mine

2651
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:30,780
is like the most subscribed is a channel

2652
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:35,620
called Reckless Eating with 600,000 subscribers.

2653
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:40,300
They are like, yeah, Jesse like did like the Count

2654
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,660
Chocula review like a million years ago.

2655
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:47,660
And somehow through some like association through Jesse,

2656
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,860
he found Hippocrite and he subscribed.

2657
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:53,460
And he, I think has commented on a few videos.

2658
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,540
It's just sort of like, man, I don't know anything

2659
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:56,380
about that.

2660
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:58,300
Anime guy said to me, go fuck off, dude.

2661
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:01,060
I don't give a shit about your terrible anime.

2662
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:01,900
All right.

2663
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,740
Now I'm just, I'm just, you're a fallatio at this point.

2664
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,740
I'm on my own and apparently Mr. Meat Man's following me.

2665
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,580
Okay.

2666
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:09,420
All right.

2667
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,260
Okay.

2668
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,100
Oh, he wants to dig up that scoop, dude.

2669
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:11,940
He wants to beat.

2670
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:12,780
Yeah, he really.

2671
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:13,620
He thought that was monkey.

2672
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,500
To be fair, Frank, he thought you were.

2673
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,940
Yeah, that's right.

2674
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,780
You know, unironically, Mr. Meat Man, I think was like

2675
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:22,620
kind of a fan of at least some of us for a while.

2676
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:23,780
And I don't know, he probably still is.

2677
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,900
I mean, there's nothing's changed about what any of us do.

2678
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:31,020
So, I mean, I just, I think he generally likes my content

2679
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:31,860
as far as I know.

2680
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:32,700
I don't know.

2681
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:34,380
You know, I'm trying to put words in his mouth.

2682
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:35,620
You know, you want to be fun.

2683
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,460
You want to be fun.

2684
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:37,300
Yeah.

2685
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,020
Even if you're not, you know, like a fucking,

2686
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:41,260
like a big wig, big dick.

2687
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,100
Yeah, I am.

2688
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:42,940
You know what?

2689
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:44,700
If you're listening to us, just post a comment.

2690
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:45,540
Post a comment.

2691
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:46,740
I don't know what you do.

2692
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:48,340
What your deal is.

2693
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,180
I don't know.

2694
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,340
Maybe I do know you from somewhere.

2695
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,780
If you have vast amounts of social currency,

2696
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:55,420
please post in the comments below

2697
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:58,100
so that we may, we may basket it's glow.

2698
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,100
I would love that.

2699
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,260
I would absolutely, you know, that'd be delectable.

2700
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,500
If I can, if I can Viva Reverie as well.

2701
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,340
That's a cool guy.

2702
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:05,180
I'm a two.

2703
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,020
Oh yeah, he's a cool guy.

2704
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:06,860
I remember those pony things.

2705
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:07,700
Yep, yep, yep.

2706
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,260
Wasted his talents on ponies,

2707
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,580
but you know, one day maybe he'll wake up to, to justice.

2708
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,620
There's a bizarre amount of subscribers to me

2709
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,980
that have Scott Pilgrim avatars,

2710
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:17,980
which I'm completely fine with.

2711
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:18,940
Oh, that's concerning.

2712
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:19,780
That's nice.

2713
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:21,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2714
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:22,740
That's the audience you want to be reaching.

2715
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,100
Yeah, literally.

2716
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:25,420
The Scott Pilgrim audience.

2717
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,100
Um, okay.

2718
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:28,700
So enough jacking our own.

2719
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,540
Yeah, sure.

2720
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,380
About how cool our subscribers are.

2721
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:31,220
Sure, sure.

2722
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,900
Um, let me, you guys catch those

2723
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,980
fucking Democratic debates on the television.

2724
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:37,820
I didn't know, television.

2725
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,420
You know, I wanted to,

2726
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,660
I wanted to look back,

2727
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:43,780
but I, all I could find on YouTube was like reaction videos

2728
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:44,780
and I couldn't find the actual thing.

2729
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:45,620
I watched them both on YouTube.

2730
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,580
I found clips.

2731
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,420
The whole thing.

2732
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:48,460
No, I mean, like afterwards,

2733
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,300
I wasn't watching them.

2734
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:50,140
Me too, I watched them afterwards.

2735
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:50,980
I was like, I was gonna.

2736
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,820
I'm gay.

2737
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:53,100
Oh, well, whatever.

2738
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,020
You know, I'm fine.

2739
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,620
I really thought long and hard about watching those.

2740
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:57,900
My conclusion was,

2741
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,860
and this just goes to my general thoughts on life these days,

2742
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:05,860
it's that I don't want to engage with politics

2743
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:08,580
on this kind of like fast,

2744
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,100
like kind of like the hype cycle level.

2745
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,900
I would be much happier letting everybody else sort it out

2746
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:15,660
and then I will try to sort through.

2747
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:16,500
And you know what?

2748
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,340
Maybe I'm lazy.

2749
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:18,460
Maybe I'm avoiding the question,

2750
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:19,300
but I think it's the best thing for me.

2751
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,620
I watched them for the exact opposite reason.

2752
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:23,660
I watched them because I didn't want to have

2753
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:26,140
the information of the debate to be filtered through

2754
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:28,060
biased perspectives from other people.

2755
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:29,580
I wanted to observe it first hand

2756
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,060
and draw my own conclusions.

2757
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:33,780
I mean, I'd rather watch them all like in six months,

2758
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:35,780
but I'm not going to obviously.

2759
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,620
Nate, I understand what you mean by that.

2760
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,300
But here's my counter thing.

2761
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,340
I kind of felt the same way in 2016.

2762
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,740
And in 2016, I wasn't really paying attention.

2763
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,860
And I was just like, eh, doesn't matter.

2764
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:50,360
I'll just wait for the final election.

2765
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,720
I'll look at the final candidates.

2766
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:52,800
I'll pick between them.

2767
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,080
You know, I was like, you know,

2768
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,840
everything up until that is the, it's, it's all just,

2769
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,760
you know, there's nothing I can do about it.

2770
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,720
And then because I had that attitude, I didn't,

2771
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:05,200
I wasn't paying attention in the democratic primaries.

2772
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,040
Yeah, yeah.

2773
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,960
And I created and I fit the greatest moral failing

2774
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,600
of my entire life, which was not voting for Bernie

2775
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,600
in the primaries because I didn't vote in the primaries

2776
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,000
because I wasn't paying attention.

2777
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,680
So this time I was like, well, I'm going to be,

2778
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,240
I got to at least pay some attention.

2779
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,400
I got to at least pay some attention to like, you know,

2780
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:26,040
the main fucking event of the race, which is, you know,

2781
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:26,880
the debates.

2782
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,720
So I tuned in.

2783
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,560
That's fair.

2784
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,040
I'd highly encourage people to arm themselves

2785
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,480
with information and to vote in their primaries,

2786
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,320
including me.

2787
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,680
I should do that too.

2788
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,860
If I, I don't even know if I'm registered to a party.

2789
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:40,200
I certainly don't feel like I belong to either party

2790
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,280
or any of the myriad parties out there.

2791
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:43,120
But people should.

2792
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,040
I don't know how it is in Cincinnati.

2793
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,400
Pretty sure in Massachusetts.

2794
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
I think I'm registered as an independent in Massachusetts,

2795
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,600
but I think in Massachusetts,

2796
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,160
independents are allowed to vote in either.

2797
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,720
People should know those sorts of things.

2798
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,560
Yeah.

2799
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,280
I should make absolutely sure of that.

2800
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,400
But you know, I, I was actually talking about this

2801
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:00,640
in my stream yesterday a little bit,

2802
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,960
that I do consider it a civic duty to vote.

2803
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,720
And I think like you cannot do it in the same way

2804
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,560
that you cannot, I don't know,

2805
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,920
like doing anything that you should do,

2806
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,800
but like that's, that's worse than doing it,

2807
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,360
which I count with myself.

2808
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,500
Which so I voted in the last bunch of elections,

2809
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,840
but not the primaries.

2810
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,680
And the primaries kind of matter more.

2811
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,520
The only thing is-

2812
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:21,600
I mean, you know, I mean, yeah,

2813
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,960
I didn't think about it until 2016,

2814
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,800
when the primaries-

2815
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,640
2016 opened my eyes.

2816
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:26,480
Yeah.

2817
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,320
Yeah, yeah.

2818
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,440
The 2016, the primaries decided everything.

2819
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,760
It was so clear.

2820
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:33,000
I mean, our two votes obviously, you know,

2821
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,780
wouldn't have made a big, I wanted to vote for Bernie.

2822
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:38,200
I was fucked up that Bernie didn't win, you know, last time.

2823
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,440
I wouldn't vote for him now, but-

2824
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,920
In hindsight, you wouldn't wait.

2825
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,200
What do you mean you wouldn't vote for him now?

2826
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,800
I mean, I, I mean, I don't know.

2827
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,960
I probably vote for Trump.

2828
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,120
So I was going to vote for anybody.

2829
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,080
Because things are going fine.

2830
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,240
I don't know, pretty happy.

2831
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:51,320
Are you insane?

2832
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,160
No.

2833
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,000
Oh no.

2834
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

2835
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:54,800
Not at all.

2836
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,120
Did you actually say that?

2837
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,520
Oh my God, you're so down the rabbit hole.

2838
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,280
Well, I'm down the, I'm down the rabbit hole.

2839
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,200
I'm gonna fucking-

2840
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,960
Well, I totally admit to my total ignorance.

2841
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:08,520
I have no, not even if I not looked into it,

2842
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:12,200
I have no interest in looking into like real life politics.

2843
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,000
And so, I mean, I'll vote,

2844
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,120
I'll figure out somebody to vote.

2845
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:16,600
And I'll probably do what I've done.

2846
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,120
And basically cop out,

2847
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,000
and just vote for like a third party person

2848
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,280
who isn't gonna win anyway.

2849
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,320
Which, you know, I mean, it is my right to do, obviously.

2850
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,640
Is this a bit?

2851
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:26,800
No.

2852
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,640
No.

2853
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:33,040
You know, most of the country just, you know,

2854
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,680
is pretty right-wing.

2855
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,040
I mean, you know, about half.

2856
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,520
I'm not even right-wing.

2857
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,200
It's just that I don't really,

2858
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,480
I mean, I want small government overall.

2859
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,720
Clearly is like,

2860
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,280
clearly is like a really stupid,

2861
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:49,040
like silly man who says the wrong things on TV.

2862
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,800
And it's really funny when he does that.

2863
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,400
I assume you're one of those people who likes to ignore

2864
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,040
like the Twitter drama stuff.

2865
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:57,880
True.

2866
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,120
And you care more about policy.

2867
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,640
Do you even know what Trump has been doing, though?

2868
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:02,720
I know a couple of things.

2869
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:03,960
I mean, I don't either,

2870
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,520
but like, I wouldn't immediately say,

2871
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,680
yeah, sure, Trump.

2872
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:10,320
Well, okay, let me be more specific.

2873
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,760
What I'm really saying is,

2874
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,000
because frankly speaking,

2875
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,680
I'm almost definitely not going to vote for Trump.

2876
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:18,640
I mean, you know, so let's not overreact here.

2877
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,240
Nate's the biggest Trump supporter in the world.

2878
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,800
He loves everything Trump is doing.

2879
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,880
My point is that it doesn't seem to me very likely

2880
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:27,720
that anyone's going to beat Trump.

2881
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:30,080
So considering that, I'm, I don't know,

2882
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,960
I'm relatively ambivalent about who I vote for anyway.

2883
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,120
I mean, look, I understand people

2884
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,560
are probably gonna disagree with that.

2885
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,120
Why is that a reason to vote for him?

2886
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:41,440
And second of all, I mean, I don't think that's,

2887
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,280
he might win.

2888
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,840
I don't think it's a sure thing.

2889
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,600
I mean, to break it down, I'm in Ohio.

2890
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,920
Ohio's gonna go red.

2891
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,320
So I mean, you know.

2892
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:49,760
Well, how do you know?

2893
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,360
Well, it went red last time

2894
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,920
and it seems like it's been trending that way.

2895
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,240
I haven't really studied it or anything.

2896
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:57,080
I understand that you don't really care,

2897
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:00,960
but like, it seems like a pretty silly like position

2898
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,720
to be like, well, it was this once,

2899
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,840
it'll probably be this again.

2900
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,200
Therefore, I won't even think about it.

2901
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:06,040
You should vote.

2902
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,000
You say that voting is a civic duty, but correct.

2903
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,400
I honestly think people with your attitude

2904
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,440
probably just shouldn't vote because that's fucking dumb.

2905
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,440
I mean, I agree.

2906
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,800
Well, okay, you're asking me right now

2907
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,120
before I had a chance to, you know, look in anything.

2908
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,480
So I don't know.

2909
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,480
Let's readdress this question

2910
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:21,800
when the primaries are coming up

2911
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,800
or when the elections are coming up.

2912
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,040
I really wish that you had seen the debates

2913
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,960
because I really would love to hear your thoughts

2914
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,000
on all the shit.

2915
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:29,840
There was a lot of shit.

2916
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,160
Not that I think they were great or anything.

2917
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,640
In fact, they were kind of disappointing.

2918
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,840
This will be more important

2919
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,000
than anything I just said about who I'm gonna vote for.

2920
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,520
The real deal here with me as a person

2921
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:43,320
is I want the government to be so small

2922
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,680
that I don't have to think about it at all.

2923
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:49,280
So the question to me of who are you gonna vote for

2924
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,240
is it's about who will fuck things up the least.

2925
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:56,760
And additionally, who will do the less

2926
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,720
to increase the size of government

2927
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,120
because I just don't want it to be big.

2928
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,160
So I understand.

2929
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,680
People who want the government to fix things,

2930
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,280
understandable, that's fair.

2931
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,200
I just don't think that's happening.

2932
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,640
And again, I'm not a student of political philosophy.

2933
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:11,600
I don't know anything.

2934
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:13,960
These are general thoughts of experience of life

2935
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,240
that could be totally wrong.

2936
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,400
It's just that considering that,

2937
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,080
the question to me of who to vote for

2938
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,240
is not a very important one

2939
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,800
other than who will not fuck up the world more.

2940
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,040
I'd rather that opposite of that happen.

2941
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,200
So reasonable to think about.

2942
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,080
I understand the president has influence on the world.

2943
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:37,040
Who can I vote for to diminish that power?

2944
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,680
That's the person I wanna vote for.

2945
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,880
Cause I just wanna do my own shit

2946
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,960
and not be bothered by anyone.

2947
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:44,080
Cause that's it.

2948
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:47,160
I mean, I wanna kind of wanna vote for Bernie

2949
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,040
because he'll diminish corporate power

2950
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,200
because that's like kind of the more pressing problem

2951
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,320
in my life, right?

2952
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:57,040
Economically speaking, that's what I'm into.

2953
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,880
I get that.

2954
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:58,720
What's going on with Yang?

2955
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,640
I heard that his mic was like cut.

2956
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:01,680
Yang got cut, man.

2957
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,120
Yang got cut.

2958
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,000
Okay.

2959
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,840
He didn't speak up.

2960
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,080
I'm not saying it's his fault, but yeah.

2961
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,560
They only asked him like one or two questions.

2962
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:12,120
He got snubbed and also apparently

2963
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:14,440
his mic was turned off when he tried to interject.

2964
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:16,720
There's video evidence showing that his mic

2965
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,600
did get was turned off.

2966
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,440
Okay.

2967
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,440
So they fucking, yeah.

2968
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,800
They fucking forest-gumped him.

2969
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,640
Remember that?

2970
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,480
Oh yeah.

2971
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,320
When they cut the mic.

2972
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,160
Yeah.

2973
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,000
Okay, I'm with you.

2974
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,840
I'm with you.

2975
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,840
So that happened to him.

2976
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,080
So he's being silenced, which is great.

2977
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,160
You know, I love it.

2978
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,640
God, no.

2979
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,960
Hell, okay.

2980
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,160
You know, I did watch just of passing interest.

2981
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:46,320
I watched a couple of people's summaries of the debate

2982
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,840
and it was interesting to see.

2983
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,840
I watched, I think I watched Ben Shapiro on the one hand

2984
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,960
say that Bernie lost hard.

2985
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,160
And then on the other hand,

2986
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:59,360
I watched Kyle Kalinsky of Secular Talk say that Bernie won.

2987
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,360
Not as much as Kamala Harris, but that Bernie came out

2988
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:04,400
and I'm just like, well, this just seems like

2989
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,320
people's biases are playing a new one.

2990
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,840
Well, Ben Shapiro is a fucking goblin.

2991
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,160
So like, I think he's obviously wrong.

2992
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,440
And I would assume that about anything he says.

2993
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,880
I mean, what a boring point.

2994
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,720
Cause now we, okay.

2995
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:19,680
People whose political politics are different from mine.

2996
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:20,880
Their opinion just doesn't matter.

2997
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,920
Well, there's people who are different

2998
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,200
and there's people who are stupid.

2999
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,880
The only things I've heard Ben Shapiro say are,

3000
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,680
man, I couldn't understand him.

3001
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,520
Okay.

3002
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,440
I don't think Bernie was like a huge,

3003
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:35,160
I don't think he, yeah, like it's pretty clear

3004
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,440
that the general consensus that the people that came out

3005
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,680
that the most ahead in the debates were Tulsi Gabbard

3006
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,560
in the first one and Kamala Harris in the second one.

3007
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:43,640
That's fine.

3008
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:47,240
I was just, I was waiting for Biden to embarrass himself,

3009
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,600
which he kind of did, but not as much as I hoped he would.

3010
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,720
Here Kamala dunked on him or something.

3011
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,840
Kamala dunked on him really hard.

3012
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:56,280
And then there was another part where I'm, oh God,

3013
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,040
fucking the guy who looks like the fucking Dweebie guy

3014
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,280
from 30 Rock, I don't know his name.

3015
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:05,400
Like a younger candidate who looked like a fucking nerd,

3016
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,640
but he was all right.

3017
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:09,440
He came out, he was like, 30 years ago,

3018
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:12,760
a politician came to my town or something.

3019
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,880
Fuck, I forgot the details.

3020
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,400
I heard a politician speak and he said it was time

3021
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,680
to pass the torch to the next generation.

3022
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,120
That politician was Joe Biden.

3023
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:25,480
And Joe Biden fucking smirks at the camera and is like,

3024
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:28,680
well, I'm gonna hold onto that torch a little longer.

3025
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,960
He literally said that.

3026
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,960
You'll pry this torch for my cold dead hands.

3027
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,600
He didn't say that.

3028
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:37,400
He did not literally say that.

3029
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,000
That was pretty funny.

3030
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,920
The best part of both debates was when fucking,

3031
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:47,920
Hick and Looper, that fucking ghoul was like,

3032
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,320
I think we need to not,

3033
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:56,240
we need to make it really clear that we're not socialists

3034
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,200
because if we're socialists,

3035
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:02,080
then the Republicans will call us socialists,

3036
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,680
and that's bad.

3037
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:06,640
I mean, that will happen, true, as they already do.

3038
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,360
Yeah, it already happens.

3039
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,560
I mean, he's so fucking behind.

3040
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,160
I thought Bernie's literally running

3041
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,760
as a democratic socialist.

3042
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,200
He is openly a socialist.

3043
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,760
And you're like, we can't let them call us socialists.

3044
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,920
Bernie fucking is one.

3045
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,600
Hasn't Bernie been rejecting the label of socialist?

3046
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,920
Like, I know he's a democratic socialist.

3047
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,760
He's like, no, no, no, that's not socialism, guys.

3048
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,400
This is a totally different thing.

3049
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,920
Isn't that his stance?

3050
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,160
I mean, think about it, though, Ben.

3051
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:31,920
The whole reason Bernie got fucking snubbed last time

3052
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,880
by his own party is because he was basically pushing

3053
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,520
the socialist agenda that the people

3054
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:37,360
power the DNC did agree with.

3055
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,200
Yo, I'll throw this out here, though, Ben,

3056
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,000
because it's interesting to hear your thoughts on it.

3057
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,600
Like, okay, you're into the left stuff.

3058
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:45,800
Got it, that's cool.

3059
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:49,400
Is America overall with you on this?

3060
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:50,760
I mean, are they gonna win?

3061
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,880
No, Nate.

3062
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,280
No. Okay.

3063
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:56,240
Well, I think Bernie could win.

3064
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:58,200
Okay, that's possible.

3065
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,160
I don't know America's not on board

3066
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:02,280
because the Overture window has shifted

3067
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:05,600
and what's considered centric now

3068
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,880
is fundamentally conservative.

3069
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,960
Okay.

3070
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,800
So no.

3071
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:15,000
We're the opposition, but that's fine

3072
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,400
because the actual things on offer by people like Bernie

3073
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:22,480
are things that people actually care about and want.

3074
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,200
For example, student loan, debt forgiveness,

3075
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:31,200
universal health care, et cetera, such and such.

3076
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,560
So yeah, no.

3077
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:35,800
I think it is probably against,

3078
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,560
but why do you ask that, Nate?

3079
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,600
What's the point of that fucking question?

3080
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,840
Well, my question, it's really, it's that like...

3081
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,840
What's the actionable results of knowing that answer?

3082
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,400
It's that like, I mean, based on the people

3083
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,760
that I've been listening to,

3084
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:51,840
it's been put out there that like,

3085
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,840
so the left, like the democratic debates

3086
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,320
are really far left in what most people are into

3087
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,800
and like, that's fine.

3088
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,000
That's their values or whatnot,

3089
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,160
but like in a general election,

3090
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:06,400
won't they be like too far left overall to win back?

3091
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,500
Like, you know, the actual general election

3092
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,160
from somebody like Trump,

3093
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,640
who's obviously gonna be the other side.

3094
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,540
I mean, I know that the far left people hate Trump,

3095
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:18,240
but like, is this a winnable plan to just keep going left?

3096
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:20,360
And the idea of even staying at all centers

3097
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,280
seems to be so demonized,

3098
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:23,720
but isn't that like literally the way

3099
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:24,800
you appeal to more people?

3100
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,200
What you're saying, what you were saying is...

3101
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:29,600
I'm an idiot of politics, by the way.

3102
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:30,440
I know nothing.

3103
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:31,560
For the left, okay, okay.

3104
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,920
Well, you know, you're not the only person to say this,

3105
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,840
but it's very frustrating

3106
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,080
because basically what you're saying is,

3107
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,600
okay, if the left wants to win,

3108
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:41,640
if the right, if the left wants to do what it wants to do,

3109
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:45,280
it needs to concede and appease

3110
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:48,080
and give as much ground to the right as possible.

3111
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,120
I mean, negotiate, right?

3112
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:51,960
And that's, right, that's what Democrats do.

3113
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:54,920
They compromise, but we've compromised too much.

3114
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:58,120
And the result of that is like,

3115
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:02,760
centrist neoliberal shills like Hillary getting supported,

3116
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:07,400
like Biden, who will change nothing, accomplish nothing.

3117
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,600
Will they be better than Trump?

3118
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:12,400
Yeah, sure, but like, they won't do anything.

3119
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,800
And what we need is a fucking someone, you know,

3120
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:18,360
Bernie, for example, someone who's actually got,

3121
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,080
who wants to like fundamentally change stuff.

3122
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:22,800
Well, you know, Ben, I'm with you in the sense of like,

3123
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,640
having the kind of stagnation that results from that

3124
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,840
is probably good for no one

3125
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,720
and that it might just be straight up better.

3126
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:30,920
I'm a small government guy,

3127
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,440
so I'm not into most of these ideas,

3128
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:36,160
but like, but having them might actually be better

3129
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:37,920
than having the kind of half measures

3130
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,320
that seem to paralyze society somewhat.

3131
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:45,080
So yeah, I mean, maybe, I don't fucking know.

3132
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,600
I don't, I certainly don't like

3133
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,400
when everything's all like compromised

3134
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:51,040
and no one actually gets the actual plan.

3135
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,680
Vote, vote, vote Biden.

3136
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:55,240
Nothing will, nothing will fundamentally change.

3137
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,200
You know, sick, love it.

3138
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,160
That's a quote.

3139
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,040
He said, like he said, nothing will fundamentally change.

3140
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:04,560
You know, the, here's the problem with me and politics.

3141
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:07,840
It's that I'm very happy with my life

3142
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,200
and I don't need much to change such that

3143
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,560
I am not incentivized per, call me a selfish asshole,

3144
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,200
I guess, but I'm not incentivized to like look into

3145
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:21,040
what can be done to improve other people's lives

3146
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:23,600
because that will have no impact on my life.

3147
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:26,120
And as a result.

3148
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:28,840
That's one hell, that's one hell of a sound, right?

3149
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:29,800
You just gave me a name.

3150
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:30,800
I mean, what should I do?

3151
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,480
I mean, you know, it's hard to discern

3152
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:36,080
what like other people's lives being better

3153
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,640
will do to affect your life.

3154
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:39,840
Like you can assume it's just generally good,

3155
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,360
but there's nothing like immediately,

3156
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:44,360
you know, I understand that sentiment.

3157
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,080
I mean, I feel that a lot.

3158
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:49,040
Well, not specifically, but like,

3159
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:52,600
there's just sort of, ah, jeez, you know,

3160
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:55,560
I have to think about that.

3161
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:01,120
I just think it would be nice if, you know,

3162
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,560
we took care of our citizens.

3163
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,120
I just don't want the government to do anything.

3164
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,360
You know, you know, whatever.

3165
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,600
Yeah, I, I like.

3166
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:11,680
The problem for me is that the government has fucked up

3167
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,680
some people's lives.

3168
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,080
So it seems like it owes people something for that.

3169
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:17,800
But once we're square, can we just call this thing off

3170
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:20,160
and let, you know, things just run on their own?

3171
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:21,000
It'll be fine.

3172
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:21,960
We can't fucking call it off.

3173
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:22,840
It won't be fine.

3174
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,080
It's not fine.

3175
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,760
Well, no, it's not fine right now.

3176
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,840
Yeah, there's things that need to be made amended for.

3177
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,520
I agree, corporate, there's tons of problems

3178
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,360
with corporations.

3179
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,160
Yeah, that's, that's fair, that's fair.

3180
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,480
Seems like power's being consolidated.

3181
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:37,160
It sure, it sure is Nate.

3182
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:38,800
It sure is.

3183
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,320
Do you see that fucking wealth chart that I tweeted?

3184
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,880
It's, but, but the other issue is, I don't agree.

3185
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:45,200
Did you see that fucking chart?

3186
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:46,040
I did, I did.

3187
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:46,880
I did.

3188
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:47,720
Cool visual.

3189
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,560
Okay.

3190
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,720
I still stand by the belief that some people having

3191
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:53,880
more money than others is not a moral crime.

3192
02:00:55,720 --> 02:01:00,200
You, well, you mean power is a zero sum game, Nate.

3193
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,000
Okay, but this, this idea of power,

3194
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,680
like at what point will a company be so rich,

3195
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:07,840
it's allowed to just like take my house from under me

3196
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,240
and kick me onto the street.

3197
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:10,560
Cause if that's not going to happen,

3198
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,680
then I don't care how much money they have.

3199
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:17,160
But the, but the point is that the more they have,

3200
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,440
the less everyone else have.

3201
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,280
That's how power works.

3202
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,920
Okay. Well, you're talking about power.

3203
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:21,880
I'm talking about money.

3204
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:24,480
Yeah. And money, and money is power.

3205
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,120
Well, I mean, I'd be,

3206
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:28,160
I think you're doing an unfair conflation here.

3207
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,000
Like you're saying like,

3208
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,440
I'm not conflating money is power.

3209
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,640
Well, that, isn't that a conflation right there?

3210
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:35,120
No, not when it's true.

3211
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:37,440
Not when two things are the same.

3212
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,800
I mean, I, but I just established why I don't agree

3213
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,520
with that. So maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't agree.

3214
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,840
Yeah. I mean, no amount of money will let someone

3215
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,880
just like kill me.

3216
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,800
So until that happens, you know,

3217
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,120
I'm not really worried about it.

3218
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,400
So money, so money is not power then.

3219
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,560
Okay. Great. Point.

3220
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:57,080
Money can definitely help them like do it in a way

3221
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:58,360
that they don't get caught.

3222
02:01:58,360 --> 02:01:59,200
Like, okay.

3223
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:01,280
So they like, they bribed like the town commission

3224
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,280
such that like those people will, you know,

3225
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:04,640
they'll sign some forms and

3226
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,680
or they pay an assassin to do it sneaky,

3227
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:08,800
tweak some things so that they can, you know, like

3228
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:11,480
wheel their way in the system to like take my house

3229
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:12,320
or something like that.

3230
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,680
I mean, that's not, that's not a crazy thing to do.

3231
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:16,720
Who gives a, who gives a shit about your house?

3232
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:19,920
Is it money being power the entire point of lobbying?

3233
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:21,920
Right? Like, isn't that the whole point?

3234
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:22,760
It is.

3235
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:23,600
I mean, yeah.

3236
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,240
But the problem there is that they can lobby the government

3237
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,000
to do things that I'd rather the government

3238
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,600
couldn't do one way or another.

3239
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,760
Just get out of our lives.

3240
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,000
Like, like what?

3241
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,320
I mean, like how about like a company dumping waste?

3242
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:41,640
Well, you know, they'll, whatever the fuck it,

3243
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,240
they'll use money and the lobby

3244
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:45,640
to get like loose and environmental controls.

3245
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:46,960
Okay.

3246
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,800
So like that's the government like shifting their standards.

3247
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,840
That's money being power, right there.

3248
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:52,760
I mean, I don't know.

3249
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:55,440
I'm no fucking expert, but just like, can't.

3250
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:56,680
You don't have to be an expert.

3251
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:57,520
This isn't complicated.

3252
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,120
It's extremely complicated.

3253
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:01,360
And the way that you reduce it as like my point

3254
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,600
is obviously the right one.

3255
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,520
Anyone who thinks differently,

3256
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:06,640
obviously they're not making any sense at all.

3257
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,920
When I say that money is power,

3258
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:11,480
yeah, I think anyone that thinks differently obviously

3259
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:13,400
just doesn't know what they're fucking talking about.

3260
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,640
Well, like what do you think money is?

3261
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:17,200
Like what do you think money is?

3262
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:19,240
It's, you know, like, what's the word?

3263
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:23,160
Like leverage to be able to get people to do stuff.

3264
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:24,120
There you go.

3265
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:24,960
But the thing is, yeah,

3266
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,360
just have the power to say no

3267
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,680
when people ask you to make a transaction.

3268
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:32,160
I mean, I oppose the anyone being able to override

3269
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,680
one's right to choose things,

3270
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:35,920
because of my freedom.

3271
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,480
But I don't think that just having money

3272
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,800
to buy things that you want

3273
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,960
when people agree to the exchange

3274
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:45,040
is the beast that we need to contend with.

3275
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,040
Well, it is, I'm sorry.

3276
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,320
Well, I guess that's it.

3277
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,480
Maybe I could just be the ignorant one here

3278
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,520
and not know anything.

3279
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,760
That's definitely possible.

3280
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,880
But I don't know, this is what I think.

3281
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:57,400
Sure is.

3282
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,880
Okay, well, whatever.

3283
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,960
I mean, what do you expect from me?

3284
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,280
I'm not educated on this.

3285
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:04,680
Is that better, better?

3286
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,880
Question mark, question mark, question mark?

3287
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,600
I think you probably could be a good person

3288
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,440
if you put a little effort into it.

3289
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,160
Well, see, here's my focus.

3290
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:13,240
I mean, call me a bad person if you want.

3291
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:17,720
My focus is on being personally the best person I can be,

3292
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:20,760
building myself up so that I can do good for myself

3293
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:21,880
and the people around me

3294
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:24,040
and taking care of my immediate environment.

3295
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,080
If you wanna call that a bad person,

3296
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,320
that's your right, excuse me.

3297
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,400
But I mean, I would call that just, you know,

3298
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:32,600
doing the things that are more tangibly,

3299
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:33,920
you're able to control in your life

3300
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,440
to try to make the world a better place.

3301
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:39,120
But you're not talking about stuff that just affects you.

3302
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:43,520
Like, when you're talking about like society at large,

3303
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,040
so like we've moved beyond that.

3304
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:49,280
Like, yeah, I get it that you personally want to like,

3305
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:54,200
I don't know, you know, have a house, you know, have money.

3306
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,160
Like, I want those things too,

3307
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:58,240
because I need those things,

3308
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,160
because I need to want those things

3309
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,080
because that's the society we live in.

3310
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,360
Right? You need to want them?

3311
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,200
What do you mean?

3312
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,120
And I don't blame you for being like,

3313
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:08,760
I don't want there to be societal upheaval.

3314
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:12,360
I don't want there to be, you know, strife.

3315
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:14,480
I don't want there to be, you know,

3316
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:19,080
I don't wanna be taxed and, you know, be impoverished.

3317
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:23,280
That's all fine, makes sense.

3318
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:26,400
But then there's sit like, you know,

3319
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:30,360
in the broader scope of things, really, oh, small government.

3320
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:34,760
Well, small government means corporations run rampant, right?

3321
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:36,160
The smaller the government gets,

3322
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:39,880
the less checks we have on unrestrained capitalism,

3323
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,760
which caused the 2008 fucking financial crisis

3324
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:43,600
and subsequent recession.

3325
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:45,600
Well, look, I'm saying small, not zero.

3326
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,440
For example.

3327
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,240
I don't think that anarchy is the solution.

3328
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:51,040
I agree on that, but you know, I mean,

3329
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,240
it seems to me that like a lot of what we're doing

3330
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:56,520
is putting faulty, like the system itself

3331
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,840
is putting faulty incentives into place.

3332
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:02,360
And again, I have not studied this shit, but...

3333
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,480
What's a faulty incentive?

3334
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:04,320
What do you mean?

3335
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:08,920
Well, I don't know, like all the regulation on drug testing.

3336
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:11,480
I mean, I was just listening to something about how,

3337
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,760
regulations like they make, I get it.

3338
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:17,120
We don't wanna hurt people, sounds good, got it.

3339
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:20,080
The problem is when this like stagnates the development

3340
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:22,680
of new products and adds such overhead

3341
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,560
that the drugs are so expensive.

3342
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:26,400
I mean, this sounds like it's being counterproductive

3343
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,360
at a certain point.

3344
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:28,200
So what can we do?

3345
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:30,080
That's not why the drugs are expensive.

3346
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:31,000
The drugs are expensive

3347
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,120
because fucking big pharma is a monopoly.

3348
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,680
But there's multiple drug companies.

3349
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,880
So how's that a monopoly?

3350
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,480
Well, they have a, well, okay.

3351
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:42,440
Well, they're a polyopoly, okay?

3352
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:45,160
They're like, they might be multiple companies, right?

3353
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:46,600
But the point is that they are rich.

3354
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,040
They're a rich capitalist corporation.

3355
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:48,880
They have all the money.

3356
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,820
They lobby for policies that empower them.

3357
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:54,760
They have all the hands in the situation, right?

3358
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:59,720
It's not because like testing regulations are too strict.

3359
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,960
That's not why drugs are expensive.

3360
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:02,800
I mean, what I want.

3361
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,080
It's because they have the power to lobby

3362
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,600
for the ability to make them expensive.

3363
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:06,440
Man, we want the same.

3364
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:07,280
So they can make more money.

3365
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,120
It's not the same thing.

3366
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,640
We want more people.

3367
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:11,120
I mean, I assume this is what you want.

3368
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:13,520
More people to just be able to compete

3369
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:16,960
on a fair playing field with these guys.

3370
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,800
And I mean, I don't know what's involved

3371
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,120
in like making a drug and doing any of the testing

3372
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:25,600
or chemical production or whatever's involved with that.

3373
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:26,440
But like, I just-

3374
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:29,560
Life doesn't have to be a competition.

3375
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:30,400
Society doesn't have to be a competition.

3376
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,760
Oh, that's where I totally disagree.

3377
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,400
At last, we're at the true disagreement between us.

3378
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,040
This is where we totally disagree.

3379
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,000
Life will always be a competition,

3380
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,400
as far as I understand it.

3381
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:43,960
And I think it's naive to believe otherwise.

3382
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,760
The human desire is not infinite.

3383
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,600
Just it's fundamental to human nature.

3384
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,640
You would think, you would think that it's naive

3385
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,720
to think that things could be good.

3386
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:53,960
I mean, you're framing it that way.

3387
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:56,640
I'm framing you as being unrealistic about human nature.

3388
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:57,480
So who's right?

3389
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:00,040
I guess everyone has their own view on that.

3390
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,080
Okay.

3391
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,640
I'm depressed.

3392
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:04,480
Thanks for listening to T-Bap,

3393
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:07,040
two best brothers bitch about politics,

3394
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:10,840
the weekly podcast show here on The Procrastinators.

3395
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:12,680
I didn't want to have to do this.

3396
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:14,480
What can we do to not do this again?

3397
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:15,480
I would love to do that.

3398
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,680
You forced me.

3399
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:18,880
I forced you, but being ignorant.

3400
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:21,800
You always are one half of the conversation.

3401
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:23,960
You're like, oh, but guys, politics,

3402
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:25,440
like, oh, this is just terrible.

3403
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,600
How could this possibly happen?

3404
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:28,440
Munchy, put yourself in my shoes.

3405
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:30,800
If at any point I say, look, Ben,

3406
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,080
I don't want to talk about this.

3407
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,800
I look like the asshole.

3408
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,080
So what am I to do?

3409
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,160
What am I to do?

3410
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:37,800
Take the bullet for the benefit of the show.

3411
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,320
I don't know whether you look like the asshole.

3412
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:42,920
Just concede that I'm right instead of this whole,

3413
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:43,760
well, here's what I think.

3414
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:44,600
Oh, but I'm not an expert.

3415
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:45,920
You don't think you can see to any of this.

3416
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,240
Are you the expert, Ben?

3417
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:49,320
Here's why I disagree with you,

3418
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,320
even though I don't actually know anything about it.

3419
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,840
We just found out that we disagree

3420
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:53,800
on our fundamental approach.

3421
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,800
I think I know more than you do honestly.

3422
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:58,800
True, but we disagree on our fundamental approach.

3423
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

3424
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,600
I think I'm doing that because I am humble,

3425
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:03,560
whereas you are not.

3426
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:07,000
But we totally disagree on our fundamental premise

3427
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,200
of what human life even is.

3428
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:11,040
How could we ever agree on politics,

3429
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,160
knowing that that's different?

3430
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:15,000
This is like a microcosm of the problem

3431
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,720
with the country in general right now,

3432
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,840
is that the two parties don't agree on anything.

3433
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:22,880
They're operating on two fundamental different existences.

3434
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:24,960
The very building blocks,

3435
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:27,440
the foundation of society and life itself

3436
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,560
is no longer agreed upon by 50% of the country.

3437
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,520
Well, surely it's been this way before.

3438
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:36,360
I don't think that life has to be built around competition,

3439
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:39,160
but I'm not gonna argue too hard,

3440
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:42,880
and I will say that if we're gonna have a competition,

3441
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:45,960
yeah, I wish that it would be fair, but it's not.

3442
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,120
Like the deck is stacked in favor of those who are currently winning.

3443
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:51,960
Whoever's, okay, you say that,

3444
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,000
but everything you say works to the contrary of that,

3445
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,400
because the deck is stacked

3446
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:59,680
in the favor of those who are currently winning.

3447
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:02,440
And what someone who is like socialist might say is,

3448
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:05,560
well, we should stack the deck the other way

3449
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:09,680
because capitalism itself stacks the deck.

3450
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:13,400
So we gotta unstack the deck because that's just fair, right?

3451
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,480
Because that's fairness.

3452
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:18,400
I mean, is it fair to take the inheritance of a guy from his parents?

3453
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,280
And you say, yes, because he doesn't fucking deserve it.

3454
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:27,560
I mean, the thing is, no one deserves anything.

3455
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:29,080
Life just happens.

3456
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:32,000
And I don't want things to be...

3457
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,360
Life is fundamentally unfair, is my approach to it.

3458
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:41,280
No one deserves anything from square one.

3459
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,640
Like no one is born deserving anything,

3460
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:46,160
but when you're born into a society,

3461
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:49,720
you necessarily must participate in that society.

3462
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:52,680
And that society is generating wealth,

3463
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:55,920
like on the back of you and everyone else's labor

3464
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,880
that could provide for everyone.

3465
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,480
I don't think you deserve it just for being alive,

3466
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:03,880
but for your participation in that society,

3467
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:07,120
I think you deserve to be taken care of by that society

3468
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:09,320
that could do that for you.

3469
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:12,760
If the people who were in charge of it decided that's what they wanted to do.

3470
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:14,480
I just don't think it's their obligation to do so.

3471
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,480
I think everyone's got to carve out their own shit.

3472
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:20,960
They made them, they didn't make that money by themselves,

3473
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,040
but they get to keep it themselves.

3474
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,240
Like they personally own it.

3475
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:26,760
If you don't like the job, don't do the job.

3476
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:27,640
You're not making it else.

3477
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:28,920
It's not about that.

3478
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:31,680
All right, like the idea of inheritance and stuff,

3479
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:38,520
like if I had the choice to have grown up in a family with less money,

3480
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:41,680
I would not choose it because why would I?

3481
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:45,520
I understand that there's an inherent like,

3482
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:47,320
I don't want to give up this thing that I have.

3483
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:51,240
I don't want to live in a world where my children won't have the benefits

3484
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:54,840
that I can carve out for myself in the world.

3485
02:11:54,840 --> 02:12:01,400
But if everything was fair and the difference between the very rich

3486
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:06,080
and the very poor was a lot, it was a lot more equal.

3487
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:11,560
Being in a poorer family would not even be that bad.

3488
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:15,600
I think is what like the ideal is where even if you're not,

3489
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:19,520
if you're not given like a huge inheritance or if you didn't grow,

3490
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:23,200
you didn't get born into the the correct big wealthy family.

3491
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,720
If you got born into like the average family,

3492
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:30,800
the average family would still be, you know, way better than it currently is.

3493
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,800
And therefore it would be fine to not have inheritance

3494
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:36,040
because you'd still be OK average.

3495
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:40,240
We don't need to take down the top to raise the bottom.

3496
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,200
We should be raising the wealth floor.

3497
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,800
We don't have to necessarily stifle the wealth ceiling

3498
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:51,440
because if wealth become a lot of the things that we all use

3499
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:54,240
in a capitalist system is like done in the pursuit of profit

3500
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:57,680
and that is fucked up and bad and wrong because it can lead to a lot

3501
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:00,480
of like terrible decisions that are like tunnel vision.

3502
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:02,560
I mean, sometimes to that point, sure.

3503
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:10,160
But like if if if you if you have a situation

3504
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:13,560
where you no longer have any incentive to do anything,

3505
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:16,520
like a lot of people are just not going to do things, you know,

3506
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:20,360
it just it just doesn't seem to make sense to me.

3507
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:23,080
And that's when the society becomes burdened by those people

3508
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,920
and that is bad. That's not good.

3509
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,080
The that's what I fear about it.

3510
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:31,720
The video, the video that that chart that I tweeted came from,

3511
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:34,440
like my edited version of the chart that showed like,

3512
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:38,440
okay, in the video, that final column for the 1%

3513
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:41,480
that is like a million times higher, like it doesn't show the whole high.

3514
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:43,440
It like chops it up and makes like a block out of it.

3515
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:43,920
Yeah, yeah.

3516
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:46,160
And it's a little and it's a little less evocative, right?

3517
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:49,440
So I edited it to show that it actually is how tall it actually is

3518
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:50,560
on this bar graph.

3519
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:56,760
And it's like it's like 10 times as high as even like the 90th percentile

3520
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:00,920
or as the 99th, like the 100th percentile is like so much higher than even

3521
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:04,120
like the spike is like hugely exponential.

3522
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:09,760
But anyway, the point is like that video is a video on the wealth inequality

3523
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:14,760
in America and they polled people about like, what do they think the wealth

3524
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:17,720
like the wealth distribution looks like?

3525
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,880
And people drew sort of like a sort of a graph that like, you know,

3526
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,440
oh, there's it kind of levels down at the poor people.

3527
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,840
And then, you know, it starts to rise up in the middle class.

3528
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,600
And then at the rich, there's sort of like this, there's a big bump, right?

3529
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,240
So like this is like this is like maybe they're like five or ten time,

3530
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:35,960
you know, several times wealthier than the average like middle class,

3531
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,760
like maybe five times well, whatever.

3532
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:38,840
So there's a big bump.

3533
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:42,160
And then they asked, what do you think the wealth disparity should look like?

3534
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:47,040
And people drew another chart that was like, you know, more even didn't

3535
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:50,160
like the poor people were started out higher up, right?

3536
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:52,280
Even the poorest were not under the poverty line.

3537
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:54,000
It went up a little bit in the middle class.

3538
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,680
And then there was still a bump, but like a smaller bump, right?

3539
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:58,720
So there was a difference there in the distribution.

3540
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,400
And it turns out that the that was what people thought it was and

3541
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,240
what people thought it should be.

3542
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:11,280
And it turns out that the actual graph is as different from the reality as people

3543
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:16,680
think the as people think the reality is from their ideal.

3544
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:19,640
And then you see the three alongside themselves and like, you know,

3545
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:24,200
but from the ideal that people described, and then the bump gets bigger in the

3546
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:26,280
in what they think the reality is.

3547
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:29,400
And then the actual real reality is just this huge fucking

3548
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:33,600
asymptotical spike up towards infinity at the hundred percent.

3549
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,720
And the point is that basically everyone thinks that wealth should be

3550
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:43,000
more equitably distributed, like almost everybody thinks that.

3551
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:46,720
And people think that without even knowing that most people don't even

3552
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:51,400
realize the direness of how inequitably it is distributed.

3553
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:56,040
Did you know that currently the wealth distribution in America is less

3554
02:15:56,040 --> 02:16:01,120
equitable than in the days of fucking like Carnegie and Rockefeller, right?

3555
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:03,760
Like the fucking like post-industrial revolutions.

3556
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:04,200
Seems reasonable.

3557
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:05,640
Yeah, the days of the robber barons.

3558
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:07,280
It is worse than that now.

3559
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:08,600
It's a nightmare.

3560
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:10,360
We're living in hell.

3561
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,120
That's all makes sense.

3562
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:13,240
It's perfectly reasonable.

3563
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:17,600
But I just remain at the position of I don't think disparate disparate

3564
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:21,160
disparate desperateness or whatever in wealth is equivalent.

3565
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:24,600
Like I'm all for setting the rules that you finish that sentence.

3566
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:25,560
What is it not equivalent?

3567
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:30,760
It's not equivalent to a moral crime because let's set the rules so that

3568
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:34,640
you can't spend money on things that are like bad for the world or whatever.

3569
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:35,560
I'm all for that.

3570
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:41,400
But to just like to take the money that's that is produced by them.

3571
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:44,800
I mean, do I think that they necessarily deserve all of it?

3572
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:46,080
I'm sure that's not true.

3573
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:50,080
So let's identify the specific ways that ill gotten gains have been obtained.

3574
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:54,320
And let's take that, I guess, as like a crime that's been committed.

3575
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:58,760
I just have no interest in taking money from people who just who earned it

3576
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:01,120
legitimately by playing the rules.

3577
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:04,040
You just you just said they probably didn't earn it legitimately.

3578
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:05,560
You know, I said that I'm sure.

3579
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:06,560
Well, I'm not. Yeah.

3580
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:09,960
OK, I'm sure I'm sure that there has been some money gained illegitimately.

3581
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:13,160
But a lot of this would be on how you define illegitimately.

3582
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:14,360
I have a sneaking suspicion.

3583
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:15,920
Yes, we're not going to agree.

3584
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,360
We're not going to agree on that.

3585
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:20,800
So I'm not even going to have you not said you won that profit is theft

3586
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:24,080
in the past, because I think that right there shows our profit.

3587
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:25,880
Is exploitation. OK.

3588
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:29,280
Well, well, not always, but a lot.

3589
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:31,320
OK, look, let's leave that.

3590
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:33,120
Let me just ask you this.

3591
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:36,760
OK. In the days of the robber barons, right?

3592
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:38,960
Fucking I don't my history is muddled.

3593
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:42,160
But the point is like we had monopolies, we had robber barons,

3594
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:45,840
we had like huge wealth and equality, fucking like Teddy Roosevelt or whatever.

3595
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,760
You know, him and his brain trust, you know, past trust busting laws.

3596
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:52,120
They busted up the trusts and such.

3597
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:55,280
And and and, you know, they fucking do that now.

3598
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:59,800
And we, you know, yeah, OK, we should do that now.

3599
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:05,040
And, you know, the way that you do that is you have to have a power

3600
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:09,360
that is more powerful than these big corporations that can enforce that.

3601
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:12,680
And I know you love small government, in theory, I understand.

3602
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:17,560
But the only power on earth that could possibly do that is the government, right?

3603
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:20,160
And I agree. That's our only hope.

3604
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,040
There are certain functions the government should do.

3605
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:26,240
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Or I mean, or a violent people's revolt.

3606
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:29,200
I don't particularly want that, but that's another option.

3607
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:31,440
It is an option. Here's the problem with the government, right?

3608
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:36,240
Is that you the situation we're in right now that makes like corporate

3609
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:41,440
like control, like being able to like fight back against the issues

3610
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:46,120
you're talking about is that the government is a national power.

3611
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:48,240
Corporations are worldwide.

3612
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:51,440
So like we can make all the laws, put all the laws on the books that we want,

3613
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:54,640
saying like, Oh, Amazon, fuck you, you're paying taxes now.

3614
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:58,640
The loopholes are closed. We're breaking up Google, whatever.

3615
02:18:58,640 --> 02:19:02,400
Like the government can go in and try and make rules like that and make legislation.

3616
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:05,360
Google and Amazon will just leave. We'll just leave the country.

3617
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:08,840
They all they already operate internationally.

3618
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:10,600
It's already that's exactly my point.

3619
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:15,640
So like they have the resources clearly to to to to to get out of the

3620
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:17,480
jurisdiction of the United States law.

3621
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:20,360
So you would in order to actually solve this problem,

3622
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:22,480
you would have to have a one world government.

3623
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:25,240
And I know that's like the dream for a lot of people on the left.

3624
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:27,280
They want to get rid of the nation state.

3625
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:29,480
But that creates a lot of other problems.

3626
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:31,680
And this is where I think Nate is right in saying that like,

3627
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:34,920
this is an incredibly complicated issue because of the domino effect

3628
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:38,760
of changing these things when you're dealing with powers this massive

3629
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:43,840
and this able to get around what we feel like as normal people,

3630
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,480
like ironclad law, right?

3631
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:49,040
Like we are governed by US law.

3632
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,920
Corporations, not so much.

3633
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:54,560
They have the power and the ability to leave the United States entirely

3634
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:56,640
and no longer be bound by national law.

3635
02:19:57,240 --> 02:20:01,360
And Amazon is a it's a United States based corporation.

3636
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:05,040
Like if we said, you know, maybe Yang gets elected.

3637
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:06,960
We're like, OK, value added tax.

3638
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:10,080
There's a value added tax on Amazon's profits now.

3639
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:11,960
That's there's no loopholes for that.

3640
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:13,080
They have to pay it.

3641
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:16,520
And and Bezos says, well, in that case, I'm just going to leave.

3642
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:18,200
I mean, they can't just leave, right?

3643
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:20,800
That would be like maybe not treason.

3644
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:23,360
But it would be like that would be tax evasion and he would be

3645
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:25,400
an international fugitive if he did that.

3646
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:29,000
Don't I mean, I'm not an expert, but I don't know if that's the case.

3647
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:31,920
I would assume if you're running a business, you can relocate it.

3648
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:35,400
I mean, yeah, probably to pay.

3649
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:38,400
I mean, I didn't Trump put something like a thing where you have to pay

3650
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,880
if you're trying to leave your company from the US or something.

3651
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:44,880
Sure, I'm sure that fine would be inconsequential compared to the damage

3652
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:50,600
that that a radical restructuring of corporate law in the United States would entail.

3653
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:53,920
So I think a lot of people would probably pay that fee and leave if that was the case.

3654
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:55,720
Maybe. I mean, that's the same.

3655
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:58,560
That's the same issue we're talking about with like Amazon's new headquarters

3656
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:01,280
in New York was like a microcosm of what we're talking about, you know,

3657
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:06,280
but states instead of country, honestly, you know, I don't think it would be as simple

3658
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:11,280
as just oh, we impose a tax Amazon like like operating in the United States

3659
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:12,480
is still beneficial.

3660
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:15,000
Like, I don't think they would just up and leave.

3661
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,080
Well, it's beneficial even if they did with this new laws in place.

3662
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:22,520
Like someone's balancing the books.

3663
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,200
And at some point, if we tip the scale too much, of course, they're going to pack up and take off.

3664
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:29,200
But that that's just that's just appeasement.

3665
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:34,080
That's just saying, let the fucking OK, I'm sorry for my sorry for my evocative language

3666
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,880
that I'm sure people have a big problem with.

3667
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:40,520
That's just saying to the to the tyrant, the like go OK,

3668
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:43,360
we better just let you fucking have your way with us.

3669
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:46,240
Better just let you exploit us as much as you want.

3670
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:49,880
Because if we do anything about it, you'll you'll you'll you'll leave.

3671
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,840
You know, you'll fuck us over like you'll take your bowl.

3672
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:55,720
No, that's just not a tenable mode of operation.

3673
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:58,960
OK, I mean, I mean, no, I want I want there to be a reform.

3674
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:00,040
I get what you're saying.

3675
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:01,080
I get what you're saying.

3676
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:03,240
Probably it would be bad problem.

3677
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:08,640
I mean, would well, here's the thing with the United States even lose anything

3678
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:11,600
if Amazon fucked up because they don't even pay taxes.

3679
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:13,480
So like fuck leave them.

3680
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:15,000
Well, I don't think it's that simple.

3681
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,920
Surely there's some, you know, benefit to the economy.

3682
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:22,040
Here's like a simple question to this complex situation, right?

3683
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:27,720
Would you be more in favor of like a potential

3684
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:33,680
like domino effect catastrophe or like some some, you know, unforeseen bad consequences

3685
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:38,040
but also change or would you prefer stagnation?

3686
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,880
Um, like if there's a choice, like how much do you care?

3687
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:45,600
And like would you care that there's a change

3688
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:48,800
even if it may fuck things up?

3689
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:53,200
I mean, I guess we're assuming that this is like what we would consider a good change.

3690
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:55,640
Is this is this question for me specifically?

3691
02:22:56,080 --> 02:23:04,120
It's for anyone, like like that a lot of what these complicated complex things come down to is like

3692
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:11,160
do you care enough about potentially damaging other things that you may not

3693
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:15,280
be foreseeing to like upset the system?

3694
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:21,400
Or are you scared too scared to do any of that or not scared?

3695
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:25,920
But like you're too wary to change, you know, change anything for fear

3696
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,760
or fucking up something unforeseen?

3697
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,480
I mean, it depends.

3698
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:35,560
Like, I mean, depends how bad we're talking.

3699
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:39,440
You know, the point is that is that it's unforeseen and you're not sure exactly.

3700
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:42,920
Nobody, unless you're like a super genius, you'd never be able to have all the information

3701
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:44,320
and make the correct decision.

3702
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:48,600
At the moment, I would say, yeah, we better fucking shake things up now

3703
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:51,160
because things are bad and they're just getting worse.

3704
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:56,920
So, yeah, I mean, I guess if you if you handed me the dice and said,

3705
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:00,520
yeah, you feel unlucky, punk, yeah, I'd roll them.

3706
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:03,960
I think now is a good time to roll them because because, you know,

3707
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:08,200
the status quo is bad and getting better.

3708
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:11,840
So, yes, I think I'd change, please.

3709
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:17,080
Is the main bad thing that you're identifying change seems just more more.

3710
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:20,680
I mean, I guess interesting, but that's not a good reason.

3711
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:25,960
But like, sure, politics has been like the same old shit

3712
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:26,840
my entire life.

3713
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:31,960
I've never really noticed anything being like actually different.

3714
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:37,240
Like, Trump is the most recent thing that was like, whoa, what do you know?

3715
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:38,840
And yeah, it's very different.

3716
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:40,520
I suppose that's not.

3717
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,640
Brexit is also a thing.

3718
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:43,320
I don't really want Brexit to happen.

3719
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:44,360
I know it will be bad.

3720
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:47,400
But one part of me is like, that's different.

3721
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,480
I'd prefer different, honestly.

3722
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,920
I mean, yeah, I would also prefer good.

3723
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,080
Yeah.

3724
02:24:57,080 --> 02:25:00,040
For example, yeah, okay.

3725
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:02,280
Well, cool.

3726
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:04,600
Yeah, roll them.

3727
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:05,480
Roll them bones.

3728
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:12,920
Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't want a violent revolution, but if there was one

3729
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:18,920
and the result was, you know, student loan, debt forgiveness, universal health care

3730
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:22,120
at the cost of, I don't know, maybe some beheadings.

3731
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:25,000
I just straight up think that's probably worth it.

3732
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:28,280
I straight up think that's worth it because people because people actually die

3733
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:30,280
under like lack of Medicare right now.

3734
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:34,120
Revolutions don't go the way people say that they will fight.

3735
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:34,680
I mean, yeah.

3736
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:36,120
Oh, no, I'm posing.

3737
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:41,000
I'm posing the hypothetical scenario of there is a violent uprising and the only

3738
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,480
measurable consequences of that are student loan, debt forgiveness, universal health,

3739
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:46,520
single payer health care.

3740
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:48,440
Yeah, I would take that deal.

3741
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:53,800
Okay, but I need to leave right now.

3742
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:54,520
Highly specific.

3743
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:57,720
Unfortunately, I need to leave right now.

3744
02:25:57,720 --> 02:26:03,960
I did not expect this podcast to go on for two hours and 35 minutes before voicemails.

3745
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:05,640
Yeah, it's a long ass episode.

3746
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:06,200
Oh, God.

3747
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:09,320
Okay, yes, understandable.

3748
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:13,080
Sorry, happy birthday, you fuck.

3749
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:15,240
Yeah, oh, it's my birthday.

3750
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,360
I don't know whether I mentioned that.

3751
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:17,400
No, I don't think so.

3752
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,840
Happy birthday, you jerk.

3753
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:24,840
I'm 26, I'm like just a boring number.

3754
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:29,960
It's the one year anniversary of you being able to rent a car without paying an additional

3755
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:32,440
young driver's fee in the United States.

3756
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:38,840
All right, see you later.

3757
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,560
Later.

3758
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:41,080
Should we just do the voicemails now?

3759
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:47,320
Unless anyone's got any more to say about all of that.

3760
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:49,320
We could go on for hours, honestly.

3761
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:53,400
I gotta tell you, not only do I not have anything more to say right now,

3762
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:59,880
it's that I'm so, I so wish we didn't do these things because everyone's so bored by them.

3763
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:04,040
You sure argue pretty fervently for someone who has nothing to say about it.

3764
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:05,160
It's not that I have nothing to say.

3765
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:09,080
It's that I am so aware that no one wants to hear what I have to say.

3766
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:10,600
That's what I'm sensing.

3767
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:13,000
I think the, I would say that the audience is split.

3768
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,080
T-Baboo politics literally went.

3769
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:18,440
Literally went, Nate.

3770
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:21,640
I gotta tell you, Ben, I just straight up don't,

3771
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:25,800
I don't want that to exist is my main concern.

3772
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:26,760
Just do it yourself, man.

3773
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:27,720
Just get whoever you want.

3774
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:30,680
That's just another, that's just one more,

3775
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:36,280
that's one more fundamental difference in our worldviews that will probably never be reconciled

3776
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:39,560
is the desire for two best brothers bitch about politics to exist.

3777
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:40,280
I think you're right.

3778
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,560
I think that is very true.

3779
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:45,800
Uh, you know, I will say on the subject,

3780
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:50,920
it's just that, I mean, maybe I'm just a coward and I'm too complacent,

3781
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:55,480
but frankly, I just don't want to fuck up my life by discussing politics

3782
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:59,320
and things I have no idea about and don't even have the interest to learn about.

3783
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:02,440
Well, you've sure done a great job of doing exactly that.

3784
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,880
Like, why do you, you'll fucking fight me on these things and then you'll be like,

3785
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:09,240
oh, but I don't know what I'm talking about.

3786
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:11,480
I just think, and then you'll fight some more about it.

3787
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:15,240
I mean, everything I say, everything I say, I believe,

3788
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:19,640
I just don't think anyone, like whatever, they care about my opinion.

3789
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:21,800
They shouldn't though, because I'm uneducated.

3790
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:24,200
This is just like my life assessments.

3791
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:26,040
I have not studied any of this.

3792
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:28,760
I listen to people who know more sometimes

3793
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:30,600
and they think different than me.

3794
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:31,640
Maybe they're right.

3795
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,120
I don't know.

3796
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:35,880
Why would my opinion has no value in politics?

3797
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:40,600
So I'm just aware that I'm just wasting everybody's time with my discussion about it.

3798
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:42,440
So I believe everything I say.

3799
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:43,960
I just think that no one should care.

3800
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:49,160
And I'm really not trying to make myself sound cool or anything like that.

3801
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:52,920
It's just that I am ignorant and that's unfortunate.

3802
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:56,120
I mean, I guess listen to Ben since he claims to know more.

3803
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:57,720
I mean, take his word for it.

3804
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:01,880
I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I think I know some things

3805
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:05,800
and they have led me to some pretty strong opinions about some things.

3806
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:10,200
I want to say in the record that even though in the past

3807
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:16,120
and even still now, I don't want to make it seem like I've been a real vocal opponent

3808
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:18,440
to the idea of politics being presented.

3809
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:19,960
Because frankly, I think that's pretty annoying.

3810
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:24,440
Ben, if you remember the last PCP, when I just brought up something

3811
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:28,680
that was tangentially related to politics, everyone started groaning in chat,

3812
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:32,200
which I thought was pretty immature and lame and dumb.

3813
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,080
Was I on that one?

3814
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:34,200
Dude, can you blame them?

3815
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:37,320
We've been inundating them with our politics talk for months now.

3816
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,120
Of course.

3817
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,600
You mean the audience started groaning?

3818
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:40,760
Yeah.

3819
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:41,720
Wait, who started groaning?

3820
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:42,120
The audience?

3821
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:42,520
Yeah.

3822
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:43,160
Yeah, fuck them.

3823
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:44,040
Fuck the audience.

3824
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:46,440
I emphasize with that.

3825
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:47,240
I understand.

3826
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:54,760
But I do just want to say that Ben, you've actually been pretty good this time actually.

3827
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:57,080
You were pretty eloquent.

3828
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:57,160
Smart?

3829
02:29:57,160 --> 02:29:57,880
Yeah, you were.

3830
02:29:57,880 --> 02:29:58,600
Eloquent?

3831
02:29:58,600 --> 02:29:58,920
You were.

3832
02:29:58,920 --> 02:29:59,400
You know what?

3833
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:04,760
I feel like in the past, I have sometimes not gotten my point across adequately.

3834
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:06,440
I don't really feel like that this time.

3835
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:09,160
At the very least, I feel like I said everything I needed to say

3836
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:10,760
and made all the points I wanted to make.

3837
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:16,040
I feel like you got into actual specifics and you actually argued your point.

3838
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:25,080
You know, maybe early in this year, in the 2016, lead up to 2020 primaries,

3839
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:27,080
I'm like, I don't want to repeat it last time.

3840
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:30,760
I don't want to go down another year that I didn't vote in the primaries.

3841
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:34,680
I started thinking about all this stuff and I started getting into it.

3842
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:38,760
I feel like I have grown in my understanding quite a bit.

3843
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:43,720
I started out with some vague notions of what I thought was right and probably just.

3844
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:50,600
I've looked into it more and I have more facts and logic to own people with now.

3845
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:53,080
I am a political history nerd.

3846
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:59,800
I love the idea of orators and I love the ideas of intrigue and debate.

3847
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,720
They're extremely romantic to me.

3848
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:05,080
And I've always really highly valued them.

3849
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:09,160
The reason why I would be annoyed with the PCP of Discussed Politics

3850
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:14,920
is because it felt like people very vehemently like arguing things that they know nothing about

3851
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:17,640
and that have went very little thought into them.

3852
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:20,440
And so that's why I would get annoyed.

3853
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:26,760
But I feel like, you know what, Ben, you at least understand what you're saying.

3854
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:31,080
You have reasons to believe them and you know, I'm curious.

3855
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:35,320
How much time do you guys devote to politics on RFCK?

3856
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:37,720
Basically zero.

3857
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:39,800
Why can't that be this?

3858
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,240
Why can't that be here?

3859
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:46,440
Why don't you put all your politics in RFCK?

3860
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:47,320
That sounds great.

3861
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:52,040
I have no wish to argue politics or to discuss them.

3862
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:54,760
Nate, you are the half of this.

3863
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:56,840
I don't understand what you don't understand about this.

3864
02:31:56,920 --> 02:32:01,640
You are the essential component that makes politics happen on the PCP.

3865
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:04,040
This is like that moment at the end of Fight Club.

3866
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:04,760
You're right.

3867
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:07,400
I am the name of that.

3868
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:08,600
I am Tyler Durden.

3869
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:09,320
Tyler Durden.

3870
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:14,200
I need to kill myself to remove me from the situation so this never ever happens again.

3871
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,720
I think politics are intriguing.

3872
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:19,640
I do not think they're an inherent evil.

3873
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:22,600
I think they are oftentimes annoying on this show.

3874
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:26,680
I think they're I think that politics are a big opiate for the masses

3875
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:30,200
as a distraction from actually fixing their lives in meaningful ways.

3876
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:32,040
This is how I view politics.

3877
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:33,080
Yeah, that's right.

3878
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,280
We can all jack our dicks about like, oh my god, this tax policy.

3879
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:41,240
Meanwhile, you should go fucking, I don't know, pick up a second shift

3880
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:43,960
so you can pay for your daughter's fucking college or something.

3881
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:47,880
As if taxes don't affect what you're able to pay for.

3882
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:53,480
Too bad you'll need to work 36 hours a day in order to actually do that

3883
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:55,720
because the minimum wage is only like $10.

3884
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:57,800
Why would you ever think that the minimum wage

3885
02:32:57,800 --> 02:32:59,800
should be what you should earn to support a family?

3886
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:01,560
What?

3887
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:05,480
That's like that's that's the entry level on baby level.

3888
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:08,840
Some people some people don't have like degrees.

3889
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:11,720
Well, that's you can get a good deep better job without a degree.

3890
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:15,560
Well, okay, not everyone.

3891
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:19,720
Some people are going to have to work minimum wage jobs, right?

3892
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:23,080
Well, I they should work out of it eventually.

3893
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:26,040
Not everyone can work out of it.

3894
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,880
I mean, I'm sure that's true.

3895
02:33:27,880 --> 02:33:28,920
I'm sure that's true.

3896
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:35,320
Well, I hope they live their life realistically then, I guess.

3897
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:38,360
Yeah, fuck college.

3898
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,160
I mean, I agree.

3899
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:41,880
I'm colleges for people who are going to do something useful with it,

3900
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:43,160
not just waste a bunch of money.

3901
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:45,560
Well, sure.

3902
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:50,200
Munchy, you're my best friend.

3903
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:56,120
I mean, you know, I feel like you you earned it this time.

3904
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:56,760
And you know what?

3905
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,720
And you know what, Ben?

3906
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:00,520
I want you to appreciate because I do not say that lightly.

3907
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:02,040
Thank you.

3908
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:06,600
Because I well, you know, you know, you annoy me all the time every day.

3909
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:07,240
And you know what?

3910
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:09,480
You didn't annoy me even a little bit this time.

3911
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:12,680
The constant crunching of my unsalted cashews,

3912
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:15,160
just just grinding of my teeth keeps you up at night.

3913
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:18,120
I know, you know, I know people have complained about in the comments

3914
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:21,240
like us talking about this and not knowing what we're talking about.

3915
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:25,560
I'd like to think that those are, for me personally, those are growing pains

3916
02:34:25,560 --> 02:34:30,200
in which I was still trying to like hash out, you know, knowledge.

3917
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:31,800
I'm getting there.

3918
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:33,160
I don't think it's necessary.

3919
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:34,280
I'm getting there.

3920
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:40,360
I don't think it's necessary that everything you say align with my or everyone else's opinion.

3921
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:45,480
I think the only thing that matters in debates like this are the fact that you are eloquent

3922
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:47,800
and explain yourself in a reasonable sort of way.

3923
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:54,200
You still are extremely vitriolic and angry and mean for no reason,

3924
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:55,160
which is something to work on.

3925
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:55,960
But you know what?

3926
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:58,040
That's, that will work out.

3927
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:59,720
Yes, yes.

3928
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:00,520
Okay.

3929
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:00,920
All right.

3930
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:04,280
We don't have to thank you for patting me on the back, but let's let's end it.

3931
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:05,080
Should we?

3932
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:06,360
I don't know.

3933
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:06,920
Anything else?

3934
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:09,320
The voice, the voicemails are here.

3935
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:11,720
And Nate, I believe you said that these are terrible.

3936
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:14,040
So we do you want to do them?

3937
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:17,160
No, no, well, well, I said that the, as I was going through them,

3938
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:19,000
the, everyone be, please be advised.

3939
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,760
The selection of voicemails was, was particularly bad this time.

3940
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:25,000
There was like, you know, you know who you are.

3941
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,560
If you left a voicemail, it was like kind of okay.

3942
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:29,480
I'm not playing it for a reason.

3943
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:31,480
So just be aware of that.

3944
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:34,040
You know, I was, I was questioning myself.

3945
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:36,280
I was thinking, am I like in a bad mood?

3946
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:39,640
Is there something wrong with me that like I'm enjoying these less than normal?

3947
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:41,560
I don't think so.

3948
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:42,840
I think it's you, not me.

3949
02:35:43,560 --> 02:35:45,480
Humble, humble voicemail callers.

3950
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:50,200
It's like that, it's like that meme of Skinner being like, hmm, is it,

3951
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:51,240
could I be out of touch?

3952
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,400
No, it's the voicemails.

3953
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:56,760
The difference being in that the joke was that he was wrong about that,

3954
02:35:56,760 --> 02:36:00,040
but I'm right about this is my, is my confusion.

3955
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:03,160
No, yeah, no, I'm sure the voicemails are terrible.

3956
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:08,040
And listen, people, look, nobody, nothing was like offensively bad or terrible,

3957
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:10,600
but like some people you went on way too long.

3958
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:14,600
You, I don't know, I'm doing this for your benefit.

3959
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:17,240
Speak, pipe, listener, people, so that you will get on.

3960
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:20,520
It was too long and boring and didn't get to the point.

3961
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:24,040
It was like overly personal and not in an interesting way.

3962
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:26,360
And we have personal stuff on here that was entertaining.

3963
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:29,160
So juxtapose this to your voicemail.

3964
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:33,880
I don't know, like it just, just a lack of entertainment value was the main thing.

3965
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:35,560
So I'm not trying to berate anybody.

3966
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:39,240
I'm simply giving you feedback on why you didn't get in so that you can improve in

3967
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:42,920
the future if you care to be on, of which you don't have to be, you owe us nothing.

3968
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:44,120
So there you go.

3969
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:45,800
That's, that's it.

3970
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:49,960
Let's, let's go to the first one though, because like I have four that were, you know,

3971
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:50,840
they were okay.

3972
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,040
They were okay.

3973
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:54,280
Let's, let's, you know what, this one sucked.

3974
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:55,400
I'm skipping this one actually.

3975
02:36:55,400 --> 02:36:56,280
Let's go to the next one.

3976
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:00,040
We're down to three.

3977
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:01,480
I can't wait.

3978
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:02,680
All right.

3979
02:37:02,680 --> 02:37:05,080
This is from a bus ride Tony.

3980
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:07,560
Let's, let's hear what bus ride Tony has to say.

3981
02:37:07,560 --> 02:37:08,360
Oh, yes.

3982
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:08,840
Okay.

3983
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:09,240
Go.

3984
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:10,200
I know that name.

3985
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:10,840
Where do I do that?

3986
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:11,240
Hello.

3987
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:14,600
I am bus ride Tony.

3988
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:15,720
Oh God.

3989
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:21,880
And after 92 years, I'm finally a teenager.

3990
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:22,600
That's right.

3991
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:27,640
Today I turned 113 years old.

3992
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:30,040
He's keep like disappeared.

3993
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:30,680
That's how I know.

3994
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:37,160
Finally, finally submit my application to join the teen CP.

3995
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:39,480
Oh, of course.

3996
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:49,000
If you need to contact me, I look like a man who is always waiting for the bus,

3997
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,800
but there's never a bus stop near me.

3998
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,440
Is that Victor Victor?

3999
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:56,520
Goodbye.

4000
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:57,960
I don't wait my summons.

4001
02:37:58,600 --> 02:37:59,160
Oh my God.

4002
02:37:59,160 --> 02:37:59,800
Shut up.

4003
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:00,040
All right.

4004
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:01,640
But bus.

4005
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:01,880
Okay.

4006
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:05,400
First of all, please don't stop.

4007
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:11,560
But also why do, why does everyone call in to be on the teen CP on the teen CP?

4008
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:12,600
It's the new meme, dude.

4009
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:14,280
Because it's the wave of the future.

4010
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:14,680
Well, okay.

4011
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:17,240
Listen, the teen CP is objectively superior.

4012
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:18,920
Hashtag where's the teen CP?

4013
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:22,360
Maybe multiple are out already.

4014
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,000
Check them on my channel.

4015
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,440
I guess it's just another podcast.

4016
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:24,680
So wait.

4017
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:25,400
Nobody stops.

4018
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:28,040
So they're on Munchy wears tiny hats on YouTube.

4019
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:28,680
They're on your channel.

4020
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:29,640
That's where they are.

4021
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:30,600
Yes.

4022
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:34,040
Well, I don't know why you're like, you're like, don't even focus on that one detail.

4023
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:35,080
I actually did not know.

4024
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:35,400
Right?

4025
02:38:36,200 --> 02:38:36,680
What?

4026
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:37,160
I knew.

4027
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:39,720
I knew they were out and I did not know where they are.

4028
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:40,120
Okay.

4029
02:38:40,120 --> 02:38:45,960
Well, yeah, there are two episodes of the teen CP soon to be a third on my channel.

4030
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,280
You can go watch them.

4031
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:52,600
People really, really, really seem to resonate with them and are super excited about them,

4032
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:54,200
which I'm super excited about as well.

4033
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:55,080
It's pretty cool.

4034
02:38:55,080 --> 02:38:59,560
Well, the teen CP is a PCP meme, but it is its own show.

4035
02:38:59,560 --> 02:39:00,040
There's this.

4036
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:00,440
Oh, yeah.

4037
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:04,600
No, it's its own show for disgruntled PCP fans

4038
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:05,640
who are also teens.

4039
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:05,960
Indeed.

4040
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:06,680
AKA me.

4041
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:09,160
Such as our boy bus ride Tony or whatever the fuck his name was.

4042
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:09,960
No, no, no.

4043
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:10,600
He's not on.

4044
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:11,240
He wants to be on.

4045
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:11,800
What do you mean?

4046
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,160
I mean, he's eligible.

4047
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:13,320
Okay.

4048
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:18,920
Well, what's your what's your policy on Centenarian teen, Centine areas?

4049
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:24,680
Our policy is that we take everything on a case-by-case basis because we are Zoomers,

4050
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:28,360
AKA maximum nuance and there is no objective reality.

4051
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:29,960
So we will review him.

4052
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:32,920
Odds are that we will say get fucked and you're gay though.

4053
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:33,560
Okay.

4054
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:34,280
I am.

4055
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:36,120
I am, by the way, coining that term.

4056
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:40,360
If you are a Centenarian is a person who is over 100 years old.

4057
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:44,120
So if you are in your 110s, you are a Centine area.

4058
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:44,200
That's good.

4059
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:45,240
That is mine.

4060
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:46,840
I get royalties for that every time.

4061
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,720
There's a couple of those.

4062
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:49,240
A couple of people have lived that long.

4063
02:39:49,240 --> 02:39:52,040
I think the oldest person ever was 130 something.

4064
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:52,440
I don't know.

4065
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:52,840
Whatever.

4066
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:54,360
Yeah.

4067
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:59,000
No, there you know, there's like research that suggests that like this is depressing,

4068
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:03,320
but like like like like it's it's genetic.

4069
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:06,920
Like whether you will live to be like super old is like pretty much just genetic.

4070
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:07,320
Hmm.

4071
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:07,800
Okay.

4072
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:10,360
Like it runs in like it runs in families and stuff.

4073
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:13,080
No, that's a good thing because we've mapped the human genome.

4074
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:15,960
It's only a matter of time before you can genetically engineer immortality.

4075
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:16,760
We're getting there.

4076
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:17,080
We might.

4077
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:19,560
Well, it's a good thing for the next generation, but it sucks for me.

4078
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,600
Yeah, we're probably not going to make it.

4079
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:21,160
Maybe we will.

4080
02:40:21,160 --> 02:40:21,640
No, fuck off.

4081
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:22,280
We'll see.

4082
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:25,720
I'm optimistic.

4083
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:29,480
2027 is when Deus Ex brings in fucking robot bodies.

4084
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:31,000
So like we're we're getting close.

4085
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:31,800
We have seven more years.

4086
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:32,280
That's fair.

4087
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:33,080
That's fair.

4088
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:35,640
I'm I'm not even like my whole thing.

4089
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:37,960
I don't know if I said that this episode about how immortality.

4090
02:40:37,960 --> 02:40:42,680
I'm a little skeptical of it as a like as a viability for the human species,

4091
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:44,520
but it's a totally different ball game.

4092
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:47,960
If we've got like interstellar travel and like we've got colonies,

4093
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:50,360
like if you can just go be immortal elsewhere, that's fine.

4094
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:53,560
I'm worried about like clogging up earth with old people who should be dead,

4095
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:54,600
but it was just myself.

4096
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:55,560
You're immortal.

4097
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:58,200
Khan, you're banished to the moon for eternity.

4098
02:40:58,840 --> 02:40:59,640
The moon's all right.

4099
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:00,520
I take it.

4100
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:01,000
It's not bad.

4101
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Well, as long as I can kill myself,

4102
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,480
if I want to the moon, you know, the dumpster, I mean,

4103
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,720
for all of eternity on the moon, that's not that bad.

4104
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:12,440
If theoretically there would be stuff on the moon at some point,

4105
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:14,280
dude, it'd be it'd be like playing Minecraft.

4106
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,240
Exactly.

4107
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:16,440
Yeah, that sounds good.

4108
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:18,360
You could just you just make shit out of it.

4109
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:18,600
All right.

4110
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,480
Two more voicemails.

4111
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:21,160
So we got two more fucking long.

4112
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:21,720
I have a pizza.

4113
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:22,440
I need to go to pizza.

4114
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,640
This fucking pizza.

4115
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:23,960
Okay.

4116
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:24,600
All right.

4117
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:27,880
This this mail is from LMAO Lamau.

4118
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:29,880
Let's see what Lamau has for us.

4119
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:30,120
Go.

4120
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:32,600
Yo, what's up?

4121
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:33,160
PCP.

4122
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:35,640
What's up?

4123
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:39,560
Here to ask some relationship advice because that's been.

4124
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:40,120
Okay.

4125
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:40,360
Yeah.

4126
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:40,600
Really?

4127
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:41,160
Interesting.

4128
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:44,360
As much as we are politics experts.

4129
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:48,280
Basically what I'm wondering is I got this chick who's into me

4130
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,400
and she wants to like.

4131
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:50,440
Don't say chick.

4132
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:51,880
Date and stuff.

4133
02:41:51,880 --> 02:41:56,680
But I really want to because my life is like super busy with

4134
02:41:56,680 --> 02:42:02,280
like I'm just going into college now and like all that kind of

4135
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:06,200
stuff and so I don't even want to like deal with girls right now.

4136
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:16,440
So my question is how do I ditch this chick without like being a rude dude?

4137
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:18,360
Okay.

4138
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:19,480
All right.

4139
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:20,040
That's two.

4140
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:20,520
That's two.

4141
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:21,480
I've got the answer.

4142
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:22,760
It's a three word answer.

4143
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:25,640
These little phrase will serve you well in your life.

4144
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:27,880
Pump and dump my dude.

4145
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:29,320
This is the way you do it.

4146
02:42:29,320 --> 02:42:30,760
This is the way you should live your life.

4147
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:32,520
That's all there is to it.

4148
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:35,000
Before I said how do I ditch this chick.

4149
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:38,040
I thought I was just like oh you know like I just want to work on my craft you know.

4150
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:38,120
I know right.

4151
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:39,320
I just don't have to ever rush it.

4152
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:41,560
So how do I dump this fucking bitch in the gutter.

4153
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:42,680
This is a weird question.

4154
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:44,680
Well he said how does he do it.

4155
02:42:44,680 --> 02:42:46,440
I think he wants to do it in a nice way.

4156
02:42:46,440 --> 02:42:46,520
Yeah.

4157
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:48,120
He didn't want to look a nice way.

4158
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:51,480
He's literally just tell her what you told us in this voice.

4159
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:53,160
Just play this play this voicemail.

4160
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,320
Your reasoning isn't even mean.

4161
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:56,920
It's totally pragmatic.

4162
02:42:56,920 --> 02:43:01,880
I guess like a girl might feel bad that a guy isn't willing to displace his time

4163
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:03,240
on other things to make.

4164
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:04,520
I guess that is a negative thing.

4165
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:06,280
You're saying your time is more valuable.

4166
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:08,280
But just you know you can say I like you.

4167
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:10,360
You're nice but I got stuff to do.

4168
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:10,680
You know.

4169
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:17,240
Relationships are a relationship that you have to foster and you have to put time into.

4170
02:43:17,240 --> 02:43:20,840
I mean relationships are like a lot of work and just pure time.

4171
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:24,280
If you don't have that time then it just wouldn't be good for either of you.

4172
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:26,840
I mean the relationship would falter and it wouldn't be a good time.

4173
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:28,920
Honestly I think it's a mark.

4174
02:43:28,920 --> 02:43:31,560
I mean this guy says he's applying for college.

4175
02:43:31,560 --> 02:43:32,200
Yeah I think so.

4176
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:33,000
I think it's probably a mark.

4177
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:37,880
I think it's a mark of this person's maturity that they would consider that and be like well

4178
02:43:37,880 --> 02:43:41,560
you know our relationship will eat into my free time.

4179
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:42,840
Can I afford it right?

4180
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:44,120
Like to even ask that question.

4181
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:44,920
I suspect.

4182
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:47,880
You know you're thinking you're thinking you're thinking the right thing.

4183
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:52,360
Considering this guy and the life situation is that I suspect he's not that into her anyway.

4184
02:43:53,480 --> 02:43:54,920
So I mean that seems clear.

4185
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,120
So problem.

4186
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:57,240
What are you losing here dude?

4187
02:43:57,240 --> 02:44:01,080
I mean there's nothing wrong with a good old pump and dump every once in a while.

4188
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:02,440
So keep that in the back burner.

4189
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:02,520
Sure.

4190
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:03,240
If uh.

4191
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:06,680
But if she wants to know why you won't be her BF.

4192
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:09,560
Just tell her you're just tell her you're busy and you can't fucking.

4193
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:10,040
Yeah.

4194
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:10,440
I'm sorry.

4195
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:13,720
I mean that's really always the best like scenario.

4196
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:18,920
I think for basically like any situation like any relationship is just to be honest.

4197
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:19,400
Yeah.

4198
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:24,120
But don't be afraid to emotionally manipulate her to at least lose your hand holding virginity.

4199
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:25,320
I would definitely go for that.

4200
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:26,120
That's an easy one.

4201
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:27,320
Do that.

4202
02:44:28,280 --> 02:44:28,920
Aim for that.

4203
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:29,240
High bar.

4204
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:30,360
Gaslighting too.

4205
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:33,240
Gaslighting is definitely recommend gaslighting.

4206
02:44:33,240 --> 02:44:37,720
And don't be afraid to if she ever gives you a guff go in her face and make rapid hand motions.

4207
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:39,320
Go nightmare nightmare nightmare.

4208
02:44:39,320 --> 02:44:40,680
That's a good one for confusing.

4209
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:41,480
Love nightmares.

4210
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:42,360
All right.

4211
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:43,640
Next mail is okay.

4212
02:44:43,640 --> 02:44:46,680
This is our last one other barely passable one.

4213
02:44:46,680 --> 02:44:49,080
This is requiem for a meme.

4214
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:50,840
Let's hear what he has for us.

4215
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:51,000
Go.

4216
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:54,760
Actually didn't realize there was a 90 second.

4217
02:44:55,480 --> 02:44:58,600
Rule before I decided to send this little voice mail.

4218
02:44:58,600 --> 02:44:59,640
The equivalent of sorry.

4219
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:01,240
I haven't made a video in a while.

4220
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,560
Much longer and in detailed story.

4221
02:45:03,560 --> 02:45:04,840
You're wasting your 90 seconds.

4222
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:06,360
I'm wasting your 90 seconds.

4223
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:06,920
It's okay.

4224
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:11,400
One part which is my ex-girlfriend is absolutely insane and keeps harassing me.

4225
02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:13,080
I've blocked her on all social media.

4226
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:15,720
I've blocked all her friends on social media.

4227
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:19,400
But she keeps showing up to the place I work which is a movie theater.

4228
02:45:19,400 --> 02:45:23,960
She keeps showing up for no reason over and over again just to talk to me.

4229
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:25,480
She's got all her friends doing it.

4230
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:28,360
Her friends will show up and buy bottles of water.

4231
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:30,040
Just bottles of water and then leave.

4232
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:31,320
It's a movie theater I work at.

4233
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:36,840
She's apparently spreading rumors about me and how I've got like small penis.

4234
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:38,520
Which I can do whatever fit.

4235
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:41,320
And she's harassing me.

4236
02:45:41,320 --> 02:45:42,360
I am 18 years old.

4237
02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:43,800
This girl is 17 years old.

4238
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:46,280
She is dating a 22 year old opioid addict.

4239
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:47,480
Fucking.

4240
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:49,400
I don't know why.

4241
02:45:49,400 --> 02:45:51,480
What sort of time is he living?

4242
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:52,760
Requiem for a dream over here.

4243
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:55,240
You know it's quite a bit of drama.

4244
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:56,520
So tell me procrastinators.

4245
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:59,880
Because you know you guys seem to be geniuses when it comes to women.

4246
02:45:59,880 --> 02:46:00,680
Clearly women.

4247
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:01,160
Yeah that's us.

4248
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,560
I'm disputed kings of dealing with femininity.

4249
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:07,880
So please how do I handle this absolutely insane ex-girlfriend.

4250
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:10,040
Keep showing up at my work.

4251
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,760
Keeps you know adding me on social media.

4252
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:14,520
Trying to get her boyfriend to attack me.

4253
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:15,800
You know how do I deal with it.

4254
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:16,440
Oh no.

4255
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:17,560
Without shooting someone.

4256
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:18,360
He's like he's he's like.

4257
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:19,080
That's about where I am.

4258
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:19,320
Wait.

4259
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:20,680
He's like sweating right now.

4260
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:20,920
Okay.

4261
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:25,080
While he was recording that like he was being threatened at that very moment.

4262
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:27,880
That guy was like gunpoint that entire fucking voicemail.

4263
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:29,880
Is this a like is this a meme.

4264
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:32,360
Yeah it sounded so cartoonish.

4265
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,320
It must be a joke.

4266
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,000
It's it's I okay.

4267
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:36,520
I don't know because I don't really remember.

4268
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:40,040
But I think he might be describing the plot of Requiem for a dream.

4269
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:41,000
No no no.

4270
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:42,360
I've seen Requiem for a dream.

4271
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:44,280
It's just about a heroin addict.

4272
02:46:44,280 --> 02:46:47,320
There's no like stalker girlfriend in Requiem for a dream.

4273
02:46:47,320 --> 02:46:47,880
I don't think.

4274
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:48,760
Been a while.

4275
02:46:48,760 --> 02:46:49,560
Okay.

4276
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:51,880
I mean the way he's like laughing as he talks.

4277
02:46:51,880 --> 02:46:52,920
Like it doesn't really sound like.

4278
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:53,000
He's not laughing.

4279
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,680
He's scared for his life.

4280
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:57,960
He sounded like he could was barely on the breaking point.

4281
02:46:57,960 --> 02:46:59,560
It sounded like he was like walking somewhere.

4282
02:46:59,560 --> 02:46:59,960
And he's not.

4283
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:00,840
I mean this is kind of.

4284
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:02,040
This is a pretty silly.

4285
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:04,120
This is a pretty silly situation.

4286
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:06,360
I mean it's kind of it's hard to know how serious it is.

4287
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:09,480
I'm guessing based on his demeanor it's not like like life or death.

4288
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:11,240
But it could be just it's absolutely disturbing.

4289
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:13,240
It seems to me so fair and fair enough.

4290
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:15,560
Yeah yeah yeah it is it is a disturbing situation.

4291
02:47:15,560 --> 02:47:18,440
I could that's why it's to me it sounds like he's laughing.

4292
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:21,160
Okay let's just assume he's serious.

4293
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:22,360
If we just assume that it's serious.

4294
02:47:22,360 --> 02:47:26,920
Okay let's take it on good faith and answer it as though it is serious and maybe.

4295
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:29,000
I've never been in this situation but it seems pretty fucked up.

4296
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:33,720
Yeah this seems like very extreme to the point of like like you know like normal

4297
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:36,520
like reason doesn't seem like it has a place here.

4298
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:39,320
It's weird to me that he just slips in at the end.

4299
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:42,360
He just puts in at the end like oh yeah she said her boyfriend to like fight me.

4300
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,360
It's like whoa why isn't that front and center.

4301
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:45,480
Yeah that's pretty crazy.

4302
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:48,040
That seems like the that's that was the typical.

4303
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:48,840
Okay yeah.

4304
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:50,600
But like here's the thing here's the thing.

4305
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:54,840
The the new boyfriend's a fucking cuck if he's doing that.

4306
02:47:55,400 --> 02:48:00,520
If if if his girlfriend is like dude my ex is such a bitch go fight him.

4307
02:48:00,520 --> 02:48:03,880
I don't like to even think about the fact that girls I date use to have exes.

4308
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:07,400
I like to disassociate from my body and from that reality you know.

4309
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:09,480
Sure sure but imagine imagine.

4310
02:48:09,480 --> 02:48:11,240
Maybe it's even better to beat them up though.

4311
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:13,720
That's like how to win over the long term.

4312
02:48:14,680 --> 02:48:18,280
Imagine you're dating a girl and she's like my ex is such an asshole.

4313
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:19,240
Go fuck with him.

4314
02:48:19,240 --> 02:48:23,960
Like how much of a fucking Roger Roger that's that's big loser activity.

4315
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:26,520
But my ex was so abusive.

4316
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:27,320
He was so talky.

4317
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:29,080
Go fuck with him and his chubby little friend.

4318
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:30,520
Just make me pose very much.

4319
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:33,400
Yeah good idea.

4320
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:37,240
Okay well like I mean so okay well well he says he says attack.

4321
02:48:37,240 --> 02:48:38,520
What do you mean by attack?

4322
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:39,800
Do you mean like insult?

4323
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:41,080
Do you mean physically attacked?

4324
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:43,640
Do you mean I'm guessing physical intimidation.

4325
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:45,480
Is it criminal?

4326
02:48:45,480 --> 02:48:49,080
If it's criminal I think you could probably file for a restraining order.

4327
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:50,600
Just the general things he's talking about.

4328
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:53,480
Sounds like it's already grains for a restraining order against the girl.

4329
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:55,800
I mean this guy's probably never filed one.

4330
02:48:55,800 --> 02:48:58,680
Well her showing up to his place of work.

4331
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:01,560
Her friends coming to his place of work and buying water bottles.

4332
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:03,800
I don't know if that is like severe enough.

4333
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:04,280
It's hard to say.

4334
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:07,800
That you would need to that you could take legal action about it.

4335
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:12,040
And I mean like okay I get that it's probably stressful.

4336
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:13,400
But like who are they really hurting?

4337
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:16,120
They're just showing up and spending money at your place of business.

4338
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:17,000
Well they're talking to him.

4339
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,200
He's trying to talk to him.

4340
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,440
Okay about what?

4341
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:25,560
It sounded almost like they were trying to talk to him like to get him to get back with

4342
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:26,600
the girl at first.

4343
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:31,320
But then the thing about the boyfriend seems like a harassment campaign.

4344
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:36,520
The spreading rumors is a pretty vicious thing to do about like small dick whatever.

4345
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:42,120
I mean okay this is a man's area where a man has no...

4346
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:44,200
Like a man can't fight back on this battle.

4347
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:47,000
There's nothing you can do other than like get over it.

4348
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,880
Anything you do makes you look like you can say no I've got a huge dick.

4349
02:49:49,880 --> 02:49:51,320
You look like you have a small dick.

4350
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:52,280
You can I don't know.

4351
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:54,040
There's no way to win.

4352
02:49:54,040 --> 02:49:55,000
There's no way to win.

4353
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:01,480
So all you can do is try to get people to understand in whatever capacity that like this

4354
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:03,720
person is just coming from bad faith.

4355
02:50:03,720 --> 02:50:07,480
Like don't even specifically refute the claim because that just looks pathetic.

4356
02:50:07,480 --> 02:50:09,800
Just be like look this was my girlfriend.

4357
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:11,240
I dumped her or whatever.

4358
02:50:11,240 --> 02:50:16,120
She's just mad at me like nothing she says is real or serious assuming that's true.

4359
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:22,040
You know you know I mean this is a you know this is a this is a post breakup scenario.

4360
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:27,960
Like I think people kind of get that like there's can be bad blood there.

4361
02:50:27,960 --> 02:50:31,960
And like if one of the if people are talking shit about each other after they break up like

4362
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:36,200
that's normal and not like cause for alarm.

4363
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:37,720
That's true that's true.

4364
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:40,760
And I'm not saying like oh get over it.

4365
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:42,520
Like yeah I get how that would suck.

4366
02:50:42,520 --> 02:50:47,080
I'm just saying people will hear that and be like yeah shit talking to her ex.

4367
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:48,120
That's it to be expected.

4368
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:51,560
Yeah I personally I never take any of these claims of like small dick.

4369
02:50:51,560 --> 02:50:53,720
I don't think I've ever taken it seriously once in my life.

4370
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:55,800
And some of those people probably have small dicks.

4371
02:50:55,800 --> 02:51:00,280
But it's just like you know statistically it's a certainty it's a certainty.

4372
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:03,640
Statistically probably half of them are at or below the average.

4373
02:51:03,640 --> 02:51:04,440
Sounds about right.

4374
02:51:05,960 --> 02:51:09,240
Okay so on the on the one hand Ben's point is good to like

4375
02:51:09,240 --> 02:51:13,240
if these things are concerning you don't try like don't be overly concerned because

4376
02:51:13,240 --> 02:51:15,800
it's probably less bad than you're you're right Nate you're right.

4377
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:17,720
This is really this is out of your control.

4378
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:19,640
You can't control what she does.

4379
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:20,680
It's definitely true.

4380
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:23,560
But if she's like stalking him though but hey but take comfort.

4381
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:24,680
Take comfort in the fact.

4382
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:28,920
Yeah other people probably are just hearing this like yeah shit talking.

4383
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:31,480
That's I would say I don't know your circumstance exactly.

4384
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:36,600
But I would involve either my parents or possibly the police if you think it's at that level.

4385
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:41,000
It never hurts to just talk to the police and tell them your situation if you think it's fucked up.

4386
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,560
The worst thing they'll say is like sorry dude we can't help you.

4387
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:48,360
And like there's no shame in that if you feel either scared or you know like this is going

4388
02:51:48,360 --> 02:51:49,320
beyond what's reasonable.

4389
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:56,120
I feel like if you do talk to the police and like have a record that you did it like lays the

4390
02:51:56,120 --> 02:52:01,720
foundation later for like if some if something does happen and it is like a more serious like

4391
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:07,000
threat like makes it more credible like late in the future if you're like okay I filed a

4392
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,160
report before nothing happens and I'm filing more again just like repeat behavior.

4393
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:14,760
When they're sifting through like your bloodied remains on the side of the road you can rest

4394
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:18,840
assured that they will see that police paper trail and they'll be like we got a suspect.

4395
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:20,440
We got it under control.

4396
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:22,440
So that's you know yeah that'll be good.

4397
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:23,480
That'll be good to have.

4398
02:52:23,480 --> 02:52:25,720
That'll give you much comfort as she pulls out the knife.

4399
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:29,000
I guess the you know it's kind of unfortunate.

4400
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:34,680
I guess the only the only actionable thing here is if it's not that bad if it's not if

4401
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:38,360
they're not doing anything criminal try not to worry about it.

4402
02:52:38,360 --> 02:52:43,640
If they are go to the police yeah I mean it seems pretty obvious right right there's nothing

4403
02:52:43,640 --> 02:52:44,360
groundbreaking there.

4404
02:52:44,360 --> 02:52:48,120
I think the most useful thing we said is the reassurance that people don't take this that

4405
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:49,240
seriously anyway.

4406
02:52:49,240 --> 02:52:50,360
I think that'll be comforting.

4407
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:52,280
They definitely take it less seriously than you.

4408
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:53,400
Yeah that's for sure.

4409
02:52:54,120 --> 02:52:54,760
Guarantee.

4410
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:59,560
I think that we're all missing a vital component here is that we're all like trying to like

4411
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:05,160
make it so that we make the woman not want to come in like you know ruin his life as well.

4412
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:10,680
But we need to make it so that she doesn't want to and how can you convince someone to not

4413
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:12,120
fuck with another person.

4414
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:17,240
We'll get to show them that the person that might be the object of their hatred has friends

4415
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:22,840
in high places and what higher friends in higher places than the procrastiners podcast.

4416
02:53:23,080 --> 02:53:26,040
So I'd say buy some of our merch maybe just the I'm being cool.

4417
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:30,600
This guy's rolling with the best guy ever.

4418
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:33,640
That's the best advice I've heard all day god damn it.

4419
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:34,600
That's the way to do it.

4420
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:37,960
See you don't need big government to solve this problem for you.

4421
02:53:37,960 --> 02:53:41,240
You just need cold hard capitalism baby that's the way that's the way.

4422
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:45,560
The best revenge is living well so show them you're living the highlight with some teespring

4423
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:49,480
shirts from patreon.com slash the procrastinators or whatever.

4424
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:53,960
I feel bad for this guy but frankly by his demeanor it doesn't sound like it was that serious

4425
02:53:53,960 --> 02:53:56,520
so I'm not that worried about not having no idea.

4426
02:53:57,320 --> 02:53:57,960
We got no idea.

4427
02:53:57,960 --> 02:53:59,160
Let us know next week.

4428
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:01,240
I'm a little interested in this if this is worse or better.

4429
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:04,280
I guess this is why he was frustrated with the 90 second limit.

4430
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:06,840
There was clearly more nuance to the story.

4431
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:07,800
You know that's fair.

4432
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:08,280
That's fair.

4433
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:16,120
Isn't there always if people have messages that are good and are longer than 90 seconds I will

4434
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:17,960
there's been times when I will play a two-parter.

4435
02:54:17,960 --> 02:54:21,800
If it's good enough but it has to be good enough so you know keep that in mind.

4436
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:26,680
All right whatever he's got enough information from us talk to talk to people in your life.

4437
02:54:26,680 --> 02:54:27,960
Yeah you'll be fine you'll be fine.

Are you going with Si?

4447
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:18,280
Oh my god Si is not allowed on the premises.

4448
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:25,240
There's been a worldwide ban from Si at water park since the incident.

4449
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:28,520
That actually makes two of a snake because I also will have gone to a water park.
