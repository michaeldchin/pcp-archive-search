1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:20,400
Okay, I sure hope there's no spooky AI robot voices in here this week trying to steal our

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
jobs as podcasters.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,280
It sure would be bad if AI advanced to the point that they could just replace me with

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
a robot duplicate.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,560
Welcome to the Procrastinators Podcast.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Welcome.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,360
We're so soulful, we're so full of human.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Yeah.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,000
They'll never replace me.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,920
My work here is indispensable.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,880
I couldn't tell if you were trying to do an AI sound and voice.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
No.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,360
No, you're just dead inside.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
That's right.

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Oh man.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Well, that's not what I was going for either, but welcome to the Procrastinators Podcast.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,440
Welcome to the show.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,120
I don't think you're dead inside, Ben.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,600
There was just a joke.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh hell yeah, I love it when it's just a joke.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,320
Wait, I got, I put some real maple syrup on my oats today, so let's see how that goes.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,720
Is it true that maple syrup is the same name as the alcoholic version?

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,320
They just call it maple syrup.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,040
What's the alcoholic version?

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
I don't know.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Isn't there like an alcoholic maple syrup drink?

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,560
I don't know, probably.

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm sure you can make some kind of alcohol out of it, definitely.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,160
Maybe that was a Simpsons joke.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,200
Maybe that was just, I'm just remembering something that's fake.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,240
You can ferment anything if you put your mind to it.

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Even bones?

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
That'd be cool.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,740
Bone beer.

38
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,100
I mean, the giant and Jack in the Beanstalk said he was going to grind your bones to make

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
his bread.

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,220
That wouldn't make for a good bread.

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
Or would it?

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
No.

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,180
I think you could probably do it a little bit.

44
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,140
It would probably be, you know, you can replace the flour in baked goods with a little bit

45
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,060
of like bug flour, but just a little bit.

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,580
I think it's just like kind of like filler material.

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,740
Like it's technically edible, but it's not like food.

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Well, that bug protein, it is food.

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
It's probably better than ground bones.

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
It's just chalk.

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740
This is pretty good.

52
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
Bug beer.

53
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,740
This beer is made from fermented centipedes.

54
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,740
That's the future, probably.

55
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,740
I have some bug protein, but I've never really eaten it.

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
It doesn't smell super great.

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
It smells kind of neutral.

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,740
And I think I've said this before, but there's no like recipes for it.

59
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,740
You can use it as a substitute in some things, but there's not like, it doesn't like, it's

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
not like for anything.

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,740
It's not like good in anything that I'm aware of.

62
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,740
Nobody's like, ah, there's a really spectacular bug based dish you got to make, bro.

63
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,740
It's all like, we put fricking mealworms on a pizza and if you don't look at them, then

64
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,740
the pizza tastes normal.

65
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
It is.

66
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Hell yeah.

67
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,740
Interesting thing, like bugs, they're gross.

68
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
Are they inherently gross?

69
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Could there be a situation where people grow up thinking bugs are not gross and then they

70
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
could eat bugs?

71
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Yeah.

72
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
I think so.

73
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
I think you could get desensitized to it for sure.

74
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,740
It's always such a, what's the word, sensational sort of thing.

75
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Like, ew, bugs on a food.

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
You've got to be pulling my leg.

77
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:53,740
One time I went to a restaurant and I ordered a lobster and I guess the waitress that was

78
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,740
serving us was new there and she was so grossed out by the lobster that she could not deliver

79
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
it to our table.

80
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,740
She had to have somebody else do it for her.

81
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
They are basically huge bugs.

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
They are.

83
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
They are.

84
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
But I like them.

85
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
To eat.

86
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
They're big enough.

87
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,740
If you could serve like a giant caterpillar as like a steak.

88
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
They're pretty gross.

89
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
They're pretty gross.

90
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Yeah.

91
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,740
It would be a little more palatable than tiny little lots of them.

92
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,740
I think, no, that would freak me out.

93
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,740
I think big fat worms and caterpillars are like the most disgusting thing ever.

94
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,740
The bigger and fatter, the worse they are.

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Yeah, true.

96
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm just trying to think of like why is lobster not so bad?

97
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
Like shrimp.

98
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Even shrimp.

99
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
It is if you look at it.

100
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
No, I get it.

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,740
If you like look at the lobster, like with its like eyes, like its face, like ew.

102
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
Horrible.

103
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
But it's got such succulent meat.

104
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,740
Such tender flaky meat inside when you crack it open.

105
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
And crabs as well.

106
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,740
They got those beady little dots.

107
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,740
Yeah, but I've never eaten like a whole crab.

108
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
I don't think so either.

109
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,740
I think I've had a meal at a restaurant that had the crab shell off to the side and then

110
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
you could have the meat like a crab cake thing.

111
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,740
And I was like, oh God, that's what he was.

112
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Oh, I've eaten crab legs though.

113
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
I've eaten crab legs like out of the leg.

114
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,740
So that counts.

115
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Sorry if I'm like scraping into the microphone.

116
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,740
I'm scraping my, I have like a, my cup is too big and I got oats way down at the bottom of it.

117
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
And I got to extract them.

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Terrible.

119
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Delicious.

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,740
I did my first Fire Emblem stream yesterday.

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,740
I saw that.

122
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
I saw it.

123
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
I missed it for a while, but I caught the tail end of it.

124
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Yeah, it was good.

125
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
It was Fire Emblem.

126
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
And I wasn't fire.

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Was it fire, bro?

128
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,740
I would say it's fire.

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Hell yeah.

130
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,740
You move your little guys around and they do a little funny animation when they attack someone

131
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:14,740
and there's a lot of strategy involved in deciding where to put people so that when the enemy moves,

132
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,740
you don't guarantee death on your part.

133
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
It's great.

134
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,740
I was, I was shocked to learn that the first Fire Emblem was called like Fire Emblem,

135
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,740
the Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Glory or whatever.

136
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,740
The Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, yeah.

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Okay.

138
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Why does it have, why didn't they just call it Fire Emblem if it's the first game?

139
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
The first Final Fantasy was just called Final Fantasy.

140
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
That's so weird.

141
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,740
I don't know.

142
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
All of them have a name.

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,740
I think none of them technically have a number in the title.

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Like even the ones I call Fire Emblem 7, that's just called Fire Emblem because it was the first English one.

145
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
So they must have set out.

146
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,740
It had like a Japanese subtitle that wasn't translated.

147
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,740
And then it was Fire Emblem 8 was the Sacred Stones and that was just called the Sacred Stones.

148
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Oh.

149
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Hmm.

150
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,740
So the, so the first, okay well the first Fire Emblem didn't get ported to America or did it

151
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
or not to America, to the west.

152
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Okay.

153
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Yeah.

154
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,740
I know Japanese love their subtitles and it's why like Mega Man had all those like funny subtitles

155
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,740
to all their, that didn't get ported into English.

156
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
But I don't know.

157
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
The first Final Fantasy was just called Final Fantasy.

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,740
So it's like, it makes me think that they must have been like, this is going to be a series.

159
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Like as they were making it.

160
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,740
And like, and this is, this chapter will call it Shadow Dragon Blade of Light.

161
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
And next chapter will be something else.

162
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Uh, I guess so.

163
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,740
I mean, I don't know the, the story behind all these games.

164
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,740
I've learned that the second game Fire Emblem Gaiden is a like half remake of the first game,

165
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,740
but with like a chapter two, like you replay the story of the first game.

166
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
But then there's more.

167
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
It feels like.

168
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
There's more.

169
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Like how much are they going to change it?

170
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
It's all still on the NES.

171
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Hmm.

172
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Um, but yeah, I don't know.

173
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Are there many like, installments just intended to be one offs that have a subtitle?

174
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Because Final Fantasy, I remember hearing that that was like, the guy who made it was like, ah, this is my last try at making a video game.

175
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
This is my final fantasy.

176
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
And it was successful.

177
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,740
That's what they say.

178
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm trying to find my lighter.

179
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm going to light a candle.

180
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Because my laundry smells really bad right now, and I should really wash it.

181
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Are you finding your lighter to light your laundry on fire?

182
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,740
I'm going to light a scented candle to absorb this.

183
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
Oh, I missed that part.

184
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,740
No, I'm going to light, I'm going to find my lighter so I can.

185
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
Burn it all away?

186
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,740
No, so I can light up this blunt so I can get so high that I don't notice it anymore.

187
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
You see.

188
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Oh, I'm clever.

189
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Okay, no.

190
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
What the fuck?

191
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
One second.

192
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
One second.

193
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
A few moments later.

194
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Found it.

195
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,740
It was near my plug because it's one of those electric ones that you have to recharge.

196
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,740
So that's why it wasn't on the table where it was supposed to be.

197
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,740
I'm reading the thing about Fire Emblem.

198
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,740
I don't think I found an explanation for the title.

199
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,740
But apparently, it was conceived by designer writer Shou, Shouzu Kaga.

200
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,740
He wanted to combine the strategic elements of Intelligent Systems' previous simulation project, Famicom Wars,

201
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,740
with the story, characters, and world of a traditional RPG role-playing game influenced by Karey Software's First Queen.

202
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
So.

203
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
First Queen?

204
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Oh, that's the name of the game.

205
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Wow, it was also praised for featuring one of the first LGBT relationships in video games.

206
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,740
You're so-and-so's First Queen.

207
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
Yeah.

208
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,740
The game was not localized initially in America's result of homophobic backlash.

209
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Wow.

210
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Really?

211
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
The first Fire Emblem was?

212
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Yeah.

213
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
I'm skimming this.

214
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Who's gay in Fire Emblem?

215
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
How could they do this?

216
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,740
In the praised marriage scene with Roy, Prince of a neighboring kingdom.

217
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Roy?

218
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
I thought he was from a different game.

219
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Roy is homosexual all along?

220
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
Is Marth and Roy?

221
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
How could he do this to me?

222
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Wait.

223
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,740
So, Marth is the one who says Roy's our boy.

224
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,740
Roy's my boy.

225
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
That's probably what it is.

226
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Wait, actually?

227
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
I don't know.

228
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I'll find out when I play the game, I guess.

229
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,740
That would mean that Smash Bros. has gay lovers in it as well.

230
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Oh my goodness.

231
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
This changes everything.

232
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
It's probably not the same, Roy.

233
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,740
The Fire Emblem series is not, like, canonical to each other.

234
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
Why would they put more than one Roy?

235
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
I don't know.

236
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Maybe it's just like a little nobody side character.

237
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
He's a Prince of a neighboring kingdom.

238
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Maybe they just say, oh, he sucks dick for fun.

239
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Fire Emblem is not canon to each other?

240
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,740
No, they're all, like, different universes.

241
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
They have similar, like...

242
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
Oh, okay, like Final Fantasy I see.

243
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
Yeah, so, like, they all have the same sorts of magic and swords and stuff,

244
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
but, like, the continent is always different.

245
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,740
The name of the world, the name of the kingdoms.

246
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Yeah.

247
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Nothing parses over except for when they do fan service,

248
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,740
dimension hopping stuff to bring Marth back,

249
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,740
or some sort of Marth legend.

250
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Is it just for Marth?

251
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,740
It's usually just for Marth, like, in Fire Emblem Awakening.

252
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
I gotcha.

253
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,740
They remember, like, an ancient hero called Marth,

254
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,740
and I'm like, oh, okay, so this one is connected?

255
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
Maybe it's a different Marth.

256
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Well, it could be.

257
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
I think it's supposed to be the same.

258
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Maybe there's always, you know, in every different version,

259
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
there's always a Marth.

260
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,740
There's always a man, there's always a lighthouse, etc.

261
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,740
Okay, Fire Emblem.

262
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
What do you think? Good series, bad series?

263
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Judge it.

264
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Well, I'm going to play all the games,

265
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
and then I can say that for sure.

266
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Okay.

267
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
But I enjoy the ones I've played.

268
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
So, yeah, it's a good series.

269
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,740
It's fun doing strategy on a little battleground.

270
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,740
It looked, yeah, I was, I mean, I tuned in for a minute,

271
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,740
and I saw you moving into little dudes around,

272
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
and you ever play Advance Wars?

273
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Yes, it's very similar.

274
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Is it very similar?

275
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Okay.

276
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Well, very similar, just in terms of it being a grid-based

277
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,740
strategy, move your guys around the board, sort of thing.

278
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Move your guys around, and like, try and get them into

279
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,740
an advantageous position, or like, use the right guys

280
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,740
against the right other guys to maximize your damage

281
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
versus them and minimize your losses.

282
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Right.

283
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Yeah, except in Advance Wars, I think,

284
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I've only played one of them, and it was on DS,

285
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,740
so I don't know how it usually is, but like...

286
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
I think the first one was on the GBA,

287
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
so you might have played the sequel?

288
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Is there a sequel?

289
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
There's a few.

290
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Maybe they had a remake.

291
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
There's a bunch of Advance Wars games, but...

292
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Oh, okay.

293
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Your character is the commander,

294
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,740
and you're controlling a bunch of faceless soldiers,

295
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
so units, so you don't mind them dying,

296
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,740
as long as you can replace them and win the battle eventually.

297
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,740
But in Fire Emblem, every single unit is a unique person

298
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,740
with a character, and you don't want them to die

299
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,740
because of that, so it sort of incentivizes

300
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,740
not losing anybody, because once they've died,

301
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,740
they are no longer available, and if you lose too many people,

302
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,740
later chapters might become impossibly difficult.

303
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Indeed.

304
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
Indeed.

305
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
So I try not to lose anyone.

306
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I did lose one person before you arrived.

307
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
No!

308
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Because the first game seems a little more tough,

309
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
a little more like, you know...

310
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
A little more for hardcore gamers.

311
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
A little bit.

312
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,740
It's not that difficult yet, but there's a bunch of chapters to go, apparently.

313
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
It's okay, that's war.

314
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
That's war for you.

315
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
That's war for you, yeah.

316
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Fire Emblem, come to twitch.tv

317
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,740
slash give and take every Saturday for some period of time during the day,

318
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
and I'll be streaming Fire Emblem,

319
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,740
and I'll put the first one up on Gibbon Gaming on YouTube.

320
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,740
If you did, catch it.

321
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,740
I should stream again this week.

322
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
I should definitely do that.

323
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I did not stream for the last two or three weeks,

324
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,740
because I've been working on the book.

325
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Oh my God, I'm done.

326
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm done with the stupid book.

327
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,740
You're done?

328
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm sending...

329
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
I haven't done it yet,

330
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,740
but I'm gonna send the files to...

331
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
I'm gonna send the files to the printer today

332
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,740
for a test copy to get printed.

333
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,740
And then I can just leave that alone while they print it,

334
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
and then...

335
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Yeah.

336
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Hell yeah.

337
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
I know, it's incredible.

338
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,740
This is the first time I feel like I've actually made a stride

339
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,740
towards having it done in a long, long time.

340
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
What a fucking...

341
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
That's fog.

342
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,740
I know.

343
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
It's fire.

344
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
You know what?

345
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
You know what?

346
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
I'll send her the message right now, actually.

347
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Oh my God, live progress.

348
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Dear Mei Zeng at Guangzhou Hang Tong Packaging Products.

349
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,740
I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

350
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
Oh, this might actually take a minute.

351
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I don't actually want to do it.

352
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
I mean, I do, though, because...

353
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
Well, take a minute.

354
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
I'm gonna read the Fire Emblem Wiki

355
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
and see if I can figure out the name thing.

356
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
I see.

357
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
What time is it?

358
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,740
It's eight?

359
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Oh, it's like midnight there.

360
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Okay, never mind.

361
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
Right, right.

362
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Okay, you know what?

363
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,740
Actually, I'm not gonna send it until, like, this afternoon,

364
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,740
because then it'll be, like, midday...

365
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Tonight, it'll be, like, daytime Monday, on Monday,

366
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
when she gets it,

367
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
and that seems like the appropriate time

368
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
to send something like that.

369
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,740
So I won't send it right now.

370
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
But, yeah.

371
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
That's gonna be cool.

372
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,740
And then once it's off to the printer, I can...

373
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
I've been fucking around with a green screen in my room

374
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
trying to take, like, videos

375
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
and get the effect looking right,

376
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,740
and it's been a mixed success.

377
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,740
The effect I was going for, where, like, my teeth glow,

378
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
it actually works really well.

379
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Like, the teeth actually show up really well

380
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
under the blacklight.

381
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
It's just, like, kind of gross-looking,

382
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
and it's, like, almost, like, more gross

383
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,740
than I wanted it to look.

384
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Oh, no.

385
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Yeah.

386
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
I can kind of pair gross on camera.

387
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
It's a little...

388
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
I mean, whatever.

389
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
It's fine.

390
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,740
I'll just...

391
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
If I use the right filters and make it look intentional,

392
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
it'll be...

393
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Okay.

394
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
The effect mostly works.

395
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
I just have to make it, like, look...

396
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
I just have to compose a good shot

397
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,740
using it, I think, and then it'll be...

398
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,740
And then, you know, I can't actually film

399
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,740
the trailer until I have the book,

400
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
because the point is that I want to, like, have the book

401
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,740
and show the book off in the trailer, so...

402
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Um...

403
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Yeah, and then...

404
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,740
So that's done, so I can hopefully stream this week,

405
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
and...

406
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Oh, I can start working on Biscopades.

407
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Getting that...

408
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Yes.

409
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Getting that Perfect Comic Party content

410
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
rolling out.

411
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Yeah.

412
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Haven't touched that, but now it's time.

413
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Before we move on to talking about that...

414
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Oh.

415
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Yeah.

416
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Fire Emblem.

417
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
In early stages of the project,

418
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,740
it was called Battle Fantasy Fire Emblem,

419
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
and then in early advertising,

420
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
it was called Hono no Moncho,

421
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Emblem of Fire.

422
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
So I...

423
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
It doesn't explain why they decided

424
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
to call it Shadow Dragon.

425
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Did you know in Japan,

426
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Blade of Fire was called...

427
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Fire Emblem was called...

428
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Emblem of Fire.

429
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Wow.

430
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Listen.

431
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Yeah.

432
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
I love video games.

433
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
I love Japan, period.

434
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Yes.

435
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
And gaming.

436
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,740
True.

437
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,740
All right.

438
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Granted.

439
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Okay, so no information I can see

440
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,740
about why it's got a title,

441
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,740
but don't you think it's odd that the first one came out

442
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
with such a specific subtitle

443
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,740
as though it were part of a series?

444
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
I mean, maybe if I read more closely,

445
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
I can find out.

446
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
But yeah, it is a little weird.

447
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,740
Maybe it was some sort of marketing thing,

448
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,740
like, oh, it's not fantastical enough.

449
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
Put a dragon on there.

450
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
Yeah, dragon and a blade of...

451
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
Yeah, it is a very dramatic title.

452
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
Maybe that's...

453
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Maybe you just thought it was attention grabbing.

454
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Yeah, so perfect comic party.

455
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
Yeah.

456
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Clarissa Gunsmoke is coming along.

457
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Last week, I basically got to the end of chapter four

458
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,740
for line art, and then this coming week,

459
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,740
I'm gonna be doing shading and speech bubbles

460
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,740
and action lines and any extra little tweaks I need to do.

461
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,740
And hopefully, I can get most of it done next week.

462
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,740
I've got a system where I'm counting

463
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
how many pages I do per hour

464
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,740
and also how many hours I manage to focus per week.

465
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Mmm, that's good.

466
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,740
So I'm averaging, for line art at least,

467
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,740
0.48 pages per hour.

468
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
It's not too bad.

469
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,740
You can do a page in two hours?

470
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,740
It depends on the page.

471
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Yeah, it depends on the page.

472
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Obviously, it's just...

473
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,740
I want to keep gathering data for it

474
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,740
so that I have a more accurate average score.

475
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Yeah.

476
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
My...

477
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
I used to...

478
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
It depended on the page.

479
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,740
I think I remembered...

480
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
back when I was drawing the champion,

481
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,740
I think it would generally take me

482
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,740
around eight hours or so to draw a page of that.

483
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,740
And, you know, sometimes it took 10 or 12 on a tough one

484
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,740
and sometimes it would take four or six on a simple one.

485
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,740
And Phantom's Revenge was much less than...

486
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
not Phantom's Revenge,

487
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Slime and Punishment was generally much less than that by design.

488
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Okay, question.

489
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,740
How much Clarissa do you want to put in, say,

490
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
an issue of the perfect comic party?

491
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,740
Well, I've vaguely already...

492
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
since I did the sketching

493
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
and blocking out a while ago,

494
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
that was all like,

495
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,740
okay, roughly 20 pages per chapter.

496
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Some bit more, some bit less,

497
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
mostly a bit less.

498
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
So, yeah, 20 pages.

499
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
20...

500
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Okay.

501
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
20?

502
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
I mean, how...

503
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
All right.

504
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
I mean, how often...

505
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
Was this going to be...

506
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I thought we talked about making this like a weekly thing,

507
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
but like...

508
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Or do we talk about it being a monthly thing?

509
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
I don't think we decided ultimately.

510
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,740
I think weekly is a little too much.

511
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
Weekly seems like a lot, yeah.

512
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Yeah.

513
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Okay.

514
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
A monthly little thing could be good,

515
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
because that would give me plenty of time

516
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
to do an entire chapter

517
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
and then work on, like,

518
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,740
gathering the rest of the stuff for the comic

519
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
and putting it together.

520
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Yeah.

521
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
Okay.

522
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Okay.

523
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
I mean, do you think that, like,

524
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
would you want to keep doing, like,

525
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740
20 pages of Clarissa a month?

526
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
If I can.

527
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
If you think that, yeah.

528
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,740
I mean, I have, like, how many chapters?

529
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Four?

530
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Five more chapters?

531
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
I'm not entirely sure.

532
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
I should double check again.

533
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
But, yeah.

534
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
I mean...

535
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Okay.

536
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
Sometimes I might not have a chapter ready,

537
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,740
you know, just be...

538
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,740
We'll either have other stuff...

539
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
Yeah.

540
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Or...

541
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Or not have a...

542
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Just to skip it.

543
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
Yeah.

544
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Oh, yeah.

545
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Okay.

546
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,740
All right, sounds good.

547
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Well, like I said,

548
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I haven't even started working on

549
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
my Beescapades contribution.

550
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
You know, I have to...

551
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
I actually think I have to go back

552
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,740
and reread all of Beescapades,

553
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
because I know I had

554
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,740
a lot of ideas that were going on in that story,

555
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
and I remember, I think, most of the big ones,

556
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,740
but I think I had a bunch that I've probably forgotten,

557
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,740
and I should probably go back and read it

558
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,740
and remind myself, like,

559
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,740
oh, yeah, that was there.

560
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Like, oh, yeah, no, he was going to do this.

561
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,740
Yeah.

562
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,740
There were a lot of little details.

563
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,740
In the town, I remember there was a bunch of shops,

564
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
and I remember what some of them were,

565
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,740
and I think there's one or two

566
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
that I didn't see the inside of,

567
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,740
and I got to refresh myself on what's there.

568
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,740
Yeah, it's one of those things

569
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,740
with, like, larger stories

570
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,740
that keep, like, getting bigger.

571
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Beescapades.

572
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
Oh, no, no, go on.

573
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,740
There's, like, things in earlier parts of Clarissa,

574
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,740
and my notes that I want to, like,

575
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,740
sprinkle in to be a hint for future,

576
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
and there's also, like,

577
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
when I was doing A Lot of Ghosts,

578
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,740
there was a lot of, like, oh, I got to make sure, you know,

579
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,740
that it lines up with a canon story

580
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,740
because those characters are in there,

581
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,740
and RFCK and all that stuff.

582
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Like, the fact that there's a slime sea,

583
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,740
but then I'm also going across the ocean,

584
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,740
so it's like there's the slime seas, the Grand Canyon,

585
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
so there's also desert after that.

586
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,740
I had to pay attention.

587
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,740
My brother was telling me that there was a thing he did

588
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
where when he was thinking of a cool story,

589
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
he would try and write a wiki for it.

590
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
I'm thinking about the geography now

591
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,740
of, like, setting sail into the Grand Canyon

592
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,740
and crossing the sea to wind up in England.

593
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
It's just, like, long.

594
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
Yeah, it's very silly.

595
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
Yeah.

596
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,740
But yeah, like, writing a wiki

597
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,740
and having articles is really quite helpful

598
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,740
for your own, like, remembering of stuff.

599
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see.

600
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
I see.

601
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
I might end up doing that.

602
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Maybe it's just a personal, like, private wiki

603
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
or just a series of Google Docs that act like one.

604
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
Yeah.

605
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,740
Because it might have spoilers in it.

606
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
That's interesting.

607
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
Me and some friends a long time ago,

608
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,740
we did a creative, we tried to,

609
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
we started a creative exercise that was, like,

610
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,740
you start a wiki and then someone, like,

611
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,740
writes an article about a fantasy world

612
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,740
and then you add a couple hyperlinks to it

613
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,740
that don't link to anything,

614
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,740
but they're, like, very specific-sounding things.

615
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,740
And then you pass it off to the next person

616
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
and someone else picks one of those links

617
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
that don't link to anything,

618
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,740
and then they write the article about, like,

619
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
what was it?

620
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,740
You know what I mean?

621
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,740
Uh, yeah.

622
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,740
That sounds pretty good.

623
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
It was pretty, it was pretty cool.

624
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,740
We were sort of building,

625
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
for those short while we were doing it,

626
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,740
we were building a sort of, like,

627
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,740
it was a bit sort of final fantasy.

628
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,740
I would say it was sort of a Final Fantasy meets Mad Max.

629
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,740
It was, like, a desert apocalypse planet,

630
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,740
but there was sort of a, like, midgar city

631
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
that was, like, floating above, like,

632
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
the desolate, like, desert planet,

633
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,740
and there was a big, like,

634
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,740
Final Fantasy VII midgar-class disparity

635
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,740
of capitalist dystopia thing going on with that.

636
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,740
It was pretty neat.

637
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,740
I like the idea of, like, having an article

638
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,740
about, like, a, like, just some plant

639
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,740
that's an alien plant that only exists

640
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,740
in your, like, made-up world,

641
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,740
but there's, like, documents about it,

642
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,740
like, what it looks like.

643
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,740
I like the idea of filling out, like,

644
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
an encyclopedia like that,

645
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
but it's just a lot of work.

646
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,740
It's fun, though. I want to do that.

647
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,740
Um, I am planning to, and I should,

648
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,740
this is another thing that, you know,

649
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,740
it's not as high priority, maybe,

650
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,740
as, like, uh, Biscopades,

651
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,740
because that's, like,

652
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,740
I would consider that somewhat of an obligation

653
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,740
at this point that I got to do that,

654
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,740
but, uh, another thing that I want to do now

655
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,740
that the book is off to ship

656
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
and I don't have to think about it too hard for a while

657
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,740
is I want to prepare to run a little, like,

658
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,740
tabletop game.

659
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Um, I found one called Paranoia

660
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,740
that I thought sounded kind of weird and interesting,

661
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,740
and I want to run, maybe not a one-shot,

662
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,740
but, like, maybe a short, like, a couple of sessions

663
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,740
game of that.

664
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Uh, it was just something I haven't done in a long time,

665
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,740
was run a game of that sort.

666
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,740
Paranoia is, I almost think it's,

667
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,740
it sort of sounds like it's meant to be, like,

668
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,740
a parody almost of tabletop role-playing games,

669
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,740
but it's one of those parodies that, like,

670
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,740
internally takes itself seriously.

671
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,740
Like, it's not, like, it's not a comedy.

672
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,740
It's more like a commentary.

673
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
And you don't, you know what I mean?

674
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Am I making sense here?

675
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
Uh, what's the paranoia?

676
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Is it, like, you imagine there being monsters there?

677
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
No.

678
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Uh, the plot of Paranoia is basically that it takes place

679
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,740
in a, like, cyberpunk,

680
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
uh, sort of, like, techno future

681
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,740
where, like, everyone lives under

682
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,740
a, like, surveillance state

683
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,740
that is run by this, like, sort of all-seeing,

684
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,740
like, techno AI

685
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
controller program.

686
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,740
And basically, in Paranoia, you all,

687
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,740
the characters all play as

688
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
you're all, like, debuggers,

689
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
or whatever, for this

690
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,740
AI, which basically means you're, like, cops,

691
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
but you're, like, cybercops,

692
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,740
but some of you might be, like,

693
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
communist spies or something,

694
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,740
so the game is about,

695
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
I guess you do missions for the AI,

696
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,740
but also a goal in the game

697
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,740
is to, like, um,

698
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,740
credibly accuse your fellow players

699
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
and try to out them to the computer

700
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
as, like, communist spies

701
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
and get them executed

702
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,740
and, like, doing this is good for you,

703
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,740
but you want to prevent them from doing it to you,

704
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,740
so you sort of try to kill each other,

705
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
but also you've all got, like, backup clones

706
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
that, like, if you die, you have some backup clones

707
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
that you can come back as,

708
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
so you have, like, you have, like, multiple lives,

709
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,740
uh, in at the same time.

710
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Uh, there's, like, kind of a lot to it,

711
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
and I have only, sort of, briefly read through

712
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,740
the, um, the manual,

713
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
but I thought it sounded interesting,

714
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,740
so I'm gonna try and give that a shake pretty soon.

715
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,740
They, like, remade a bunch of newer additions for it.

716
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
I think it's from, like, the late 80s,

717
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
but I think they made a new addition

718
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,740
as recently as, like, the aughts.

719
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,740
So, like, that's weird.

720
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Mmm.

721
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,740
And that's the thing that I'm gonna do,

722
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
hopefully.

723
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Nice.

724
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Yeah.

725
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Heck.

726
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Heck, yeah.

727
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
Heck, yeah.

728
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
Dungeons or dragons.

729
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,740
Choose your poison.

730
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Neither.

731
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
Neither one.

732
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
Neither one.

733
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Computers.

734
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Instead of, they should have just called the game

735
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
Computers and Computers,

736
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
instead of Dungeons and Dragons.

737
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Numbers and...

738
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,740
and, uh...

739
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
Nimrods.

740
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,740
Did I already, did I already talk about the,

741
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
the word Nimrod?

742
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Did we, did we discuss the word Nimrod?

743
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
Yes.

744
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
Okay.

745
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Alright.

746
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Something, something it used to be a word.

747
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Bible.

748
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
The, yeah, Nim, yeah.

749
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,740
Bugs Bunny.

750
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Defeated the Bible, but actually it was Daffy Duck.

751
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Okay, okay, we've been over this.

752
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Uh...

753
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Yeah.

754
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,740
And it was, anyone who's a regular PCP listener

755
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,740
will already know the deep lore about Nimrod.

756
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

757
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,740
I had a...

758
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,740
Damn.

759
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,740
I must have had a dream where I had an idea for a video

760
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
I wanted to make.

761
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
A dream for an idea?

762
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
I don't...

763
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,740
Okay, as I said, I remember, I remember that when I talked

764
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
about Nimrod, I was like, what if I made a video

765
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
explaining that.

766
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

767
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,740
But now I say, I was just thinking that thought,

768
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,740
and I was like, oh, yeah, yesterday I had another idea

769
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
like that, that was like, hey, I know it's not a lecture,

770
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,740
but maybe I should make that as a video.

771
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Maybe that would be a good quick video to make.

772
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,740
But now I'm thinking about it, I can't think of the idea.

773
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,740
So either I forgot the idea, or I merely dreamed

774
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,740
that I had such an idea, and there was not actually

775
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,740
any idea like that.

776
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Oh, it's like that daydream Homer Simpson has.

777
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,740
It's like, I gotta think of something incredible,

778
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
an invention that will change the world,

779
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
and he has a dream about it.

780
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,740
He's like, Homer Simpson, you've done it.

781
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,740
This is the greatest invention the world has ever seen,

782
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
and Homer's trying to see what's in the guy's hand,

783
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,740
and you just can't see it.

784
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Oh, I don't remember that one.

785
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Is that the one where he invents the electric hammer?

786
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,740
It could be.

787
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,740
There's like, oh, I can't remember the way he puts it.

788
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,740
He calls it the invention in question,

789
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
instead of saying what it is.

790
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,740
The invention in question.

791
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,740
I remember an episode where he invents something,

792
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,740
and I don't remember what it is,

793
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,740
but I remember he also invents an electric hammer.

794
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,740
Or he invents the chair protect

795
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,740
from falling backwards hinges thing.

796
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
Right, right, right.

797
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,740
The chair protect from falling backwards hinges thing.

798
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
That's probably what he would call it.

799
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Oh, and he invents the makeup shotgun.

800
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,740
That one's bad.

801
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Yes.

802
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Yes.

803
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
Okay, I have seen this episode,

804
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,740
but I don't remember that gag that you're describing.

805
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Let me try and find it.

806
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
It's a good gag.

807
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Because it's the exact same thing you have, you imagine.

808
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,740
I imagine that I had an idea,

809
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,740
but they're trying to see what it was.

810
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Ben Shane, the video you made,

811
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,740
it was the best idea for a video that anyone's ever had.

812
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Oh yeah, this is the one.

813
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,740
It's got 8 million views on its first week on the platform.

814
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
Congratulations, you've made a million dollars.

815
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,740
You're the genius who invented the product in question.

816
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
If only I could think of an invention,

817
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,740
something that would really make money,

818
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,740
must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked.

819
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,740
This isn't a daydream, this is just a regular dream.

820
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.

821
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,740
This invention of yours has made us all rich.

822
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
Yes, especially you.

823
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,740
It's simple yet ingenious, and it fits right in the palm of your hand.

824
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,740
Every person in America now owns one of these,

825
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,740
and in many cases, three or four.

826
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,740
Could I just get a look at that?

827
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,740
No, no, why would you need to see it?

828
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,740
You're the genius who invented the product in question.

829
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
But could I just...

830
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,740
Don't worry, you'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.

831
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Let me see, let me see, out of the way.

832
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
Homer, wake up!

833
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,740
There's still a few minutes till our usual bedtime.

834
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Stupid bitch wife, stupid bitch whore of a wife

835
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,740
getting in the way of my important work as a science man.

836
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,740
I really like the line at the end.

837
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Homer, wake up!

838
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,740
It's still a few minutes till our regular bedtime.

839
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
It's not the morning.

840
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Wait, I didn't even notice that.

841
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,740
I actually wanted to go to bed at the same time.

842
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,740
You can't, you have to stay awake for another little bit

843
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,740
before we go to bed.

844
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
It's still a few minutes.

845
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I just wanted to make my hatred of women explicit so fast

846
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,740
and I wasn't even concentrating and I missed that joke.

847
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,740
But thanks for pointing it out for me.

848
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,740
It's exactly what you had.

849
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,740
You had your bitch wife knock you out of your sleep.

850
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
You had a video idea.

851
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
It was coming to you.

852
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,740
My bitch wife is reality.

853
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,740
My woman, she's a bitch whore.

854
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,740
You watch, have I talked about how good the latest Todd in the Shadows is?

855
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Oh no, I have not seen.

856
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
Do you watch One Hit Wonderland?

857
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
Nope.

858
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,740
Have I, I feel like I brought everyone up.

859
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,740
You brought up Todd in the Shadows every day for the last 150 episodes.

860
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,740
I knew it.

861
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
I knew it.

862
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
I knew it.

863
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,740
I knew it and you keep letting me do it to make a fool of me.

864
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
Just like my bitch wife.

865
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
That's the line.

866
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,740
That's literally the line in Not In Your Woman by White Town.

867
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,740
But in My Woman, the song that the sample that everyone thinks is the Imperial March.

868
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
The line that what's his name?

869
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Frickin' the guy who was the detective in Roger Rabbit.

870
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,740
The one that he lip-synced.

871
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Todd plays the little clip and he goes,

872
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
My woman makes a fool of me.

873
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,740
Yes.

874
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,740
True.

875
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
It's connected.

876
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,740
True.

877
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,740
It all connects.

878
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Yes, true.

879
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,740
I don't know what he's talking about.

880
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
No, I definitely did bring that up.

881
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,740
I definitely did bring that up because I remember last episode I hummed the ba-ba-ba-ba

882
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,740
and you said Imperial March and I said,

883
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
No, you've fallen for the trap.

884
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,740
Yep.

885
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
Yes.

886
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
It's all coming back to me.

887
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,740
Someone should make, someone should like list every time on a PCP episode that Ben St. says,

888
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Hey, let me talk about this thing.

889
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Did I talk about this on a previous episode?

890
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,740
And then the rank, like how many times yes he did or yes I didn't.

891
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,740
And I'll bet the answer is mostly yes I did.

892
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Yeah.

893
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,740
I feel like every week I'm like, I want to talk about something but I'm pretty sure I talked about it already.

894
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,740
And I don't remember.

895
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,740
It's just because you're getting old and decrepit and your brain is falling into small pieces.

896
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,740
You know what I feel like is getting old and decrepit about me personally?

897
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,740
It's a great subject.

898
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
Let's explore that.

899
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,740
You know what I think I'm losing my ability to do?

900
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Is to chew a lot of food for an extended period of time.

901
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
No, that's horrible.

902
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:46,740
I find myself, I find myself more often when I'm, it's specifically when I'm eating like snacks,

903
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,740
when I'm like, when I've indulged myself in some crackers.

904
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:56,740
Listen, I bought some like some like rice crackers the other day,

905
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,740
which is not something I normally eat because I can't be trusted around salty snacks of that sort.

906
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,740
So I bought some like sea salt rice crackers and I was just eating the whole box of them.

907
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,740
And yeah, my jaw just got tired from all the chewing.

908
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,740
And I was like, I can't, I can't move my jaw sufficiently.

909
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,740
I have to put them down.

910
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,740
I have to put them down.

911
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
I don't think that's an old person thing.

912
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,740
I think that's just eating too much.

913
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,740
I just, I just, I feel like it's happening more often than it used to.

914
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,740
But maybe it's just my eating habits have changed.

915
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Yeah.

916
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Now you go ga ga ga ga ga ga ga ga all the time.

917
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Well, I don't do that all the time, but just occasionally when I get my hands on something,

918
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:44,740
I do that and like I'm not, I don't have like the muscular endurance in that region of my body anymore.

919
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I like, I'm like, can't keep up with it.

920
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,740
You're not, you're not getting any jaw gains.

921
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
That's the problem.

922
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
I'm not getting any jaw gains.

923
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,740
My, my lifts, my lifts stumbled.

924
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,740
My lifts stumbled yesterday.

925
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
I did not make much progress on my lifts.

926
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,740
And I feel like maybe I'm not sleeping enough or maybe I'm not eating enough because I've plateaued.

927
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,740
I plateaued a little bit on my squat.

928
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:17,740
I plateaued on my bench press, even on, even on my curls, even on curls for the girls.

929
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Is that not normal?

930
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
It's normal.

931
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Like for when you haven't exercised in a while, the first part is easy and then it plateaus gets a little harder.

932
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Yeah.

933
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:37,740
I mean, sure, everyone hits plateaus eventually, but I've definitely lifted more.

934
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,740
I've squatted more and I've dead lifted more than I did the other day.

935
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,740
And so, you know, you hate, you hate to plateau.

936
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,740
Whenever, whenever you hit a plateau, it's like, well, how do I get past it?

937
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:55,740
And first thing I'm thinking, I'm going to try to sleep more and maybe eat a little more because I've,

938
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
I've not been eating.

939
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,740
I was eating a bunch.

940
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:05,740
I cut back by a few hundred calories the last like week or two and I felt like I was like getting myself under control.

941
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,740
I was like, I've been eating too much.

942
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,740
Let me rain it in a little bit.

943
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,740
I have rained it in a little bit, but maybe I rained it in too much.

944
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
You know?

945
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
Think about it.

946
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
There's like a...

947
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,740
Yeah.

948
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
What?

949
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
What?

950
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,740
I was going to segue.

951
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,740
I was going to segue into talking about drawing.

952
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,740
Oh, wait.

953
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,740
I haven't drawn in a while.

954
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,740
And so, like, I'm also getting...

955
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,740
Like, it's easy to start building up again.

956
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,740
Like, the gains is like, oh, zero pages per day?

957
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,740
Well, now I'm doing like one or two or three.

958
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,740
And, but now it's getting harder to like increase that further.

959
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,740
Three pages a day is wild.

960
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,740
I mean, I am a very simple draw person.

961
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
And they're not like completed pages.

962
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,740
They're just a line art.

963
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,740
I've already done the sketch.

964
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,740
So it's not as much work as it sounds.

965
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,740
Okay.

966
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,740
I mean, sure.

967
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,740
I mean, that's still pretty good.

968
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,740
It is pretty good.

969
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,740
It's like a page where the two people are talking and their faces are close.

970
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,740
So I don't need to draw the entire body or the entire head.

971
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,740
Just sometimes just like, it's easy.

972
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,740
I love it when there's an excuse for like, I don't actually even have to actually draw that much on this page.

973
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,740
Yes.

974
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,740
Because it's still a page.

975
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,740
It still counts.

976
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
It's an important page.

977
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Every page has a story and an amount of ink.

978
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,740
Haha.

979
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,740
Some of them have less.

980
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:44,740
I'm going to do, I'm going to be really fancy and I'm going to make the next page is just a full like one panel close up shot of the face talking and making a dramatic expression.

981
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,740
Haha.

982
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Everyone's going to think I'm such a genius because this page is so dramatic, but it's actually it's really easy.

983
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,740
It's the easiest page to be drawn because just one panel is just one face.

984
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,740
It's so simple.

985
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,740
I do that way a lot.

986
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
I do that a lot.

987
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,740
I do a lot of those.

988
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,740
There's nothing wrong.

989
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,740
There's, especially in comics, there's nothing wrong with taking the easy way out.

990
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,740
You've got to do it as much as you can.

991
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,740
Oh, of course.

992
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:18,740
Because like making every panel beautiful and you realize that people read it like they don't notice these things.

993
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,740
As long as it looks okay.

994
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,740
Yeah.

995
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:28,740
And when there's an important action scene or an important moment, you spend a little extra time to make it look nice.

996
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:34,740
They'll remember the nice looking panels and they'll forget like being between ones that just move from A to B.

997
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
Yeah.

998
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,740
There's so many, there's so many shite panels in slime and punishment.

999
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,740
So many shite panels.

1000
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,740
But there's a couple that are nice too and that's the important thing.

1001
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,740
Yeah.

1002
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,740
So, Clarissa's coming along.

1003
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,740
I am happy with it.

1004
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
I am happy with how it's going.

1005
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,740
How much more do you have to do?

1006
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,740
For this chapter, there's like the last page line art and then shading.

1007
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,740
So, shading, I don't know.

1008
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,740
I don't know whether to like.

1009
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Do you have to go back and shade all the panels that you did line art for already?

1010
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
Yeah.

1011
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
So like 20 pages of shading.

1012
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,740
So it's not going to take zero seconds, but less time than line art probably the most of them.

1013
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:30,740
Sometimes shading is really just a bit of shadow under the hair or wherever it needs to be.

1014
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
And then that's it.

1015
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,740
It's all done.

1016
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,740
I don't know whether to like switch.

1017
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,740
Because before, I didn't really know how to do like dots.

1018
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,740
What are they called?

1019
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,740
Little dots.

1020
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Oh.

1021
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Half tone.

1022
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Half tone.

1023
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,740
Screen tones.

1024
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Screen tones.

1025
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:05,740
I didn't know how to do that for the early Clarissa chapters because I was stupid and I didn't know how to Google it.

1026
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:16,740
So I just did like a layer of like low opacity or gray like ink and I would just put the ink on where shadows should be.

1027
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,740
But now I know how to do the screen tones.

1028
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Should I switch?

1029
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Should I change the style of it or just keep going?

1030
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,740
From like flat shadows to screen tones?

1031
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,740
Flat gray to screen tone, yeah.

1032
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,740
Obviously screen tones are not easier to use.

1033
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:48,740
You have to really think about the size of the dots and how it will look on a page when it's printed or like the size of which people will see it on a screen changes the way it looks.

1034
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:58,740
Screen tones exist because they made shading possible in a printing environment that could only use flat blacks.

1035
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,740
And that's not so they're really necessary.

1036
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,740
They're really just a stylistic choice for you.

1037
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,740
So use them if you want.

1038
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,740
Just use them when they look good.

1039
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,740
I suppose so.

1040
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:20,740
It's a little, because it's weird to have just some of it being screen tones.

1041
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,740
No, it's not.

1042
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,740
This is weird though, because just from examples I've seen, people either use them or they don't.

1043
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:36,740
Whenever an artist does something they don't usually do, people say, ah, they're trying new stuff.

1044
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
They're growing as an artist.

1045
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,740
How heartwarming.

1046
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,740
They wouldn't say that.

1047
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,740
What would you think?

1048
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,740
I don't know.

1049
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,740
I don't know.

1050
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
I guess I wouldn't care.

1051
00:45:52,740 --> 00:46:00,740
If an artist, if suddenly they use screen tones and they never used screen tones before, you'd be like, huh, they used a screen tone.

1052
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,740
Yeah, I guess it's not a real...

1053
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:14,740
I just don't want it to look worse, because screen tones are easier to fuck up because there's...

1054
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:24,740
You can make it look okay from whatever zoom level you're looking at when you're drawing it, but then you zoom out to a normal scale or zoom in.

1055
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,740
The zoom can fuck up.

1056
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,740
The digital screen tones, the zoom can fuck up, that's true.

1057
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,740
Yeah, so I'm like, what do I do about that?

1058
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:46,740
I have designed Clarissa and Lord of Ghost to be printable and work well for a printed medium, just in case I felt like doing that.

1059
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,740
I guess I'd have to think really hard about the size of stuff, but that's hard.

1060
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:58,740
That's a whole lot of stuff to think, because I don't know exactly the size of the paper that I'm going to use if I do print it.

1061
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,740
It could do the same as Lord of Ghost, it could be a little smaller, not sure.

1062
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:14,740
So this printer, if I...

1063
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:23,740
Because I told you that I really wanted to get these guys to print it, even though they ghosted me, because their prices were way better than anyone else I could find.

1064
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:31,740
They gave me a quote, and the prices they quoted me for printing for slime and punishment are like...

1065
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:39,740
The cost falls off so much, even from the difference between 100 copies to 300 copies.

1066
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:59,740
The price for 100 books is about $13 to $14, plus like $2 or $3 in shipping for each book, so that comes to around $15 to $16.

1067
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:07,740
If I print 300 books, the price is like $5 to $6 plus $2 for shipping each book.

1068
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,740
That's really cheap.

1069
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:16,740
Yeah, you print 300 pieces for literally only like...

1070
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,740
You print three times as many books for literally only like 50% more costs, right?

1071
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,740
So the price falls off really fast.

1072
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,740
How many pages does your thing have?

1073
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,740
And their color as well.

1074
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,740
Yeah, the full color pages is...

1075
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:38,740
It would be so much, it would be even cheaper if it were...

1076
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:45,740
Sorry, I think it came to 264 pages, including like all the stuff.

1077
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,740
Oh my god.

1078
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,740
I know, it's pretty big.

1079
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,740
I should use whatever you're using next time.

1080
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:57,740
I'll order these print copies and I'll see if they are shite, and if they...

1081
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,740
Why do I keep saying it like that?

1082
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,740
Have you been watching some British YouTubers?

1083
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,740
No, never.

1084
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,740
I would never do that.

1085
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,740
Yeah, if they're good.

1086
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,740
Yeah, I will refer you to these guys because they have...

1087
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:21,740
I looked at a bunch of printers, I asked many different printers, and nobody had prices like these people.

1088
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:25,740
So there's a non-zero chance that I'll get the test copies and they will suck.

1089
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,740
And I'll say, oh, that explains it.

1090
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,740
But we'll see.

1091
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,740
I guess.

1092
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,740
Yeah, I don't know.

1093
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,740
Like, what's the likelihood?

1094
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,740
It's from China, right?

1095
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,740
Yeah.

1096
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,740
They're probably...

1097
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,740
Guangzhou Haotong.

1098
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,740
And I'm sure I'm saying that wrong.

1099
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,740
They have access to cheaper labor?

1100
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,740
I don't really know what's going on with China.

1101
00:49:50,740 --> 00:50:00,740
But even compared to other Chinese companies, this company was significantly cheaper than anyone else that I've talked to.

1102
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,740
I was only asking Chinese printing companies on Alibaba.

1103
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,740
That's where I was looking.

1104
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,740
I have no idea.

1105
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:16,740
That sounds like it's either a monopoly holder or they're going to go out of business soon.

1106
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,740
I mean, I was talking to them six months ago and they are still...

1107
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,740
They're still going.

1108
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,740
Or third option, the product sex.

1109
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,740
I wonder if they are like a monopoly holder.

1110
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:35,740
I mean, I have no way of knowing if one of these companies is much...

1111
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,740
Maybe I could actually look around and find out about that.

1112
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:45,740
Yeah, I don't know if this is an especially big company or a small one.

1113
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:53,740
That's pretty cool though, because if you get it really cheap, you won't have to charge so much for it.

1114
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,740
I know.

1115
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,740
And people are more able to say, oh, hell yeah, I'll buy that.

1116
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,740
I mean, this is...

1117
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,740
If I could charge 20 bucks for it, that sounds...

1118
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,740
That would probably be like really...

1119
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,740
Because I mean, okay, the shipping is going to be...

1120
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,740
I'm concerned about the shipping.

1121
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,740
I would like...

1122
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,740
If I could send it with media mail.

1123
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:22,740
Media mail would save me so much money on shipping, but you can only use media mail in America.

1124
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:28,740
And these packages are going to be big, especially if I add bonus stuff,

1125
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:34,740
like freaking little slime bottles and crystals and stuff and podrans, you know?

1126
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:38,740
Technically, that stuff would disqualify it for media mail.

1127
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,740
I think I could probably still get away with using media mail because it's a book.

1128
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,740
Because what are they going to check every package and see that there's a crystal in there?

1129
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:57,740
But only in America, I feel like shipping alone is going to be like $15, $20, maybe more,

1130
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,740
for international shipping on a lot of these.

1131
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,740
So I'm probably going to have to incorporate that into the price as well.

1132
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,740
I don't see the price being under $30.

1133
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:20,740
But honestly, for a 200-page full-color book, I feel like $30 is a very, very reasonable price for something like that.

1134
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:34,740
And I'll feel good if I can charge that much and that will account for how freaking expensive international shipping is going to be on all of this junk.

1135
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,740
What's the dimensions of the book?

1136
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:43,740
I went with 8.5x11 landscape.

1137
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,740
8.5x11? That's pretty big.

1138
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:53,740
Regular printer paper size. Yeah, it's pretty big.

1139
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,740
Yeah, it's pretty big.

1140
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,740
Yeah, but I guess it's pretty big.

1141
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,740
Oh, I'm really excited.

1142
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:10,740
I asked her for a second quote.

1143
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,740
She quoted me the price and then I asked her, hey, what if I change the paper type?

1144
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:21,740
And then a few days went by and I didn't get an answer and I was like, oh no, I pushed you hard.

1145
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,740
I asked too many questions, she's ghosting me again.

1146
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,740
But no, she did get back to me two days ago.

1147
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,740
So now I'm like, all right, it's fine.

1148
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I know everything I need to know.

1149
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,740
Let's do it. Let's freaking do this.

1150
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,740
I hope she won't mind if I ask her to print.

1151
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:51,740
Because I want to test print two copies with two slightly different color schemes to compare which filter looks better.

1152
00:53:51,740 --> 00:54:01,740
And also on two different paper weights to just see is the heavier paper worth the extra price or is it just as good on the lighter paper and it's cheaper too.

1153
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:15,740
If it like that many pages, paper weight might change the weight enough for weight class in transferring a large package.

1154
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:21,740
Well, I'll tell you, it'll cost more for me to ship if it's heavier too.

1155
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:36,740
For them, they said that like with the lighter paper, the lighter paper would make for 100 pieces, the printing cost would be 12.

1156
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,740
It increases the, it actually doesn't increase the shipping cost by much at all.

1157
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,740
It increases the cost of printing them from like $12 a copy at 100 pieces to like 14.

1158
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:54,740
So, you know, it's an increase, but honestly, it doesn't make.

1159
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:01,740
Yeah, if I'm printing 300 pieces, the price changes from like $5 a copy to like $6 a copy.

1160
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,740
Oh, those margins.

1161
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,740
Oh, God, those margins.

1162
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:10,740
If I sell 300 copies and I can get each one for like $6 a piece, that'd be incredible.

1163
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,740
I'm salivating.

1164
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,740
I'm salivating at the potential margins.

1165
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,740
Gabe, I love money.

1166
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,740
I love money so much.

1167
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,740
I, yeah, it's pretty good.

1168
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:44,740
When I, it's like, I don't know, when I execute a plan, when I execute a plan and the plan turns a profit, it's like, how did I do that?

1169
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,740
It's insane.

1170
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:56,740
You ever, you ever, you ever study thermodynamics in uni?

1171
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,740
You ever take a class on thermo?

1172
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,740
You ever know about the, you know about the Carno cycle?

1173
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,740
Is that when you get a, it's like a bicycle?

1174
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:11,740
The Carno cycle, it's when, it's how like the fricking, oh God, I'm going to butcher this explanation.

1175
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,740
It's how like a fricking combustion engine works.

1176
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:23,740
It's when you, you take like a thermodynamic environment, like a sealed chamber of gas, right?

1177
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,740
And you do a little, oh, how does it fucking work?

1178
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:35,740
It's like you, you compress while keeping the temperature that you compress, you compress it while keeping the pressure the same.

1179
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:45,740
You reduce the volume, but you keep the temperature the same, and then you expand while you keep the pressure the same, and then you reduce while you keep the volume the same, and then you heat up while you keep the temperature the same.

1180
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,740
Whatever.

1181
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,740
Oh, I see, I see.

1182
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,740
Yes, yes, whatever.

1183
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:56,740
It's a series of mechanical changes to the thermodynamic environment that you do.

1184
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:08,740
And in doing so, you create excess energy, and then the engine siphons off that extra energy you create through this thermodynamic process, and that's the source of the energy from like a combustion engine.

1185
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:20,740
And it's like, you know, I don't know, when I make something, and then the last couple of kick starters I've done, I like, hey, I did all this stuff, I did all this setup, and then I did a kick starter, and then I made a bunch of money on it.

1186
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:34,740
And it's like, oh, oh, I did the, I did a successful cycle, I did a big loop around the car now cycle, and I got to the end, and then I squeezed it out, and a bunch of money squirted out.

1187
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,740
Yeah.

1188
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,740
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1189
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,740
Don't pretend you don't know exactly what I'm talking about.

1190
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:47,740
Do you mean like, like, and then you take that money, and then you make a new project, and then you do a kick stuff for that project, and it's like the cycle keeps going?

1191
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,740
Oh.

1192
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,740
Are you getting it?

1193
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:54,740
Or are you just saying, I like when I do, it's like I'm driving a car and getting money out of it.

1194
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,740
No, it spins my wheels.

1195
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,740
It's just the satisfaction of seeing a plan come together.

1196
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,740
It's like, I love it when a plan comes together, you know?

1197
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:12,740
Like I did, I set up, I did all this work, and I made this thing, and then, oh, hey, I sold it, and people bought it, and it all worked out.

1198
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,740
I hope that happens, I hope that happens with slime punishment.

1199
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:26,740
If at least, if as many people buy slime and punishment as bought Vapors 2, I will be stoked as heck about that.

1200
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,740
That would be like, that's all I could ask for.

1201
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,740
I am definitely buying one.

1202
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,740
Oh, thank you.

1203
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,740
It's gonna be really nice.

1204
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,740
Okay, the book's gonna, it's gonna look really nice as a book.

1205
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:45,740
I really think it's gonna look like, as long as this printer doesn't suck, and if this printer sucks, then I'll use a different printer.

1206
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:51,740
And one that makes it look, it's gonna look really good.

1207
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,740
I'm excited.

1208
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:01,740
I'm still a little fucked up about the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

1209
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,740
Oh, the plush.

1210
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:09,740
Uh, no, no, the pumped plush was the one that failed, the Lord of Ghost succeeded.

1211
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,740
Oh, you're fucked up because, why are you fucked up about it?

1212
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,740
Because it was expensive?

1213
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:23,740
It was expensive and stressful, and I don't like doing mailing to countries all over the world.

1214
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:34,740
Yeah, you know what, I can look back and laugh now, but yeah, I do remember that after the Vapors 2 Kickstarter, there was like,

1215
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:44,740
what was it, like 10 months wherein I had to actually, I had to write the Vaporette scripts and get the Vaporette, and get the comics drawn,

1216
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,740
and then I was doing the doodles on the inside covers.

1217
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:53,740
It actually was like really hard, and took a really long time, I forgot about that.

1218
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,740
That was like two or three years ago now.

1219
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:10,740
Yeah, I want to maybe do a similar thing for Clarissa when that's like a thing, or maybe just, it's a lot of pages, the entire thing, so maybe I should make chapters that you could buy.

1220
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:21,740
There's also like Amazon as like the potential to like have it be on Amazon for you to print, like Amazon will print and send a copy to you.

1221
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,740
Yeah, yeah, print print on demand.

1222
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,740
I will probably go that route in the future.

1223
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,740
Yeah, yeah.

1224
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:38,740
It's nice to have a real thing, but it's also like, God, I'm not a distribution company, I can't handle all that.

1225
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:50,740
Well, I might do, okay, I think first line of punishment, I'm not going to do, one of the things that was really hard was the like drawings of the inside cover.

1226
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,740
Just because I went like really hard on like the detail in those.

1227
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,740
Slime and punishment, it's going to have, the pages are going to be black.

1228
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:04,740
So I might do like a, I might offer like a doodle, like a signature and a doodle, but it would genuinely have to be like a doodle doodle.

1229
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:14,740
Like a, because I would do it in like a, in like an opaque gel pen, like a white gel pen or something, or I'd probably use a green one, because slime, ha ha.

1230
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,740
So I might do that.

1231
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,740
It wouldn't do like full page like illustrations like I did in some of those.

1232
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,740
Yeah.

1233
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:30,740
Because that was like, you know, I kind of charge people like a lot because they put so much effort into those.

1234
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:41,740
And on this, it's like, I just don't think I want to have such a production on that, like on the post, on the post print side of things.

1235
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:50,740
So that, and then I won't have any, the, the vaporettes was like one of the hardest parts about that.

1236
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,740
And for slime and punishment, there won't be any of that.

1237
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:57,740
All the, all the work of actually what's going to go into the actual book is all done and taken care of.

1238
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:06,740
So like, thank God, I won't have to worry about anything like that this time, because that was such a process.

1239
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:11,740
And then what else, what else?

1240
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:17,740
Shipping will still be a nightmare, but it's okay.

1241
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,740
Only one nightmare is acceptable.

1242
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:24,740
An accept, unacceptable amount of nightmares.

1243
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:31,740
I'm just going to try and keep, keep on with my, my drawing schedule.

1244
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,740
Yeah.

1245
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,740
Five days a week, five hours a day.

1246
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,740
Yeah.

1247
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,740
Hopefully.

1248
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,740
Yeah.

1249
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,740
And once the chorus is done, I'll be like, what do I do now?

1250
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,740
But that's future Gibbs problem.

1251
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:51,740
That's, that's the way that, that's, that's the, the right attitude.

1252
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,740
Perfect.

1253
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,740
Comic party is going to be so fucking funny when it's real.

1254
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:56,740
I think that'll be.

1255
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,740
People are going to laugh so hard.

1256
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,740
They're just going to piss themselves.

1257
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,740
It's going to be really funny.

1258
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:09,740
Do you think the first one should just be Clarissa and Beescapades?

1259
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,740
Yeah.

1260
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:18,740
And then maybe in, in it, we put a little ad for like submit your comic if you want to be in the next one.

1261
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,740
Yeah.

1262
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,740
Okay.

1263
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,740
Sounds good to me.

1264
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:29,740
The only other thing I have on my notes is I've been watching the owl house.

1265
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,740
Do you know that show?

1266
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,740
I've never watched it.

1267
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,740
I mean, I've definitely heard of it.

1268
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,740
And I've seen, I've seen what I know what it looks like.

1269
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,740
Yeah.

1270
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:42,740
So a teenage girl goes to a magical world where she's the only human.

1271
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,740
Everyone else is not a human.

1272
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,740
And that's, that's her gimmick.

1273
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,740
It's just like Mario.

1274
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,740
He tries to learn magic.

1275
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,740
It's just like Mario.

1276
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,740
Yeah.

1277
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,740
Mario.

1278
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,740
It took a few episodes.

1279
01:03:54,740 --> 01:04:00,740
I try to watch it a while ago and I go like three episodes in and I'm like, nah, some of these characters are annoying.

1280
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:06,740
Some of these characters are annoying and they're not funny and the jokes aren't landing and I don't like it.

1281
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:14,740
And the main character is very Steven Universe-esque in that she's really enthusiastic and happy.

1282
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,740
And that really pissed me off.

1283
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,740
That really made me spit that one.

1284
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,740
I didn't mind that.

1285
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:21,740
That was fine.

1286
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:26,740
But I went back to it just because I needed a show.

1287
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,740
I'd finished Medical Soul.

1288
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,740
I was like, well, what else is there?

1289
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,740
What else is there in this world?

1290
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,740
I remember that.

1291
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,740
That's a good question.

1292
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,740
I gave it a chance.

1293
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,740
And yeah, I think episode five was cool.

1294
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:41,740
They had a cool fight scene and I started noticing that the animation generally is just very good.

1295
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:45,740
And the timing of the jokes is good as well.

1296
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,740
And I'm like, you know what?

1297
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,740
It's not so bad.

1298
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,740
It's not the best show ever.

1299
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,740
But I'm invested now.

1300
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,740
I want to see what happens.

1301
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:54,740
Oh, no.

1302
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,740
That's a good little comic.

1303
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,740
Good little cartoon.

1304
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,740
Good little comic.

1305
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,740
No, it's got its hooks into you.

1306
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,740
It's going to poison your mind with its content.

1307
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:11,740
I'd rather be poisoned by a nicely animated little cartoon show than by YouTubers.

1308
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,740
No.

1309
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,740
I love YouTubers.

1310
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,740
I love YouTube.

1311
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,740
They're all going to die one day.

1312
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,740
No, every YouTuber you know and love will be dead one day.

1313
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:30,740
And then won't you feel silly that you cared, idiot?

1314
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,740
How could you spend your precious time on this earth?

1315
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:43,740
How could you waste it listening to the words of fallible mortals who will one day perish?

1316
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,740
I don't know.

1317
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,740
I guess it's just part of my human nature.

1318
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:48,740
Oh, cringe.

1319
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,740
Speaking of which, I found a YouTuber that I really like recently.

1320
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:57,740
His name is Grimbeard, and he is funny, and he talks about video games.

1321
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,740
You've mentioned them.

1322
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,740
Have I?

1323
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,740
They're the person you said looked like Jesse.

1324
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,740
No, that's Burger Creek.

1325
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,740
Oh.

1326
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,740
Who's Grimbeard?

1327
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,740
I don't know.

1328
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,740
It's a different dude.

1329
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,740
It's some other guy.

1330
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,740
It's an unrelated person.

1331
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,740
I feel like you've said Grimbeard before.

1332
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,740
Maybe I have.

1333
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,740
I've been watching his stuff for a while now.

1334
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,740
I just really like him.

1335
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,740
I just really like his stuff.

1336
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,740
All right.

1337
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:28,740
And that's it.

1338
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:29,740
That's all I have to say.

1339
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:38,740
He does video game reviews, mostly of PlayStation 2 era PC shooters and stuff, horror games,

1340
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:44,740
kind of mostly semi obscure stuff, but not entirely.

1341
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:53,740
American McGee's Alice, Vampire, The Masquerade, Redemption, stuff you might have heard of.

1342
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,740
Yeah, you might have heard of it.

1343
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,740
You might have heard of it.

1344
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,740
That's pretty cool.

1345
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:00,740
Yeah, he's good.

1346
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:07,740
I'm not really interested these days in review content or video essays.

1347
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,740
I'm not really interested in the games so much.

1348
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,740
Sometimes they're kind of interesting and I've never seen them before and I go, huh, didn't know that was a game.

1349
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,740
When it comes to stuff happening on YouTube, it's like, oh, check this out.

1350
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:25,740
I usually click on challenge runs of Mario or whatever.

1351
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,740
You know?

1352
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,740
Just because those are...

1353
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,740
I don't know.

1354
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,740
It's something about challenge runs that I'm just really into right now.

1355
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,740
Do you like the ones with the guy narrates how they did it or whatever?

1356
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,740
Yeah, the guy narrate the...

1357
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,740
What's his name?

1358
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,740
What's their name?

1359
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,740
What's her name?

1360
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,740
Who?

1361
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,740
Gate Video VG Champ 3000.

1362
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,740
Oh, yes.

1363
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,740
I know her.

1364
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:57,740
There was another one who did Kirby challenge runs.

1365
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:04,740
That other guy did every Kirby game and those ones were pretty good.

1366
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,740
Yeah, VG Champ 3000 or something.

1367
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,740
Yeah, I've seen some of that stuff.

1368
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,740
Yeah, she's great.

1369
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:17,740
There's a Fire Emblem stuff that I've been looking at.

1370
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:25,740
Fire Emblem challenge runs trying to do really excessively difficult things.

1371
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:29,740
Using one character and not attacking or...

1372
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,740
I don't know.

1373
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:36,740
I just had a glance in around looking at these things.

1374
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,740
Oh, I like that.

1375
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,740
That's the content I like now.

1376
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,740
A review of like, here's why this game is good.

1377
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,740
I'm like, yeah, I'll buy it.

1378
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
You don't need to explain it.

1379
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,740
I'll just say I'll agree.

1380
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,740
You don't need to sell me on that.

1381
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,740
I love video games.

1382
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,740
Here's how this video game changed the world.

1383
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,740
I was like, nah, yeah, I'm sure it did.

1384
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,740
Is there a challenge run of you doing something about it?

1385
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,740
Is there fun going on?

1386
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,740
You having fun with it?

1387
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:03,740
You're winning some?

1388
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:07,740
Well, if it's such a good game, why don't you do a challenge run about it?

1389
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,740
Why do you just review it when you can be doing a challenge run?

1390
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,740
Why are you talking about this stuff when you could be playing it and I could be watching?

1391
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:20,740
Fuck you telling me about what kind of a game Vampire of the Masquerade Redemption is.

1392
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,740
Now, let's see you do it with a zero blood run.

1393
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:27,740
Let's see you do it without committing any crimes.

1394
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,740
Oh, you won't?

1395
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,740
Too hard?

1396
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,740
Impossible?

1397
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:33,740
Well, I guess you weren't that serious about it.

1398
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,740
Did you ever watch SEVE gaming?

1399
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,740
SEVE?

1400
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,740
SEVE, C-E-A-V-E.

1401
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,740
That does not ring a bell.

1402
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:50,740
They did Mario challenge runs where they tried not to touch coins or try to complete new Super Mario Brothers

1403
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:55,740
without like while crouching the whole time or like not pressing left or not pressing right

1404
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,740
or not pressing the jump button.

1405
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,740
All those sorts of things.

1406
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,740
I've seen things like that.

1407
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:03,740
I don't know if I saw that channel.

1408
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,740
SEVE gaming is great.

1409
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:11,740
They stopped making videos, but they got a lot of them and they're fun.

1410
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:16,740
They have a funny voice because they're German.

1411
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,740
I mentioned that Burger Creek is German,

1412
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,740
but he sounds British until you...

1413
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,740
Oh, everyone sounds British to you, Yanks.

1414
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,740
No, I swear he must have learned English from like a British.

1415
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:37,740
He must have like spent time in the UK or something because he definitely speaks it that way.

1416
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,740
The...

1417
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,740
Everybody in Europe who speaks English sounds British.

1418
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,740
They learned English by watching Doctor Who.

1419
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,740
That's probably it.

1420
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,740
That's probably true.

1421
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,740
That's probably true.

1422
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,740
That's probably true.

1423
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:55,740
Oh, shit.

1424
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:59,740
Well, I was going to say something else, but I'm sure it didn't matter.

1425
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,740
You know, we'll all die one day anyway.

1426
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:05,740
So whether I remember it or not is probably irrelevant.

1427
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:07,740
Yeah, that's the spirit.

1428
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,740
That's the spirit.

1429
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,740
I just want to shout out Grimbeard because I like him.

1430
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,740
That's it.

1431
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:16,740
Yeah.

1432
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,740
That's just what I've been doing.

1433
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,740
That's just what I've been doing this week.

1434
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,740
I just been...

1435
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:27,740
Okay, what I spent like literally most of this week doing was taking my page files for

1436
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:34,740
the comic and putting them through Photoshop and applying a color filter to them and then

1437
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:40,740
resaving the page in a new folder with like the filter on.

1438
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:43,740
Is that for printing ink stuff?

1439
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:48,740
I just was adjusting the greens because you know very well that the greens just don't

1440
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:52,740
look the same when they come out on CMYK printing.

1441
01:11:52,740 --> 01:12:00,740
So I was basically just lightening them so that they would be roughly the same brightness

1442
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,740
on the page, hopefully.

1443
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:08,740
I'm glad the way the Red Man comics came out looked all right.

1444
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:12,740
Yeah, because I was so confused by all of that stuff.

1445
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:16,740
I really couldn't get a good grasp of what I was doing to the green.

1446
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,740
It looks different, but like it's fine.

1447
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,740
It looks fine.

1448
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:24,740
Yeah, you can't really get a neon green like you can on a screen.

1449
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,740
No, you really can't.

1450
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,740
You have to either...

1451
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,740
If you want a rich green, it has to be dark.

1452
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:34,740
And if you want a bright green, it has to be pale basically.

1453
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,740
Or you can sort of nudge it into like a yellowish.

1454
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,740
And then you can get it a little brighter.

1455
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,740
That was the trade-off that I had.

1456
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,740
I did a couple different versions.

1457
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,740
One of it is yellower, but brighter.

1458
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,740
And the other one is paler, but greener.

1459
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,740
And so the two versions that I want to print on the two different paper weights,

1460
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,740
I'm going to try and give her the two different filters.

1461
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:56,740
And then I'll compare them and see which one I like better on the page.

1462
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,740
That's the plan for these test copies.

1463
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:05,740
But it really took so long because it's 260 pages.

1464
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:09,740
And the PNGs are pretty big, so it takes like a minute to save each one.

1465
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,740
And then I had to...

1466
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:15,740
So that's, you know, several hours, even if I'm not doing anything else

1467
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,740
and I'm just focused on that and I'm doing it as fast as I possibly can.

1468
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,740
And I had to do it twice because I wanted the two different filters.

1469
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,740
And I tried.

1470
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,740
I spent a whole day just trying to figure out how to get Photoshop

1471
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,740
to load all the files into...

1472
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,740
There's a script called load files into stack.

1473
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:37,740
To load all the files into one Photoshop document as layers,

1474
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:41,740
and then apply the filter to all the layers individually,

1475
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,740
and then export each individual layer as its own PNG.

1476
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,740
And there are functions that do that.

1477
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,740
But every time I tried to do it,

1478
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:53,740
my frickin' Photoshop would tell me that it couldn't do it

1479
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:57,740
because it was running out of quote-unquote scratch memory.

1480
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:02,740
Oh, yeah, that's like random access.

1481
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:08,740
That's like an area of memory that is dedicated to like holding all of this stuff.

1482
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,740
Yeah.

1483
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,740
Which need a cleaner hard drive, I guess.

1484
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,740
I don't know.

1485
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,740
Oh, wait, no.

1486
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,740
There's a way in Photoshop, in preferences.

1487
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,740
Yes, I know there's a slider.

1488
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:20,740
I know there's a slider.

1489
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,740
Yeah.

1490
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:22,740
Did it not work?

1491
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:23,740
I looked in...

1492
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:24,740
I found the slider.

1493
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:25,740
I maxed out the slider.

1494
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:29,740
I switched to another hard drive for my scratch disk

1495
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,740
that had like 800 gigs free,

1496
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,740
and it still didn't work.

1497
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,740
So I...

1498
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,740
Big file.

1499
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,740
Only a couple gigs.

1500
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,740
Well, I mean...

1501
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,740
Less than 10 gigs.

1502
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,740
I mean...

1503
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,740
Don't know how the scratch disk stuff works.

1504
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:47,740
Yeah.

1505
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,740
I spent a whole day trying to get it to work.

1506
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,740
I couldn't get it to work.

1507
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,740
In the end, I was like,

1508
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,740
I'll actually just have to do it

1509
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,740
file by file one at a time.

1510
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,740
It's the only way.

1511
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,740
And so that's what I did.

1512
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,740
And it sucked.

1513
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,740
But I did.

1514
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,740
It does suck.

1515
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,740
Yeah.

1516
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,740
I've...

1517
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,740
A lot of times there's been like,

1518
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,740
oh, you can do this really complicated thing

1519
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:13,740
that will save you so much time,

1520
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,740
but then I try to learn about it,

1521
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,740
and it takes so long.

1522
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,740
It's just frustrating.

1523
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,740
You know what?

1524
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:19,740
I'd rather toil.

1525
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,740
I'd rather toil than learn right now.

1526
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:23,740
You know, I found out how to do it.

1527
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,740
I know how to do it.

1528
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,740
It's just my machine is incapable

1529
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,740
of doing it.

1530
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,740
Yeah.

1531
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:31,740
So...

1532
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,740
My machine is my brain,

1533
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,740
and it was also incapable.

1534
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,740
True.

1535
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,740
That's fucking...

1536
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,740
That's show business.

1537
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,740
That's blow...

1538
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,740
That's bro business.

1539
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,740
True.

1540
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,740
Did you know?

1541
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,740
Did you know that Riku

1542
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:54,740
from Kingdom Hearts?

1543
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,740
Yeah.

1544
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,740
You know Riku?

1545
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,740
Yeah.

1546
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:00,740
I think because of a video I watched

1547
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,740
that he's gay for Sora.

1548
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,740
I think he's gay now.

1549
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,740
Now?

1550
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,740
It's quite compelling.

1551
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,740
He wasn't gay before,

1552
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:07,740
but he's gay now?

1553
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,740
Well, he was gay before,

1554
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,740
but now I believe it.

1555
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,740
But now...

1556
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,740
Okay.

1557
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:13,740
Yes, I understand.

1558
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,740
There was this long video essay,

1559
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,740
six hours long,

1560
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,740
it's called Riku is Gay

1561
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,740
and Why It Matters.

1562
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:20,740
Wait.

1563
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,740
That's actually really funny.

1564
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,740
I want to watch it.

1565
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,740
It's a really funny idea.

1566
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,740
For a video,

1567
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:28,740
you laugh when you hear it,

1568
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:31,740
and then they go six hours long.

1569
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,740
Here's all of the reasons

1570
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:35,740
why this makes sense

1571
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,740
and also why it's actually important.

1572
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,740
I'm surprised.

1573
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,740
Because a lot of it

1574
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:44,740
is about why Riku's love for Sora

1575
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,740
and Sora's love for Riku

1576
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,740
is why Kairi is not as important

1577
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,740
into the main story a lot of the time.

1578
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,740
That sounds...

1579
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,740
It's really cool, actually.

1580
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,740
I love it.

1581
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,740
I'm surprised there's six hours

1582
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,740
worth of information to go over.

1583
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:58,740
There are a lot of games,

1584
01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:59,740
but yeah, it was surprising.

1585
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,740
I guess there are a lot of games.

1586
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,740
Yeah, that's true.

1587
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,740
You know what?

1588
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:05,740
Link me that video.

1589
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:08,740
I'll watch that fucking video.

1590
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,740
I'll fucking watch it.

1591
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:11,740
Riku is gay.

1592
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,740
Ha, first thing.

1593
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:20,740
Oh, I don't like the drawing

1594
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,740
on the thumbnail.

1595
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:22,740
It's bad.

1596
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,740
The person drawing is...

1597
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,740
They draw throughout the video

1598
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,740
in the background before they're talking.

1599
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,740
No.

1600
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,740
Don't worry, Ben.

1601
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,740
The content is solid,

1602
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:33,740
and it's very good.

1603
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,740
It's okay.

1604
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:35,740
I'm not actually going to watch the video.

1605
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:39,740
It's just going to be background noise.

1606
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,740
It's just going to be background noise.

1607
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,740
It's just going to be background noise.

1608
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,740
Okay.

1609
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,740
All right.

1610
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,740
Fair enough.

1611
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,740
They do have a furry OC,

1612
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,740
like Torco C.

1613
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,740
Tenelle flowers?

1614
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,740
Oh, God.

1615
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,740
This person's trans, aren't they?

1616
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,740
Yes, I think so.

1617
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:55,740
No!

1618
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,740
Not another one.

1619
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,740
They can't keep getting away with it.

1620
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,740
I don't know what I'm mad about.

1621
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,740
Hey, you hear about Jake?

1622
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:04,740
I think they're non-binary or something.

1623
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,740
Anyway, yeah.

1624
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,740
Wait, I haven't...

1625
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,740
If I click play,

1626
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,740
will I see what they look like?

1627
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,740
You can scrub.

1628
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,740
Oh, do they have a furry OC?

1629
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:17,740
They have a furry OC talking.

1630
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,740
It's all the things that you'd be like,

1631
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,740
ugh, but it's good, though.

1632
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,740
It's a good video.

1633
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,740
It's okay.

1634
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:25,740
It's just going to be background noise.

1635
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:26,740
It's just going to be background noise.

1636
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:29,740
It's just going to be background noise.

1637
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:32,740
I mean, honestly, I like the design of their OC,

1638
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,740
but that's besides the point.

1639
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,740
It's not like ridiculous.

1640
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,740
It's just a little furry person.

1641
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,740
Yeah.

1642
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,740
Yeah.

1643
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:42,740
Yeah, that's all right.

1644
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,740
Yeah, that's all right.

1645
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,740
They have...

1646
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,740
There's something about the way they draw

1647
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,740
the human characters.

1648
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,740
It's very...

1649
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,740
It's not anime.

1650
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,740
It's very like...

1651
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,740
It's very like...

1652
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,740
I don't know if I want to say tumblr core.

1653
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,740
It's maybe a little bit tumblr...

1654
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:04,740
It's tumblr core in a way

1655
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,740
that is grasping at an aesthetic

1656
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:13,740
that is like 101 Dalmatians

1657
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,740
character design-ish.

1658
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,740
Is it Don Bluthish?

1659
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,740
It's Don Bluthish.

1660
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:24,740
It's tumblr does Don Bluthish

1661
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,740
is how I would describe it.

1662
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:32,740
It's not an aesthetic that I particularly like

1663
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:37,740
and I don't think they're doing it particularly well.

1664
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:42,740
So we've got a real melange of things going on there.

1665
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,740
It's just like a bit of whatever

1666
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:46,740
to fill the background of the video

1667
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,740
when there's not a relevant clip to be shown.

1668
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,740
I'm actually interested.

1669
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:54,740
I feel like this could be really interesting analysis.

1670
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,740
It is.

1671
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:56,740
Yeah, okay.

1672
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,740
I'll give that a little cool listen.

1673
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,740
I encourage viewers to watch.

1674
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,740
Anybody listening, go give that a watch

1675
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:06,740
because it's just good.

1676
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:10,740
It makes a lot of weird little eccentricities

1677
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,740
of the plot make a lot of sense.

1678
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,740
Interesting.

1679
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,740
I got so into Kingdom Hearts after watching this

1680
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,740
I was like, I gotta know more about Kingdom Hearts.

1681
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,740
Now I'm listening to other videos

1682
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,740
and then I went back and watched

1683
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,740
Nate's Kingdom Hearts 3 video

1684
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,740
just to see what he had to say on the subject.

1685
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,740
I just wanted more Kingdom Hearts content.

1686
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:32,740
I'm a fan now.

1687
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,740
I wasn't a fan before.

1688
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,740
I was just sort of like a vaguely enjoyed

1689
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,740
the first two games sort of person,

1690
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,740
but now I like it.

1691
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,740
There's a pretty long video

1692
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,740
that I watched a while ago called,

1693
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,740
I think it's called Kingdom Hearts 3

1694
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,740
was a waste of time.

1695
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:52,740
Have you seen that one?

1696
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,740
I don't think I watched all of it,

1697
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:57,740
but yeah, I think I saw that.

1698
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,740
What's his name?

1699
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,740
It's like your favorite uncle, I think,

1700
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,740
or like something uncle.

1701
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:06,740
Ah, what's this frickin...

1702
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:09,740
Well, now I gotta find it.

1703
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:15,740
KH3 waste of time.

1704
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,740
Oh, I accidentally typed HH3 waste of time

1705
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,740
and I got a bunch of the H3H3 podcast.

1706
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:23,740
LOL.

1707
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,740
Kingdom Hearts 3 was a waste of effort

1708
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,740
by Ask Your Uncle.

1709
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,740
That's the one.

1710
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,740
It's five hours long.

1711
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,740
It's just very funny

1712
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:34,740
that the video is called Riku Is Gay

1713
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:38,740
and this is a six hour long YouTube video.

1714
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:39,740
That's peak.

1715
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:42,740
That's peak YouTube in 2023, I would say.

1716
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,740
It is. It's so good.

1717
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,740
Yeah.

1718
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,740
And I'm genuinely happy

1719
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,740
and going to watch it and engage with it

1720
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:53,740
because I am a human being in 2023

1721
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,740
and this is my life.

1722
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,740
Hell yeah.

1723
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,740
Hell yeah.

1724
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,740
What else?

1725
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,740
What else, Gib?

1726
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,740
What else?

1727
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,740
Well, what did I do?

1728
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,740
I did drawing of Clarissa.

1729
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,740
I was doing for Blueberry Still.

1730
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,740
Oh, right, right.

1731
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,740
Those are pretty good.

1732
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:21,740
You still got most of the month left.

1733
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:22,740
Yeah.

1734
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,740
I'm not taking it so seriously.

1735
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,740
I had a break on Friday in Saturday

1736
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,740
because I was like, you know what?

1737
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,740
It doesn't matter.

1738
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,740
I just, I don't want to draw today

1739
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,740
so I didn't need to.

1740
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,740
That's healthy, everybody.

1741
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,740
This is not especially hot gauze.

1742
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,740
I don't know if I would even call it gauze,

1743
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:45,740
but we found out what Trixie is up to.

1744
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,740
She's got a job now.

1745
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,740
Did you know that?

1746
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,740
I did not know that.

1747
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,740
She's got a job.

1748
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:51,740
She's got like a real job.

1749
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,740
Wow.

1750
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:57,740
Yeah, she said that she is driving around

1751
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:02,740
and taking pictures of buildings.

1752
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:08,740
And there's maybe a vacuum cleaner involved.

1753
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,740
She said on Subsect that she needed a vacuum cleaner.

1754
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:15,740
And I don't know, me and some people in the Discord

1755
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,740
were trying to figure out what this means.

1756
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,740
And it seems...

1757
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,740
Ghost hunting.

1758
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:25,740
She's going around Luigi's mansioning,

1759
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,740
playing Luigi's Mansion, IRL.

1760
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,740
I think it sounds like she maybe works

1761
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,740
for a real estate company

1762
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,740
and is going around to their properties

1763
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,740
and photographing the premises

1764
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,740
for listings on Zillow or something.

1765
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:45,740
And maybe she has to clean the house before vacuum the rooms

1766
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,740
and make it look nice before photographing it

1767
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,740
or something like that.

1768
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,740
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

1769
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,740
Yeah, I was just like...

1770
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:54,740
It's kind of funny.

1771
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,740
It's kind of a funny...

1772
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,740
I don't know, imagine that, I guess.

1773
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,740
All right, good for her.

1774
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,740
It's actually making money somehow.

1775
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,740
Maybe.

1776
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,740
I mean, I don't know.

1777
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,740
I have no idea.

1778
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,740
I just...

1779
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:15,740
It's got to be so expensive driving around to do that.

1780
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:17,740
Yeah, probably.

1781
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,740
It must cost so much gas.

1782
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:23,740
I mean, I don't know.

1783
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:26,740
A lot of jobs are probably just bad like that.

1784
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:30,740
They don't care about how much gas you spend to do the job.

1785
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,740
They're just like, yeah, fucking do it, though.

1786
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,740
And we'll pay you pennies.

1787
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:40,740
I mean, either they're comping her for the gas,

1788
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,740
which would cost them a lot of money,

1789
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,740
and I would think like, damn,

1790
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:46,740
you can't just hire someone local.

1791
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:49,740
You've got to hire someone to drive from like Kentucky to California

1792
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,740
to fucking take some pictures of your house.

1793
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:52,740
Well, all over the country.

1794
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,740
Yeah.

1795
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,740
Oh, I thought it was like, yeah, like local buildings.

1796
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,740
But if it's a...

1797
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,740
That's weird.

1798
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:04,740
No, she said they drove to like New York and...

1799
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,740
Yeah, they did like full on like cross country.

1800
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,740
Yeah, and it just, it seems to me,

1801
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:12,740
if I were a realtor, I would think I would want to save money

1802
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,740
by hiring someone local.

1803
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,740
Comp them for gas to do such a thing,

1804
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:19,740
either that or they're not comping for gas

1805
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,740
and she's just blowing tons of money on the gas

1806
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:28,740
and has not considered the fact that that is like a significant cost to the...

1807
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,740
So someone's losing money on this chain,

1808
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:34,740
but whatever, it might just work like that.

1809
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:35,740
I don't know.

1810
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:39,740
If you suck up all the ghosts, you get a lot of coins.

1811
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:43,740
Yeah, she's going ghost hunting.

1812
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,740
That's pretty good.

1813
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,740
I never played Luigi's Mansion.

1814
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:51,740
Neither did I, but it's always looks cool.

1815
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:57,740
But a donkey just put out a video about why the GameCube is failing

1816
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:01,740
and he said that Luigi's Mansion is the spookiest game ever made.

1817
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,740
There's literally 300 ghouls on screen right now.

1818
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:08,740
It's more ghouls than any other game.

1819
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,740
More spooks.

1820
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,740
That's a lot.

1821
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,740
That's a lot of ghouls.

1822
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,740
I know, I know, but it's true.

1823
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,740
Yeah, I don't even have notes this week.

1824
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,740
So whatever.

1825
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:30,740
I'm getting close to 40,000 coal in my RuneScape Bank, everybody.

1826
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,740
You're gonna find 40,000.

1827
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,740
Almost level 90 mining.

1828
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:38,740
You're gonna find 40,000 coal in your Christmas stocking.

1829
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,740
That's a lot of coal.

1830
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,740
Good morning.

1831
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,740
You know, that would be really good.

1832
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,740
That would have been really good at Christmas,

1833
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:51,740
because fuck, everything's expensive and heating your house, especially.

1834
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,740
Free coal, hell yeah.

1835
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:54,740
Hell yeah.

1836
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:57,740
Damn, this is gonna be saving me so much on heating, bro.

1837
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,740
Yeah!

1838
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,740
Based, based, based.

1839
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,740
Well, you want to go to voicemails?

1840
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,740
Yeah, sure.

1841
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,740
Alright, let's do it.

1842
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:09,740
A brisk hour and a half.

1843
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,740
Oh shit, hang on.

1844
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:12,740
What's up?

1845
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:16,740
I didn't check if there's like a one piece.

1846
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,740
Oh fuck!

1847
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,740
Let's have a look.

1848
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:21,740
I forgot.

1849
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,740
What was the chapter we were on last?

1850
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,740
Oh, freaking no.

1851
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,740
Hero's Offensive, I remember that one.

1852
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:31,740
Wakuma climbing up the Red Knight as Weight of Memory.

1853
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:36,740
Miss Buckingham Stussy, Mark III.

1854
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,740
This is new.

1855
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:38,740
This is new.

1856
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,740
No, I don't want to.

1857
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,740
Okay, 1075 is coming soon.

1858
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:49,740
I have 1074, which is the new, we haven't seen this one, I think.

1859
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,740
Oh, okay.

1860
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:55,740
I guess I gotta read it.

1861
01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:00,740
Okay, cue the whatever.

1862
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,740
Play me off, Johnny.

1863
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,740
The one piece!

1864
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,740
The one piece is real!

1865
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:18,740
Damn, these one piece scientists sure do love to turn an old robot into a new robot and call it a whole new robot.

1866
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,740
Wow, what do you mean?

1867
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,740
Well, they're calling him the Mark III.

1868
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:25,740
But I mean, he's the same guy.

1869
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,740
Well, it's a different...

1870
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
They just upgraded him.

1871
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,740
Oh yeah, that's what Mark III means.

1872
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,740
Yeah, I guess.

1873
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,740
He's got bubble pounds, I don't even know what that could be.

1874
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:38,740
It's a strongest shield.

1875
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:42,740
The strongest shield that Vegapunk invented.

1876
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:47,740
I'm gonna go through it all the way before I start thinking with my brain.

1877
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,740
Okay.

1878
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,740
Oh, shit.

1879
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,740
Yeah, that's a...

1880
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:55,740
There's a lot of them.

1881
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:58,740
Oh my god, there's too many things going on.

1882
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,740
Every chapter.

1883
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

1884
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,740
It's big news!

1885
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,740
Oh shit, sorry if it was a spoiler.

1886
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,740
No, I'm already there.

1887
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,740
Okay.

1888
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:11,740
Oh my god.

1889
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:15,740
I thought better of Big News Morgan.

1890
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:19,740
I really did.

1891
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:21,740
He's such a trickster.

1892
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,740
What a scoundrel.

1893
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:32,740
Alright, so first impressions review of chapter 1074, Mark III.

1894
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:35,740
Um, it was bad.

1895
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:37,740
Okay, anyway, let's move on to voicemails.

1896
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,740
No!

1897
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:39,740
Yeah, chapter sucks.

1898
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,740
One piece is bad now.

1899
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:43,740
Let's see, what did we learn?

1900
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:46,740
Okay, they got a million Pasifistas on Vegapunk Island.

1901
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:50,740
They've got, yeah, they've got the new Mark III Pasifista.

1902
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:51,740
No.

1903
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:56,740
It's far more, the guy says this must be a Mark III, so I guess he's like, he knows

1904
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:59,740
about their existence, but he hasn't seen one before.

1905
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:00,740
Yeah.

1906
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:03,740
So maybe this is like, this is the new guys.

1907
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:08,740
These guys are not as good as the Seraphim though, right?

1908
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:09,740
Yeah, I suppose so.

1909
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:15,740
The Seraphim are like state of the art, a new type of human, new type of creation.

1910
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:21,740
Do these guys have paw paw fruit powers, or are they just big, uh, uh, fricking, are

1911
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:24,740
they just big kumas with bubble shields?

1912
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:30,740
I think they're, that might be a type of paw paw fruit ability.

1913
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:32,740
I can't remember if he ever makes a shield.

1914
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:34,740
No, he never did that.

1915
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:39,740
It does look like something the paw paw fruit could do.

1916
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:44,740
He's never done that specifically with it before, I don't think.

1917
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,740
It looks pretty cool though.

1918
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,740
He's super cool.

1919
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,740
It's so fucking big.

1920
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:57,740
Reminds me of the, it's just so funny that like, I don't know, just the way that like,

1921
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,740
look how fricking ridiculous he is.

1922
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:04,740
This is torso, some mountain and tiny little legs, but he's awesome.

1923
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,740
He's tiny little head, tiny little legs.

1924
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:08,740
Yeah.

1925
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,740
Don't know how he does it.

1926
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,740
Don't know how it works.

1927
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,740
Yeah.

1928
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:16,740
It's such a, it's like a juxtaposition.

1929
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:25,740
It's like the obscenely strange body types, but then they're moving and like, posed in

1930
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,740
sort of naturalistic grounded ways.

1931
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,740
I would be like, oh yeah, I guess if they did look like that, that's how they would move.

1932
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,740
He would be really strong.

1933
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:38,740
Yeah, that would, he would like, it says there's like a lot of power behind his like arms.

1934
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:42,740
I was, I was watching a, an old Shamey video the other day.

1935
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,740
It was about Sonic the Hedgehog.

1936
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:48,740
I was watching his old Sonic the Hedgehog series and there was one part where he talks about

1937
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:53,740
the character designs and he's talking about how like the different characters combine

1938
01:31:53,740 --> 01:32:00,740
different like sorts of elements and how like Sonic is cool, but he's also cute.

1939
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:06,740
Whereas contrasting that Eggman is comedic, he's funny looking, but he's also threatening

1940
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:07,740
and sinister.

1941
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:11,740
And like he's funny in the way that his body is shaped, but he's threatening and sinister

1942
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:14,740
in the way that his, his face is hidden and obscured.

1943
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:19,740
And like he has his tiny little glasses and you can't, and you can't read his, his expression

1944
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:22,740
except for his like, his nasty little grin.

1945
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,740
Yeah.

1946
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:25,740
And that's an interesting way to look at it.

1947
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,740
I guess I'm like looking at Kuma.

1948
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:28,740
It's like he's funny.

1949
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:34,740
He's funny looking, but he's also like physically imposing in a way that would be scary if

1950
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,740
he wanted it to be.

1951
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,740
Yeah.

1952
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:44,740
He's got that stern like frown face, even though he's got that funny like iron chin.

1953
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,740
Yeah.

1954
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:46,740
Yeah.

1955
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:49,740
His neck is so big.

1956
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:54,740
Oda really likes, I think as the series has gone on, Oda has leaned more and more into

1957
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:59,740
giving characters like huge, bulgy, like ropey, thick necks.

1958
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,740
Yeah.

1959
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:02,740
That's just what happens when you train.

1960
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,740
That's all that's where the muscle goes.

1961
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:05,740
Oda has drawn so much.

1962
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,740
It becomes like a pyramid of flesh.

1963
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,740
His arm is like bulging with muscle and the huge muscles just transfer themselves into

1964
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:13,740
the necks of the characters that he draws.

1965
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:14,740
Flexing.

1966
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,740
The deltoids.

1967
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,740
Vascular.

1968
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:19,740
The gueltoids or whatever.

1969
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:20,740
All right.

1970
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,740
So, yeah.

1971
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:22,740
So, yeah.

1972
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,740
Vegapunk has a million billion of these guys.

1973
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:25,740
We asked 50.

1974
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:26,740
50 Mark III pacifistas.

1975
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:27,740
Okay.

1976
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:28,740
Which is a lot.

1977
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,740
Yeah.

1978
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,740
Yeah.

1979
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:36,740
On the island, there's Luchi and Kaku and that's it.

1980
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,740
The rest are just like jobbers.

1981
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,740
They're just like guys with guns.

1982
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,740
They can't stand up to 50 pacifistas.

1983
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:45,740
They can't stand up to one pacifista.

1984
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:46,740
Yeah.

1985
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:51,740
So, like, but they are probably going to hold the warships at bay because they're still

1986
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:52,740
coming.

1987
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,740
You mean the admirals warships?

1988
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:55,740
The admirals.

1989
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,740
Yeah.

1990
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,740
The admiral and the tenryu.

1991
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,740
Yeah.

1992
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:02,740
The tenryu buto is on the admirals warships.

1993
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,740
No, that's not what he's called.

1994
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:05,740
It's called like the...

1995
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,740
The Gorasei.

1996
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:07,740
Gorasei.

1997
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,740
Right.

1998
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,740
Right.

1999
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:10,740
Right.

2000
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:11,740
Yeah.

2001
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:15,740
Gorasei and the admiral kizara are on that warship and they got a bunch of warships.

2002
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:22,740
So, like, that's going to be holding that back for a time until the Gorasei says, hey,

2003
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,740
pacifistas, turn around and do something else.

2004
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,740
And they're like, hmm, okay.

2005
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:31,740
Unless that's not how they work, they said that's how the seraphim worked.

2006
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,740
But they have not mentioned how pacifistas work.

2007
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:38,740
They might only take orders from a funny hair.

2008
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,740
Sentomaro.

2009
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,740
Sentomaro.

2010
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,740
Maybe.

2011
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:44,740
Yeah.

2012
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:50,740
When they said the chain of command, were they specifically talking about the seraphim

2013
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,740
and not the pacifistas in general?

2014
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,740
I don't remember.

2015
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,740
I think they were talking about the seraphim, yes.

2016
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,740
Okay.

2017
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:01,740
I mean, maybe there's an implication that also works for the pacifistas, but they're not

2018
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:04,740
exactly the same thing, so we don't know.

2019
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,740
Yeah.

2020
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:16,740
I wonder how many pacifistas is worth, Mark III pacifistas is worth, like, a seraphim.

2021
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:19,740
What are they, like, five seraphim?

2022
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:21,740
There's Jinbei.

2023
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,740
Jinbei, Mihawk.

2024
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:24,740
Hancock.

2025
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:32,740
Jinbei, Mihawk, Hancock, Kuma, and, am I forgetting one?

2026
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:36,740
No, I think that's the four.

2027
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:37,740
Yeah, that's right.

2028
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,740
I don't remember any others.

2029
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:43,740
So there's four seraphim, and there's 50 pacifistas.

2030
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:51,740
I don't know, I think 50 pacifistas is probably, they're not that much weaker than a seraphim,

2031
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,740
right?

2032
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,740
Yeah.

2033
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:59,740
If what the bubble shield is, is like the poor fruit, that means they might all have the poor

2034
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:01,740
fruit somehow.

2035
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:02,740
Maybe.

2036
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:03,740
Yeah, not sure.

2037
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:09,740
They all have a devil fruit ability, or it's just a fancy science thing.

2038
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,740
Yeah.

2039
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:18,940
Because the whole thing with devil fruits is that only one person can have them, and artificial

2040
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:26,940
devil fruits, like, clearly have allowed these fake, these seraphim to have, like, the same

2041
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:32,940
fruits or, like, fruits that already are in use, like Hancock's fruit, and Hancock's

2042
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:33,940
seraphim.

2043
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:34,940
It's the green blood, right?

2044
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:35,940
It's the green blood.

2045
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,940
Yeah.

2046
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,940
It's the green blood.

2047
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:39,940
You're telling me this guy created blood?

2048
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:43,940
Yeah, what was up with that?

2049
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,940
You created blood?

2050
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,940
What the fuck?

2051
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:50,940
Did he make an artificial fruit and then infuse?

2052
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:56,940
No, he made the green blood, like, out of the fruit power that the original had.

2053
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:01,940
Like, it's basically the DNA of the original that has the fruit.

2054
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,940
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

2055
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:07,940
Like, the reason, the reason the seraphim Hancock has the, I forget what her fruit is

2056
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:08,940
called.

2057
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:09,940
It's not Hanahana.

2058
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:10,940
Mellow, mellow, merrow, merrow.

2059
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:11,940
Yeah.

2060
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:12,940
Yeah, that sounds right.

2061
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:16,940
The reason Hancock has the merrow, merrow fruit is basically just because the original Hancock

2062
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:23,940
has the merrow, merrow fruit, and they just copied that ability with the green blood,

2063
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:24,940
I think.

2064
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,940
I don't know.

2065
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:31,940
So if you're a vampire, you could suck that blood, you get rid of it.

2066
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,940
Wait a minute.

2067
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:39,940
Now that you say that, now that you say that, that does make me wonder about, yeah, is there

2068
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:44,940
gonna be some weird shit when a Stussy vampire, Stussy drinks the green blood?

2069
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:45,940
It could be.

2070
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,940
It's gotta be.

2071
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,940
It's gotta be.

2072
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,940
It's a creation.

2073
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:51,940
They've made a thing about the blood, and now there's a vampire here.

2074
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:52,940
No, that's gotta happen.

2075
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:53,940
It's gotta happen.

2076
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,940
She's gonna suck the blood.

2077
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,940
It's Chekhov's blood.

2078
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:58,940
It's Chekhov's blood.

2079
01:37:58,940 --> 01:37:59,940
Chekhov's blood.

2080
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,940
Chekhov's every single character.

2081
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:07,940
Chekhov, check that off the list of things that I see coming.

2082
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:11,940
So those are the pacifists.

2083
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:16,940
Then at the top of Egghead, we got the Straw Hat Pirates all reunited.

2084
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:23,940
Brooke and Zorro now have their funny, cool, space age outfits.

2085
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,940
I like Zorro's jacket a lot.

2086
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,940
Zorro looks awesome.

2087
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:30,940
Brooke looks cool.

2088
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,940
Is that Stussy with the hair?

2089
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,940
Yeah, that's Stussy.

2090
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,940
Yeah.

2091
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:44,940
This panel of the three of them looks like some Tezuka.

2092
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:49,940
Looks like some Astro Boy shit to me.

2093
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:52,940
I mean, her boots might be Astro Boy inspired.

2094
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,940
Maybe that's it.

2095
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:56,940
Omega Man inspired.

2096
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:01,940
Just the way that her face is drawn does not...

2097
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,940
I don't know, it just looks different.

2098
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:06,940
Is it because she has lipstick?

2099
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:09,940
Maybe, or maybe just because the page doesn't scan that well,

2100
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,940
so the detail is not that clear.

2101
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:15,940
Something about the roundness of her head and the bigness,

2102
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:19,940
the wide-setness of her eyes and the haircut.

2103
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:21,940
And maybe it is the costume.

2104
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:24,940
Huh, it just looks Astro Boy.

2105
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:26,940
It's good.

2106
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,940
So we've got all the Vega punks.

2107
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,940
Most of the Vega punks.

2108
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:34,940
Besides the actual real guy and the straw hat pirates.

2109
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:36,940
It's called Stella now,

2110
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:40,940
which is a really weird name for him, but okay.

2111
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:42,940
Yeah, why did they call him Stella?

2112
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:45,940
I guess they need a name for him.

2113
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,940
I don't know why he's called the Stella,

2114
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:56,940
but I guess, yeah, maybe it makes more sense in Japanese.

2115
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:59,940
They're also trapped in the dome

2116
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:02,940
because they've lost control of the laser defense shield.

2117
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:05,940
So it's permanently on for now.

2118
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,940
How did that happen?

2119
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,940
I think he explains it.

2120
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:13,940
It was probably some sort of seraphim when they smashed some stuff.

2121
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:16,940
That happened because they did blow up the lab a bit.

2122
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:21,940
Okay, so it's just the machines are going haywire

2123
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:24,940
and we'll be blasted with lasers if we leave the dome?

2124
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,940
Yeah.

2125
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,940
I don't think he actually explains.

2126
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,940
He says we've lost control of the frontier dome.

2127
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:32,940
Yeah.

2128
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:33,940
And that's it.

2129
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:34,940
I mean, okay.

2130
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:36,940
He's just going to figure out a way to repair it.

2131
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:39,940
So it's probably the seraphim blew it up

2132
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,940
with some important something or other.

2133
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,940
Yeah.

2134
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:45,940
So they also can't find Vega punk.

2135
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:47,940
He's not on some of the cameras.

2136
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,940
Some of the cameras are out of commission.

2137
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:52,940
So they're all going to check out where he could be.

2138
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,940
Yeah.

2139
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:01,940
We know that he's in the paw paw memory room

2140
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:05,940
with Bonnie who is seeing...

2141
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,940
Is that Kuma?

2142
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:11,940
Is that big baby Kuma crying in a field?

2143
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:12,940
Yes.

2144
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:13,940
I believe so.

2145
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:17,940
There has been in an SBS

2146
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:21,940
Oda Drew at the time.

2147
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:25,940
Shichibukai as kids.

2148
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:26,940
Oh.

2149
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:28,940
Which included Blackbeard, I think.

2150
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:31,940
He just drew a bunch of them, what they look like as kids.

2151
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:34,940
And I think Kuma was involved in that.

2152
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:37,940
So I think this is what Kuma looked like.

2153
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:38,940
And now it's confirmed.

2154
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:41,940
Well, not confirmed, but like in the actual comic we see.

2155
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,940
I mean, I assume this is Kuma.

2156
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:44,940
Yeah.

2157
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:45,940
Who else would this be?

2158
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:46,940
Yeah.

2159
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,940
I mean, being beaten by some...

2160
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,940
It's Koma.

2161
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:53,940
You know, they bash his freaking head open.

2162
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:59,940
Being beaten by shadowy men with bats for reasons unknown.

2163
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,940
Yeah, they beat him.

2164
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:06,940
And so it's so hard that he got a chiseled jaw.

2165
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,940
Wait.

2166
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,940
That's not literal.

2167
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:12,940
That would be really funny.

2168
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,940
So he's crying, they're hitting him.

2169
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:16,940
They say, get your ass back now.

2170
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:18,940
If you escape, they'll kill the rest of us.

2171
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:21,940
So he's like in some sort of...

2172
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,940
I'm going to say he's a slave at this point.

2173
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:32,940
Like enslaved maybe on Marishwa or in some sort of thing like that.

2174
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:34,940
And he's trying to escape.

2175
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,940
And if he escapes, they'll be punished as well.

2176
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:39,940
So that's like a way to keep them in line.

2177
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:45,940
So they beat each other up and take each other back.

2178
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:46,940
Yeah.

2179
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:57,940
Or maybe it's like a buster call situation where the Marines are killing everyone to keep some information under control or something.

2180
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:02,940
They're doing an Ohara to point out what I guess would be before Ohara.

2181
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:03,940
I don't know.

2182
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:11,940
I feel like the fact that these shadowy figures are saying they'll kill the rest of us means that he was with them.

2183
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:12,940
Yeah.

2184
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:17,940
And they're all like together but fighting each other for their own survival.

2185
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:20,940
And he's like, if I go back, I'll die.

2186
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:25,940
Which probably means something terrible.

2187
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:31,940
Probably not prison, more likely slavery and perhaps in Marishwa.

2188
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:40,940
And at the very end there, there's like those fancy buildings and then the weird guy with a weird hairdo in shadow.

2189
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:41,940
Yeah.

2190
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,940
I think that might be a Tenri Bito.

2191
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,940
Oh, yeah.

2192
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,940
Yeah, you know what?

2193
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:48,940
Highfalutin who cares.

2194
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:49,940
But he's got sad eyes.

2195
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,940
So maybe that's his dad.

2196
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,940
Maybe his dad was like one of those.

2197
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:55,940
Maybe he's got some connection to Marishwa.

2198
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:59,940
Maybe that's why he's climbing the fucking thing right now.

2199
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:00,940
Hmm.

2200
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:03,940
I see what I kind of see.

2201
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:07,940
It's hard to tell if that's sad eyes or what.

2202
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,940
My scan is not like super amazing.

2203
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:12,940
You kind of, yeah, I see what you mean.

2204
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,940
Is that what makes sense?

2205
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:15,940
Yeah, okay.

2206
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:17,940
I'll put what my scan shows.

2207
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:22,940
It's pretty clear that he's got decidedly sad and not angry eyes.

2208
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:27,940
Oh, this is, yeah, this is much clearer than my version.

2209
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:29,940
Yeah.

2210
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,940
So he's getting beaten for trying to leave somewhere.

2211
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:33,940
Probably right.

2212
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:34,940
Yeah.

2213
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,940
I think, yeah, Marishwa makes sense.

2214
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:37,940
Hmm.

2215
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:38,940
And Bonnie can't stand it.

2216
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:43,940
She has to, she has to, this is in the memory bubble.

2217
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,940
And she leaves it.

2218
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:50,940
She can't hack it.

2219
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:53,940
Her resolve wasn't strong enough.

2220
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:54,940
But she wants to try again.

2221
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:56,940
She wants to figure it out because she needs to.

2222
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:58,940
She needs to know everything.

2223
01:44:58,940 --> 01:44:59,940
Pathetic.

2224
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,940
Can't weather an entire lifetime of suffering under slavery.

2225
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:04,940
What a bitch.

2226
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:08,940
What a dumb bitch or wife of mine.

2227
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:14,940
Just, just, just, just die.

2228
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:15,940
Yeah.

2229
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:16,940
Okay.

2230
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:17,940
Looking good.

2231
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:18,940
Looking good.

2232
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:23,940
But you know, is this my first time noticing that she has like a ring in her like cheek?

2233
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,940
I don't know if that's a ring.

2234
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:28,940
I think that's like a tattoo or some sort of.

2235
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:31,940
Oh, like some future makeup.

2236
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:34,940
I don't think, let me check.

2237
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:37,940
No, the one where it's like after the sad eyes, right?

2238
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:43,940
After the sad eyes, it really looks like she has like a piercing ring through her like,

2239
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:45,940
I don't know what you call, it's not quite the cheek.

2240
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:49,940
It's like under the eye.

2241
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:50,940
Hmm.

2242
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:51,940
Oh my God.

2243
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:52,940
I've never noticed that she has that.

2244
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:53,940
Yeah.

2245
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:55,940
She has that in like pre timeskip.

2246
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,940
What is that?

2247
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,940
Appearance.

2248
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:00,940
She has it in pre timeskip too.

2249
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:01,940
Yeah.

2250
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,940
I'm looking at the wiki.

2251
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,940
Well, she's called jewelry Bonnie.

2252
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:06,940
Oh my God.

2253
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:11,940
She's got jewelry in her freaking eye skin.

2254
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:14,940
Just jammed in there.

2255
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:21,940
Her outfit consists of low, midriff, cleavage, orange, black stripe, buckle, spandos.

2256
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:24,940
Where's the bit about the thing?

2257
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:25,940
Laces.

2258
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:29,940
Are you looking on the wiki for an article about her under eye piercing?

2259
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:35,940
Yeah, they usually have an extensive appearance part.

2260
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:38,940
She has an anti eyebrow below her right eye.

2261
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:42,940
Anti eyebrow?

2262
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:43,940
Bright red lipstick.

2263
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:44,940
What does that mean?

2264
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:45,940
Anti eyebrow?

2265
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,940
Yeah.

2266
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:47,940
Oh.

2267
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:48,940
That's what it's called, I guess.

2268
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:49,940
Okay.

2269
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:51,940
Anti eyebrow is a facial piercing.

2270
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:52,940
Yeah.

2271
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:53,940
Okay.

2272
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:54,940
So it is a piercing.

2273
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:55,940
Hmm.

2274
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:58,940
Never noticed it before.

2275
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:01,940
Most, when you Google it, most people don't have rings.

2276
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:04,940
Most people have like a little one of the double stud.

2277
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:05,940
Two dots.

2278
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:06,940
Yeah.

2279
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:11,940
She's got a fucked up, a reverse anti eyebrow.

2280
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:16,940
That's just a reverse anti eyebrow is just an eyebrow.

2281
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:20,940
She's got a metallic eyebrow.

2282
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:21,940
Hell.

2283
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,940
Just on top of a regular one.

2284
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,940
Hell yeah.

2285
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:25,940
Okay.

2286
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:26,940
Okay.

2287
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:33,940
So after that, after she chickens out of the dream, we see one of the punks.

2288
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:35,940
Punk 04, I forget his name.

2289
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:39,940
Is it not Archimedes?

2290
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:41,940
Aristotle.

2291
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,940
Barkimedes.

2292
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:43,940
Yeah.

2293
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,940
One of them.

2294
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:49,940
The sensible robot guy and he's walking.

2295
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:52,940
And there's a clinkity clank behind him and an explosion.

2296
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:54,940
We don't really know anything about that.

2297
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:55,940
Yeah.

2298
01:47:55,940 --> 01:48:00,940
Can't think who the hell that could be because we've got all the straw hats.

2299
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:06,940
And we've got the seraphim and the vagapunks in one area up there.

2300
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:11,940
And then there's vagapunk and Bonnie or where they are.

2301
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:17,940
And Labo and Luchy and Kaku are unconscious.

2302
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,940
Labo and Kuchi.

2303
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,940
Labo and Kuchi.

2304
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:25,940
And then we've got like all of the fucking other people are down below the thing.

2305
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:28,940
So what is this exploding clink-clank thing?

2306
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:31,940
Is this a secret enemy robot?

2307
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:32,940
I die.

2308
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:33,940
I die.

2309
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:34,940
I die.

2310
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:35,940
I die.

2311
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:36,940
I don't even know.

2312
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:39,940
I can't even think what it is.

2313
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:40,940
It's zero.

2314
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,940
It's...

2315
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:42,940
It's zero.

2316
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:43,940
It's Mega Man.

2317
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:44,940
It's a mystery.

2318
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,940
I've been awakened.

2319
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:46,940
Two Bon Clay.

2320
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:47,940
Oh my god.

2321
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,940
He's...

2322
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:49,940
He's...

2323
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:54,940
He's so known for clinking and clanking when he walks.

2324
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:55,940
True.

2325
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:59,940
So we have no idea what's going on there.

2326
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:04,940
But then we cut to over in big news, Morgan's flying ship.

2327
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:05,940
Big news, Morgan.

2328
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:13,940
Disapplying me again on his wee news tea kettle, teapot dome here.

2329
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:17,940
If I can seagulls lifting it up.

2330
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:18,940
That's funny.

2331
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:19,940
Very cute.

2332
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:22,940
Very cute little vessel.

2333
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,940
Okay, so he's heard about...

2334
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:25,940
He's got an insane scoop.

2335
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:26,940
Yeah.

2336
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:29,940
He's on the phone with somebody who is aware of what is happening.

2337
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:35,940
So he's got a guy on the inside of the Marines who can let him know about these things ahead

2338
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:36,940
of time.

2339
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:40,940
And he's learned that they intend to assassinate the Marines.

2340
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:44,940
The world government intends to assassinate Dr. Vegapunk.

2341
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,940
And he's the one who says Uhara.

2342
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:47,940
It's like, ah.

2343
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:49,940
Yeah, this is just like their occurrence of the Ahara.

2344
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:55,940
But okay, the government will be seen as bad if they do that because people like Vegapunk

2345
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:59,940
because he invented electricity.

2346
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:00,940
He invented electricity.

2347
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:04,940
And they're like, well, the government shouldn't kill him.

2348
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:11,940
So he says he's going to write the headline that Luffy did it.

2349
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:16,940
Which is going to be very plausible since he'll be seen with Luffy if they escape.

2350
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:22,940
And he's doing this because it's more entertaining.

2351
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:30,940
It's more entertaining and also the world government will appreciate that spin he says.

2352
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:34,940
So like he's going to get paid for that reading of it.

2353
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:35,940
Yeah.

2354
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,940
Which is probably how he's kept in power for so long.

2355
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:38,940
I thought.

2356
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,940
To do whatever he wants, but also.

2357
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:41,940
Damn.

2358
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:46,940
I really thought big news Morgan was all about like getting the real the real news out there.

2359
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:49,940
I really thought he was all about the real scoop.

2360
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:51,940
No, I always thought he was about the drama.

2361
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:58,940
The whole thing with him calling Luffy one of the new emperors of the sea was his idea

2362
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:00,940
because it would be like so fucking funny.

2363
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,940
He said that was his exact quote.

2364
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:09,940
Yeah, but it's but that was good because we like Luffy and I want him to say good things about him.

2365
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:13,940
And I don't like when he says bad things about my boy.

2366
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,940
But I mean true.

2367
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:18,940
But I don't think this is that bad.

2368
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:21,940
And I also don't think Luffy would care so much.

2369
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:24,940
It's like it's like how one.

2370
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,940
He killed that he killed Vega punk.

2371
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:28,940
No, no, that he kidnapped him.

2372
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:32,940
Because because Luffy.

2373
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:38,940
Like even right at the beginning, the whole idea of like people liking him was like, I don't care.

2374
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:41,940
I don't care about the town coming to congratulate me for saving them.

2375
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:43,940
Let's get the fuck out of here, everybody.

2376
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:49,940
Like that's that's sort of been his thing is like he doesn't need the validation of the world.

2377
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:51,940
He'll just do whatever he wants.

2378
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,940
I mean, this is not going to upset him.

2379
01:51:53,940 --> 01:52:02,940
No, I mean, listen, I'm not worried about like, oh, is Luffy going to be mad at my boy big news?

2380
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:05,940
I don't know.

2381
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:11,940
It's just a little bit just a little bit disappointing to see big news be like, well, hey, let's just make Luffy the bad guy.

2382
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,940
You know, he's an easy scapegoat.

2383
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:16,940
But that's just going to be good for his reputation.

2384
01:52:16,940 --> 01:52:17,940
It's going to be like buggy.

2385
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,940
People are going to start fearing him more.

2386
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:22,940
I mean, he's going to get into more battles.

2387
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,940
I think it's it's positive.

2388
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:30,940
And that it's like it's it's like he says it's not about news isn't about factor fiction.

2389
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:32,940
It's about entertainment.

2390
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:33,940
Yeah.

2391
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:39,940
Well, you know what my my my opinion of big news will probably never recover from this.

2392
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:42,940
I thought he was a man of integrity.

2393
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:45,940
But I always knew he was a chaos man.

2394
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:46,940
That's that's fair.

2395
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:48,940
That's reasonable.

2396
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:58,940
So what I appreciate about him is that because he's like this, he's not going to do he's not going to cover up things for the purposes of the government.

2397
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:01,940
He's going to do whatever is the coolest.

2398
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:02,940
He's going to put out.

2399
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:03,940
Yeah.

2400
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:07,940
When Luffy says, like, I found one piece and I'm going to tell the whole world about it.

2401
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:10,940
And Big News Morgan is like, oh, the world government would hate that.

2402
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:11,940
That's so funny.

2403
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:12,940
I'll sell.

2404
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:13,940
I'll tell everyone.

2405
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:14,940
The world government would hate it.

2406
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:16,940
But that is a really big scoop, though.

2407
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,940
That's like a really big scoop.

2408
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:19,940
Yeah.

2409
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,940
So you got to scoop it out.

2410
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:27,940
And then how old Big News Morgan is, how long has he been doing the news?

2411
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:30,940
Is he I mean, he's an adult.

2412
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:32,940
So he'll be he'll have been around for a while.

2413
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:35,940
But like, OK, has he been around during Roger's time?

2414
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:38,940
Is this a new character?

2415
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:41,940
Truly impossible to say.

2416
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,940
This might be a stupid question.

2417
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:45,940
Is he like a zoan fruit guy?

2418
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:48,940
Like, why is he a bird man?

2419
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:51,940
You know, I have no idea.

2420
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,940
Crazy question.

2421
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:58,940
You might have thought to ask this before, but why is he a bird man?

2422
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:01,940
What's going on with that?

2423
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,940
He's got to be a zoan fruit user, right?

2424
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:06,940
No, I like the idea is just a bird.

2425
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:10,940
Half animal people are not just like around for no reason.

2426
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:11,940
I know.

2427
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:12,940
This isn't dwarf fortress.

2428
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:17,940
It's weird because like in stuff like Dragon Ball, there'll be like human characters,

2429
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,940
but every so often it's just a panda guy.

2430
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:21,940
That's just a fucking rhinoceros.

2431
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,940
And you just got a role with that.

2432
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,940
And you just got to be like, OK, sure.

2433
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:26,940
That's just how it is.

2434
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:33,940
And that this has a lot of like similarities to like the the the sort of playful nature of Dragon Ball.

2435
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:34,940
Reminds me of.

2436
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:37,940
I just sort of think, oh, yeah, an animal person like that's fine.

2437
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,940
Maybe he's a mink.

2438
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,940
Oh, yeah.

2439
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,940
Yeah, you know what?

2440
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:42,940
That's actually.

2441
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:43,940
That's that's the most.

2442
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:45,940
That's actually quite quite plausible.

2443
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:46,940
Yeah.

2444
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:47,940
Wait a minute.

2445
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,940
I just said there aren't just animal people around, but yes, there are.

2446
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:53,940
And they're literally and we had like a whole freaking chapter about them.

2447
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:54,940
I forgot.

2448
01:54:54,940 --> 01:55:01,940
This reminds me in a not Burger Creek, Krug Krug Smash, the dwarf fortress guy.

2449
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:07,940
He had in one of his tournament arcs, one of the one of the fighters in the turn in the dwarf.

2450
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:08,940
Well, they weren't all dwarfs.

2451
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:12,940
One of the fighters in the tournaments was this awesome swan man.

2452
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:18,940
He was a he was a half swan half man with like a he was like a rapier like sword duelist guy.

2453
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:20,940
And he was so freaking cool, man.

2454
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,940
I'm so fucking sick.

2455
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,940
I love Krug Smash.

2456
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:27,940
I like Birdman as well.

2457
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:31,940
This guy just looks like he's he's just literally his big bird.

2458
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:34,940
Yeah, he's just he's just big bird.

2459
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:35,940
He's just big bird.

2460
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,940
What if big bird was chaotic neutral?

2461
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:46,940
What if big bird just wrote the news and just spread misinformation and propaganda?

2462
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:49,940
It's just for fun.

2463
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:51,940
Bird is probably a relative.

2464
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:54,940
I mean, he's just big bird.

2465
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:56,940
He just looks exactly like him.

2466
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:02,940
And then Vivi and Waple are here for some fucking reason.

2467
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:05,940
OK, so this is interesting.

2468
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:08,940
The big like black shadow with sad eyes behind Waple.

2469
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:15,940
Is that like that's it's just weird how like his like coat or whatever looks exactly like those shadow people.

2470
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:17,940
From the Paw Paw memory.

2471
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:20,940
That might just be a coincidence, but I think that is a coincidence.

2472
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:21,940
Very strange.

2473
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:22,940
It is very odd.

2474
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:27,940
I don't I don't exactly know what's going on with that like visually, but whatever.

2475
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:34,940
Yeah, so Vivi and Waple being monarchs were at the reverie.

2476
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:40,940
The reverie where we learned later that King Cobra of Alabasta was killed.

2477
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:43,940
Yeah, by presumably Savo who ran away.

2478
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:44,940
Right.

2479
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:48,940
Morgan was also there.

2480
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,940
Was the reverie recent?

2481
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:54,940
I think it was during Wano that they had it.

2482
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:56,940
OK, so that's not even that long ago.

2483
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,940
No, so yeah.

2484
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:03,940
So following that, I suppose.

2485
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:11,940
Morgan, who was there probably just for journalism, like here's what happened for the scoop for the scoop.

2486
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:15,940
He's there for the scoop.

2487
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:21,940
He has them on his ship Waple and Vivi just by themselves.

2488
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:27,940
I don't see any of the other people from their kingdoms, which is like it's very it's very sus.

2489
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:28,940
It's very confusing.

2490
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:30,940
Like what the fuck happened?

2491
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:32,940
Why did King Cobra die?

2492
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:42,940
They said the scoop was I think Sanji reacted to the news that Cobra was dead and Vivi was missing, right?

2493
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:44,940
Right, that's true.

2494
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,940
Sanji was like, oh, Vivi's missing.

2495
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:51,940
I think she was like suspected dead, but they all said like no way she can she can take care of herself.

2496
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,940
Someone was going to want to go rescue her.

2497
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,940
It was probably Sanji.

2498
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:59,940
Yeah, I remember it's coming back to me.

2499
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:02,940
It's interesting.

2500
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:08,940
So Waple, I think, well, they've known, they had a history, like even when she was little.

2501
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:22,940
I think there was like, he was like an asshole king and she showed how proper she can be by not starting a war over the fact that he like hit her or something.

2502
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:25,940
That sounds familiar, yeah.

2503
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:30,940
So they've seen each other at other reveries, I guess.

2504
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:33,940
Their kingdoms are like right next to each other, right?

2505
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:35,940
Sort of close, yeah.

2506
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:43,940
Draw Island was like the first island that the straw hats landed in, not the red line.

2507
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:44,940
Grand Line.

2508
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:47,940
And then Alabaster was like right after, so they must be close to each other.

2509
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:49,940
Yeah, it's nearby.

2510
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:50,940
It wasn't the first.

2511
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:55,940
The first one was the island with all of the bounty hunters.

2512
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:56,940
Oh.

2513
01:58:56,940 --> 01:59:01,940
And then it was the island with the dinosaur skeletons and the giant giants.

2514
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:03,940
That's too many fucking islands.

2515
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:04,940
God damn it.

2516
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:06,940
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

2517
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:10,940
And then that's where Nami got the disease in the jungle.

2518
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:15,940
And so they had to go to Drum Island to cure Nami from the disease.

2519
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:16,940
Nami got diseased?

2520
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:17,940
No.

2521
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,940
Do you not remember?

2522
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:23,940
The whole reason they needed a doctor was that she was going to die and they had to

2523
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:29,940
climb Drum Island's frozen thing to get to the best doctor in the land.

2524
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:37,940
And the whole idea was like Wapo had banished or stolen all of the doctors for himself

2525
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:40,940
and taken them all with him when he became a pirate.

2526
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:44,940
So the place had no doctors except for that crazy old lady on top of the mountain,

2527
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:47,940
which is why it was such a tense thing.

2528
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:48,940
Because we need a doctor.

2529
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,940
Oh, there's no doctors.

2530
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:50,940
But you've got to climb that.

2531
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:51,940
And it's like, fuck.

2532
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:52,940
Okay.

2533
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:55,940
Yeah, I forgot that Nami was sick.

2534
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:58,940
But I remember the rest of that.

2535
01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,940
Okay.

2536
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:03,940
Anyway, yeah.

2537
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:09,940
I've forgotten more about One Piece than you'll ever know, kid.

2538
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:10,940
Lamal.

2539
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:13,940
Okay, so I'm trying to speculate.

2540
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:16,940
I'm trying to think what could have gone down.

2541
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:22,940
Wake Morgan says that a big talk for the girl who was boiling her eyes out yesterday,

2542
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:26,940
meaning she was crying, probably because her dad's dead.

2543
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,940
So that might be confirmed he did die.

2544
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:33,940
Yeah, that makes sense.

2545
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:35,940
It's still like very odd.

2546
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:36,940
Why?

2547
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:39,940
And I'm pretty sure Saebo didn't actually do it.

2548
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:41,940
It's like a cover up story.

2549
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:43,940
Yeah, definitely.

2550
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:50,940
But the fact that Big News Morgan is the one who broke that story and also the one who kidnapped Vivi or has Vivi.

2551
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:51,940
Yeah.

2552
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:54,940
And Waffle says Morgan Chan took us in.

2553
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:55,940
Don't be rude.

2554
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:58,940
So it was like a favor to them.

2555
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:03,940
So maybe he spun the story the way the government wanted it, but he knows more about what actually happened.

2556
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:04,940
And so does Vivi.

2557
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:05,940
Yeah.

2558
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:06,940
And Waffle.

2559
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:09,940
Yeah, they're doing some cover up.

2560
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:12,940
They're doing some cover up stuff.

2561
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:19,940
So like if Vivi and Waffle were found to have known the truth, they probably would have been killed by the world government as well.

2562
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:21,940
You mean about Cobra?

2563
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:26,940
Yeah, like if Cobra learned something that he shouldn't have, they murdered him.

2564
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:29,940
Or like he confronted them.

2565
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:30,940
Yeah.

2566
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:33,940
It's like there's so much mystery going on.

2567
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:35,940
Did Cobra learn something?

2568
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,940
Do we know why he was killed?

2569
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:39,940
No, we only know that he was killed.

2570
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:40,940
Yeah.

2571
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:41,940
And Natsaba supposedly did it.

2572
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:42,940
Yeah.

2573
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:43,940
Okay.

2574
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,940
Maybe he's not dead.

2575
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:47,940
Maybe that was a cover up too.

2576
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:48,940
No.

2577
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:49,940
No.

2578
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:56,940
I feel like characters dying is now finally becoming a serious thing.

2579
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:57,940
Yeah.

2580
02:01:57,940 --> 02:02:01,940
It's still occasionally not like permanent.

2581
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:05,940
Like with a big mom's husband pound.

2582
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:06,940
Yeah.

2583
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:11,940
Like sacrifices himself and he doesn't die, he's fine.

2584
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:18,940
But when Pedro sacrificed himself with that giant bomb and he is dead, but nobody believed it, I didn't.

2585
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:21,940
But then he's just continually not been alive.

2586
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:24,940
So it's like, I guess he is dead.

2587
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:25,940
Yeah.

2588
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:26,940
Why would they do so much of that?

2589
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:27,940
He could be dead.

2590
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:28,940
He could be dead.

2591
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:33,940
But I mean, they're keeping a secret.

2592
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,940
So I mean, what secret could they be guarding?

2593
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,940
I mean, I don't know.

2594
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:39,940
Could something involving Cobra's death.

2595
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:45,940
So immediately my mind goes to, well, maybe there is no Cobra's death actually.

2596
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:49,940
But yeah, maybe he was killed for knowing something.

2597
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:50,940
Killed for knowing something.

2598
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:51,940
Yeah, I guess it.

2599
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:56,940
There's a lot of being killed for knowing something seems to be what the government does.

2600
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,940
So yeah, plausible.

2601
02:02:58,940 --> 02:02:59,940
Yeah.

2602
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:04,940
Like Sabo, the whole like revolutionary army people at Marishwa during the Revry.

2603
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:07,940
Sabo being blamed.

2604
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:10,940
Did Sabo show up at the Revry?

2605
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,940
They were there to rescue Kuma.

2606
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:15,940
That's why the revolutionary guys were there.

2607
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,940
They found him.

2608
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:17,940
They brought him back.

2609
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:23,940
But then he did the thing where he woke up and he jumps towards the red line again.

2610
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:26,940
Was Kuma, Kuma was at the Revry.

2611
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,940
Did someone bring him there?

2612
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,940
Was someone like controlling him?

2613
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:35,940
Kuma has, at that time, had become like a slave for like people.

2614
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:40,940
The Tenryu Bito people were just using it as like a dog or like a horse or dog.

2615
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:43,940
Oh no, just like when he was a boy.

2616
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:44,940
Yeah.

2617
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:48,940
And he was like, ooh, I'm so, it's slaved right now.

2618
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:50,940
They hated seeing him like that.

2619
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:51,940
Right.

2620
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:52,940
I think Bunny was there as well.

2621
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:54,940
She was trying to free him.

2622
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:56,940
I don't know how she got out.

2623
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:00,940
Maybe she will know more about the Revry as well.

2624
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:02,940
She just hasn't mentioned it yet.

2625
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:04,940
Oh man, Bunny was at the Revry?

2626
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,940
I'm pretty sure.

2627
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:10,940
I remember her being like sneaking around with like child form or something.

2628
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:13,940
I don't remember that at all.

2629
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:16,940
I mean, we didn't know that she was Kuma's daughter back then.

2630
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:17,940
No.

2631
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:18,940
We just found that out.

2632
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:23,940
So maybe that, I don't remember that.

2633
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:25,940
Okay.

2634
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:26,940
Yeah.

2635
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,940
Hold cake.

2636
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:28,940
Lovely.

2637
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:29,940
Revry.

2638
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:33,940
Bunny entered Marishwa posing as Queen Dojo Connie of the Sorbet Kingdom.

2639
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:37,940
She later went to the Sliths, your dragon gate at the Panjia Castle and snuck into the

2640
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:42,940
domain of the gods when the gate opened for an injured Charles.

2641
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:44,940
I guess that's just how she got in the door.

2642
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:49,940
She was hiding and she saw how Rosward, who is these people, mistreated the

2643
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:54,940
Was Charles, is Charles one of the whole Cake Island people?

2644
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:56,940
No, Charles is the guy.

2645
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:57,940
Okay.

2646
02:04:57,940 --> 02:04:58,940
I clicked on his thing.

2647
02:04:58,940 --> 02:05:04,940
He's the guy who at Shabaudi Archipelago, Luffy punched in the face causing the admirals

2648
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,940
to be called.

2649
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:06,940
Oh yeah.

2650
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:10,940
That like fucking fat pug looking guy who was wearing the, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2651
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:12,940
He's one of the, one of the Tenryubito.

2652
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:13,940
Yes.

2653
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:14,940
Yeah.

2654
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:15,940
Okay.

2655
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:21,940
So this guy was seeing, opening the gate for an injured Charles.

2656
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,940
I forgot why he was injured.

2657
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:25,940
Is it because Luffy punched him?

2658
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:28,940
Well, this would have been after the time.

2659
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:29,940
Oh yeah.

2660
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:30,940
That was two years ago.

2661
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:31,940
No.

2662
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,940
So it's just, I guess, some other thing.

2663
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,940
Someone else punched him.

2664
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:37,940
Someone else punched him.

2665
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:40,940
Wait, wait, did like his dad punch him or something?

2666
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:43,940
Because he was being a brat or something like that?

2667
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:44,940
Something like that, yeah.

2668
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:45,940
Yeah.

2669
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:46,940
And you know what?

2670
02:05:46,940 --> 02:05:47,940
You know what?

2671
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:51,940
Unless this is like a common haircut.

2672
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:52,940
I'm looking at the-

2673
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:59,940
That high, yeah, the shadow, like the weird like high like samurai top knot thing.

2674
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:04,940
Both Charles and this other person mentioned Rosward, which is the guy's dad, I think.

2675
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:08,940
Also, they all have that, that funny bone shaped like hairstyle.

2676
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:10,940
You fucking, good eye.

2677
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:11,940
Good eye.

2678
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:12,940
Yeah, good eye.

2679
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:15,940
Yeah, you caught it.

2680
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:21,940
So she saw how enslaved Kuma was being mistreated and she was disgusted.

2681
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:22,940
Right.

2682
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:28,940
And she briefly encountered Sabo, apparently, but we don't see anything else that happened.

2683
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:29,940
So she might know.

2684
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:30,940
She might be-

2685
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:35,940
She was there and she saw Sabo and we know that Cobra is supposedly dead.

2686
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:42,940
So presumably Sabo would have done it at the reverie, this killing of Cobra.

2687
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:45,940
Presuming that he did that at all, but yeah.

2688
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:46,940
Right, right.

2689
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:50,940
So this all happened and Jewelry Bonnie is with us now.

2690
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:54,940
Do we know anything else about Cobra's death or just that he's dead?

2691
02:06:54,940 --> 02:07:00,940
No, we heard about it in the news and I guess now we know that it's probably true because

2692
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:03,940
VV was crying, although that may be a misdirection.

2693
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:06,940
It may be a misdirection about crying about something else.

2694
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:07,940
She could have been crying.

2695
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:08,940
I don't know.

2696
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:14,940
The fact that Vivi's here and that Sabo is clearly being framed makes me think that maybe

2697
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:18,940
Cobra's not actually dead.

2698
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:20,940
Where would he be?

2699
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:21,940
Like locked up.

2700
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:24,940
They got him in a fricking, I don't know, they got him in a barrel or something.

2701
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:26,940
Put him in a barrel?

2702
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:27,940
Why wouldn't they kill him?

2703
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:32,940
I mean, maybe he's doing some, I don't know, they're hiding something.

2704
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:33,940
They got a secret.

2705
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:39,940
They got a secret and it's VV and it's all a big mystery and it's all cover up secrets

2706
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:41,940
and lies, so.

2707
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:48,940
I suppose if there were to be like a cool revelation, like reveal, Bonnie would be the one to say

2708
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:51,940
Cobra isn't dead and everyone would be like, what?

2709
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,940
Why do you know that?

2710
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:53,940
I was there.

2711
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:55,940
Like that could be a moment.

2712
02:07:55,940 --> 02:07:58,940
And then they all go, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2713
02:07:58,940 --> 02:07:59,940
When was the reverie?

2714
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:00,940
Like how long ago was it?

2715
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:02,940
Like how much time has passed since then?

2716
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:03,940
What island?

2717
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:06,940
Why did they go to Drum Island?

2718
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:09,940
Yeah, they've forgotten as well.

2719
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:10,940
They forget everything.

2720
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:13,940
Too much to keep in your head.

2721
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:16,940
Damn, I love One Piece, it's so good.

2722
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:18,940
It is so good.

2723
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:22,940
It's so freaking good right now, yeah.

2724
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:28,940
I really get a lot out of picking it apart like this though.

2725
02:08:28,940 --> 02:08:32,940
If we didn't do this, I would just kind of read it and be like, oh, okay.

2726
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:34,940
Oh, VV and Big News Morgan, okay.

2727
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:38,940
Well, see you next week.

2728
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:39,940
Yeah, it's good.

2729
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:40,940
It's good shit.

2730
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,940
Commenters, what do you think?

2731
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:48,940
Is Cobra dead or is that part of the cover up?

2732
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:51,940
Sound off in the comments below.

2733
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:57,940
I think it's plausible that he's dead just because as a character, he has an air that

2734
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:05,940
could be the new ruler of Alabasta and it's not like he's necessary as a person who needs

2735
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:07,940
to stay alive for narrative reasons.

2736
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:13,940
It would be tragic, it's good for tragedy, it could be like a real death.

2737
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:14,940
I guess I'm just thinking.

2738
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:15,940
It depends.

2739
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:19,940
We'll find out when we know more about how did he die.

2740
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:22,940
Did he die in front of a big room where everyone he saw that he died?

2741
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:28,940
I guess I'm just thinking that if the cover up is not that Cobra is alive, then I don't

2742
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:34,940
know what else it could be, but it could be something else and we'll just find out later.

2743
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:38,940
Because they're colluding on something.

2744
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:46,940
There's the aspect to remember as well of the world government being formed by a bunch of

2745
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:54,940
immigrants deciding to band together and Alabasta being one of the main holdouts for not joining.

2746
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:57,940
They never joined the world government.

2747
02:09:57,940 --> 02:10:04,940
They just go there as diplomatically is a good thing to do.

2748
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:11,940
If there's any knowledge that he has about the void century that they don't want the

2749
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:17,940
world to know, he would have had to keep quiet about it until he said, I'm going to tell

2750
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:19,940
everyone and kill himself by saying that.

2751
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:26,940
That would be a pretty darned evil thing for the world government to do, to be like, hey,

2752
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:35,940
everyone join our secret club and one guy's like, no thanks and then they just kill him.

2753
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:39,940
Well, I mean they would have killed him long, long ago.

2754
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:43,940
Yeah, if it were just for that.

2755
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:46,940
So I think the fact that it's King Kerber is relevant.

2756
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:49,940
It's not just some guy we know.

2757
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:53,940
It's the Alabasta guy.

2758
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:58,940
Vivi says, there's no way Luffy would do such a thing.

2759
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,940
This is why I hate the government.

2760
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:02,940
All right, here's my theory.

2761
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:04,940
He doesn't say that on my thing.

2762
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:06,940
What is she saying?

2763
02:11:06,940 --> 02:11:09,940
She says the economic journal is such a rag.

2764
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:10,940
This fake news sucks.

2765
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:11,940
That's what she's saying.

2766
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:14,940
The economic journal is such a rag?

2767
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:15,940
Yeah.

2768
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,940
That's what she, really?

2769
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:19,940
I mean, I'll post it.

2770
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,940
Is that what the newspaper is called?

2771
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:26,940
The economic journal?

2772
02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:28,940
A dinner.

2773
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:29,940
I don't think so.

2774
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:33,940
I think she's just saying journalism's stupid.

2775
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:37,940
Luffy, the economic journal,

2776
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:39,940
Luffy would never do something like that.

2777
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:41,940
The economic journal is such a rag.

2778
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:42,940
That's way better.

2779
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:46,940
Mine says, yeah, there's no way Luffy would do such a thing.

2780
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:50,940
This is why I hate the government.

2781
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:54,940
Yeah, I guess the way that Wapol responds

2782
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:57,940
is like the government might be spying on us.

2783
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,940
So like we can't say anything bad about the government,

2784
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:02,940
which is why they may have translated it that way.

2785
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:05,940
She actually borrowed my clothes and never washed them again.

2786
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:07,940
I lent some clothes to her.

2787
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:09,940
I won't wash those ever again.

2788
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:12,940
The government will erase us.

2789
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:14,940
We'll be erased immediately by the government.

2790
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:15,940
Keep your voice down.

2791
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,940
What if there's a wiretap snail?

2792
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:18,940
Don't be too loud.

2793
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:21,940
What if there are wiretap responder snails around here?

2794
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,940
Besides, Morg-Chan.

2795
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:25,940
Morg-Chan.

2796
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:29,940
Okay, interesting.

2797
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:31,940
Interesting.

2798
02:12:32,940 --> 02:12:34,940
Yeah, I guess it could be.

2799
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:37,940
It works as both because it's like,

2800
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:41,940
the newspapers are like bought and sold for by the government.

2801
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:44,940
And that's why he hates that this is fake

2802
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:46,940
because it's good for the government.

2803
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,940
I just think it's funny.

2804
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:49,940
I think it's a funnier line.

2805
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:51,940
The economic journal is such a rag.

2806
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:52,940
Yeah.

2807
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,940
But this is why I hate the...

2808
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:56,940
I was just gonna say,

2809
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:59,940
like really, really maybe they killed your dad

2810
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:01,940
and this is why you hate the government

2811
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:04,940
because journalistic standards have fallen these days.

2812
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:06,940
Like, come on.

2813
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:07,940
Yeah.

2814
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:09,940
I guess it could be both, though.

2815
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:11,940
I think it is meant as both.

2816
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:12,940
Yeah.

2817
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:14,940
And that's why it's like...

2818
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:15,940
Such a rag.

2819
02:13:15,940 --> 02:13:16,940
That's what I'm gonna say.

2820
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,940
Every time I don't like something,

2821
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:20,940
I'm gonna call it a rag.

2822
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:25,940
Every time you have a YouTube channel that I'm not fond of.

2823
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:28,940
Yeah, so Morg-Chan is doing this spin

2824
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,940
as a benefit for the world government.

2825
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:32,940
So whatever the spin is, it's like,

2826
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:33,940
oh, fuck you.

2827
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:34,940
Fuck the world government.

2828
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:36,940
And then Waipo is like,

2829
02:13:36,940 --> 02:13:38,940
you can't say bad things about the world government.

2830
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:39,940
They'll kill us.

2831
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:41,940
Probably like they killed King Cobra.

2832
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:42,940
He knows.

2833
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:43,940
I think he knows.

2834
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:45,940
I guess he has to maintain.

2835
02:13:45,940 --> 02:13:47,940
Like, he's gotta keep the world government

2836
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:49,940
liking what he's doing.

2837
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:53,940
But if a story is a big scoop

2838
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,940
and it's funny and entertaining,

2839
02:13:55,940 --> 02:13:58,940
it's published off the world government doesn't want him to.

2840
02:13:58,940 --> 02:13:59,940
Yeah.

2841
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:02,940
So I guess he's gotta walk a tightrope there.

2842
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:05,940
They appreciate him for what he does for them.

2843
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:08,940
And there's like, this big news Morgan is good for us,

2844
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,940
but he's a loose cannon.

2845
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:12,940
That's probably how they see him.

2846
02:14:12,940 --> 02:14:13,940
Yeah, yeah.

2847
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:15,940
I mean, kind of like Vagapunk.

2848
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:18,940
I also think Waipo's like being scared of the government

2849
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:22,940
and raising them for speaking bad is probably...

2850
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,940
That's probably where my mind goes for like,

2851
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:28,940
oh, they erased King Cobra because of what he said.

2852
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:30,940
We'll be erased immediately, but yeah,

2853
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:34,940
yeah, yeah, he might have reason to be afraid of that.

2854
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:35,940
True, actually.

2855
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:37,940
And it's also why both of them are here

2856
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:39,940
because they know that that's probably what happened

2857
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:42,940
or they know for sure that's what happened.

2858
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:46,940
So that's why big news Morgan has taken them under his wing.

2859
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:48,940
It's a bird.

2860
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:50,940
He really is.

2861
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:56,940
And it's like, if the government knows that they know,

2862
02:14:56,940 --> 02:14:57,940
they're in big trouble.

2863
02:14:57,940 --> 02:14:58,940
So I don't know where they're going.

2864
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:01,940
I guess they're staying with him for the time being.

2865
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:06,940
Where's their destination right now?

2866
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:11,940
I can't even venture a guess.

2867
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:15,940
Other than, are they also headed to Egghead?

2868
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:17,940
Are they going to Egghead right now?

2869
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:19,940
I don't know.

2870
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:20,940
I guess it would make sense.

2871
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:22,940
It's the only thing that pops to mind

2872
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:24,940
as to where they could be going.

2873
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:26,940
Yeah, I suppose they must be

2874
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:28,940
because they're going to take pictures

2875
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:30,940
and see what's going on.

2876
02:15:30,940 --> 02:15:33,940
I don't feel like big news Morgan would go there himself.

2877
02:15:33,940 --> 02:15:35,940
He's got like a network of people

2878
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:37,940
that like investigate stuff for him.

2879
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:39,940
So I wouldn't normally think like,

2880
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:41,940
oh yeah, if there's a scoop,

2881
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,940
he's going to go there and whip out his camera

2882
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:44,940
and be like, oh yeah.

2883
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:46,940
Well, not him specifically,

2884
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:48,940
but like it might be that they're flying

2885
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:50,940
somewhat close by.

2886
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:51,940
Yeah, maybe.

2887
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:53,940
I don't know why they would, but they could be.

2888
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:54,940
Well, I mean, maybe if they get,

2889
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:55,940
if they get, if they're closer,

2890
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:57,940
then maybe they can get the news faster.

2891
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:59,940
Well, no, no, transponder snails.

2892
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:00,940
Transponder snails.

2893
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:02,940
They can communicate instantly.

2894
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:04,940
Yeah, I guess the most sensible thing

2895
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:06,940
is they're just in hiding these two

2896
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:08,940
and he's just doing his thing

2897
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:10,940
being a bird flying around.

2898
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:14,940
I wonder if he is a mink.

2899
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:16,940
That's interesting.

2900
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:18,940
Damn.

2901
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,940
Much, much to consider.

2902
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:23,940
Yes.

2903
02:16:23,940 --> 02:16:25,940
I think we've, I think we've dissected it

2904
02:16:25,940 --> 02:16:27,940
pretty thoroughly.

2905
02:16:27,940 --> 02:16:29,940
Damn, we spent an hour on that.

2906
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:32,940
Well, not enough time reading.

2907
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:33,940
We've read it.

2908
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:34,940
Yeah.

2909
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:39,940
Yeah, I totally forgot that there was

2910
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:41,940
a new chapter this week.

2911
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:44,940
All right, you want to go voicemails?

2912
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:45,940
Let's go.

2913
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:47,940
Okay, let's do it.

2914
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,940
Let's see.

2915
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:54,940
Okay, this one is called, is a vocaru link.

2916
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:56,940
It's called, I'm actually trying to fix it,

2917
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:58,940
but okay.

2918
02:16:58,940 --> 02:16:59,940
Three.

2919
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:00,940
You ready?

2920
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:01,940
Yep.

2921
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,940
All right.

2922
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:03,940
Three, two, one, go.

2923
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:04,940
Now.

2924
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:13,940
Anyone can enter the comic book?

2925
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:20,940
Is it okay if it's the most pretentious thing ever?

2926
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:22,940
What the fuck was that?

2927
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:24,940
I think it's a bunch of memes,

2928
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,940
but also the question,

2929
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:28,940
can anyone enter the perfect comic party?

2930
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:30,940
And I'm going to say it'll depend on

2931
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,940
if we like, yeah, and want you in the thing.

2932
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:35,940
It's not like anyone can just be in it,

2933
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:37,940
but anyone can apply.

2934
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:40,940
I explained this last week.

2935
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:41,940
Yeah.

2936
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:44,940
I mean, we'll exercise some quality control.

2937
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:48,940
We'll have some, you know, we'll choose.

2938
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:49,940
Yeah.

2939
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:51,940
I mean, show us your stuff if you want to be in,

2940
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:54,940
but like, you know, it's got to be good.

2941
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:56,940
It's got to be a little good.

2942
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,940
It's got to be at least a little good.

2943
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:05,940
You know, do you know House of Decline?

2944
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:08,940
Comic guy, yeah.

2945
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:10,940
Have you been seeing his big comic

2946
02:18:10,940 --> 02:18:12,940
that he's been posting lately?

2947
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,940
I think it's called Together.

2948
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:15,940
Oh, yeah, I did see that.

2949
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:17,940
That was a really good one.

2950
02:18:17,940 --> 02:18:18,940
He's still going.

2951
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:20,940
I caught up on it last night.

2952
02:18:20,940 --> 02:18:21,940
Oh, is it still?

2953
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:23,940
I didn't realize it was coming out.

2954
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:25,940
I just saw a link to it, and I was like,

2955
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:26,940
this is nice.

2956
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:28,940
The two characters stuck together?

2957
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:29,940
Yeah.

2958
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:30,940
Yeah.

2959
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:31,940
Oh, yeah.

2960
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:33,940
I mean, in the last couple of days,

2961
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:35,940
it's really gone places.

2962
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:39,940
I don't know how recently you read it.

2963
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:42,940
It's good.

2964
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:43,940
I don't know.

2965
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:46,940
That just occurs to me.

2966
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:48,940
You know, House of Decline,

2967
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,940
and I mean this in the nicest possible way,

2968
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:53,940
is just a great example of how you can make a comic that's good,

2969
02:18:53,940 --> 02:18:56,940
even if you're shit at drawing and you suck.

2970
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:59,940
You know what I mean?

2971
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:03,940
I mean, what's bad about the drawing?

2972
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:05,940
They just have a very distinct style.

2973
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:06,940
I mean, that's, I'm being mean.

2974
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:07,940
It's not bad.

2975
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:09,940
It's not, I'm sure.

2976
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:12,940
They have a wobbly line art, like, you know,

2977
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:14,940
they don't care about it being clean.

2978
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:15,940
Right.

2979
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:17,940
It's, I'm sure, I'm sure that's not,

2980
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:20,940
I'm sure he can draw other ways if he wants to.

2981
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:23,940
The point is, it's, you know,

2982
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:26,940
it's very, it's very simple.

2983
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:28,940
How would I, how would I describe House of Decline?

2984
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:30,940
I guess I would say that it's simple,

2985
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:33,940
it's rough.

2986
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:36,940
It's simple and rough.

2987
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:37,940
Yeah, okay.

2988
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:40,940
Simple and rough is the way that we fuck.

2989
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:42,940
The way that we fuck.

2990
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:43,940
Oh.

2991
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:45,940
Done.

2992
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:46,940
Done.

2993
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:48,940
That's okay.

2994
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:52,940
I don't know how people will submit their comics.

2995
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:54,940
We'll figure it out.

2996
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:56,940
We're going to do the first one with just us,

2997
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,940
and then we'll put like submission info.

2998
02:19:58,940 --> 02:19:59,940
Yes, yes, yes.

2999
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:02,940
In the first issue, there will be submission instructions.

3000
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:04,940
We'll figure out something.

3001
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:06,940
Maybe just tell you to email us or something.

3002
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:07,940
Probably email.

3003
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:10,940
Maybe.

3004
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:13,940
Next one is called funny number three, two, one, go.

3005
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:22,940
Just want to say, man, thanks for like,

3006
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:24,940
for like seeing the digital art.

3007
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:27,940
You know, not a lot of people are doing that nowadays,

3008
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:30,940
you know, seeding files on like peer-to-peer networks.

3009
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:32,940
Really, really great service you're doing.

3010
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:37,940
Anyway, just wanted to call in to read of like a funny number

3011
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:39,940
and it goes like this.

3012
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:41,940
Yeah, someone alerted me.

3013
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:44,940
Eleazar, don't play the, don't play the number.

3014
02:20:44,940 --> 02:20:47,940
I don't know if that's, someone alerted me

3015
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:50,940
that people can read your IP address

3016
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:55,940
if you seed files.

3017
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:57,940
So I stopped seeding.

3018
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:02,940
I would like to continue to seed, but I don't know.

3019
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:03,940
It's a little scary.

3020
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:05,940
I feel like maybe I shouldn't have mentioned

3021
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:07,940
that I was seeding those files.

3022
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:11,940
Yeah, that's very bad.

3023
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:15,940
I mean, I don't know if anyone can actually do anything

3024
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:20,940
with my IP number, but...

3025
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:23,940
They can pee on you.

3026
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:28,940
Well, they can IP freely.

3027
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:31,940
You pee IP address.

3028
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:33,940
Well, guess what?

3029
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:36,940
I have stopped seeding for the moment

3030
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:38,940
and maybe I'll seed some more in the future

3031
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:42,940
or maybe I won't because it seems a little bit risky to do that.

3032
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:44,940
Someone else pointed this out to me.

3033
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:51,940
Okay, next one is called fun trivia facts.

3034
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:53,940
Three, two, one, go.

3035
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:56,940
Hey, Ben. Hey, Gib.

3036
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:58,940
Did you know that William Henry Harrison

3037
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:01,940
was an American military officer and politician

3038
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:04,940
who served as the ninth president of the United States?

3039
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:09,940
Harrison died just 31 days after his inauguration in 1841

3040
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:13,940
and had the shortest presidency in United States history.

3041
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:16,940
He was also the first United States president to die in office

3042
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:19,940
and a brief constitutional crisis resulted

3043
02:22:19,940 --> 02:22:22,940
as presidential succession was not then fully defined

3044
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:24,940
in the United States Constitution.

3045
02:22:24,940 --> 02:22:27,940
Harrison was the last president born as a British subject

3046
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:29,940
in the 13 colonies

3047
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:32,940
and was the paternal grandfather of Benjamin Harrison,

3048
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:35,940
the 23rd president of the United States.

3049
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:38,940
Crazy, right? Goo Goo Gaga.

3050
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:40,940
I am an AI voice controlled by the shadow cabal

3051
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:43,940
and my mission is to kill Ben St. in his sleep.

3052
02:22:43,940 --> 02:22:46,940
Whoops. Did I say that last part out loud?

3053
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:48,940
Silly me. Ha, ha, ha.

3054
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:52,940
I knew some of those things.

3055
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:57,940
I knew that William Henry Harrison died 30 days

3056
02:22:57,940 --> 02:22:59,940
after being inaugurated president

3057
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,940
and that he was the first president to die in office.

3058
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:05,940
Why'd you got to have three names?

3059
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:08,940
I think it's fun to say William Henry Harrison.

3060
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:10,940
It is. I think it's fun to say that.

3061
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:12,940
He's got a good one.

3062
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:14,940
If you got a good one, why not?

3063
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:17,940
If you got a good one, if you got it, flaunt it.

3064
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:22,940
Okay, well, thanks for trying to kill me, I guess.

3065
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:25,940
Whose voice was that? Do you know whose voice that was?

3066
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:26,940
No idea.

3067
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:28,940
Yeah, I'm not sure.

3068
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:31,940
It's sort of something I might have been familiar.

3069
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:34,940
Next one is called Clarification 321 Go.

3070
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:36,940
Please ignore that last voicemail.

3071
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:38,940
I'm not an AI voice controlled by the shadow cabal

3072
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:42,940
and my mission is not, I repeat, not to kill Ben St. in his sleep.

3073
02:23:42,940 --> 02:23:44,940
Oh, okay. Thank you for clarifying.

3074
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:46,940
Now that this has been resolved, please go to bed, Ben.

3075
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:48,940
Come on, get your healthy sleep.

3076
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:51,940
Don't worry about me, I'm just going to read the newspaper

3077
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:55,940
and brush my teeth as all normal humans tend to do.

3078
02:23:55,940 --> 02:23:58,940
Lifts have plateaued, I might need to sleep more.

3079
02:24:00,940 --> 02:24:03,940
Alright, next one is an image.

3080
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:05,940
We got an image.

3081
02:24:05,940 --> 02:24:08,940
Whoa, this is a cool image.

3082
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:10,940
Have you seen?

3083
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:15,940
This is the old Digi Bro kitchen.

3084
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:17,940
That's me, right?

3085
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:18,940
Yeah.

3086
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:20,940
What am I holding?

3087
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,940
Or has a gun been added?

3088
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:23,940
A gun.

3089
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:24,940
Has a gun been added?

3090
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:26,940
You're going to kill the...

3091
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,940
Have you seen this man?

3092
02:24:28,940 --> 02:24:31,940
Well, he's the last thing you'll ever see.

3093
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:33,940
Uh, LeMap.

3094
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:36,940
Yeah, cool.

3095
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:39,940
Where will that be from? Like a video?

3096
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:43,940
Yeah, maybe from something at Radcon 2.

3097
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:46,940
Or maybe just from a video...

3098
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:51,940
We recorded a bunch of stuff that we never published anywhere.

3099
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:55,940
I remember we tried to film that video of me cooking fried Oreos

3100
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:58,940
that came out shit.

3101
02:24:58,940 --> 02:25:00,940
We never published it.

3102
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:03,940
The Oreos came out fine, the video came out shit,

3103
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:05,940
because I was for some reason really nervous

3104
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:09,940
to be explaining how I'm doing it on camera.

3105
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:10,940
Oh, no.

3106
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:13,940
I just found it really uncomfortable to be filmed while cooking

3107
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:16,940
and to explain the process of cooking.

3108
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:18,940
So, like, I had no...

3109
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:20,940
I had no Riz in that video.

3110
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:22,940
So, we just scrapped it.

3111
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:28,940
Anyway, yeah, cool image, buddy.

3112
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,940
Looking evil.

3113
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,940
Next one is an image.

3114
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:34,940
Oh, God!

3115
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:37,940
Not another one, no!

3116
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:41,940
It's Mikkel.

3117
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:44,940
It's a lady holding the Mikkel,

3118
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:47,940
talking about it on the top of the cliff

3119
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:49,940
and all those subjects down there.

3120
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:52,940
They're meandering, they're not really paying attention.

3121
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:55,940
Yeah.

3122
02:25:55,940 --> 02:25:58,940
I don't get it.

3123
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:00,940
Is that supposed to be Nate?

3124
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:04,940
I don't know.

3125
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:09,940
She's wearing, like, a green dress with a yellow heart on it?

3126
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:12,940
With a black sash.

3127
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:14,940
Is it home stuck?

3128
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:17,940
I have no idea.

3129
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:22,940
I like the fact that most people are just sort of walking around

3130
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:25,940
this one guy sitting down looking.

3131
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:27,940
Everyone else is just looking at the camera.

3132
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:30,940
That guy with the little hat and the crazy teeth.

3133
02:26:31,940 --> 02:26:34,940
I just...

3134
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:38,940
It's pretty good, but what does it mean?

3135
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:40,940
We'll never know.

3136
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:43,940
Behold the Mikkel. Behold the glory of the Mikkel.

3137
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:46,940
Next one is another image.

3138
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:48,940
I guess.

3139
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:51,940
I guess I'll post it.

3140
02:26:53,940 --> 02:26:57,940
Why do they hate to see a girl boss win?

3141
02:26:57,940 --> 02:27:00,940
Is that the fucking Coomer smile?

3142
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:03,940
Yeah, it is.

3143
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:06,940
There's JK with the Burger King crown.

3144
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:09,940
What's her name? Hermione.

3145
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:12,940
Is that Luna Lovegood?

3146
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:14,940
Yeah.

3147
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:19,940
Because we hate women.

3148
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:21,940
It's true.

3149
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:26,940
The American people are tired of women.

3150
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:30,940
Sick and tired.

3151
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:33,940
Why did they just transition already?

3152
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:35,940
I know.

3153
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:38,940
All the men should become women.

3154
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:41,940
And all the women should become men.

3155
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:44,940
And then there won't be any women.

3156
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:52,940
Being a woman, you know, I have a lot of thoughts about being a woman.

3157
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:55,940
Being a woman, it's like being white.

3158
02:27:55,940 --> 02:28:01,940
It's like being white in that any portion of you is not one.

3159
02:28:01,940 --> 02:28:04,940
It's like, womanhood is like whiteness.

3160
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:06,940
It has to be preserved and it can't be tainted.

3161
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,940
If it's tainted at all, it's completely lost.

3162
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:11,940
That's right. Barack Obama is a black president and not a white president,

3163
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:13,940
even though he's mixed-race.

3164
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:17,940
Being a woman, well, if you're AMAB, you're not a woman.

3165
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:20,940
And if you are AFAB transition, you're not a woman.

3166
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:22,940
And if I don't like you, you're not a woman.

3167
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:24,940
And that's it.

3168
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:27,940
What do you think? Thoughts? Purity?

3169
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:29,940
Security?

3170
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:32,940
Security? Security? Police?

3171
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:36,940
It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I know I'm right.

3172
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:41,940
For some reason, I thought of like, is there a metaphor with like the sneeds

3173
02:28:41,940 --> 02:28:44,940
or the star on the belly thing?

3174
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:46,940
That's your gender?

3175
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:49,940
Some people have a green star on their belly. Some people don't.

3176
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:55,940
And then they go into the, here's the trans machine that the old man rolls up into town.

3177
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:58,940
It's like, it's cool to have to be this gender.

3178
02:28:58,940 --> 02:29:01,940
You'll never have a real green star on your belly.

3179
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:04,940
It's like, no, I can give you one with my funny machine.

3180
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:07,940
No, it doesn't, no.

3181
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:13,940
It's like all the, and then everyone gets the thing to be popular and then to be unpopular.

3182
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:15,940
And then it's, they have to remove it.

3183
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:18,940
It goes in a big circle and then everyone doesn't know what gender they are.

3184
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:21,940
They're all just whoever and it doesn't matter and they're all friends.

3185
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:25,940
I kind of, I kind of forget what happens in that story.

3186
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:26,940
Is that what happens?

3187
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:29,940
Like some of them have the star bellied sneeds and some of them aren't.

3188
02:29:29,940 --> 02:29:32,940
And then a guy shows up and there's a machine that can give you a star belly.

3189
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:34,940
Is that, is that what happens?

3190
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:37,940
That's the idea that the star bellies are snooty and they're like,

3191
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:39,940
we're better than you know star havers.

3192
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:41,940
Snooty star belly sneeds.

3193
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:44,940
Are they like rarer or is it like half and half?

3194
02:29:44,940 --> 02:29:46,940
I don't know. I guess it's rarer or half.

3195
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:50,940
It doesn't matter. They just sort of say, and so the ones who don't have stars

3196
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:51,940
wish they had stars.

3197
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:53,940
So this guy has a machine to give them stars.

3198
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:56,940
And then when they have stars, the people who had stars were like,

3199
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:58,940
oh, well now I'm not special anymore.

3200
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:00,940
I'm going to be special by removing my stars.

3201
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:02,940
And then it goes in a figure eight circle.

3202
02:30:02,940 --> 02:30:05,940
Everyone's trying to be popular, trying to be the best.

3203
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:08,940
And then everyone can't remember whether they started with a star or not.

3204
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:09,940
Somebody.

3205
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:11,940
And so they realize it doesn't matter.

3206
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:12,940
Yeah.

3207
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:15,940
Someone has to.

3208
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:16,940
That's like.

3209
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:20,940
Like there's such such a there's such a clear avenue there of like,

3210
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:24,940
if you wanted to take it, you could be like all this gender ideology.

3211
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:26,940
It's just like the star bellies.

3212
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:29,940
Has anyone has anyone written like a think piece about this?

3213
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:31,940
Should I should I be the one?

3214
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:33,940
Yeah, do a video about it.

3215
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:35,940
Did I do a video about it?

3216
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:36,940
Okay.

3217
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:37,940
Sneeds.

3218
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:38,940
Sneeds.

3219
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:40,940
Sneeds it is.

3220
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:44,940
Next one is called it's a voicemail.

3221
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:48,940
It's called smiley face and it's five seconds.

3222
02:30:48,940 --> 02:30:50,940
Three, two, one, go.

3223
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:53,940
Weekly reminder.

3224
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:54,940
Happy birthday, Ben.

3225
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:55,940
Thank you.

3226
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:56,940
I love you.

3227
02:30:56,940 --> 02:31:01,940
It's my birthday in two months minus a little bit.

3228
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:04,940
So no, we got to get started early.

3229
02:31:05,940 --> 02:31:09,940
Next one is called Jackie fan 96.

3230
02:31:09,940 --> 02:31:11,940
Three, two, one, go.

3231
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:13,940
Oh, still in me.

3232
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:14,940
How could I forget?

3233
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:16,940
Happy birthday, Jackie.

3234
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:19,940
Okay.

3235
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:21,940
Okay.

3236
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:22,940
Dab.

3237
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:24,940
Next one is called invite monkey.

3238
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:26,940
Three, two, one, go.

3239
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:29,940
Let's talk.

3240
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:31,940
Can you guys invite monkey?

3241
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:33,940
You guys are very low energy.

3242
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:35,940
ZZZ up in here.

3243
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:36,940
Come on.

3244
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:38,940
Okay.

3245
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:41,940
I'll do it.

3246
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:43,940
You're, I'm sorry, sir.

3247
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:45,940
Your wish is our command.

3248
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:47,940
Your wish is our commands.

3249
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:49,940
But we don't follow the rules.

3250
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:53,940
But I'm, it's our, it's our command.

3251
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:56,940
Yeah, but like, I don't, I don't do them.

3252
02:31:56,940 --> 02:32:01,940
I received command, command received, but I'm not going to do anything about it.

3253
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:04,940
I'm not a very good slave.

3254
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:07,940
Next one is called.

3255
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:11,940
It's a my anime list.

3256
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:14,940
It's a link to Helk on my anime list.

3257
02:32:16,940 --> 02:32:20,940
I've read part of Helk and the beginning is really good.

3258
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:23,940
I can't say that it stays good throughout.

3259
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:26,940
I thought that it kind of got a little bit wrote.

3260
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,940
When have you read, you know, Helk?

3261
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:29,940
I had no idea.

3262
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:30,940
What's, what's it about?

3263
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:33,940
I'm reading a synopsis and it says demon king and hero.

3264
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:36,940
And I'm like, yeah, it sucks.

3265
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:37,940
Um, okay.

3266
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:42,940
Well, there's really, it's about, there's a demon world and there's a human world.

3267
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:48,940
And, okay, basically the demons are the good guys and the humans are the bad guys in this world.

3268
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:49,940
That's the gist.

3269
02:32:49,940 --> 02:32:55,940
But the premise that it starts, it starts out in like the demon king has died and the demons need to elect a new king.

3270
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:58,940
And they, the way that they elect a king, they don't elect him.

3271
02:32:58,940 --> 02:33:02,940
They hold a tournament and like the winner of the tournament becomes the demon king.

3272
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:10,940
And a human has shown up to compete to become the king of the demons and humans, demons hate humans,

3273
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:18,940
but they love this human because the human, every time he wins, he's just, oh, there's a great,

3274
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:22,940
like the Helk's introduction is like he wins this battle in the tournament.

3275
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:26,940
And everyone's like, yeah, this mysterious human has shown up to compete to be the demon king.

3276
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:29,940
Uh, humans, uh, you know, we hate humans.

3277
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:31,940
Uh, hey, human, why are you here?

3278
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:33,940
Uh, what do you have to say for yourself?

3279
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:36,940
And he like looks directly in the camera and he goes, humans suck.

3280
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:39,940
And all the demons go, woo, yeah, we love you.

3281
02:33:39,940 --> 02:33:40,940
We love Helk.

3282
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:42,940
Um, yeah.

3283
02:33:42,940 --> 02:33:43,940
What a cool guy.

3284
02:33:43,940 --> 02:33:44,940
Yeah.

3285
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,940
Um, he is cool.

3286
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:48,940
Uh, so it starts off pretty funny and cool and good.

3287
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:58,940
And then I think at some point it's like, uh, Helk and like the demon princess get like transported out of the underworld

3288
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:01,940
and they have to like go on a journey to get back together.

3289
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:03,940
And I kind of fell off around that point.

3290
02:34:03,940 --> 02:34:07,940
So I don't know if it stays good, but I like the beginning.

3291
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:09,940
Humans suck.

3292
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:10,940
Humans suck.

3293
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:11,940
Woo.

3294
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:12,940
Yeah.

3295
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:20,940
It's like, um, it's like if we, it's like if we westerners, you know, you and I, we're westerners.

3296
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:25,940
If like we were having like a tournament to decide the next like prime minister of the UK.

3297
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:28,940
And it was like a Russian and everyone's like, ooh, we hate Russians.

3298
02:34:28,940 --> 02:34:32,940
But he's like, Hey guys, I'm here to say fuck Russia.

3299
02:34:32,940 --> 02:34:34,940
And everyone's like, yeah.

3300
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:35,940
Yeah.

3301
02:34:35,940 --> 02:34:37,940
Oh, he did the thing.

3302
02:34:37,940 --> 02:34:39,940
Oh, he's one of the good ones.

3303
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:41,940
Oh, yeah.

3304
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:42,940
Exactly.

3305
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:44,940
Um, next one.

3306
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:49,940
Well, it's another link to my wiki feet about Ben St.

3307
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:51,940
And I don't need to click that again.

3308
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:52,940
Yeah.

3309
02:34:52,940 --> 02:34:53,940
Okay.

3310
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:56,940
So I bet it's going to be disgusting.

3311
02:34:56,940 --> 02:34:57,940
Three, two, one, go.

3312
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:58,940
Sound of feet.

3313
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:01,940
I cannot believe this.

3314
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:03,940
Ben St.

3315
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:07,940
There are two wiki feet articles of you.

3316
02:35:07,940 --> 02:35:08,940
Why?

3317
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:13,940
The one that you saw was the inferior one.

3318
02:35:13,940 --> 02:35:18,940
The one that is better is the one that is made by your own very good fan.

3319
02:35:19,940 --> 02:35:25,940
And it has about 40 pictures of your succulent feet.

3320
02:35:25,940 --> 02:35:26,940
Oh, God.

3321
02:35:26,940 --> 02:35:28,940
And you should look at it.

3322
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:30,940
It has a higher rating.

3323
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:33,940
I like it five stars.

3324
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:36,940
I beat off to it every night.

3325
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:38,940
Thanks, Zug.

3326
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:39,940
Hey.

3327
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:40,940
Gross.

3328
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:41,940
Hey, Zug.

3329
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:42,940
I, you know what?

3330
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:43,940
I apologize.

3331
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:47,940
I got to apologize to Zug because Zug bought some RFCK pins and this was, this must have

3332
02:35:47,940 --> 02:35:49,940
been like three weeks ago now.

3333
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:50,940
And it's totally on me.

3334
02:35:50,940 --> 02:35:52,940
I haven't mailed them yet, but like I got the box right here.

3335
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:53,940
I got to put those in the mail.

3336
02:35:53,940 --> 02:35:56,940
I just got to, I just got to get to the freaking post office.

3337
02:35:56,940 --> 02:36:00,940
I see the post office because I don't, I don't want to put them in the mail in an envelope

3338
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:01,940
because I know they'll get damaged.

3339
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:03,940
They'll definitely get damaged.

3340
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:05,940
So I'm going to send them in a box.

3341
02:36:05,940 --> 02:36:06,940
It's got to go to the voice.

3342
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,940
It's got to get voicemail.

3343
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:09,940
I mean, it got to go to the post office.

3344
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:11,940
I like this one.

3345
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:13,940
This is my favorite.

3346
02:36:13,940 --> 02:36:16,940
Are you looking at your own feet pictures?

3347
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:17,940
Yeah.

3348
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:18,940
Yeah.

3349
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:19,940
Yeah.

3350
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:20,940
Yeah.

3351
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:21,940
Yeah.

3352
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:22,940
But look at this one.

3353
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:23,940
This is the best one.

3354
02:36:23,940 --> 02:36:24,940
Oh yeah.

3355
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,940
Reported for no feet showing.

3356
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:26,940
It's a slime and punishment version.

3357
02:36:26,940 --> 02:36:27,940
Reported for no feet showing.

3358
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:28,940
Fucking feet moderators.

3359
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:37,660
Um, there's something really, there's something really perverse about the feet thing.

3360
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:43,380
The way that it's like most people don't consider it like sexual, but like some people do.

3361
02:36:43,380 --> 02:36:47,940
And so it's like, you got to collect every instance of a person showing their feet thinking

3362
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:48,940
it's innocent.

3363
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:51,540
You got to put it all together.

3364
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:56,620
It's like seeing images of somebody taking pictures through your window.

3365
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:59,660
It's like, yeah, no.

3366
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:04,820
I don't like, it's, it's, it's not that it's a literal invasion of privacy because those

3367
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:08,540
videos are public, but it's the, the reason they're doing it.

3368
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:10,420
It's like, yeah, I didn't publish.

3369
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:15,300
I didn't put this out there to be ogled, ogled.

3370
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,300
Oogled.

3371
02:37:16,300 --> 02:37:20,940
I was just trying to entertain you, but in a cool way.

3372
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:21,940
Damn.

3373
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:26,940
I got to say, oh man, I look fucking good in this one.

3374
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:29,860
I look fricking, I look fricking good in this one.

3375
02:37:29,860 --> 02:37:30,860
There's no feet.

3376
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:31,860
There's no feet.

3377
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:32,860
Okay.

3378
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:33,860
Yeah.

3379
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:34,860
I thought you were like, oh, you know what?

3380
02:37:34,860 --> 02:37:35,860
I really like feet.

3381
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:36,860
Damn.

3382
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:37,860
My feet look hot in this one.

3383
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:40,860
No, this is a good picture of me.

3384
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:41,860
Yeah.

3385
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:43,860
Um, okay.

3386
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:55,260
Well, thanks for, um, showing me that, uh, voicemailers, um, okay, bye.

3387
02:37:55,260 --> 02:38:02,860
Next one is called, oh, well, there's a, um, there's an image, there's an image, oh god.

3388
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:03,860
Oh wait.

3389
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:09,860
Do we, I think this is slightly different from the last time.

3390
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,860
All right.

3391
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:13,860
Three, two, one, go.

3392
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,860
Damn!

3393
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:15,860
Fold again.

3394
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:16,860
Oh, it's loud.

3395
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:19,860
I guess this is what happens when you pour out your heart.

3396
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:22,860
You get stabbed right in the back.

3397
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:26,860
I would be lying if I said I wasn't heartbroken.

3398
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:30,860
This cursed pain inside, just like the darkness within.

3399
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:31,860
Oh, how it burns.

3400
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:36,860
I guess Ben St. will never smile upon the wretched heart of a man like me.

3401
02:38:36,860 --> 02:38:37,860
Oh, sniff.

3402
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:39,860
Oh, I can't believe it.

3403
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:40,860
It's over.

3404
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:42,860
He will never love me.

3405
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:43,860
I should just end it all.

3406
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:46,860
Put me out of my big fucking misery.

3407
02:38:46,860 --> 02:38:47,860
No.

3408
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:52,860
Unless if only there was a lovely little name on this here PC tree.

3409
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:53,860
Hmm.

3410
02:38:53,860 --> 02:38:54,860
Hmm.

3411
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:55,860
That would solve everything.

3412
02:38:55,860 --> 02:39:21,860
I don't even understand what noise that is.

3413
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:24,860
I mean, it's in the image.

3414
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:29,860
When I when I see it written out braps, I think it's like supposed to be like a belch.

3415
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:32,860
But this guy like actually pronounces it like braps.

3416
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:34,860
It's like, what noise?

3417
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:35,860
What noise is that?

3418
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:36,860
It's terrible.

3419
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:37,860
It's terrible.

3420
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:38,860
It's what it is.

3421
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:39,860
It is.

3422
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:44,860
It's hideous, heinous, horrible, vile, disgusting, despicable.

3423
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:46,860
We got to censor it.

3424
02:39:46,860 --> 02:39:47,860
We got it.

3425
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:48,860
We got to censor it.

3426
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:49,860
But not.

3427
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:50,860
Eleazar.

3428
02:39:50,860 --> 02:39:51,860
Eleazar.

3429
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:52,860
Eleazar.

3430
02:39:52,860 --> 02:39:53,860
Eleazar.

3431
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:54,860
各 Stewie.

3432
02:39:54,860 --> 02:39:55,860
Okay.

3433
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:57,060
The bark of repetition.

3434
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:59,860
Got him in the previous raps.

3435
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:02,860
But the bleep, thekem psk leeps the sweeps.

3436
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:05,860
And the creeps on the wraps on the mean, the brats.

3437
02:40:05,860 --> 02:40:06,860
Okay.

3438
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:08,860
The next one is called Benz regrets.

3439
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:09,860
3,2,1 go.

3440
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:10,860
Yes.

3441
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:11,860
Yes indeed.

3442
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:12,860
Gibb and take does have the緝 is such cute.

3443
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:13,860
Simply.

3444
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:14,860
Braps.

3445
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:17,860
I think that that nocturne guy wasn't so bad after all fucked up.

3446
02:40:17,860 --> 02:40:18,860
Perhaps I was too hard on him, maybe.

3447
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:19,860
It's not quite.

3448
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:21,860
Right, I should have given him a chance, you know, but it's too late now.

3449
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:25,780
has moved on, he'll always be the one who got away.

3450
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:28,700
That's not quite right, it's not quite me.

3451
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:30,900
It's like three quarters of the way there,

3452
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:33,580
five eighths even, seven tenths.

3453
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:37,420
Why does the AI takeover have to be prep related?

3454
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:42,420
Uh, okay, the next one is an image.

3455
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:47,460
I can't wait to see what it looks like on my screen.

3456
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:52,460
Ben St, he's unaware.

3457
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:54,700
Can Visa and Mastercard really block you?

3458
02:40:54,700 --> 02:40:56,580
Never heard of such a thing.

3459
02:40:56,580 --> 02:40:58,580
Josh Moon, owner of Kiwi Farms,

3460
02:40:58,580 --> 02:41:00,020
banned from payment processing,

3461
02:41:00,020 --> 02:41:03,780
banned from GDOS protection, banned from having a PO box.

3462
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:06,700
Well, get owned.

3463
02:41:06,700 --> 02:41:08,340
Really?

3464
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:13,340
Okay, well, banned from, how are you banned

3465
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:16,620
from having a PO box?

3466
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:18,300
Like by the American government?

3467
02:41:20,020 --> 02:41:21,380
Like the American government is like,

3468
02:41:21,380 --> 02:41:26,180
hey, post offices do not allow this person to have a PO box.

3469
02:41:26,180 --> 02:41:28,340
I don't, how do they,

3470
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:30,780
a PO box is not a person's home address,

3471
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:33,900
it's just like a thing, it's like a whole place.

3472
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:35,460
Banned from GDOS protection,

3473
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:37,580
I don't even know what that means.

3474
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:39,940
Uh, what form of GDOS protection?

3475
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:41,900
And banned from payment processing,

3476
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:45,260
is it, is it just that like,

3477
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:48,940
is it just that like a frickin' Visa and Mastercard

3478
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:51,060
know your Social Security number

3479
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:52,500
and they can identify you by that

3480
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,100
and they are just like this,

3481
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:57,420
don't service this Social Security number.

3482
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:00,820
I mean, I suppose it's,

3483
02:42:00,820 --> 02:42:03,340
I suppose I believe that it can happen.

3484
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:08,460
I just don't think, I guess I just wanna know why,

3485
02:42:08,460 --> 02:42:09,700
like if that's true,

3486
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:13,340
why would Dick Masterson have had that happen to him?

3487
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:18,820
Why would Josh Moon, is Josh Moon like a criminal?

3488
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:19,940
Is he a felon?

3489
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:24,140
Yeah, I mean, owning Kiwi farms

3490
02:42:24,140 --> 02:42:25,540
makes you a real shitty person,

3491
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:27,780
but I don't actually know if he did a word,

3492
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:30,060
like a specific crime thing.

3493
02:42:31,220 --> 02:42:33,460
Is it, I mean, I just don't,

3494
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:36,300
I just don't believe that like-

3495
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:38,660
Was it about the Keffles situation?

3496
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:40,540
I can't remember what happened with that.

3497
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:42,500
I vaguely heard about it,

3498
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:44,860
that Keffles is instrumental somehow

3499
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:48,100
in getting Kiwi farms taken out, taken down.

3500
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:51,940
Yes, but I don't know if that's related to

3501
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:53,980
ban from payment.

3502
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:57,420
Okay, is Josh Moon banned from payment processing

3503
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:00,700
or is Kiwi farms banned from payment processing?

3504
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:04,740
Like that's a different, that's different.

3505
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:06,300
Also, where are you getting this information?

3506
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:07,580
Is Josh Moon saying it?

3507
02:43:09,660 --> 02:43:10,500
Yeah, that's a good question.

3508
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:13,980
Does he have the accurate understanding of the situation?

3509
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:18,660
Cause it seems weird that you can't have a peel box

3510
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:21,740
and how do they even make sure that's the case?

3511
02:43:21,740 --> 02:43:23,860
Yeah, it does seem weird.

3512
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:27,660
I guess I would like to see more about it.

3513
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:31,060
Cause yeah, my first thought is like, there's no way.

3514
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:33,380
There's no way you can't walk into a post-off.

3515
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:36,460
Like, I'm sorry, but I feel like for the government

3516
02:43:36,460 --> 02:43:38,020
to be like, don't give this person a peel.

3517
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:39,060
Like you'd be a criminal.

3518
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:40,580
Like you would be like a felon

3519
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:42,340
and wanted and they would arrest you on site.

3520
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:43,860
Like if it's that to the point that like,

3521
02:43:43,860 --> 02:43:46,580
do not allow this person to make a personal PO box.

3522
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:49,060
There's no fucking way.

3523
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:51,020
That's my gut.

3524
02:43:51,020 --> 02:43:52,220
That's what my gut says.

3525
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:57,460
So I'm just gonna trust it.

3526
02:43:57,460 --> 02:43:58,940
No evidence, please.

3527
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:03,140
Next one is called PCP episode 500.

3528
02:44:03,140 --> 02:44:05,620
Oh, it's gonna be, oh, okay.

3529
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:07,740
Three, two, one.

3530
02:44:07,740 --> 02:44:09,020
Yeah, three, two, one, go.

3531
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:12,780
Welcome to the procrastinators podcast.

3532
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:14,540
I'm the best guy ever.

3533
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:18,260
And today, today is a very special day.

3534
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:19,100
Sounds deep.

3535
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:20,940
We have reached the end of the journey, my friends.

3536
02:44:20,940 --> 02:44:21,780
That's right.

3537
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:23,620
We have reached the end of one piece.

3538
02:44:23,620 --> 02:44:24,460
I can't believe it.

3539
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:25,420
Oda pulled it off.

3540
02:44:25,420 --> 02:44:26,260
Indeed he did.

3541
02:44:26,260 --> 02:44:27,580
Let's go around.

3542
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:28,420
That's perfect.

3543
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:29,260
I'm Digi Brony.

3544
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:32,180
I make analysis videos about my little pony in anime.

3545
02:44:32,180 --> 02:44:34,700
I'm Applejack, my sweet Apple acres.

3546
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:37,260
I can't believe Applejack's on the PC.

3547
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:40,380
Patreon.com slash BenSaint, stcomics.com.

3548
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:42,900
And introducing officially our newest member

3549
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:44,660
of the podcast, Dr. Wolf.

3550
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:45,940
I'm happy to be.

3551
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:47,380
All right, where should we get started?

3552
02:44:47,380 --> 02:44:48,220
Just a heads up.

3553
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:50,580
I haven't kept up with one piece since your lecture.

3554
02:44:50,580 --> 02:44:51,340
Shame.

3555
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:53,140
Well, I really liked the ending.

3556
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:55,860
The twist during the last talk were incredible.

3557
02:44:55,860 --> 02:44:58,180
I gotta say, the one piece being a giant pizza

3558
02:44:58,180 --> 02:45:00,100
was the last thing I expected.

3559
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:01,540
Based go to strikes again.

3560
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:04,620
Everyone knows that pizza parties are always a good time.

3561
02:45:04,620 --> 02:45:05,460
Indeed.

3562
02:45:05,460 --> 02:45:07,380
So the one piece, the entire island of Raftel

3563
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:08,700
is actually just one pizza.

3564
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:09,540
I think?

3565
02:45:09,540 --> 02:45:12,420
So we had the straw hats, Blackbeard, Law,

3566
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:15,140
Doe Flamingo, the Marines, and the admirals

3567
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:16,940
all having a pizza party.

3568
02:45:16,940 --> 02:45:18,580
But then Jewelry Bonnie and Big Mom

3569
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:21,020
decided they're going to eat all the pizza.

3570
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:23,220
They're going to eat the entire island.

3571
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:25,340
So we have the straw hats fighting Bonnie

3572
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:26,980
and Buggy versus Big Mom.

3573
02:45:26,980 --> 02:45:27,820
And then we have-

3574
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:28,660
Speaking of Buggy.

3575
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:29,500
Yeah?

3576
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:30,340
He gave me an idea.

3577
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:31,180
What?

3578
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:33,580
I'm thinking about getting a part time job as a clown.

3579
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:36,140
But Ben, isn't that already your job?

3580
02:45:39,980 --> 02:45:44,300
It's just the no enthusiasm in Nate's voice.

3581
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:45,140
She says that.

3582
02:45:45,140 --> 02:45:46,940
Isn't that already your thing?

3583
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:50,300
This is great.

3584
02:45:50,300 --> 02:45:51,940
What a great lineup.

3585
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:57,100
That was a real home day of a little voicemail.

3586
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:57,940
Oh, you know what?

3587
02:45:57,940 --> 02:45:58,940
AI would be funnier.

3588
02:45:58,940 --> 02:46:02,020
I feel like Voice Grail.

3589
02:46:02,060 --> 02:46:04,340
Voice Grail for PZP episode 500.

3590
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:06,860
Yeah, that's a good one.

3591
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:09,060
Applejack, part of the team, finally.

3592
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:12,100
What did she say?

3593
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:12,940
And I'm Applejack.

3594
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:15,260
I'm just happy to be here.

3595
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:18,100
Yeah, you know, in the good timeline,

3596
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:23,060
Digi Brony continued making Pony videos

3597
02:46:23,060 --> 02:46:28,060
and got married to Applejack and she joined the PZP.

3598
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:31,740
Damn.

3599
02:46:31,740 --> 02:46:33,740
So was that DeVoo or?

3600
02:46:33,740 --> 02:46:36,860
I think it sounded like DeVoo.

3601
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:38,820
Was that, oh, I guess the giant pizza.

3602
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:39,820
They all had a pizza party.

3603
02:46:39,820 --> 02:46:40,980
Was that it?

3604
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:45,060
I think it might have been like Rebel Taxi or Pan Pizza.

3605
02:46:45,060 --> 02:46:47,700
I honestly don't even know what Pan Pizza sounds like,

3606
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:50,620
even though I literally was on his podcast and spoke to him.

3607
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:52,140
I don't remember.

3608
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:53,140
But lol.

3609
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:54,500
I mean, neither do I really.

3610
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:56,140
But I just thought I could imagine

3611
02:46:56,140 --> 02:46:58,460
if they're talking about pizza party.

3612
02:46:58,460 --> 02:46:59,940
First of all, you're insane.

3613
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:01,100
You're out of your freaking gourd

3614
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:02,340
because they hadn't even mentioned

3615
02:47:02,340 --> 02:47:04,060
the pizza party joke at that point.

3616
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:07,580
So it would be weird to introduce Pan Pizza before.

3617
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:09,500
I mean, yes, they had mentioned the pizza,

3618
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:11,980
but they had not said pizza party.

3619
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:14,100
And so there was no, it was pretty far leap

3620
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:15,420
to pizza party podcast.

3621
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:16,260
So I don't know.

3622
02:47:16,260 --> 02:47:17,740
It would be weird comedic timing

3623
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:20,820
to introduce the joke of having Rebel Taxi talk there.

3624
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:23,340
Also, I mean, this is supposed to be the PCP.

3625
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:25,300
So yeah, I would just, yeah, DeVoo.

3626
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:26,940
The new guy was Dr. Wolfe.

3627
02:47:27,860 --> 02:47:29,180
The new guy was Dr. Wolfe.

3628
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:31,380
So the person who spoke was someone else

3629
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:32,220
or maybe it's Dr. Wolfe.

3630
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:33,060
They didn't introduce them.

3631
02:47:33,060 --> 02:47:35,020
They didn't introduce them or mention them at all.

3632
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:36,500
So I guess it's not clear.

3633
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:39,340
I heard it and I was like, oh, it's DeVoo,

3634
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:40,580
but I don't know.

3635
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:45,220
What can I say?

3636
02:47:45,220 --> 02:47:46,140
What can I say?

3637
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:48,820
Dr. Wolfe didn't even have anything to say about One Piece.

3638
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:49,660
Yeah, didn't he?

3639
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:50,500
He was just like-

3640
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:52,580
He's just brand new guest, like new member.

3641
02:47:52,580 --> 02:47:53,860
Thanks for having me.

3642
02:47:53,860 --> 02:47:54,700
Yeah.

3643
02:47:54,700 --> 02:47:58,460
It's really gotta work hard to get integrated

3644
02:47:58,460 --> 02:47:59,540
into the group.

3645
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:00,380
Yeah.

3646
02:48:00,380 --> 02:48:02,180
He's really pulling the Jeff.

3647
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:05,300
He's really pulling the Jeff and just being sloppy.

3648
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:10,300
I wonder if they don't have enough material for me

3649
02:48:11,260 --> 02:48:13,380
to make an AI voice.

3650
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:14,540
You weren't even there.

3651
02:48:14,540 --> 02:48:15,380
No.

3652
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:16,220
Maybe I left at that point.

3653
02:48:16,220 --> 02:48:18,360
I'd left the PCP by 500.

3654
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:21,860
There was bad blood between you and Dr. Wolfe.

3655
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:22,700
You had beef.

3656
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:23,540
Yeah.

3657
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:27,060
They decided, group decision, we're kicking you out

3658
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:28,780
because you won't work with Dr. Wolfe.

3659
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:31,140
We need Dr. Wolfe on the show.

3660
02:48:31,140 --> 02:48:32,300
He's integral.

3661
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:36,820
He's instrumental to our business model going forward.

3662
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:37,820
You're expendable, Gib.

3663
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:38,660
I'm sorry.

3664
02:48:38,660 --> 02:48:39,500
It's you or him.

3665
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:42,540
Fine, I'll leave.

3666
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:47,540
I'll start my own podcast with Fluttershy.

3667
02:48:50,740 --> 02:48:51,660
And Briska.

3668
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:52,500
And Briska.

3669
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:53,340
Yes.

3670
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:55,180
And Antony C.

3671
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:58,140
And Nolan B.

3672
02:48:58,140 --> 02:48:59,900
And Nolan B. of the pizza party podcast.

3673
02:48:59,900 --> 02:49:01,580
This was before the scandal.

3674
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:04,140
So it was okay back then.

3675
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:05,580
And Sargon of a card.

3676
02:49:05,580 --> 02:49:07,220
Everybody's together.

3677
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:08,180
Yes.

3678
02:49:08,180 --> 02:49:10,420
I love Sargon.

3679
02:49:10,420 --> 02:49:11,460
I love him.

3680
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:13,180
Did you see him saying that if you play

3681
02:49:13,180 --> 02:49:15,340
the new Harry Potter game, you have swag?

3682
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:21,500
He's so cool.

3683
02:49:21,500 --> 02:49:22,820
What a cool thing to say.

3684
02:49:22,820 --> 02:49:24,140
What a very cool thing to say.

3685
02:49:24,140 --> 02:49:27,980
I love little baby games for little baby children.

3686
02:49:27,980 --> 02:49:29,900
So sexy.

3687
02:49:29,900 --> 02:49:31,460
Okay.

3688
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:35,060
Next one is called Kongalooja.

3689
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:37,300
Like Hallelujah, but with Donkey Kong.

3690
02:49:37,300 --> 02:49:38,140
Kongalooja.

3691
02:49:38,140 --> 02:49:39,140
Yeah, I guess so.

3692
02:49:40,660 --> 02:49:42,340
Oh, it's a Vokeroo.

3693
02:49:42,340 --> 02:49:44,900
Let's freaking, let's freaking go.

3694
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:45,740
Here we go.

3695
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:46,580
Three, two, one.

3696
02:49:46,580 --> 02:49:47,420
Go.

3697
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:51,420
Donkey Kong, you know him well.

3698
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:55,420
He's finally back to kick some tail.

3699
02:49:55,420 --> 02:50:01,420
His gun can fire in spurts and he can shoot you.

3700
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:04,420
Isn't it Diddy Kong's going with fires in spurts?

3701
02:50:04,420 --> 02:50:11,420
And he's bigger, faster, stronger to the leader of the

3702
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:13,420
D.K. Krill.

3703
02:50:13,420 --> 02:50:21,420
The baffle comes performing Kongalooja.

3704
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:25,420
Kongalooja.

3705
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:29,420
Kongalooja.

3706
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:33,420
Kongalooja.

3707
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:37,420
Kongalooja.

3708
02:50:37,420 --> 02:50:45,420
Kongalooja.

3709
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:46,420
Wow.

3710
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:47,420
That was wonderful.

3711
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:53,420
Some real production on that, yeah.

3712
02:50:53,420 --> 02:50:58,420
Trans rights, Donkey Kong.

3713
02:50:58,420 --> 02:51:03,420
That's exactly what Donkey Kong would do with his Kong gun.

3714
02:51:03,420 --> 02:51:06,420
He would fire hormones in spurts.

3715
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:11,420
He would fire in spurts on Congress.

3716
02:51:11,420 --> 02:51:13,420
Oh my God, Congress.

3717
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:16,420
Oh my fucking God.

3718
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:21,420
Oh, this one is a drop box.

3719
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:23,420
Hang on, I gotta download that last one.

3720
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:25,420
Here we go.

3721
02:51:25,420 --> 02:51:27,420
What is this?

3722
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:30,420
Whoa, hang on.

3723
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:32,420
This is a comic.

3724
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:35,420
I don't like content.

3725
02:51:35,420 --> 02:51:37,420
Oh, it is a comic.

3726
02:51:37,420 --> 02:51:40,420
Chapter one, question mark, revive.

3727
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:42,420
Oh, revive.

3728
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:44,420
Ah, yes.

3729
02:51:44,420 --> 02:51:46,420
Very good.

3730
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:49,420
Chapter one, question mark, revive.

3731
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:53,420
Oh, whose art style is this?

3732
02:51:53,420 --> 02:51:56,420
I don't actually recognize it.

3733
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:58,420
Hmm.

3734
02:51:58,420 --> 02:52:00,420
Is it new?

3735
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:03,420
No, no.

3736
02:52:03,420 --> 02:52:05,420
There's no giant tits.

3737
02:52:05,420 --> 02:52:07,420
And also, I can tell the style is different.

3738
02:52:07,420 --> 02:52:10,420
Yeah, yeah.

3739
02:52:10,420 --> 02:52:12,420
Hmm.

3740
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:15,420
Should I just, should I read through this?

3741
02:52:15,420 --> 02:52:16,420
Yeah.

3742
02:52:16,420 --> 02:52:17,420
Okay.

3743
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:19,420
Like, breathe in.

3744
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:21,420
Ah, shit.

3745
02:52:21,420 --> 02:52:23,420
Did I actually die to that nose guy?

3746
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:25,420
Fuck.

3747
02:52:25,420 --> 02:52:30,420
Well, I guess he can get off my ass about stealing them now.

3748
02:52:30,420 --> 02:52:32,420
Scrolls, yeah.

3749
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:37,420
Piss, where the hell am I?

3750
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:40,420
Did somebody ask for help?

3751
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:43,420
Oh, you did the help command.

3752
02:52:43,420 --> 02:52:44,420
Oh, help.

3753
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:46,420
Oh, okay.

3754
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:50,420
PCPHQ, aka podcast death furnace, endless episodes.

3755
02:52:50,420 --> 02:52:53,420
Holy shit.

3756
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:59,420
Well, oh, you want to, oh, I said, I say no, I say no.

3757
02:52:59,420 --> 02:53:03,420
Welcome to PCPHQ, home of the procrastinators.

3758
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:07,420
If you're a member, you can create content by recording an episode.

3759
02:53:07,420 --> 02:53:08,420
Read.

3760
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:12,420
At Ben, tried recording in an unauthorized zone.

3761
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:17,420
Members can only record, oh, saliva in my mouth.

3762
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:21,420
Record in the current hashtag episode channel.

3763
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:25,420
The current hashtag episode is 348.

3764
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:26,420
Is that this one?

3765
02:53:26,420 --> 02:53:28,420
I think that's this one.

3766
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:31,420
Yeah, it is.

3767
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:32,420
Inv.

3768
02:53:32,420 --> 02:53:35,420
You are holding 33.

3769
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:38,420
What's, oh, this is the item value.

3770
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:39,420
What's scroll?

3771
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:40,420
One.

3772
02:53:40,420 --> 02:53:41,420
Tape recorder, one.

3773
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:42,420
Cassette, 30.

3774
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:43,420
Vape, one.

3775
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:44,420
Flip phone, one.

3776
02:53:44,420 --> 02:53:46,420
Katana, one.

3777
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:48,420
That's all I need, baby.

3778
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:50,420
Equip vape.

3779
02:53:50,420 --> 02:53:55,420
Well, I guess I should at Gib or something.

3780
02:53:55,420 --> 02:53:59,420
At Gib, hey, you still in that hallway with the...

3781
02:53:59,420 --> 02:54:03,420
It sniffed my tits off.

3782
02:54:03,420 --> 02:54:07,420
What the fuck?

3783
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,420
Patreon.

3784
02:54:08,420 --> 02:54:10,420
Wait, maybe it is new.

3785
02:54:10,420 --> 02:54:11,420
I think it is.

3786
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:16,420
Yeah, the style looks a little different, but this is a continuation.

3787
02:54:16,420 --> 02:54:19,420
I forgot where it was last time.

3788
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:22,420
My epically fat memories are gone.

3789
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:25,420
Yeah, it's been a while since my epically fat...

3790
02:54:25,420 --> 02:54:28,420
No, they're normal boobs size now.

3791
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:29,420
No.

3792
02:54:29,420 --> 02:54:32,420
Large nose man defeated.

3793
02:54:32,420 --> 02:54:35,420
It's Patreon and the pupils.

3794
02:54:35,420 --> 02:54:36,420
Hang on.

3795
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:38,420
I can't remember.

3796
02:54:38,420 --> 02:54:39,420
My boot.

3797
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:41,420
Why do I look like...

3798
02:54:41,420 --> 02:54:43,420
Is this a continuation of that last one?

3799
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:45,420
Because I am a human, a normal...

3800
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:48,420
And by a human, I mean a male.

3801
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:50,420
I can't remember.

3802
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:52,420
Where was the last one?

3803
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:53,420
Did I save it?

3804
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:54,420
I remember we were in...

3805
02:54:54,420 --> 02:54:58,420
Errorare had showed up and we were in some kind of...

3806
02:54:58,420 --> 02:55:00,420
Wait a minute.

3807
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:06,420
Are both of these links the same?

3808
02:55:06,420 --> 02:55:09,420
Oh, this is in PNG form?

3809
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:11,420
Same thing, but in PNG.

3810
02:55:11,420 --> 02:55:12,420
Wait a minute.

3811
02:55:12,420 --> 02:55:16,420
The next one is...

3812
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:19,420
I think the next one just shows this.

3813
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:20,420
You should hurry up.

3814
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:23,420
Yeah, by the domain perfectcomicparty.party.

3815
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:25,420
Perfectcomic.party, I commented this already,

3816
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:28,420
but of course it was deleted for no reason.

3817
02:55:28,420 --> 02:55:31,420
Why do comments disappear like that?

3818
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:38,420
Perfectcomic.party is a pretty good idea, actually.

3819
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:40,420
I wonder how much it would be.

3820
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:43,420
I'll have a look.

3821
02:55:43,420 --> 02:55:47,420
Actually, I kind of forget how to do that.

3822
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:52,420
It's been so many years since I bought stcomics.com.

3823
02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:57,420
I can't remember my fucking accounts for my domain thingy.

3824
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:00,420
I'll have to figure that out.

3825
02:56:00,420 --> 02:56:02,420
Every single time I plug into anything,

3826
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:10,420
I always forget my password because it's just never in my head.

3827
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:13,420
Man, we got some cool listeners.

3828
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:14,420
Oh, hell yeah.

3829
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:23,420
It was really appreciating how good some of these messages we get every dang week are.

3830
02:56:23,420 --> 02:56:28,420
Have we given a voice grail to new for the comics?

3831
02:56:28,420 --> 02:56:29,420
I don't know that we have.

3832
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:36,420
God, if not, it would be a disgrace to the honored institution of the voice grail

3833
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:40,420
and to its sanctity.

3834
02:56:40,420 --> 02:56:50,420
Post humus, as in for the previous comics and this one, I think voice grail is deserved.

3835
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:54,420
Sure, if it hasn't already been.

3836
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:56,420
Must have, must have.

3837
02:56:56,420 --> 02:57:00,420
Although I don't know if you've actually maintained the list in a while.

3838
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:01,420
I thought I did.

3839
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:05,420
A while back, I thought I updated it.

3840
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:08,420
Okay, so the idea is that you died from the nose thing.

3841
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:10,420
You revived.

3842
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:12,420
And now we just look like this.

3843
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:14,420
And now.

3844
02:57:14,420 --> 02:57:16,420
Why did I look like that?

3845
02:57:16,420 --> 02:57:18,420
Before.

3846
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:21,420
Because I don't know.

3847
02:57:21,420 --> 02:57:24,420
But that's how the large nose man was defeated.

3848
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:28,420
They sucked my boobs away and he got too fat and he died.

3849
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:33,420
Oh, that's those are your huge boobs shoved in its nostrils.

3850
02:57:33,420 --> 02:57:35,420
I see.

3851
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:37,420
Oh my God.

3852
02:57:37,420 --> 02:57:39,420
Oh God, I just, I got it.

3853
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:42,420
I thought those were his eyes and the paper was like the pupils, but no.

3854
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:43,420
Oh God.

3855
02:57:43,420 --> 02:57:45,420
No, I see, I see.

3856
02:57:45,420 --> 02:57:47,420
That's really.

3857
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:49,420
This is freaky.

3858
02:57:49,420 --> 02:57:52,420
I'm going to throw up.

3859
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:59,420
Nobody draws, nobody draws a big sack of fat and skin like new.

3860
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:04,420
Really, really, there's a talent on display there.

3861
02:58:04,420 --> 02:58:06,420
One more voicemail.

3862
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:08,420
Oh, right.

3863
02:58:08,420 --> 02:58:13,420
Were you going to look, did you not look up a perfect party comic dot?

3864
02:58:13,420 --> 02:58:19,420
Oh yeah, it's just my, I have a cover account and I forgot my details.

3865
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:21,420
All right, we'll look into it later.

3866
02:58:21,420 --> 02:58:23,420
But we should do that like this week though.

3867
02:58:23,420 --> 02:58:24,420
Yes.

3868
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:27,420
Like before this episode comes out.

3869
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:30,420
The next one is a immature.

3870
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:33,420
I don't know what this is.

3871
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:37,420
CC comments on the Riku is gay video saying no shit.

3872
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:38,420
Ah, come on.

3873
02:58:38,420 --> 02:58:40,420
You can't just assume.

3874
02:58:40,420 --> 02:58:44,420
I didn't know you need a six hour video explaining it to you.

3875
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:47,420
Oh, it's not like it's gay as in like ha ha gay.

3876
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:49,420
It's just it's like.

3877
02:58:49,420 --> 02:58:54,420
No, no, like it's a romantic love story like Kingdom Hearts is a romantic gay love story

3878
02:58:54,420 --> 02:58:59,420
and Riku is the guy.

3879
02:58:59,420 --> 02:59:03,420
I, I mean, what do they say about Kyrie then?

3880
02:59:03,420 --> 02:59:05,420
Then what of Kyrie?

3881
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:15,420
The thing that's funny is that Kyrie is like kind of the love triangle is not for Kyrie's affection.

3882
02:59:15,420 --> 02:59:21,420
It is for Sora's affection and Kyrie and Riku are like both trying to win Sora's heart.

3883
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:23,420
That's that's sort of the way it's framed.

3884
02:59:23,420 --> 02:59:25,420
And it's like that makes so much more sense.

3885
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:26,420
It does.

3886
02:59:26,420 --> 02:59:33,420
At some point it does seem like, yeah, Sora is really is more interested in finding Riku.

3887
02:59:33,420 --> 02:59:40,420
Like even when he finds Kyrie, there's a scene like deconstruction where like he finds Kyrie and he's like, oh, hey, Kyrie.

3888
02:59:40,420 --> 02:59:42,420
Like at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2.

3889
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:43,420
It's like we found you.

3890
02:59:43,420 --> 02:59:46,420
But then Riku is here and he's like he's crying.

3891
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:47,420
Riku.

3892
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:48,420
Oh my God, Riku.

3893
02:59:48,420 --> 02:59:49,420
I can't believe it.

3894
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:50,420
Yeah.

3895
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:51,420
And Kyrie's there.

3896
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:52,420
It's like, OK.

3897
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:58,420
Well, it's because like Riku was like in Dark World because like Riku was in like more danger.

3898
02:59:58,420 --> 02:59:59,420
Yeah.

3899
02:59:59,420 --> 03:00:00,420
Yeah.

3900
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:01,420
But also.

3901
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:02,420
Yeah.

3902
03:00:02,420 --> 03:00:03,420
But yeah.

3903
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:04,420
Yeah.

3904
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:07,420
So this last voicemail is just a picture.

3905
03:00:07,420 --> 03:00:09,420
I think it's just a picture of a gummy bear apron.

3906
03:00:09,420 --> 03:00:10,420
You know.

3907
03:00:10,420 --> 03:00:12,420
Pretty cool apron, I guess.

3908
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:13,420
It's pretty good.

3909
03:00:13,420 --> 03:00:15,420
I mean, I would rather they be worms.

3910
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:17,420
I prefer the gummy worm to the gummy bear.

3911
03:00:17,420 --> 03:00:23,420
I made a test batch of low sugar gummies because I was thinking, what if I wanted to sell these?

3912
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:26,420
I was thinking like, do they last on the shelf?

3913
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:33,420
And I made some and I kept them in a little tub, a little sealed container, like something

3914
03:00:33,420 --> 03:00:34,420
I might sell them in.

3915
03:00:34,420 --> 03:00:38,420
And I was disappointed because they're very soft.

3916
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:43,420
Like they're quite soft on the shelf at room temperature.

3917
03:00:43,420 --> 03:00:44,420
And that's a bummer.

3918
03:00:44,420 --> 03:00:49,420
They kind of like stick together when you try to get them out of the bag.

3919
03:00:49,420 --> 03:00:56,420
And it's too bad because I know how to make them firmer, but it makes them taste worse.

3920
03:00:56,420 --> 03:01:04,420
So there's an unfortunate trade off there, but I'll might have to make it.

3921
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:06,420
Yeah.

3922
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:09,420
That's all I have to say about that.

3923
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:10,420
They're delicious though.

3924
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:11,420
They're guava flavored.

3925
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:13,420
They're light green guava.

3926
03:01:13,420 --> 03:01:15,420
They're just a little soft.

3927
03:01:15,420 --> 03:01:17,420
They kind of like fall apart.

3928
03:01:17,420 --> 03:01:21,420
Pull on them even a little bit.

3929
03:01:21,420 --> 03:01:23,420
That's the last voicemail.

3930
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:25,420
All right.

3931
03:01:25,420 --> 03:01:28,420
Let me refresh to see if we get any new ones.

3932
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:29,420
Nope.

3933
03:01:29,420 --> 03:01:34,420
No last minutes.

3934
03:01:34,420 --> 03:01:35,420
Okay.

3935
03:01:35,420 --> 03:01:36,420
Thank you for listening.

3936
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:37,420
I guess we're done for the week.

3937
03:01:37,420 --> 03:01:39,420
Three hours, respectable.

3938
03:01:39,420 --> 03:01:40,420
You know what?

3939
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:42,420
It's reasonable, healthy.

3940
03:01:42,420 --> 03:01:43,420
It's normal.

3941
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:45,420
People asking for five hours.

3942
03:01:45,420 --> 03:01:48,420
It's funny because of how stupidly long that is.

3943
03:01:48,420 --> 03:01:52,420
In five hours, I could almost explain to you why Riku is gay.

3944
03:01:52,420 --> 03:01:53,420
Almost.

3945
03:01:53,420 --> 03:01:55,420
That's the scale.

3946
03:01:55,420 --> 03:01:58,420
Yeah.

3947
03:01:58,420 --> 03:01:59,420
It's three hours.

3948
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:01,420
Three hours is long for a podcast.

3949
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:04,420
I don't think most podcasts run that long.

3950
03:02:04,420 --> 03:02:07,420
Some podcasts are 25 minutes.

3951
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:08,420
Yeah.

3952
03:02:08,420 --> 03:02:15,420
So we're really providing the value here on this free YouTube channel.

3953
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:16,420
Okay.

3954
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:20,420
Well, I guess anything else before we sign off?

3955
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:25,420
Go to twitch.tv slash Gibbentake to catch the next Fire Emblem stream.

3956
03:02:25,420 --> 03:02:28,420
I'm going to be doing that on Saturdays.

3957
03:02:28,420 --> 03:02:32,420
I might do them more often if I have a hankering forum.

3958
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:33,420
But yeah.

3959
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:34,420
Okay.

3960
03:02:34,420 --> 03:02:35,420
All right.

3961
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:39,420
I guess while you're there, maybe go to twitch.tv slash Saint Comics.

3962
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:43,420
I do intend to start doing more Mega Man again.

3963
03:02:43,420 --> 03:02:49,420
Probably I'm thinking Mondays and Fridays are what I would like to do.

3964
03:02:49,420 --> 03:02:51,420
Those are days I have free.

3965
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:53,420
So that's what I'm thinking.

3966
03:02:53,420 --> 03:03:01,420
And I'll fucking see you in hell.

3967
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:02,420
See you in hell.

3968
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:05,420
Perfect coming party coming soon.

3969
03:03:05,420 --> 03:03:06,420
Yeah.

3970
03:03:06,420 --> 03:03:07,420
All right, bye.

3971
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:08,420
All right, bye.

3972
03:03:08,420 --> 03:03:09,420
You'll be away.
