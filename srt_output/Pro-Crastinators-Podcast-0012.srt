00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,240
Hello and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,240
guy ever and I'm here with Jesse Wood. I am the punisher, I'm not me anymore. I knew

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:43,200
identity as the punisher. You're a punisher of ears and eyes, Hippocrit. Go on, Gibb. Are

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,000
you calling me ugly and also has a dumb voice? Yeah, that's correct. Gibb. I'm Hippocrit.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm going to put in twice as much effort today. You're going to be the first villain

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,320
I fucking punish. Good. And we're happy to have back with us. Perhaps the most qualified

7
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,840
of us, given his channel RebelPixels on this particular topic, Tommy Oliver. Because Gibbin's

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,800
putting in twice as much effort, I'm only going to put in half to balance it out. That

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,760
math checks out. That math checks out. Okay. So yeah, today's topic is effort. Putting

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,480
in effort, working hard at shit. Wait a minute, are you implying that I'm four times as worse

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,960
as you? He's, wait. That's the math. No, it's wrong. To balance it out. All right, before

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,840
we get into that, I want to say that the inspiration for this. I'm offended, I'm so angry. We watched

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,200
this video of this guy. I don't know how old he is. I think he's a high schooler. And

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,920
he has, in the video, it's him with all these Game Boy SPs lined up in a row. Game Boy Advance

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,600
SPs. And he's been grinding out, trying to catch a shiny ponytail. I think like in a

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,200
live stream for around six months, I think it took him. And in the video, he finally gets

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,120
it and he flips his shit. He goes absolutely ballistic. And it seems like perhaps the greatest

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,040
one is light. And he becomes the punisher. Yeah, his response. And so, but the thing

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,760
about it is, the thing about it is the comments are absolutely flooded with people saying

20
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,800
like, wow, what a fucking loser. What a piece of shit. This is how you spend your time.

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,000
This is what you want to do. And so just as a result of seeing these comments, we felt

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,120
inspired to comment on this phenomenon. So I'll just say right now that this man, doing

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,800
what he did, this man set himself a goal, right? He arranged everything he needed to

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,720
do. He got it. He got it going. He started the engine and he grinded it out every single

25
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,480
day doing this. And this isn't like, this isn't like doing something new all the time.

26
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,120
He did the same thing over and over again to achieve this very specific goal of catching

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,520
a shiny ponytail. And he fucking did it. He accomplished his goal. And these commenters,

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,960
man, these commenters have, I mean, admittedly, obviously they've never achieved anything

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,880
hard in their entire lives and never worked for something. They've never reached a pinnacle

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,840
of experience as a result of months and months of work on something. But if they had, they

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,320
would know that it's not about the value, the objective value, whatever the fuck that

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,040
means or whatever goal you're trying to reach. It's about personal satisfaction. And this

33
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,240
guy achieved the goal he was trying to reach. And he, as a result, was the happiest man

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:34,040
in the world for, you know, however long that lasted. And fuck everyone who doesn't disagree.

35
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,360
You people are just jealous that you don't have a shiny ponytail. Go fucking kill yourselves,

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
you pieces of shit. And that's what I have to say about it.

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah, he was, he was a role model.

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,280
Well, you know what? I have a shiny Mew and I got it for free at a Nintendo event. So

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
fuck that kid.

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Cause I'm better at the game than him and I didn't have to put in any effort at all.

41
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,240
I bet you were just as excited when you got that as when he got his shiny ponytail.

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,800
I was and still am. I still have my shiny Mew.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,120
In fact, it was better that way because you, you were just so happy. You didn't have to

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,840
put in all the time like this guy did.

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,440
Exactly. The true, the true joys in this life are the things you didn't have to work

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
for.

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,440
As Ben would say, the only way to win is not to play.

48
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,440
As Ben would say, the only way to win is to take you on Dutch Ones.

49
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
It is a good idea.

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,520
So what's that give? Sorry.

51
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,240
The whole point of the putting in effort for something that's completely pointless for

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,560
the rest of like, like compared to everyone else and everything else in your life. If

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,480
it's pointless, but you still like it, is it worth doing all that stuff?

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,600
And I would say for that, for that Pokemon thing, I mean, you didn't seem very old.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,360
So he didn't, he probably didn't have a lot of responsibility.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,960
So I would say probably like 16 or 17 or something.

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,080
I would say that was a good idea because he can say, I got it.

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,240
Look at how cool.

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,480
I mean, honestly, how many other people his age are willing to dedicate that amount of

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,760
time to something, you know?

61
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,480
And I know he was like streaming.

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,840
So he's got like a community going on.

63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,600
Obviously he's probably pretty into Pokemon in general.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,320
But like, it's just impressive no matter what they want to do.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,960
Like the guy who wanted to like eat a freight train and like did it.

66
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,440
It took him like 20 years or something and he's like digested every piece of it.

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,240
I don't know if that's real, but something like that.

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,400
It's like, wow, why would you do that?

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,280
That's probably actually causing you physical harm.

70
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,160
But he had a goal.

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,200
And I mean, all right, this is really what it comes down to for me.

72
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Our lives are completely meaningless.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
Nothing has any point whatsoever.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,360
So everything we do is an arbitrary, you know, it's all arbitrary.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,000
Any goal you set for yourself.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,320
If you want to, if you, let's, like the people who are going to be like, lol, he just spends

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,160
every night playing Pokemon, why don't you go get laid, bro?

78
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Why don't you go smash some puss dog, homie, my nigga.

79
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,920
You know, they talk like this because I'm a racist.

80
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,480
You know, that's a very offensive impression of me.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah.

82
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,680
It's, what, what are they getting out of that?

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
You know?

84
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,600
God, it makes me so, I want to strangle every person who fucking says this shit because

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
this guy just decided he was going to do something and he followed through with it.

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
And you know what?

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
You know what?

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,000
That ability to follow through on something is much more of a valuable skill than any arbitrary

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,880
ass thing you decide to set it to.

90
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,120
If you can achieve something that's like takes months to do, you can do anything you want.

91
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,200
This gets a better person than any fucking commenter.

92
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Exactly.

93
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,800
And that leads right into why I don't respect commenters and why I want to tell them personally

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,280
for the 100th time how much they sicken me and I want them all to commit suicide.

95
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
That would be ideal.

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,280
I fucking, leaving a YouTube comment takes no effort and that's why they're all cancer.

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,720
Yeah, really, that's the, that's the, that's like the secondary point here.

98
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,400
How much it is great to do things that take effort, but how little, if not a negative

99
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,720
impact you have on the world by doing things that take no effort.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,200
I think Jabroni can sit down on the computer and you know, watching your video through

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,360
a glass-eyed fog of retardation and fucking slam their ape-like fists onto the keyboard

102
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,000
and, and hash out some ignorance, spew it in your direction.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Any monkey could do that.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,280
In fact, I, I believe that most of them are monkeys or at least monkey-like, simian people.

105
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,040
Some kind of mutant hybrid created in, in the island of Dr. Giro or whatever the fuck

106
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
the animal guy was called.

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Dr. Giro, a different guy.

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Dr. Seuss.

109
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Dr. Seuss.

110
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Dr. Seuss, yes.

111
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,320
But, but if you fucking, if you watch a video on the internet and you disagree with it,

112
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,400
or even if you do agree with it, if you want to say anything at all pertaining to anything,

113
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,000
put in the effort, write something down, memorize something, fucking learn how to speak in public

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,760
or fucking turn out a camera and learn to dress nice, fucking comb your hair, stop being

115
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,160
a fat slob, all of you people, you're dumb and I don't like you and I don't like you

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,080
Tom, what do you make of all this?

117
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,800
I mean, I think, like you said, it's, it's that, you know, there is no purpose in life.

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,080
People ask, like, what's the purpose of living or like, why do we exist or whatever?

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,880
And like, the really liberating thing is that there is no point.

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Like we're all just like some genetic accident and we're just happened to be here.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're all going to die.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We're all going to rot.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,480
So that means that the point of life is whatever you want it to be.

124
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Well, except Jesse, obviously, but for the rest of us, yeah.

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Right.

126
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,720
It's kind of why I'm like very jealous of obsessively, like heavily autistic obsessive

127
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
people who have like a big thing that they really love and they do it all the time and

128
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,320
makes them super happy, you know, even though they won't be able to get a job or anything.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,840
It's, they're having fun.

130
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
I'm legitimately jealous.

131
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,160
My mother was a special ed teacher and so I met a fair amount of these people, but I'm

132
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,280
pretty jealous of just, you know, fairly retarded people because I mean, I'm not, I'm not trying

133
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,640
to shit on anybody.

134
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm just saying that like, if what is important to you in life is, you know, getting your

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,240
mac and cheese for dinner every day and you get it and you're over the fucking moon because

136
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,640
you got it while you're watching, you know, whatever shows you like to watch on TV.

137
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,720
And that's, that's the limit of, of what your understanding of happiness is and you're

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,200
at a hundred every night because you get it.

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
That's, that's literally the ideal way to live.

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
So we should all be retarded is what you're saying.

141
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Yeah.

142
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
We really should be retarded.

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,240
The only reason I'm at all interested in, in, excuse me, having any higher level of

144
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,040
intelligence than, than, uh, putting so much effort into, that's my effort right there.

145
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,680
The only reason I'm at all interested in putting any higher level of, of thought into any of

146
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,120
this is in the vain hope that perhaps humanity will one day rise above our, our bestial place

147
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,160
in the universe right now, maybe we'll become, you know, God's made of pure energy and our

148
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,880
existence will have some impact.

149
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
But frankly, like the universe.

150
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,320
If I'm going to become a God made of pure energy, I'm still, I'm still going to have

151
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,720
a stamp collection if I'm a God made of pure energy because I'm going to get bored otherwise.

152
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,760
If that, if you rule the universe, I mean, yeah, if that happens, it's going to happen

153
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,640
like millions of years after we're dead.

154
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Right.

155
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,640
And personally, I believe that if I'm going to die, then I want humanity to go extinct

156
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
right after.

157
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
I don't want humanity to achieve without me.

158
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,840
I don't want them to continue because you're taking the, the cuja from Final Fantasy nine

159
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
route.

160
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Yeah, exactly.

161
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,040
That's the best route.

162
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,600
He didn't have the right fashion ideas, but you know, his whole nihilism, his belief structure,

163
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,280
his desire to end all life.

164
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,520
You know, I can respect that.

165
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,640
He is not deserving of continuing without me.

166
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,880
You know, that's why Kuj is a great villain because, you know, he just, it's a totally

167
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
understandable thing that he did.

168
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,240
He thought he was going to live forever.

169
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,480
But then when he found out he wasn't, he's like, oh, shit, this changes everything.

170
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,400
And as a result, he's like, well, if I'm going to die, so does everything else need

171
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
to.

172
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Yeah.

173
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,640
You know, Final Fantasy nine is, you know, can this be a Final Fantasy podcast?

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Absolutely.

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,960
Whatever the crappy fucking topicals.

176
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,080
Kuj was willing to put in the work to blow up everything.

177
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
That's a guy you can respect, you know.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,240
He went straight from zero to a hundred like that.

179
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,560
And that's, that's the kind of guy I want to destroy my world.

180
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Hmm.

181
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
But you know, I mean.

182
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
You could destroy my box.

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Yeah.

184
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
That's what I want.

185
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,520
We can, we all know this stuff.

186
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,400
We have something of a basis to talk about this from, because we're all creators and

187
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:10,400
we all do make shit that, you know, could mayor, that we throw into the void to hopefully

188
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,320
be valued, but easily could not be, despite putting tons of effort into it.

189
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,000
Right now, as I've talked about many times, working on a video, I've been working on four

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,040
months and months and months and just, just today in fact, and yesterday, I found two videos

191
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
that have come out.

192
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Okay.

193
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,280
I wrote this video, but it's about Undertale spoilers.

194
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
The game that shall not be named.

195
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,440
I wrote it back in October, right, like a month after the game came out and it was ready.

196
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,040
I just needed to edit it.

197
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Shit comes up and I'm still working, been working on it the whole time.

198
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,760
And in the meantime, I have seen not one, but two videos that cover all the exact same

199
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,200
points, rendering intellectually rendering my effort completely useless.

200
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
There's no intellectual benefit.

201
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,000
I could just, you know, make a video that points to these and that would be just as

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,760
valuable to the collective consciousness as the thing that I'm currently working on.

203
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Maybe my production values are better, but it doesn't matter.

204
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,640
But the point is, I'm not going to stop because, well, I guess it's, it's because I care about

205
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,720
myself and making the thing I'm making more than I do about the intellectual content of

206
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
it, I guess.

207
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,640
So actually maybe I'm doing the wrong thing.

208
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,680
Maybe I should just stop and kill myself.

209
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Never mind.

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
No.

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
No.

212
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
You should make it.

213
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Well, that's the whole thing.

214
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Is that like you can't, you can't care.

215
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,040
It gets like the trap of YouTube and the internet and like this whole connected culture in general

216
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
is that like because everything can be like quantified and measured and like reach can

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,360
be like easily keeping track of now and like popularity and things like that, you know,

218
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,800
it's so easy to like get downtrodden and get distracted by the fact that like you have

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
X amount of reach when you want Y amount of reach.

220
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Yeah.

221
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Yeah.

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,200
And that's really annoying, especially I think it's gotten even worse kind of now that

223
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,760
we have Patreon because now like not only do you get like popularity measurement, you

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,880
have like monetary measurements as well.

225
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
That's true.

226
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,920
It's like everything about like someone's creativity now can be quantified in like real

227
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,640
world terms that like matter.

228
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,800
And so all of a sudden the thing you're doing for passion now has a lot of real world implications.

229
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,720
And if you want to chase that obviously, because like this is the thing you enjoy is what you

230
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,960
want to do with your life, but now it becomes a job and it becomes a competition because

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,200
you know, it's like a free market.

232
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,720
So you have to like make yourself marketable and you have to do all that shit.

233
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,000
And so all of a sudden you're kind of passions being poisoned by like the rest of life.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
Yeah, totally.

235
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,360
So it's like you have to kind of disconnect yourself from that, which is super difficult

236
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,000
because like you want to keep consuming more content because there's so much at your fingertips

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,480
that you can like be inspired by and things like that.

238
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,160
But at the same time, it's almost like disheartening to see someone do something so much better

239
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,600
or have so much more success, especially when they're worse than you and they have more

240
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,720
success and you don't understand like what the secret sauce is there.

241
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Both of these videos that cover what I have covered.

242
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,800
Each one, one has 115,000 views.

243
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,040
The other has 250,000 views.

244
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm just curious to see how much mine will climb to when I finish it.

245
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,680
Man, I gotta, yeah, I gotta talk about that because that's a topic that's near and dear

246
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,920
to my heart.

247
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,600
It's more successful channels than you that are also way crappier than you who then release

248
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,320
a crappier version of a video that you were planning to make or that you have made.

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
Oh, and you've seen tons of that, especially in the pony days.

250
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Oh yeah.

251
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,880
Anthony C. has been ripping me off for his entire fucking career and I'll go ahead and

252
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,320
say that on record right now.

253
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Everything he's ever said in his videos is a crappier version of something I said in

254
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
my videos.

255
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
There you go.

256
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,040
But also, you know, lacking the self-awareness and the comedic timing and the intellectualism

257
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
and the wit.

258
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Mm-hmm.

259
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Right.

260
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
But I digress.

261
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Uh, what the fuck was I saying?

262
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
I don't remember.

263
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Well, if you're talking about shittier people making more popular things.

264
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Okay, yeah.

265
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,960
Forget Anthony C. I was gonna bring this around to a guy that I really hate, which is a YouTuber

266
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,560
by the name of Nerdwriter, but I'm pretty sure we all hate.

267
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,480
I just found out who Nerdwriter was like two days ago because you kept bitching about him

268
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
on Twitter and I had to look him up.

269
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't think I'd say I hate him, but there are some major grievances that I'm sure you'll

270
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
go into.

271
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Yeah.

272
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,660
He's my favorite.

273
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,160
He's my favorite.

274
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,940
Uh, I didn't see it.

275
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,360
Donnie, get out of here.

276
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Donnie possessed Gibbon.

277
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,160
That wasn't really him.

278
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,640
He's like a evil spirit that consumes this all.

279
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah.

280
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,320
So, one of my favorite cartoons of all time is Hey Arnold.

281
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,640
And I've been wanting to make a video about it forever.

282
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,600
And where'd everyone go?

283
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Is this the-

284
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
We're here.

285
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Did I break it up?

286
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
No, we're all single quiet.

287
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Be quiet.

288
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,560
Waiting with aided breath for your words of farting and making noises. Anyways, my point is

289
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Putting in the effort

290
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:00,400
No, I wrote a hey Arnold video like fucking months ago like five months. Yes shit and I saw in nerd writers comments

291
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Some some fucking Jbrown in his comments was like hey nerd writer since you're the smartest fucking the best

292
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
guy of all time on

293
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,160
YouTube you should make a video about hey Arnold and he just responded to it and like okay

294
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,100
I will and and the fucking the clouds parted

295
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,920
Millions of thumbs up and people are losing their fucking minds. Yes nerd writer is finally gonna show the world about hey

296
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,420
Arnold, that's my fucking job

297
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,960
I'll do it better. I'll do it better than you can and he's gonna come out with some asinine shitty

298
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,800
Modeling manipulative fucking video about

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,360
If you look into it from the right perspective, you'll see that hey Arnold is about us

300
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,240
He's gonna ruin he's gonna ruin hey Arnold for all time is gonna ruin it for me

301
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,080
He's gonna try to take it from me just like everyone ever from of all time is stolen every idea

302
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,400
I've ever had and I've gotten no credit for it. Yeah, it's like that's the whole point right like we're talking about like putting

303
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
In the effort and stuff like and now we're just shitting on nerd writer

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,100
But like it does objectively massive amounts of work on most of his videos. He really does put in the

305
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,400
What are we talking about right now? I supposed to be talking about

306
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I was gonna talk about

307
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,920
He's putting in the effort on hating nerd writer. We'll put yeah, that's true

308
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah, I am putting in the work for that. I think it's got a real point though

309
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,620
I was gonna say about the way my channel has been

310
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Like I've I've thought about the way I make videos because my last video a few days ago the puzzle pirates thing

311
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,840
Hmm

312
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,040
Nobody is putting in effort for like making your channel big and grow and get all the stuff and doing doing the things

313
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,680
Nobody cares or knows about puzzle pirates and I've got like a few videos planned that I like very specifically for me

314
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,080
Like nobody would really get them unless they were very like like very similar

315
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
upbringings and stuff

316
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,160
So I'm not really like going

317
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,440
Putting in the effort to make it like a like a youtuber if you know what I mean

318
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Yeah, it's just I just like and it's helping me like like if you were a youtuber

319
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,440
You'd be doing a review of the division right now or something like that or undertale

320
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,320
Yeah, I would be doing something that would get me views and I just it's not really making me

321
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,960
Motivate because I for a long time

322
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,240
I was thinking I got to do ratchet and clank 2 next because I want to talk about that and and the first one and people

323
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,120
Asking for it, and I just couldn't think of anything at the time

324
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,280
So yeah, yeah, it's it's it's better for me to just think of my channel as a hobby for the moment

325
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
And then I'll put in the effort

326
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,800
In into making it cool for me and then later it will it's not like it's just I'm just saying like you can put in effort to

327
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,600
To you can lack effort and it could still be good because if I was trying really hard to make videos to get big

328
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,120
I would not be making anything because I'd be like right because there's this there's definitely a

329
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,560
sense of like

330
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,440
Paralysis when you're when you're like oh god like eight you can say it on h3h you three's vlogs lately

331
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,120
They're like man like like h3h 3h 3h 3 has just reached like a million subscribers not long ago

332
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,720
And like now they've got their other channel because they're like too scared to make anything to put on their main channel because they're afraid

333
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,420
It won't be good enough. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's it's like that

334
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,200
Yeah

335
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,680
But do you think it's a serious problem and that's why I put in the effort to have multiple channels

336
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,240
because

337
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,200
The fact that I have a channel like my Japanese anime is or a channel like the blue glow or man child think you know

338
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,960
Those channels all have strong gimmicks and strong themes. Yeah, and a strong kind of content

339
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,400
Which frees up my main channel and the stress and allows me on that channel to just not give a fuck at all and post

340
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
Whatever inane insane crap that I want

341
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,560
That's true, you know, I was just talking to a to a to a guy

342
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,840
I know about how the interesting thing about your your channel set up your your multiple channel set up is that

343
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:19,080
Your the fact that you've got multiple channels with different identities is is part of the narrative basically

344
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,420
Yeah, and but it's just that that narrative isn't really the one most suited to succeeding on YouTube. Oh, yeah, and it's yeah, you know

345
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,960
Someone just messaged me

346
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,960
I never mind just you just make your own website. That's that guy with the glasses, but just I was gonna do that

347
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,920
I was different. That's smart. Yeah, I was I was I was going to

348
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
When Johnny with the channels

349
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
Yeah

350
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,400
Yeah, when Johnny old school decided that he wasn't gonna be Johnny old school anymore

351
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
He said I'll just give you my site and you can change it to your site

352
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,240
Oh blue, but it was like I would have had to buy a domain name

353
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,600
I would have had to yeah put an effort to make the fucking thing to make the website

354
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
So you got to put in the effort

355
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I don't want

356
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,240
Smart you got to play smart not hard. Here's a question about effort. Do you think that effort is

357
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,240
Affected by passion because I would say absolutely

358
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
because

359
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Any any video that I'm making

360
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,960
For the purpose of like well, I got to make this video

361
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,240
It's never gonna get fucking made. Yeah, but when I get distracted by some other totally stupid idea

362
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:39,040
Those videos like 90% of my videos that I've actually made are videos that are like distractions that I did to get away from an actual video

363
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,120
Yeah, that is the entirety of my give-and-take channel, right?

364
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,840
I was gonna say bring it back to what you were just saying is that like you're not some of you're putting an effort

365
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,080
You're not putting an effort you are it's just you're putting effort into things like

366
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,640
You can go with like passion or marketing, you know, like yeah, like the two kind of extremes

367
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,240
I can be like whore yourself out and talk about what people want to hear or you can put an effort to like be very authentic

368
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,160
And I don't know about you guys

369
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,440
I've said this many times before but I

370
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Greatly respect anyone who would even put in the work required to run a YouTube channel

371
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,720
Even if you make shit at least you're doing something, you know, and and that's I mean at the very least that's better than your average commenter

372
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:24,200
Even if they're you know terrible videos at least this guy's show got something to show for and and creative people when they do that when they get

373
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,320
Distracted with other like, you know sillier or more personal projects in between the actual work

374
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,000
You'll trick yourself into thinking that you're doing a shitty job or not doing enough work

375
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,280
When really you're doing a shitload of work and you're making great shit

376
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,160
It's just not what you think you should be doing so you don't count it for yourself in your head and you make yourself

377
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,560
Like yeah, the last three videos that I posted were all like asinine crap

378
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,320
That just like came to me like that and I like made like you know ten minutes or whatever

379
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,680
I'm fucking crows video or the file which video or the and they all ruled incident everybody fucking loves those videos

380
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,760
They all have like massive thumbs up. Yeah, everybody's like yes, you're making good content again

381
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,240
And it's like well, I wanted to be making shitty content, but that's a lot of work

382
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,120
So I guess I'll have to settle for making good videos

383
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,360
Yeah, it's it's it's tough to when you're an artistic person

384
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,120
It's you get into a habit of second-guessing yourself

385
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,840
Well, like a lot of a lot of it is like the stuff that I value was often vastly different from what my audience values, of course

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,200
Of course

387
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,280
And that's kind of the problem when you I value like a two-hour video of me

388
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,280
Fucking around my room in corpse paint talking about raping children eating

389
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,120
That's and that's going to go I'm looking forward to it

390
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,040
You know the I think we've mentioned him on the show before but the new storyteller

391
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,520
You know that guy who dresses up as Gumby and read stories when I was thinking of he's he's the cool

392
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,200
He makes like videos

393
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,840
Like they're they're borderline on watchable

394
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,520
But they're so charming because he's I think he's like got a mental problem

395
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,720
And he lives with his mother and he plays with Thomas the Tank Engine toys and reads stories allowed

396
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,560
But like really far from the camera, so you can't hear what he's saying and they're like hours long and he's like hundreds of videos

397
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:15,080
Something like three a day and each hour long like that's the average putting in the effort and it goes back to the whole autism thing

398
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,280
Like I'm so jealous of that guy because he's having the time of his life making all these videos that nobody's watching

399
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Yeah, it's just it's that's the whole thing right

400
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:28,520
That's the trap because when you care about your audience and you care about your popularity or your reception of your content

401
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,400
Like you damn yourself to always being not satisfied

402
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,240
Which is why it's so dangerous to kind of go pro as an artist

403
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,040
As you're you're forcing yourself to be you know, what's the word subservient or or at the behest of of you know

404
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,480
An audience even even if they're just you know, your viewers

405
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,400
You feel pressures no matter what to to optimize what you're trying to do

406
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Which is going to affect the kind of shit you want to produce for example

407
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,120
I don't think it is in at all smart for me to continue producing

408
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,720
Uh best anime ever is best game ever is in the way that I have been

409
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,360
It it's taken me months to get these out

410
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,160
There's no way I can keep doing it and achieve the kind of stuff

411
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,880
I want to so I'm gonna have to radically change my formula and I've already taken a bunch of steps to uh

412
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,000
To make that happen

413
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,520
So, you know, I think my my vision is gonna have to change if I want to be at all successful and frankly

414
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,720
I think we can all agree digital success is pissing me the fuck off

415
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,240
That's the topic that needs to be this. Let's thank god. He's not here. Yeah

416
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,760
Yeah, thank god. He sold out quit the procrastiners podcast to go beyond anthony fantano's podcast

417
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,800
He's going on the hollywood hogan podcast as we speak

418
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Making me fucking say

419
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah, he was literally on anthony fantano's podcast

420
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,640
Man, he's um, yeah, we need to kill him. We need to we have to kill him. That's the only yeah, we decided

421
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,520
We've decided we either need to kill him or we need to like abuse his power and get him to show all of us

422
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,200
But you know, but you see no we're much more comfortable killing him because we don't want pity

423
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,600
We we rather forcibly take them. Yeah

424
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,360
It it it sickens me to think that the only time that I gain subscribers

425
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,760
is when digi

426
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,560
Promotes me in a video and I'm not saying that one of us recently. I'm not saying I want him to stop promoting me

427
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,440
But I'm saying that I'm sickened with myself for not wanting him to stop. I don't that was like a triple negative

428
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah, we know what you're saying. We we have to it's we have to kill

429
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,040
It's sad to think that we're all dependent on the one of us

430
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,400
But I don't I want to I want to I want to shield forever. I was I just want to well, you know

431
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,200
The loser but I think the thing about this is the most loser right digi totally has found his sweet spot

432
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,600
And he seems he seems pretty happy with the content he's making and he's working really hard at it and it's great

433
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,000
So for him, it's absolutely perfect. Um

434
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,040
Oh, excuse me, but you know, it's it's just frustrating for guys like us who

435
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,960
Are just more are more inclined to make to taking longer to make things

436
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,080
And I mean, I don't want I don't want to oversell myself like I fuck around

437
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,920
You know quite a bit as well. I could do things faster, of course

438
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,480
But like, you know, my my dream video isn't the same as digi's dream video

439
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,200
Like his his his asterisk war thing was absolutely beautiful for for youtube

440
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,920
I mean, even then we're probably took a little longer to make that

441
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,440
Yeah, the kind of content he wants to make is also just happens to be the kind of content that yeah

442
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,000
That's why he's so successful right now diminish his his intellectual ability to you know, make the right content

443
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,480
He's done it all intentionally. Look at his leaving pony

444
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,000
Like he reset his whole shit after vast success because you know, he wanted to succeed and he's done it

445
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,800
He's capitalized on it, but you know, it's just something that I'll never have in my work. I will never

446
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Value what my audience values in the sleigh

447
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,240
Because yeah, yeah, you just got out once you're once you're above it like like the red letter media folks

448
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,240
They're just above that shit doesn't matter anymore. They'll just keep making a half of the bags

449
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,520
It's I mean, I'm not going to say that those are super easy to make but they make them for themselves

450
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,640
Seems pretty clear. They they do not take shit seriously

451
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,200
It's it's great. It'd be great to have a situation like that. Yeah, maybe one day

452
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,960
It's interesting that you say that you're at a point where you have to

453
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,120
Change up your style with the best guy ever and try to make it so that you can get them out faster

454
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,040
whereas

455
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,400
I've I've decided on like exactly the opposite solution. I see whereas I have

456
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Stopped giving a fuck entirely

457
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
I've been releasing like

458
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,680
as the most random

459
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Like I posted a tweet where like I posted like the screenshot of like my video history of the last couple months

460
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,600
And it's like all this random shit that has nothing to do with each other

461
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Like, you know, I used to think like oh man, you know, if I try to give my channel a strong theme and make everything fit

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And look nice together on the video page. I'll get more. I don't give a fuck anymore. Well, good. Good. That's the sound of sucking dick

463
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah, it's the sound of sucking dick. Exactly time to fucking

464
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Jack in your ding dong

465
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,800
And I'm just I've just had it with that shit dong

466
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,440
Yeah, I am he got lost in a tragic accident just as we all know he's a pirate

467
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,600
So we had to replace the wooden dick. Well, you know, my father Gepetto. He taught me a lot of things

468
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,800
And the main thing he taught me was how to jack me wouldn't

469
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
do

470
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,840
I can't believe there's a Pinocchio porn of that up to this point

471
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Exactly a lot of that tree sap comes up

472
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,480
And a mosquito gets caught in it and that's how I gave birth to the fucking

473
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,280
And that is how Jurassic Park happened a mosquito got trapped and Pinocchio's sap jizz

474
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,440
And 2,000 billion years later Jurassic Park takes place

475
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Little wooden boy

476
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,840
We put in the extra effort on this joke. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Imagine sanding down that that

477
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,320
Sanding down

478
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,080
To make it all smooth. You know, I I I had to I had to just listen to my conscience. Mr. Jiminy Dickett

479
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Came down

480
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Mr. Jiminy Jacket

481
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Ah

482
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,720
By the way, I have a bone to pick with you Gibbo

483
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,520
What happens last week when we did our amazing procrastineers dark soul race

484
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,800
And I revived the once-in-future legendary hero of Lordran

485
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Uh, what's her name Anita?

486
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
I I I I said

487
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,160
Gib you gotta post the the original Anita's occasion video so that people have context for her adventures

488
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,520
Oh, you wanted to post it on procrastinators. Yeah, or you know, link it in the description and Gib

489
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
He didn't put in the effort to link

490
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,280
The original by that time I had looked off of the thing

491
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,800
Well, which means that the the viewers had no context. They didn't understand it

492
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,520
That some of the commenters got mad at me. They said I don't like Anita's occasion. I have no sense of humor

493
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I think you're gay. I think you're fucking

494
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,440
I'm a misogynist and I hate women's, you know, you know, we have a lot of misogynists in our audience

495
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,280
Can we just address that? It's sad but true. It's sad but true. We need to we need to you know

496
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,640
Get rid of this toxicity. I've been thinking of pulling our comments all together from procrastinators

497
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,680
You know, it's just I'm not ready to subject innocent viewers to that level of hatred of hate speech

498
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:22,440
It's just find the comment section to be really problematic and that's right. You know, that's right. That's absolutely right

499
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:29,000
The like bar itself can't be trusted to have a strong progressive message that we need that that is really

500
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,760
I mean the point of the show the point of the show is to instill our social values and the people who listen. So, you know

501
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,080
Fuck you

502
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
That's what I'm trying to say

503
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,360
Um, yeah, what can we say that's related to the topic?

504
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
I don't know. I don't know

505
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,240
We didn't put off an upper up an effort into this

506
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,400
Well, no, okay. Here's here's a question then would you wrap like which we're talking about how digi's super successful

507
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,520
Doing what he does and how like we're not there and how we hate him

508
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,120
Yeah, and how we want looking for more success and the only reason I'm not as more successful than digi's because I've

509
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,280
Been working at university. So I haven't had time to make the amazing video the best videos of all time

510
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Which is a decent excuse actually

511
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,320
And you've been your animations, which are great, which we are

512
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,880
I'm gonna become way bigger than digi's

513
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,120
Looking forward to it not to mention you also are like in talks. You're you're working with an actual animation studio now

514
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,680
We forgot to mention that gibbons the most successful really in the real he literally is the most successful

515
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
He's the most legit the most the most most

516
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,240
Normie in the good way s guy of us all and he's gonna he's gonna make us all wish we were dead soon enough the way digi does now

517
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,120
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. Yeah, this guy. He's gonna be the next fucking the next rebecca sugar

518
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,440
He's the next alex hersch lauren foust. Yeah, whoever the fat hip man. He is who made adventure time

519
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
He's gonna try to make youtube videos

520
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,040
Imagine how hard it is to work in the studio where the man's trying to fuck you the whole time

521
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,440
Imagine producing something like like like steven universe in that environment, you know

522
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,800
Or or any kind of real show that involves so many people working together

523
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,480
That's a that's a whole animal that gibb's gonna get into and I man. I'm excited to hear more about it

524
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,640
Let's say once you're you know, did you meet with her recently? You got like a meeting coming up meeting with her tomorrow actually tomorrow

525
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,040
Oh, yeah

526
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,120
Well, this is the last time we'll see him on this podcast. He's yeah, he's moving up in the world

527
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Forget about us

528
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,880
Me and nate sitting here like two gay idiots sucking on my beer bottle

529
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,280
It's too it's too cool to be praised for being the the cool guy

530
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,880
So I it's it's on the hollywood bound

531
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,240
Wow

532
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm the cool moving with jon tron in hallywood. No no ego raptor. Yeah elmo raptor

533
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,960
So tom you were saying something we cut you off. What were you saying?

534
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,640
Well, my question was going to be like because we're all doing different things

535
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,080
And did you's being very successful doing what he's doing? I don't think any of us would do what he does

536
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,280
Mm-hmm. I'm I'm kind of sorting. I'm kind of planning to mimic him in his style. I mean it was successful

537
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,920
Um, but whatever I don't go on the question. I guess it's like would you rather be successful

538
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,960
Doing something you're just meh about would you rather?

539
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,480
Be kind of unknown doing something you have

540
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Tons of personal

541
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,400
Is the question at the heart of being an artist

542
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,240
You don't need to make that much money to be alive all of my enemies die

543
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,720
Seeing them all driven before me. Yeah, the lamentation of the women. That's my true

544
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:51,880
Hence becoming the punisher. I mean what what are you gonna do if not just become uh, uh, I mean

545
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,360
It's not fair to describe him even as an anti hero because he's just a hero

546
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,840
A man who kills everyone who disagrees with his opinion

547
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,600
This this word anti hero this this anti hero meme needs to go away

548
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,440
I'm you know, just because you know, here's here's the thing people

549
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,400
Good people aren't always nice people and nice people aren't always good people

550
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,920
Sometimes you need a guy who's willing to cross those lines that the other cowards won't cross

551
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,560
You need a guy who's willing to do what needs to be done to clean up these fucking streets and wash away the filth

552
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Once and for all that's choking the life

553
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,080
of this city

554
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,360
Even even by his own volition batman is not willing to take on the burden of being willing to murder people

555
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,560
To achieve his goal, but the punisher on the other hand that guy will do whatever it fucking shakes to get his shit straight

556
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,880
Fucking dirty harry any any guy who kills people is my hero

557
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,920
That's that's why I've never really liked batman. He's such a high horse faggot

558
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,280
He is he is a very high horse guy. I mean he he'll try to spook you

559
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,040
He'll spook you real good

560
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,040
I mean not to get too far off base, but I always thought it was interesting that they do that with batman

561
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:06,600
But they lately I think they present that as like a weakness like a character flaw almost what that's the core of the character

562
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,480
That was his yeah, I've been thinking about this ton. That's a good point. I hate that I hate

563
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,920
This trend of like cynicism and how superheroes are perceived or written

564
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,600
Where it's like like how they really should be killing people all the time like this trend of oh batman creates his villains

565
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,600
Batman, uh, he made them all worse. Yeah, what is that? Oh, yeah, you know what fuck you

566
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,000
Batman doesn't kill the joker because he's fucking batman. You know, he's a good guy

567
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:37,640
The whole point of batman is what makes him great is that he has suffered fucking trauma

568
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,680
He's emotionally traumatized. He has he's he's he's mentally ill and because of that

569
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,480
He takes pity on his mentally ill

570
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,440
Enemies, you know he Batman my batman is the guy you ever see that episode of the animated series with that

571
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,360
With that with baby doll

572
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,400
Yes, she's she's oh, yeah, yeah, of course. She's this midget. She's a dangerous. It's the saddest story ever told

573
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,040
She's a dangerous fucking criminal. She kills people. She shoots people

574
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,840
But at the end of the episode she breaks down because all this shit just happened because she's had a fucked up life

575
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,640
And what does batman do he doesn't punch her in the fucking nose

576
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,280
He holds her and he takes pity on her and he takes her to the fucking police station peacefully

577
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,800
That's why batman's a great hero and I'm sick and tired of this fucking this this cynical trend of well

578
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,080
If batman would just kill all of his bad guys that's deathly his batman because he doesn't

579
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,560
Man, I while we're talking I gotta bring up

580
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,720
I gotta bring up the greatest batman story of all time which is in the justice league

581
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,160
I don't know like unlimited where it's it's telling the future where it shows

582
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,480
Where his worst enemy that that fat black lady whatever her name was who was like his moral enemy

583
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,120
Holy shit. Yeah, where he he there's this there's this crazy psycho girl

584
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,400
Who's mutating the whole fucking world and like all of new york city is going to be fucking leveled if they don't stop her

585
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,160
And so he's like, okay, we need someone to go kill her. That's the only way to stop her

586
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,680
So, uh, she gives batman this he's like, I'll fucking do it. I'm gonna fucking end this. I'll do whatever it takes man

587
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,480
They're like damn batman you you crazy nigga get in there

588
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,320
So he goes in and this lady who can read minds this little this kid named ace leader of the royal flush gang

589
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
She goes in there and he's just like

590
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,840
If he just walks up to her and she's like, hey batman, he's like, yo, what's up girl?

591
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,960
And she's like so you came here to stop me and he's like, yep

592
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,560
And she's like you're gonna kill me and he's like nope just gonna be your friend, bro

593
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,320
And he just holds her hand. He just holds her hand while she dies

594
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
She's just because because she's like, oh man

595
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,680
My childhood was all fucked up by these asshole scientists nigga. It was fucking gay as hell dog

596
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,480
You know what that's like, you know what that's like, don't you bruce? And he's like, fuck. Yeah, I do exactly

597
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,840
And you know what the cynic the cynicism comes from is a critical misunderstanding of who batman is

598
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Even his man enemy says that's the real batman. That's the guy, dude

599
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,760
Batman is not batman doesn't be batman for vengeance. He doesn't do it to hurt criminals

600
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,480
He does it to prevent crime to prevent other children from going through what he did

601
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,600
He's doing it to save victims not to kill people. You know, here's the thing. I fucking love the punisher

602
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,160
I love kasey jones. I love vigilantes who fucking kill people and i'm sure most people

603
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,200
Tend to agree with these characters that criminals should be fucking put down and killed

604
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,640
I certainly agree with it

605
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:19,160
But that doesn't mean that i'm going to apply that logic to batman because the basis of his character is an entirely different fucking philosophy

606
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
That is equally valid. You can't

607
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,520
It also seems like most of his villains are indeed insane

608
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,960
Uh, well, yeah, I mean, I mean you kind of happen to be insane

609
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,000
He doesn't even come up against like just asshole brutes who want to kill people

610
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,600
They're they usually fucked up themselves. Yeah, I mean his original enemy was like the mob, right?

611
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,880
And the mob is like an evil organization that sort of justifies our legitimately mentally ill

612
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,600
They need help. They don't need to be murdered. That's right. That's right

613
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,160
Well, what was that related to the batman podcast everybody put a lot of effort into that tangent

614
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,560
