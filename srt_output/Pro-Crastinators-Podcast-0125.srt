00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello everyone, welcome to an episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here we are to listen to your every sin, everything you've done, it's time for you to confess.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's time for a laid back, therapeutic episode of the PCP.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is ASMR. This is better than-

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
HELL NO! We're getting rowdy up in this piece!

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We have Digi.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Self-explanatory.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We have Nate.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Self-explanatory.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We have Hippo.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Self-explanatory.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have Ben.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm supposed to be sleeping right now.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, that's Ben. Don't you know that that seems like it's been fucking banished from ever trying this podcast ever again?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You know, our iconic theme song that everyone knows the words Ann Mellie to has been fucking, you know, obliterated.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's in the fucking new version! It's in it!

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It is in it. It is literally in it.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wait, the one with the stay at home mom and dad?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, if you listen close, if you open up the baby ears of yours, you'll hear the melody.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you open up the frequencies, if you open up the waveforms on a dash, you're gonna be able to make up in, you know, distant.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Distant in the background.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It is the instrumental. He is using the instrumental in the opening song. You can hear it.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't hear it. Stupid.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, you have not paid attention then. The fault lies with you friend, not with me.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ben, you're in a grouchy mood today.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am in a fucking grouchy mood today. I didn't want to...

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I stayed up late last night waking up a ghost, okay? I had to summon a ghost and it was really stupid.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It made me very upset.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh yeah, what the hell was that? You said you were going to a seance or something?

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, I had a seance.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because there's a ghost in my house, you guys.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Or maybe not a ghost. Maybe just a spirit.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Could be a low level.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Maybe not a demon, could be an incubus.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Maybe just a phenomena. Maybe just some kind of phenomena.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How does it feel to be a certified scientist with like a master's degree?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
As a bachelor's.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Feels great. Feels wonderful.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In a house with ghosts.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well...

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're still out of your element, Ben. This house doesn't apply to you.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, I'm weak to ghosts. I'm literally weak to ghosts type.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And you know what? They really took their toll on me. I had to sleep it off.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I had to sleep off.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How late did you spend?

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The time is not matter. The time is not matter. Just because my sleep schedule.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The point is I was supposed to be sleeping through that whole period, but instead I wasn't.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's funny you say this, Ben, because I also have been up all night.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And Tom was too. I'm guessing that he passed out at some point. That's why he's not here.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
For like two seconds before the show started.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And then he was like, fuck this. I can't stay away.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He said like two words that were irrelevant. You know, like usual.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, three slaves, but you know, irrelevant.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You had a seance. We had a blood sacrifice at this house.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because Tom spent...

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What's going on with you guys? I'm the only pure Christian boy left in the museum.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Were you becoming games?

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Tom was setting up for our games to become even greater by building a server and streaming PC in the house,

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
which he spent like 15 hours doing last night because of a comedy of errors.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
One of which was the computer slicing his finger open.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And apparently it was like Kill Bill blood spraying all over the place.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's like dried blood in places where blood shouldn't reach from a finger.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's intense. Me and Mae were not home when this happened.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we just come home and Tom's like, yeah.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's come home and there's blood everywhere.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait, wait, so Ben, what are the specifics of this ghost?

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Like has a poltergeist invaded and started knocking down family heirlooms and sacred urns in a hilarious comedic fashion?

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oops, my grandmother's ashes are all over the floor.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Listen, because there is a small chance that my housemates could listen to this podcast,

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not going to say that I think they're fucking retards for doing any of this.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I will. I'll say it for you.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Your housemates are fucking retards for believing ghosts.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What about the whole story here?

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So one guy, he was smoking on the porch one day and he claims...

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The devil's lettuce.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, so we had like a broken door, right?

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like the doorknob was extremely loose and would fall off the door.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's the work of a ghost right there, for sure.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, yeah, to start, yeah.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So this doorknob would fall off very easily. It was not held on very well.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He claims that one day he was sitting out there and the doorknob just flew off the door in an arc and like landed kind of by his feet.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And this spooked him really bad.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You know, for days this was all he would talk about.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Jesus Christ.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is that he witnessed a paranormal event.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I mean, if that was true, it would be spooky.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure, whatever.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I get it, I guess.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Did anybody ask him if there was wind that night, by chance?

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We're talking about like a metal door.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Look, the thing he describes, if it happened as described, would be very strange and hard to explain for the doorknob to fly off in an arc.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Just the problem is like, how reliable is one sense?

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How do you know you didn't just see it at the corner of your eye and that's not really like, you know, how do you know?

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Of course.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The human error is a huge factor in these things.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Maybe a squirrel landed on it and then jumped off and it like propelled it off and he saw the squirrel traveling in the arc.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, Arkham raises that, did you? That's too complicated.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then saw the Arkham's razor.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I am a chief philosophical mastermind.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you just strip away all the complexity, it's a ghost.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I mean, there are incidents in like, there's one like South America where like a literal entire village claims to have witnessed some like extremely strange like solar phenomenon.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But it's just like, what's more likely?

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
God stole the sun for a minute just from this one location?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Or that like there was some sort of mass, I don't know, maybe it was a fucking mass.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or what's more simpler than that?

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A.K. less words and it was a ghost.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's how we Arkham's razor, it just was a ghost.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, so there's more, so there's more.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So, you know, obviously nobody cared about this, but then naturally this was irrelevant to everything.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But then a couple days, maybe two weeks later, my other housemate, he is a little tipsy or whatever and he hears a bottle cap fall off of a countertop and he looks at the ground.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And he screams as loud as fucking hell.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There's no way that the bottle cap could have fallen that far across the floor just from falling off.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There's just no way.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The counter is a lot of substances involved in these stories.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It went like halfway across the floor, you guys.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's like almost halfway across the entire kitchen.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wow.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So, you know, and he didn't even touch it.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Has anyone put a level on the floor of this house yet to see if it's like leaning?

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Maybe, not a bad idea.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or maybe it's a circle and it rolled.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So the point is, so this convinced, let me call these, I don't know, these are, whatever, so these are the ghost bros who are both now convinced.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And then, you know, and then we got me and we got Big John and Little John.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And Little John is like, guys, we should have a seance.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We got to invite people over.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We got to buy a Hasbro brand Ouija board.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And we got to have a seance.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Got to do it.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So that's what we did, you know.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And basically, so the ghost, yeah, it kind of was.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So the ghost boys are totally, totally believing, convinced that there is a presence, there is a spirit, you know.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the rest of us are just sitting around, just like, you know, intently, intently pretending like this isn't the dumbest thing we've ever seen.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So, yeah.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So, okay, so we started the seance.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We asked the ghost, first question, one of the ghost bros is sitting there.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Two people have their hands on the Ouija board planchette.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
One of the ghost bros is one of them.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The other one's this girl who's a friend of the house.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And this guy asks, he's like, first, he's like, is there a presence here?

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And the planchette moves immediately to no.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The ghost is immediately denying his involvement in any of this stuff.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So the ghost answered in the negative to his own presence.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, there was more.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He asked it, he asked it, at one point he asked it, are you fucking with us?

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
At which point it moves somewhat towards yes.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then he asked it, do you like to have fun?

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And it moves strongly towards yes.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Whatever, whatever.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh man, then our downstairs neighbors heard about this and like one of the answers it gave at one point had an eye in it.

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And she was like, oh my god, my dad died this last year.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And his name was Irving, I for Irving, I think it was his ghost.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is legitimately worse than hearing about a dream.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I literally went outside and threw myself off of the balcony that the ghost removed the original doorknob on.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then your ghost came back and completed the seance for me.

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, I answered, they asked, you know, how can we help you move on to the next world?

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I answered with a B for Ben and that was proof.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So that's, I'm sorry, was that a boring story?

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, that was fascinating.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm fascinated with the story.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're poking a lot of fun right now, but can you prove that there wasn't a ghost in your house?

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I cannot.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well then there you fucking go.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There you go.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then shut the hell up and pack it on out of here.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I will.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Anyway, I'm cranky.

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm cranky and I don't like ghosts.

168
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I ain't afraid of them.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I don't know why I stayed up.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And from generations from now, apography will be misquoted to all of you.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But famously, I have spoken in many letters that the government is scarier than ghosts.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
As I said once in a procrastinators podcast very recently.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And so I don't believe in ghosts, but I do believe in the government, which is way worse.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So it's possible that the NSA in fact planted, you know, an assassination attempt on your friend

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and their method of choice was to fling a doorknob at his head as fast as they could.

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Not even at his head.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Maybe like towards his knees kind of.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Listen, okay, I'm going to guess that if your guy believes in ghosts,

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
they probably wouldn't go to the doctors because they would probably be, you know,

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
some sort of like demon incubi that would rape him in his sleep.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So I'm assuming if his knee was scraped and blood were to come out,

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it would probably get a staff infection and he would die.

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So the NSA might have better intel on your friend than you do, Ben.

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Maybe you're just a fucking idiot. How about that?

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I live in a house.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I live in a house with a weird spread, a weird melange of like people from different places on the ideological spectrum.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And there is a certain segment of my house that is like weirdly, apolitically,

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
like what's it like, neoconservative with like a weirdly spiritual bent.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I think it's the worst.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's like dubstep country mashups.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, these are, we're talking about guys who voted for Trump

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
just to shake up the establishment and who like regularly talk about going to church

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and how much they like going to church, but who don't actually go to church.

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know I'm just the kind of person we're dealing with.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I know I'm about to preach to the choir and say a bunch of shit that's obvious,

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
but what blows my mind whenever this is the subject of ghosts

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
is that like you can have people who like by and large don't believe in any weird shit

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
or superstition or ghosts, but like the second they can't explain something,

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
it's immediately ghosts.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, so little John, who was the one putting on the seance,

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
he was telling me that like he would mention the seance to people

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
because he wanted to invite more people over for it.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And he would get split reactions, like some people would think it was really funny

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and others people would be like, oh no, don't do that.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's a bad idea.

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Like people would react negatively to it.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Like it's bad because like, oh no, don't mess with the ghost, dude.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think, yeah.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay, yeah.

210
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The thing about...

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Not even, like I could almost understand if you were like,

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
don't mess with your dumb friends like that.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's really mean.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But I don't care about that.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean, sure.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The thing about jumping to ghosts...

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Of course I'm going to do it anyway.

220
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
...that gets to me is that like ghosts are like made up by people.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's like you could have...

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There's some biblical references to them,

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
so maybe people are working from that partially.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If I see something like weird and inexplicable...

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If I see...

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There's like risen dead or something, but okay.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If I see some weird inexplicable shit and I can't explain it,

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
like why jump immediately to made up shit instead of just like,

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
oh, there's probably like a rational thing that I just don't understand

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
or did not observe enough.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like...

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There's an answer for that.

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you aware?

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I forget.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's like a name for it I think,

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but there's a phenomenon that's just like,

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
after the events of like,

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I forget what it is,

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
but there was like some alien conspiracy

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
where specifically like the gray alien...

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Roswell?

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Like Visage became...

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Maybe it was Roswell,

246
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
but there was like something where in popular culture,

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the gray alien depiction became like the zeitgeist,

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
what people thought aliens looked like.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like before that, there had been some alien reports that they'd been kidnapped,

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but after that like fake thing happened,

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
it maybe was like whatever that...

252
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Those encounters of the third kind movie?

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, it might have been that.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It might have been that.

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And after that,

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
like all the very different types of reports about alien abduction,

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
all very coincidentally settled in on the like gray alien depiction

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to describe like what their alien kidnappers looked like.

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Because it's a way for you to fill in the blanks.

260
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's like you see a...

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah.

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But kind of like with UFO sightings,

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
it's like there's so many things that look like a floating black disc

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
that you could see,

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
that as soon as you mentally associate it with one thing,

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that's what you're gonna see.

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I think that's what you're trying to say.

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
These people, they just need to watch some Vsauce

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and understand the basics of the human mind

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and how it's fallible and learn all the funny things about illusions.

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It can't be true.

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
All your problems.

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
YouTube, videos, UFO.

274
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm so fucking upset with all of you right now, Nate.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're being so ridiculous right now.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So all these people from different walks of life,

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
all just coincidentally are talking about the exact same type of aliens

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and driving the exact same way.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
All these different people at different points, intervals of time.

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's so just a complicated, you know, conspiracy theory, Nate.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The simplest Occam's razor way is just say it's real.

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's just real and they're all describing the same thing.

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're right.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're an idiot.

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You haven't even been to poll.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Occam's razor, man.

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're right.

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Jesus Christ.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Come on.

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Like as we define Occam's razor to mean the thing that takes the fewest words

291
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
to explain.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah.

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, we could also, let's just Occam's razor it to gestalt psychology then.

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Eh?

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, but no one knows what those words mean.

297
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How many, how few, how few letters can we possibly use?

298
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, oh, no, no, no.

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay, guys.

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, yeah, I've got it.

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Real.

303
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
R-E-L.

304
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Real.

305
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's real.

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah.

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There you go.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Wait.

310
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Fake also has four letters though.

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a coin toss.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It comes down to a coin toss.

313
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's always split.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Everything boils down to a coin toss between fake and real.

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Ben, how many people do you, do you live at your house?

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Because it just seems like there's just a clown car just constantly revolving door

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of just like 20 or so people who are all insane.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay.

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Not counting my downstairs neighbors because we live in like a split condo.

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Hold on.

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I want to say six.

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Uh-huh.

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Whoa.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Six?

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you do three of those, that's the mark of the beast.

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Real.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Big John, Lil John, the ghost bros, the other, the anime recluse.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Nice.

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who's Indian name is Clips Through Walls and me.

330
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Sick.

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I think the six.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think there's six.

334
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
My Indian name is Hacks the Mainframe.

335
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hacks the Mainframe.

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah.

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Can you imagine each of them up to a My Little Pony character?

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Ooh.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Cool.

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't really know who they are.

341
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We have no way of knowing if their comparisons are accurate.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's not do that.

344
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay.

345
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, no.

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We got, we got.

347
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They're all Queen Chrysalis.

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They're just all.

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah.

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Who's the spike of the group?

352
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There's Serendipity.

353
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's a band, of course.

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's definitely a band.

355
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

356
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

357
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

359
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
All right.

360
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There's Serendipity, Chastity, Grace, Serenity, Firefly.

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Action Adventure RPG video game.

363
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There's a pony called Chastity.

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
God, I hope so.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The biggest slut of the bunch.

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So I can fuck her.

368
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You know what I'm saying?

369
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What's it like living with your old roommates after living not with them for so long?

370
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know.

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's good.

372
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I like it.

373
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Why are we interviewing Ben?

374
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is terrible.

375
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay.

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Hey, hey, hippo.

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How's your life going?

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Huh?

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh yeah.

380
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
How's your life?

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What have you done today?

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh yeah.

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's real great, dude.

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's real fucking nice.

385
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh wow, hippo.

386
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm so impressed.

387
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, wait.

388
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Speaking of which, happy birthday, Munchie.

389
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

390
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Happy recent birthday.

391
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh my god.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're a fucking adult, aren't you?

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He's 18 at last.

394
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It was yesterday, right?

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It was the 14th.

397
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Now we can release all those unreleased videos from Radcon 3.

398
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Now they've become retroactively legal.

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You better head over to that link, the Gumroad link below.

400
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Get the backseat pass if you know what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen.

401
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Heyo.

402
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Now I'll be the second PCB member to have their dick shown on camera.

403
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Who was the first?

404
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You.

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You.

406
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
My dick's never been on camera.

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
All right.

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you talking about?

409
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No one's ever seen my dick.

410
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No one ever.

411
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know if you want to get into it.

412
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Wait, do people think my dick is out there on camera?

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think it was.

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Of course not.

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like a brief flash, because you had holes in your undergarments.

416
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, you mean the PCB.

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There was that thing.

418
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ah, yes.

419
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I forgot about that.

420
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You didn't see my whole dick, though, right?

421
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No.

422
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean, I suppose not.

423
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Not the whole.

424
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You gotta leave a little, you gotta leave a little mist.

425
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Like my foreskin.

426
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Cut this off.

427
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Cut it off.

428
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's right.

429
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Destroy this whole piece.

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Why?

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Why?

432
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, I don't know.

433
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If you don't care, I don't care.

434
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
All right, let's get this phone straight.

435
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why would I care?

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's not even, it's not available.

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Nobody could find it.

438
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I mean, I assume somebody downloaded it.

439
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You know.

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And enlarged it and enhanced it.

441
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It was with your podcasting skills.

442
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
All right, my podcasting skills.

443
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Hey, guys.

444
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Welcome to another Let's Play.

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm gonna play Minecraft today.

446
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Have you been sick recently or at school and not been able to release a video?

447
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

448
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you sorry that your voice sounds a little weird because you have a culture?

449
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry, guys.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Save me if you would will.

451
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Guys, listen.

452
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
When did you first realize that you had wasted your life?

453
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
At what point did you realize this?

454
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Today.

455
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Just now, actually, listening to you ask me that question.

456
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know, I realized I was wasting my life.

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It was in college after my girlfriend broke up with me and before I went to Japan.

458
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And then I fixed it and it was pretty good.

459
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Actually, there was actually a second round.

460
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was after I got back from that and I was before I started doing any YouTube stuff when

461
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I was just going through my shitty school and stuff.

462
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That sucked.

463
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But then it got better.

464
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So that's cool.

465
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hey, have you guys heard of this Hispanic comedian?

466
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Guzzlin Dispera?

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Guzzlin Dispera?

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
No.

469
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Have you heard of this Hispanic comedian called Munchie Shatsky?

470
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How about Guzzlin Disparity's nuts, bitches?

471
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Wait.

472
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah!

473
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Say that name again?

474
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Guzzlin?

475
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Say it?

476
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Guzzlin Dispera?

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Is that it?

478
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's right, that's right.

479
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay, so I'm Guzzling This Pair of Nuts is what I'm...

480
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's correct.

481
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, that's what you are doing.

482
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Pretty good.

483
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I like this new meme of names that make people retarded.

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Those are good.

485
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I like this new meme of the past time when it's all this desperately trying to cover

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
up with something to say and then two people talking about it nervously chuckling at one

487
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
other.

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Other people are just fucking panicking right now.

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Just sweating.

490
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Just sweat.

491
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Like bill bullets off their fucking forehead.

492
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Okay, okay.

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's okay.

494
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They're filling up time.

495
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay.

496
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh, fucking thank, thank, thank.

497
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
All right.

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That comes courtesy of Big John, who by the way, Big John and Little John are comparably

499
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
sized with one another.

500
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay.

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I just want to put that out there.

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is it a question of personality who fills the room with their charisma?

503
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's more like Big John is older and was here first.

504
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Pokemon Go.

505
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Here we go.

506
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Pokemon Go topic.

507
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, let's do it.

508
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I have a thing to say.

509
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Pokemon Go podcast.

510
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
PGP, everybody.

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Because this is the only thing that I'm constantly doing that isn't just, hey guys, I'm working.

512
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's like Pokemon Go.

513
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
There was a new update where they have allowed for a short period of time, you can send gifts

514
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
to friends and stuff.

515
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And sometimes you get like a special, a lowland egg that takes like seven kilometers to open.

516
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And recently they updated it for like a Gen 1 special event where they try to get everybody

517
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to complete their Gen 1 Pokedex by releasing all the Pokemon, all the legendaries are in

518
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
raids, and all the Gen 1 Pokemon are all over the place.

519
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But the thing they did that made me really mad and rarer, I'm going to fight, I'm going

520
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
to kill, is that they made the Gen 1 region exclusives available in these eggs so that

521
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
people don't have to go around the world to catch them anymore.

522
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They can just wait for them to be...

523
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I heard about this on a video by some YouTuber called Gibbentake?

524
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No.

525
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No, you didn't.

526
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
This is the first and only place you'll hear about this exclusive news dropped like months

527
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
after it stopped being relevant.

528
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But like, it just got me thinking about like how video games are like people feel entitled.

529
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Because I had a lot of people in that comment section of that video by Gibbentake where I

530
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
didn't know.

531
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That you didn't make.

532
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That I didn't make.

533
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And they were arguing about like my point that it was bad that this was happening.

534
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And they were saying, oh, but what about the people who can't travel?

535
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
What about the people who...

536
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's good.

537
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's good because now I can get the thing that I couldn't get before.

538
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Right.

539
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah, their argument basically boiled down to, but I want it.

540
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Why can't I have it?

541
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah.

542
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And it just made me so annoyed.

543
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't understand where these people, like, who exists that literally cannot travel ever.

544
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Like, if you're like, I'm 15, I can't travel.

545
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You'll be 18 in three years.

546
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You can get it then.

547
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Like, hold on a second.

548
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
To be fair, if you want to get all the region exclusive, you will have to go to, like, if

549
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
you have to go to places, you have to go to Japan.

550
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You'll have to go to Europe.

551
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah.

552
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You'll have to, let's say you live in America, so whatever, you're there.

553
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Where else?

554
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Do you have to go like South America?

555
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
South America.

556
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This should give you something to strive to, all right?

557
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes.

558
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's expensive to fly to Japan.

559
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

560
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That means you should bust your ass and get a job and work really hard and save up your

561
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
money so you can get that goddamn far-fetched.

562
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I agree.

563
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
In terms of opportunity costs, like, I would argue that, like, the time spent getting a full

564
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Pokedex other than the region exclusives is, like, way bigger.

565
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yes.

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like, it's a huge commitment.

567
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And especially now with trades, it's not even that you have to go there.

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You can just meet someone who's been there.

569
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And how great is that?

570
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You'll be able to meet someone in real life.

571
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You can't trade over online, so you'll meet someone in real life just down the street

572
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
or, you know, at your local park or something.

573
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And you'll ask, oh, where'd you get this far-fetched?

574
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, I was in Japan.

575
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I was serving in the standing Japanese army during 1943.

576
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And they're like, wow, you must have done some real nice things.

577
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And he was like, yeah, I did.

578
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And he got the far-fetched.

579
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Wait, was that like a rape of Nan King joke?

580
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yes, it did.

581
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, good.

582
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I was just checking.

583
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I say it every time about this stuff, but this 100% comes down to just different conceptions

584
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
of how the world should be.

585
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Like, if you're, like, a 15-year-old kid, like, obviously you don't have a lot of money right now

586
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and you want to complete your Pokedex, you're going to be, like, bummed out that you don't have enough money

587
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
to, like, go to Japan and get far-fetched.

588
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I mean, you're already five years late to start your Pokemon journey.

589
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

590
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But, like, so you'll want to do it.

591
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But, like, it'll be hard and it'll be, like, you'll have to find someone online.

592
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And, like, what I'd like this person to do is, like, go online, research, find people in their area

593
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
who, like, maybe have been there.

594
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And, like, kind of, I want them to rise to the occasion.

595
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But a lot of people don't want to do that.

596
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
They just want to, you know, have things lower down to make it easy for them to do it.

597
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Find someone who's got a phone from that, like, just buy phones from people

598
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
who've collected the Pokemon from those regions.

599
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
There you go.

600
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I want to know.

601
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I want to know how many of these people, like, how many of these people have a full Pokedex

602
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
aside from the region exclusive?

603
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm going to bet none.

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm going to bet, like, zero, zero percent.

605
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I've heard the argument, simply so this is a well-rounded piece of conversation here,

606
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I've heard the argument that the game has been out for so long

607
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
that all the people who would have been able to get the regionals would have got them already.

608
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Which I think is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

609
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Like, literally, even if you grow up three years and in three years,

610
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
you'll be able to potentially do it.

611
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And, I mean, not that you're limited by being 15 necessarily.

612
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But, like, even if it was literally impossible for you to ever go to Japan

613
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
or meet anyone from Japan and get that Lapras, who cares?

614
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Right.

615
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I really come back to that.

616
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Who cares?

617
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Like, guys, there's a problem.

618
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
People don't like.

619
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
People have a huge problem with the fact that the world is in fact hierarchical.

620
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
People hate that, and they think it's unfair.

621
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But, I'm sorry.

622
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's not even a matter of hierarchy to me so much as just that this is what the conceit of the game is.

623
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like, it's not that being able to travel makes you a better person,

624
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
it's just that this is what the game's purpose is.

625
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's maybe not meant for people who don't travel.

626
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Like, yeah.

627
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's almost like it's a social game that's meant for you to travel to different places

628
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to catch different types of Pokemon.

629
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's almost like that's the goal of the game.

630
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I do sympathize with people who are, like, let's say they're really poor,

631
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
but they have a smartphone with Pokemon Go somehow.

632
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay, fine.

633
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm sure that could happen in some cases.

634
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I do feel for those people, but I just care so much more about preserving, like,

635
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
the ability of people to, like, challenge themselves and, like,

636
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
accomplish things and, like, obtain greatness by working really hard

637
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and, like, getting exclusive things.

638
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I know this is a silly example of a Pokemon Go game,

639
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
but that's so much more important to me

640
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
than, like, making sure everyone gets the fucking participation trophy

641
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
of a fucking, you know, gimme Pokemon.

642
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And I just need to reiterate, because this is not, like,

643
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
like, these are all great points, but this is not an issue of you having to go to Asia anymore.

644
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You literally don't.

645
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Okay, Google search.

646
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Like, the name of your city.

647
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Pokemon Go Discord.

648
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Boom.

649
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You will have, like, 30 fucking people.

650
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You will have, like, thousands of the Pokemon that you want.

651
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Meet up with someone in real life at a nice sunny park,

652
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
actually play the game, engage with people socially,

653
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and you'll be able to get the Pokemon you want

654
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
for, like, you know, a high amount of stardust.

655
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Who cares?

656
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You don't have to spend literally any money.

657
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm sure there's people who are really frustrated by the fact that, like,

658
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
there's no online trading, so they can just, like, do it all from home.

659
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But that is not what the game is.

660
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That is not what the game is.

661
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That's not the point of the game is to say you're home.

662
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The point is to go out and walk around.

663
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm still, like, completely baffled by spoofers.

664
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Like, the idea of playing the game.

665
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Like, there was this one time when I was, like, there was a raid,

666
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and it was a five-star raid, and I was by myself, and there was no one around.

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I was like, well, let's just jump in and see what happens.

668
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm not going to win, but, you know, whatever.

669
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I jump in, and then, like, 17, like, level 40 spoofers jump in out of nowhere,

670
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and I'm like, oh, shit, I'm going to get this guy.

671
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And it turns out that these level 40 spoofers just, like, I guess they have,

672
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
like, a program that jumps into people to raids that are currently, like,

673
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
have people in them to leech off of the, you know, the battle,

674
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
because none of them were actually doing anything.

675
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They were just sitting there, hoping that, you know, whatever group had started

676
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
the raid would complete it, and then they would catch the Pokemon.

677
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What in the fuck is a spoofer?

678
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It is a person who plays Pokemon Go indoors, like, with a program

679
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
that allows them to cheat and go anywhere.

680
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah.

681
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And it's like, the whole idea of Pokemon Go, like, if you strip away the walking

682
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
outside and, you know, the experience of being, like, catching Pokemon in real life

683
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and being an explorer and moving and walking and doing all that stuff,

684
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
it's not really that good a game that, like, you just tap the screen.

685
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Is there a monetary benefit to doing this?

686
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
No.

687
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I mean, technically...

688
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Could sell your account, possibly, maybe?

689
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I guess people might do that.

690
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because it makes me think about how, like, in World of Warcraft,

691
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
like, a lot of botting and shit like that just...

692
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, for the sake of selling accounts.

693
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay, okay.

694
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Niantic has specifically, like, engineered their trading system

695
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
in a...

696
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In trying to make it so that, like, World of Warcraft's steam markets can't exist,

697
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
which I think personally as a Team Fortress 2 trader is fucking gay as hell

698
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and it's literally the funnest thing about any video game ever

699
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
is spending real-life money to buy, like, ones and zeros

700
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that make your character look cooler.

701
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think that's literally the funnest part of Team Fortress 2,

702
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
so I'm fucking upset that there is no underground market for, like...

703
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, I mean, sure, but those markets are, like, super illegal and unregulated and, like...

704
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, it's great! It's fucking cool!

705
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I mean, it's all, like, untaxed purchases going back and forth, so...

706
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah, okay.

707
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean, I don't think the gambling side of things there has been much discussion about.

708
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Like, I'm sure that the reason those companies don't want this to happen

709
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
is because they don't want the government to start telling them they have to do something to regulate it.

710
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You know?

711
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Of course, of course.

712
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Um, and so they're just like, fuck it, we'll make it so they can't.

713
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, well, you know...

714
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So, since Hippo brought up the video game I don't give a shit about and know nothing about,

715
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm gonna talk about, just to you, Nate,

716
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I started playing Final Fantasy IX and...

717
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, great! Fantastic.

718
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I started playing Final Fantasy VI, so fuck you!

719
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm in this conversation too now!

720
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And...

721
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And I ruined it...

722
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I ruined it for myself immediately with fucking Tetra Master.

723
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh!

724
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah, that'll, uh...

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
If I remember correctly, I think Tetra Master was my favorite card game, though it might be the one from 8.

726
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I remember, I played the one from 8 a lot more, but I never actually beat 9, so...

727
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

728
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think the games, like, regularly had card games in them.

729
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
They do?

730
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I tried them when I played these when I was a teenager.

731
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Tetra Master...

732
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I guess they don't know anything past, like, 11, so...

733
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Tetra Master's a fucking nightmare.

734
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And...

735
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah.

736
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It was like...

737
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Hell yeah!

738
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So, here's what happened to me.

739
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So, for anyone who doesn't know what this is...

740
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Triple Pride, that's the one for me.

741
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
In Final Fantasy IX, there is this card game that you can play with, like, half of the fucking NPCs in the game.

742
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Like, you just walk up to them and press X, and you'll just start up this very bizarre, um, like...

743
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I guess...

744
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Do-da-do-da-do-da-do-da-do-da-do.

745
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh wait, that's the 8 one.

746
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I guess how we describe it is, like, go.

747
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Like, the Japanese game go, but with cards.

748
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Kind of.

749
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Right, right.

750
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And the thing is, the game deliberately doesn't tell you any of the fucking rules of the game.

751
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
No, it doesn't.

752
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Not a one.

753
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It purposefully keeps it obscure, and at first I thought that was kind of neat, and I was like,

754
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
oh, I'll learn the game through playing it.

755
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I mean, while getting all your fucking cards taken by the enemy.

756
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, so the way this game works is that if you lose, the enemy takes one of your cards, and if you win, you take one of their cards.

757
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But so, if you're just trying to figure out the fucking rules of the game, and almost everyone is stronger than you,

758
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
then you can literally lose enough cards that you can never play the game again.

759
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like, if you have...

760
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You can get cards later, but I mean, yeah, you can fuck yourself up real bad.

761
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So, I didn't really start engaging with the game until I got the Lindblum,

762
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and by that point, the enemies were all too strong, and I didn't understand the game,

763
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
so I was just like, man, I feel like I should have collected a shitload of cards at the start of the game

764
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and just hoarded them so that I could have a buffer of stuff I could lose.

765
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So I started the game over, and in the beginning part where you're playing as Vivi,

766
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I got my five cards, and I just started challenging this one dude over and over again,

767
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and just like, just raking him for...

768
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I had like 30 slimes, and all I would use is slimes in every battle.

769
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I was doing this like an hour and a fucking half.

770
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Flans, I mean.

771
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And so, I'm trying to take this guy's whole deck, which I don't think you can actually do,

772
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm not sure, but I'm just taking this guy's cards for a long time,

773
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and finally, I start challenging other people and immediately getting my ass kicked,

774
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and I'm just like, what is this game?

775
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So I finally just, I'm like, I'm gonna look up the fucking rules, I'm just gonna read them,

776
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and then I read all the rules and I'm like, oh, it's a nightmare.

777
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's like, not only is the game extremely complicated,

778
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
but like, there's like cards that there's only one of in the game.

779
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh yeah, absolutely.

780
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And if you get that card, you're gonna have to use it eventually to get other cards that there's only one of,

781
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and if you were to lose that card in a match, you have to then win it back in the next match,

782
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
or else it will just be gone forever.

783
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's right, that's correct.

784
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And you will never complete your card deck.

785
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Completing the card deck is considered like the most, like, difficult task.

786
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's prestigious.

787
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah, it's prestigious for sure.

788
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So when I found all that out...

789
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I mean, if you basically imagine, just imagine playing Final Fantasy IX,

790
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
not even like, to save the world, or do any of the stuff, it's just,

791
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
you're in there to become Setokaiba and have all the blue-eyed white dragons

792
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and destroy the purple one.

793
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That's one of the things I love about the Final Fantasy games,

794
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
is the PS1 one.

795
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well, the thing about, it's really frustrating, because in Final Fantasy,

796
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
they always put in something that like, there's like a challenge that would be fun,

797
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
except that there's that one thing that's so fucking impossible, that like,

798
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
you're just like, there's no way it would remain fun.

799
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like, as soon as I read the full rules and like, what to expect,

800
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I was like, this will obviously stop being fun at some point,

801
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
so I should just stop now before I get disappointed.

802
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I mean, that's fair.

803
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So there is a tournament I think you have to compete in at some point in the game.

804
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Do you have to compete in it? I think you do.

805
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
In Final Fantasy X, for example, there's like, if you go back to certain towns,

806
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you have to fight like, insanely powerful versions of the Aeons,

807
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and like, the only way you're gonna have a chance is if you have the ultimate weapons for your characters.

808
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But to get one of the ultimate weapons involves dodging 100 consecutive lightning bolt strikes

809
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
in this one place, and predicting them and dodging them is not impossible,

810
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
because the controls are not built for this, so like,

811
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and you have to do it 100 times in a row.

812
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, I did it.

813
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I did it.

814
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You actually did that?

815
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Of course I fucking did it.

816
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
How long did it take you?

817
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I mean, the time I did it was like, when it first came out when I first played the game.

818
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I mean, it took me hours. It took me a couple hours to get it done, I think.

819
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Just a couple hours? I spent a couple hours trying to dodge 10 in a row.

820
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Damn. I mean, it gives you some warning with like, the rumble of the thunder or something.

821
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm sure dodging 100 lightning bolt sounds really hard to some people,

822
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
but we live in a post undertale world.

823
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I spent six hours beating Sans. There's nothing that I can't do.

824
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
As a white male in America who beats Sans, there's literally nothing society can stop you from doing.

825
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Did you also beat the jump rope minigame with Vivi in 9?

826
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, there's progressive difficulties. I don't think I ever beat the topmost one.

827
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I beat like the 50 instead of like 200 or whatever the top one is,

828
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
but yeah, that one was pretty tough too.

829
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That one I just got fed up with, because like, the reward I looked up and it like, wasn't that great,

830
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
so I didn't worry about it that much.

831
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
All the rewards are cards.

832
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Cards. Yeah. Okay. There you go. There you go.

833
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It was fun though. I mean, I love that Final Fantasy puts in that kind of stuff,

834
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and you have the freedom to fucking do it or not.

835
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I mean, that's some reason why I love those games so much.

836
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I just wish they made it, I really wish they made it more.

837
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Like, with the Tentrum Master, it's fine, because it's like, it's whole other own world,

838
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,000
but I also wish, because it is actually fun, that like, there was a version of it that wasn't a huge pain in the ass.

839
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I hear that's what Gwent is for Witcher 3 people. Yeah, they just love playing that game so much.

840
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But I would say that Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII, I have to say, is the best.

841
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Like, it's fairly simple, and it's the best of any of the Final Fantasy mini-games,

842
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
which is why, incidentally, just unrelatedly, I'm real sad that Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X and XII

843
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
are all being ported to Switch, but notably VIII is just being ignored and skipped.

844
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
What?

845
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah, they're skipping VIII, they're just skipping VIII.

846
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Also, it's coming to like, Xbox and Polypies 4 and something.

847
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I never understood, I never really understood. People shit on VIII.

848
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
They sure do.

849
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like, it's like a, I don't know, would you say it's like a Dark Horse in that like, era?

850
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's the most oppressed race in all of gaming, Final Fantasy VIII fans.

851
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Somehow, I feel like it's even less popular than X.

852
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
X is awesome.

853
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
X is beloved, X is beloved.

854
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Is it? I don't know.

855
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I played it recently and I literally plotted out an entire book.

856
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I wanted to write about it.

857
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's how excited I was about X.

858
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What? Why?

859
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Hey, did I ever tell you?

860
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I didn't like X as much.

861
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think age is superior to X for me, but whatever.

862
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
This reminds me.

863
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I liked it more than XII.

864
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There, I said it.

865
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Oh, alright, fine, fine.

866
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The first brain-embigging panel I ever went to at an anime convention was something called like,

867
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Final Fantasy X and like, Tidus in the role of Ubermensch, or like something like that.

868
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It was just about how Tidus is like, yeah, it was pretty dope.

869
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It was very brain-long.

870
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I will say my analysis does not incorporate such elements.

871
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I don't.

872
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay, alright.

873
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Such elements.

874
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Tidus being the, ah!

875
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So yesterday, I went out, ah!

876
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yesterday, that scene is, that scene makes sense in the game by the way.

877
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.

878
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
People name that scene so ridiculously hard.

879
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Like deliberately misunderstood.

880
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Jason Arnold, or whatever his name, James Arnold Taylor, the voice actor.

881
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
He himself on his own YouTube channel.

882
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

883
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Like, a decade later, no, whatever, James Arnold Taylor.

884
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
He made a video, like, just clarifying, like, in extensive detail.

885
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And he pulls out the script he was given from Square when he recorded the game.

886
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And it shows an explicit detail, like, all the reasons why he was intended to be forced.

887
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You should be able to tell that immediately by watching the scene.

888
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I know.

889
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
People don't, people don't actually know what they're looking at.

890
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's Spoonie's fault.

891
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Spoonie made fun of it.

892
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It is Spoonie's fault.

893
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It is Spoonie's fault.

894
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He fucking didn't get it because he didn't like the game and he's returning.

895
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because, I mean, that's, that's Spoonie being very nostalgia critic by just misunderstanding

896
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
what that, like, scene is actually.

897
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Well, you know, Spoonie, you know, Spoonie's dead and nostalgia critic is disgraced.

899
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It looks like those hacks got what was coming to him, just like we all will one day.

900
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah, it's true.

901
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's coming.

902
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
First they came for nostalgia critic and I said nothing.

903
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I said nothing.

904
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Then they came for Spoonie and I enjoyed it and laughed.

905
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So yesterday I thought, hey, this is just getting better and better.

906
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yesterday at long last.

907
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I can't wait for the next one.

908
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
God damn it, Ben!

909
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Why are you laughing so hard at this?

910
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yesterday I went out to the local game stores, the local big used game stores finally, which

911
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
are amazing out here in Boston land.

912
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, cool.

913
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I went in search of Melee.

914
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You can't find Melee anywhere.

915
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'll give you Melee for price.

916
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Fucking Mewtwo King bought every copy in the world.

917
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
He's hoarding them right now.

918
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Just like Saddlekai, but he's got all the blue eyes, white dragons.

919
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
What I did, however, impulse purchase was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

920
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And then six hours later found out that they literally that day announced a port to the

921
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Switch.

922
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Dude, online play for Crystal Chronicles.

923
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Come to the fucking Switch or whatever.

924
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Does it have couch multiplayer?

925
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Does it have what?

926
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Does it have couch multiplayer?

927
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You know, I don't know.

928
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Probably, but I mean, the Switch is built for couch multiplayer, but I didn't check.

929
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And I'm very glad that I did not do what I almost did and buy several Game Boy Advance

930
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
SP link cables because I didn't think I had enough Game Boys.

931
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Because for those who don't know, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles has the worst local multiplayer

932
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
of all time.

933
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Right.

934
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Where it requires everyone to have a link cable for their GBA to the GameCube so that

935
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
you can have a map screen on the GBA screen.

936
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And one of the players has to carry the crystal chalice at all times.

937
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So.

938
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Right.

939
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That's right.

940
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Like basically you have to fight within this little circle that is surrounding this chalice

941
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and one of the players just has to carry the fucking chalice and that's all you get to

942
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
do.

943
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But like you can have four players play this game, but one of them is always stuck with

944
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
the chalice.

945
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
By the way, I'm just looking it up.

946
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Local multiplayer has not been confirmed, but online has.

947
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But here's the hilarious, I was looking this up and I found out that you can play the game

948
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,500
with GameCube controllers as long as you have the Game Boy Advance link cable plugged in when

949
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,500
it loads the level, and then you can swap it out for a GameCube controller and play

950
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,500
it perfectly fine.

951
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,500
So what you're telling me is they really just were doing this to push system sales of GBAs

952
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
or something.

953
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Yeah.

954
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
I mean big time is for the link cable.

955
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,500
This is also why Four Swords Adventures happened.

956
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,620
These are like around the same time and then they horribly bombed and so they did not

957
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,620
do this again.

958
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,380
Digi, you know what we should do is you and me should do a playthrough of Kirby's Amazing

959
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,140
Mirror is what we should do next time.

960
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,140
I want to play that.

961
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,900
That's my literal favorite Kirby game.

962
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
That is the best one.

963
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,900
What do you mean by that?

964
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
That's four players.

965
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
It's four players, right?

966
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,900
Yeah.

967
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
It's four players multiple GBAs.

968
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Oh, I did not know that.

969
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
Yeah.

970
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,900
That's sick.

971
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,900
Yeah.

972
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,900
That's a really good one.

973
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I mean I guess if we all meet up in a place and we all have GBAs and link cables, that

974
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,900
can happen.

975
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,900
When are we going to do another Radcom?

976
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,900
Never.

977
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,900
It's banned.

978
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,700
When are we going to do another games?

979
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,740
I want to play video games with my band games.

980
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,700
We should do a Shekels for Hekels and one for Crystal Chronicles when it comes out.

981
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
It's a fun one.

982
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
It's a game I've never played.

983
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,780
There's like sequel Crystal Chronicles games, but I've never played the original one.

984
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,780
Good.

985
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,260
I've got, well, because I've played, I mean, I bought it again.

986
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,700
I had it when I was younger.

987
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,420
It doesn't play anything like any Final Fantasy game.

988
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:23,060
It's just an action RPG with like, the level, it kind of just puts you on a level that's

989
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,340
like 20 minutes long and usually you just got to solve a couple puzzles and fight a

990
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,700
bunch of enemies and get to the end and it's just a pleasant little happy time, but it's

991
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,140
got really cool character designs and great music, great art design.

992
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,220
But what about the Chalice?

993
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,220
I thought the Chalice just was terrible.

994
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,740
Well, if you're playing on single player, then you've just got a Mugle that carries

995
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,180
it around for you.

996
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,780
So it's not even a big deal on single player mode.

997
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,420
On multiplayer, it's just a bad game.

998
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,980
Okay, cool.

999
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,860
But on single player, it's perfectly fine.

1000
00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:01,740
And then I also bought a Fantasy Star Online, which is the greatest game of all time, Word.

1001
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,740
Word.

1002
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,740
There's a lot of videos going around right now.

1003
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,740
It's like arrows flying over your head in the Indian and Joe's ride Disneyland.

1004
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,740
It's just like constantly...

1005
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:16,900
When is my stupid switch owning roommate going to stop being a coward and buy Splatoon

1006
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,900
2?

1007
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,140
You could buy it.

1008
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,140
Yeah, yeah.

1009
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,780
I could.

1010
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:30,700
He's got Zelda, he's got Mario Odyssey, but he doesn't have Splatoon 2.

1011
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,980
Blown the fuck out by Joseph Anderson, no thanks.

1012
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:38,860
Ben, you know you could just come over here and play it because Tom has a switch.

1013
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,860
And that's true.

1014
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:45,260
I'm fairly sure he has Splatoon 2 because he really loves Splatoon.

1015
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,620
Maybe I'll do that.

1016
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,420
Maybe I'll come over there and be Splatoon 2.

1017
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,420
Yeah, it's a good idea.

1018
00:46:52,340 --> 00:47:00,860
I recently started playing Metal Gear Solid 1 with my friends and it was totally like

1019
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,820
the eye-clap from when I saw it, experience, and willingly and happily, whenever we saw

1020
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,220
any sound effect or character, we just went like, I love Solid Snake!

1021
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,220
Yeah.

1022
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:17,380
That's the peak experience.

1023
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,140
And then when we heard the brand, we just like jumped up from our seats and just clapped,

1024
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,700
it's hard as we fucking could, like every single thing that we could, we did.

1025
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:32,660
My friend's mom can testify, we were fucking tearing up the house to see Metal Gear happen.

1026
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,980
Every time a new asset appeared on screen.

1027
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,300
What happened when you saw my Japanese enemies?

1028
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:46,220
Oh, okay, like me and my friend, Leif, we basically know what was up with Metal Gear

1029
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,340
2 to an extent.

1030
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,940
My friend Kyle and the Tories Furry, and I've called that many times on the show, bitch,

1031
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,940
did not know.

1032
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,580
So the entire time, me and Leif were building this the fuck up saying like, Kyle, Kyle,

1033
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,940
it's you, you're gonna be on screen soon, it's gonna be you, then I'm gonna start pissing

1034
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,740
his pants, and then we jumped up and we started making fun, like Kyle, this is you, you're

1035
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
a bitch!

1036
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,740
Fuck you!

1037
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,740
And it was great.

1038
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,740
It was, you know, something like...

1039
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,740
It was great time.

1040
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,740
Fairly owned.

1041
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,340
Yeah, we just beat the tank guy, it was a horrible experience.

1042
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
Vulcan Raven.

1043
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,740
The game is scary and awful, and makes up, like, it's like, like, migraines, but visually...

1044
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,740
Have you gotten to the part where you have to machine gun down dogs yet?

1045
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:30,340
No, oh, we started to play the first Metal Gear game, and that was a fucking, that was

1046
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,340
a trip.

1047
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,340
That was a, that was...

1048
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,340
Oh, the NES one.

1049
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah, I didn't use to emphasize with, you know, prisoners of war and Poland being reduced

1050
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,860
to gulags and forced labor, but now I do have to play one video game, and I understand

1051
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,860
what it was like for them.

1052
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,860
It was a great time.

1053
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:51,500
And too bad the PS3 we were playing on is gone forever, because Kyle moved away, and everyone's

1054
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,420
moving away, and this is the part of my life that's in movies, and it's happening right

1055
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,420
now.

1056
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,420
Oh, they're going to college now, huh?

1057
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,420
Yeah, all my friends are gone.

1058
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,420
It's like that.

1059
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,420
It'll happen again.

1060
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,540
This'll happen again when you start to get, like, 50 or 60, only this time they're all

1061
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,540
moving to hell.

1062
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,780
Munchy, it's literally your favorite Green Day song.

1063
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,780
The one that's...

1064
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,380
Oh, dude, I want to let you know that literally that night was the last time I saw Kyle, and

1065
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:23,460
for the entire car ride home, we fucking blasted good riddance as loud as we could and screamed

1066
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,460
the lyrics.

1067
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,460
The lyrics which are as follows.

1068
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,460
Tell me why'd you have to go make things so complicated?

1069
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,460
See the way, act like somebody else gets me frustrated.

1070
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,460
I love that song.

1071
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,300
I love the gorillas.

1072
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,300
It's crazy.

1073
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Everyone's leaving.

1074
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,300
I thought it was a joke that people said, like, oh, your friends are going to leave,

1075
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:51,140
and I was like, psh, nah, and then there they are.

1076
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:57,140
They're all going to go off to become boarders managers.

1077
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,180
You got to do what I do, Munchy.

1078
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,460
Establish an organization that entraps the people that you want to keep nearby with monetary

1079
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
incentives.

1080
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Yeah, financially.

1081
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
That's the way to do it.

1082
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
Yeah.

1083
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,460
You got to bait the hook.

1084
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,460
You got to bait the hook.

1085
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,460
Keep them around.

1086
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Otherwise, they'll be.

1087
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,460
Otherwise, what do you want to be lonely?

1088
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,460
What do you want to be abandoned?

1089
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,460
Yeah.

1090
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,460
Exactly.

1091
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,460
Watch the fuck out.

1092
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,460
It's this or nothing.

1093
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,460
I've got a topic that was kind of brought up.

1094
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,460
No, you don't.

1095
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,460
I do.

1096
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,460
It was brought up via, well, I was reminded of it, because a couple of things.

1097
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,460
Munchy was talking about Pokemon Go, and Isabel got confirmed for Smash, which is cool.

1098
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,460
And there is a connection, and it's that she's a dog, and it's that I got a dog.

1099
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,460
I got a dog recently.

1100
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,460
What?

1101
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,460
I saw, I saw the dog.

1102
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,460
I'm keeping it under wraps.

1103
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,460
I saw it on Twitter.

1104
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,460
I have a dog.

1105
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,460
You got a dog.

1106
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
I have a dog.

1107
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,460
This is the happiest I've ever become on a PCP episode.

1108
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,460
And his name?

1109
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,460
His name is Lord Sashomaru.

1110
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
Is this full name?

1111
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
No.

1112
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,460
Come on.

1113
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,460
That's his full name.

1114
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Dude, that's crazy.

1115
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,460
Your dog is Lord Sashomaru, and my cat is Killala.

1116
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,460
Killala.

1117
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,460
I thought of that, too.

1118
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,460
I fucking can't even believe it.

1119
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,460
The Inuyasha permeates the culture.

1120
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,460
So what do you say when you're calling the dog?

1121
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,460
We call him Sessho.

1122
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Call him Sessho.

1123
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,460
Come here, Sessho.

1124
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,460
Sessho.

1125
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,460
You got to call him Sessho.

1126
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,460
That was the fan girl nickname for Sashomaru.

1127
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,460
Was that true?

1128
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Okay, good to know.

1129
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,460
Good to know.

1130
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,460
Probably mix that one in there, too.

1131
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,460
Yeah, he's a great guy.

1132
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,460
What kind of dog is he?

1133
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,460
Okay, get this.

1134
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,460
He looks like a small German Shepherd, or a German Shepherd combined with a Chihuahua.

1135
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,460
But in actuality, he is half Beagle, half Welsh Corgi.

1136
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,460
I see.

1137
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,460
It's very strange.

1138
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,460
I'm not saying he's a men pin, but no, he's just a freak.

1139
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,460
He is a freak.

1140
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,460
He's a weird genetic slurry.

1141
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,460
Indeed.

1142
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,460
That's him?

1143
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,460
Isn't it funny what we've done to dogs as a race?

1144
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
I just sit back and laugh.

1145
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,460
Just mess them right the fuck up.

1146
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,460
We got him from the SPCA or whatever, like the shelter, and he had recently, like within

1147
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,460
like a couple of weeks, gotten his balls removed, and he still has a dangling empty ball sack.

1148
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,460
It is quite horrific.

1149
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,460
It's just nightmarish to think about, really.

1150
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,460
I feel so bad for him.

1151
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,460
Why do they...

1152
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,460
Why does he just have the sack and not the balls?

1153
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,460
Well, apparently the sack like shrinks into the body or like it goes away to some degree

1154
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,460
at some point.

1155
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,460
Yeah.

1156
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,460
Erasing all traces of sexuality.

1157
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,460
Thank God.

1158
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:33,460
My dog has a literal genetic dysfunction where he has a boner 100% of the time.

1159
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
Is that true?

1160
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,460
They're told it's painful.

1161
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,460
Yeah.

1162
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,460
That sounds real.

1163
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,460
You got to help him out, dog.

1164
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,460
You got to help him out.

1165
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,460
I mean, they say you're supposed to go to the hospital after a mere four hours.

1166
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,460
Consider an entire lifetime.

1167
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,460
It really gets in the way of new dates.

1168
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,460
Yeah.

1169
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,460
By the way.

1170
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:56,460
If anyone out there wants to make fan art, I've got a picture in my mind of I am...

1171
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,460
You know Rin, the little girl who hangs out with Lord Sashomaru?

1172
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,460
That's me.

1173
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:07,460
The dog is Lord Sashomaru and Michelle is that little gremlin jack-in who hangs out

1174
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,460
and just dances and does kind of Jewish shanties around to announce Lord Sashomaru's presence.

1175
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,460
I demand that you become a basic bitch and send us cute dog photos on a regular basis.

1176
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,460
Don't do that.

1177
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,460
Do not do that.

1178
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,460
If you do that, you better make a fucking containment chat.

1179
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,460
Yeah.

1180
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,460
Why?

1181
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,460
Why?

1182
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,460
I don't want to see that shit.

1183
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,460
What's wrong with dog?

1184
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,460
Why?

1185
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,460
What's wrong with you guys?

1186
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Look, I saw one picture of the dog.

1187
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,460
I get it.

1188
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,460
I'm not kidding about this.

1189
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,460
I have seen none and I get it.

1190
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,460
And I didn't even hear it described.

1191
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,460
I got up to piss before he started describing it so I wouldn't have to hear it.

1192
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,460
I want to see dog photos.

1193
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,460
I just thought it was an interesting change in my life because actually I feel a ton of responsibility now

1194
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,460
and it's a huge burden in the good way, just something I have to worry about now.

1195
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,460
What's it like being able to try and raise a child?

1196
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,460
This is the basic training.

1197
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,460
So far, so good.

1198
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,460
So far, so good.

1199
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,460
Doesn't hate you yet?

1200
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,460
He doesn't hate me yet, but he's building up to it.

1201
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,460
I can see it in his eyes.

1202
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,460
He's building up to it.

1203
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,460
He's waiting to spring that on me at my weakest moment.

1204
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,460
But it's good.

1205
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,460
So that shows he's a good lad, but I'm waiting.

1206
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,460
How old is he?

1207
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,460
How old is he?

1208
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,460
Oh, he's just under a year.

1209
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,460
So he's a year old.

1210
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,460
So he's basically full-grown.

1211
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
He's small.

1212
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,460
Yeah, okay.

1213
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,460
I wasn't sure if he was a puppy or not.

1214
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,460
Is he for leisure or for pleasure?

1215
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:36,460
He's for farm use.

1216
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,460
He's not for pleasure.

1217
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,460
I don't know.

1218
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
Maybe you need a guard dog.

1219
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,460
I know you live in Cincinnati, which is a nightmare.

1220
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,460
That's true.

1221
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,460
He's for pleasure.

1222
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,460
He's for my pleasure.

1223
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,460
Indeed.

1224
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,460
Anyway, that's about it.

1225
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,460
I would say probably I'll post pictures on Instagram if anywhere else.

1226
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,460
So I mean, you can call me there if you care to.

1227
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,460
So there you go, people.

1228
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,460
Munchie, did you not know that I already have a dog?

1229
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,460
No.

1230
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,460
And I also post...

1231
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,460
Sunny.

1232
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,460
Wait, wait, wait.

1233
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,460
I didn't know you post images.

1234
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,460
On Instagram.

1235
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
And sometimes Twitter.

1236
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:10,460
Oh, I don't follow any of your Instagram, so they don't use Instagram.

1237
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,460
Same.

1238
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Same.

1239
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,460
It's a good place to put dogs and cats.

1240
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,460
It's where normie things go.

1241
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,460
Normie things go on Instagram.

1242
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,460
That's how I think of it.

1243
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
Hmm.

1244
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,460
I don't have any normie things.

1245
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,460
The most normie thing I did this week was have a fucking séance in my house.

1246
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,460
Yeah.

1247
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,460
Yeah.

1248
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,460
Fucking...

1249
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,460
I went for a walk.

1250
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,460
Mm-hmm.

1251
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,460
Because it was, you know, late and I forgot to spin my poker stop for the day.

1252
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
Of course.

1253
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
Gotta hit that.

1254
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,460
And I went out and it was dark.

1255
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:49,460
And Luna, my cat, decided to come with us as she sometimes does.

1256
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Walking like...

1257
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,460
It's very strange if you've ever had a cat walk with you, like go on a walk with you.

1258
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,460
We were going through the park.

1259
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,460
Cats like to go where they think you're going.

1260
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,460
So she would like wait for a bit and then gallop like as fast as she possibly could.

1261
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,460
Like at marked speed.

1262
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,460
Like 100 meters in front of us and then turn around and wait for us.

1263
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,460
So you can like take your cat out and she'll like follow you around?

1264
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,460
Yeah, it's weird.

1265
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,460
I think what she does, I think that she saw that we take the dog for a walk.

1266
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,460
And like part of her is like, I want to be included in that.

1267
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:29,460
So when she's outside and we go outside, she jumps out from the bushes and says,

1268
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,460
I'm coming with you.

1269
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,460
Mm-hmm.

1270
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,460
And it's very...

1271
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,460
That's actually amazing.

1272
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,460
I lived with a cat.

1273
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:42,460
I lived with a cat who was the opposite of that, who if the door was ever opened,

1274
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,460
she would bolt and just run.

1275
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,460
Sounds like a captive prisoner.

1276
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,460
Yeah.

1277
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,460
Oh.

1278
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,460
Yeah.

1279
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,460
No comment.

1280
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,460
How do we know that this person isn't what, you know, Peter Pettigrew was in Harry Potter.

1281
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,460
Which is a, you know, a transmogrified human attempting to seek escape.

1282
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:06,460
Listen, I tried to put a harness and a leash on this cat.

1283
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,460
It was the scariest thing that ever happened.

1284
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,460
Jesus Christ.

1285
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,460
All right.

1286
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:17,460
She went completely ballistic.

1287
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,460
Trying to get it off was a nightmare too, because she just ran into a corner traumatized

1288
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,460
by the fact that she was wearing a thing.

1289
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:33,460
I tried to walk her into the backyard and it was going okay for like two seconds.

1290
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,460
Like for two seconds there was like a solid hope like, oh, maybe she's over it.

1291
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,460
Maybe she can like walk around on this little cat harness and a little leash.

1292
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,460
Wait, wait, okay.

1293
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,460
Until I stepped on a twig, until I stepped on a twig and she went nuts and like flew up

1294
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,460
to the end of the leash and was like, bah!

1295
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,460
I was like, like spun around on the leash like a tether ball.

1296
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,460
Like a taut tether ball on a cord.

1297
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,460
Okay, I must have missed something.

1298
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,460
Were you attempting to expose your therapy on this cat by trying to get her like acclimatized

1299
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,460
to like being outside that she wouldn't run away?

1300
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,460
Yeah, I was trying.

1301
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,460
Sounds like it, right?

1302
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,460
The idea was to try and like get her used to wearing this harness so she could be taken

1303
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,460
on catwalk.

1304
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,460
Makes sense, you know, relatively.

1305
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,460
Yeah.

1306
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
Well, that was a failure.

1307
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,460
Yeah, yeah.

1308
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,460
Completely failure.

1309
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:21,460
But hey, I just wanted to say that about this Pokemon Go thing, I just love Pokemon Go

1310
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,460
because I'll go walk with Sessho and we'll just walk.

1311
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,460
It's a little bit of a longer walk, but I'm kind of glad.

1312
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,460
It gets me out and doing stuff all the way down to the Pokestop on the end of the road.

1313
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,460
And I hit that and then I walk back and it's a great time and I love doing it.

1314
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,460
And I'm happy to have an excuse to go do more things.

1315
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,460
So I'm getting over the initial anxiety of getting a new responsibility in this dog

1316
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,460
and getting way into just the benefits.

1317
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
And I'm raking them in.

1318
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,460
This dog is paying dividends.

1319
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,460
This is just such a perfect breeding grounds for fatherly attributes.

1320
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,460
You can test out the dad joke.

1321
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,460
Are you a Pokemon Sessho?

1322
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,460
Literally every single time you walk here to get the exact perfect cadence

1323
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,460
so that you can torment your kids every day of their lives.

1324
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,460
That's true.

1325
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,460
That's absolutely true.

1326
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,460
And I look forward to doing so.

1327
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,460
I can't wait for the day when Pokemon Go is an old man thing and I'm still doing it.

1328
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,460
Hey, by the way.

1329
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,460
All the kids are hip and they don't do it and they think it's gay.

1330
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,460
That'll be great.

1331
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,460
All the kids are playing Fortnite Go.

1332
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:25,460
They're all walking around with VR headsets or whatever.

1333
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,460
I'm shooting each other.

1334
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,460
This was absolutely incredible to me.

1335
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,460
So when we're actually getting Sessho, it was crazy.

1336
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,460
We go to the SPCA or whatever it's called, the dog place.

1337
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,460
And we look at all the dogs.

1338
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:43,460
And Sessho is by far the cutest and the strongest dog in the whole place.

1339
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,460
And so we're like, okay, he seems like he's got kids going places.

1340
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,460
So we get him.

1341
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,460
And then we go up to the desk and I'm like, all right, what's the damage?

1342
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,460
How much for this fucking piece of shit asshole dog?

1343
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,460
And they're just like, with that plus the color and the leash,

1344
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,460
that'll come down to, they're like bracing me forth.

1345
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,460
They're like $56.

1346
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,460
And I'm like, this is like a life we're talking about.

1347
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,460
It's only $56.

1348
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:09,460
Okay.

1349
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,460
And then they hit me with this bombshell.

1350
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,460
They're like, okay, but there's something you need to know.

1351
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,460
And I'm like, oh shit, what's it going to be?

1352
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,460
You can have this.

1353
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,460
There is a 30 day return policy.

1354
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,460
And if you are one fucking fraction of a split fucking second late,

1355
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,460
you'll be on this 30, 30 day policy.

1356
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,460
And you bring this dog back anytime.

1357
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,460
We will not take it back without paying the fee.

1358
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
And I'm like, what's the fee?

1359
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,460
$14.

1360
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,460
$14.

1361
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:38,460
I was just like, guys, relax.

1362
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:43,460
That's like, by the way, you can just leave a dog there for free.

1363
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,460
So like, why do you even have to pay anything?

1364
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,460
I don't know.

1365
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,460
You can leave a dog there for free, but you can't return a dog.

1366
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,460
I mean, it's a charity.

1367
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
Without paying $14.

1368
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,460
Just like a man and a dog outside.

1369
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,460
And like, they'll, you know, do it.

1370
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Oh, okay.

1371
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,460
So that's what I'm incentivized to do, to just drop him off, tie him to a fucking post,

1372
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:05,460
pound it into the ground, and then just skid off on my fucking sick electric skateboard.

1373
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,460
Like hog time and leave him on the doorstep.

1374
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,460
Exactly.

1375
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,460
How much time has this taken up?

1376
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,460
Stuff an apple in its mouth.

1377
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,460
Well, I mean, this was like the week where, oh, do you mean just like getting the dog or since having him?

1378
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,460
No, since having him.

1379
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,460
Like, like how much maintenance do you have on this guy?

1380
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,460
Very little, honestly.

1381
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,460
Very little.

1382
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,460
It's been, I mean, he honestly has a great attitude.

1383
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,460
So like, he has not been up in my shit.

1384
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,460
He's been like hanging with me when I was like streaming the other day.

1385
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,460
He was in the room and like didn't cause a peep.

1386
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,460
He's been real good.

1387
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,460
He's sparked like ten times.

1388
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:41,460
How fucking poor are these people like getting dogs from SPCA that they're like having to

1389
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,460
brace you for the news that it'll be $56?

1390
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,460
Not to be overly condescending, but like honestly, there was a lot of poor people there.

1391
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,460
Getting dogs.

1392
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,460
So like I could, I could, I got the impression economically.

1393
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,460
Absolutely.

1394
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,460
Yes.

1395
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,460
But like dogs make you happier.

1396
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,460
Statistically speaking, maybe not digi here.

1397
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,460
I mean, I mean, what do you think?

1398
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:03,460
What do you think it costs like on a weekly basis to maintain a dog?

1399
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,460
He doesn't really.

1400
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,460
Honestly, not a lot.

1401
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,460
I mean, all you really have to pay for is food.

1402
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,460
Dog food is all you need pretty much.

1403
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,460
And that's like, I don't know, maybe up to 40, maybe $50 a week.

1404
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,460
I mean, I have no cons of it.

1405
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,460
That's probably way too much.

1406
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,460
Feeding your $40 to feed your dog.

1407
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,460
That was a retarded guess.

1408
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,460
We bought one bag for probably $20.

1409
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,460
I don't even eat $40 of food in a week.

1410
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,460
Okay.

1411
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,460
Honestly, it's probably like $10.

1412
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,460
Maybe.

1413
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,460
Maybe.

1414
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,460
Not even that.

1415
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,460
There you go.

1416
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,460
All right.

1417
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,460
Enough dog talk.

1418
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,460
I wasn't trying to bore everybody with the dog talk, but, I like the dog talk.

1419
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,460
I wish she was the only dog talk.

1420
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,460
We're getting dangerously close to dream.

1421
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,460
Sheer.

1422
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,460
Sheer.

1423
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,460
What's the word?

1424
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,460
Sheer.

1425
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:53,460
What's the word for when something doesn't matter?

1426
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,460
Sheer.

1427
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,460
Irrelevance.

1428
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,460
All right.

1429
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,460
Yeah.

1430
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,460
I'm unbelievably uninteresting.

1431
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
C.G.P.

1432
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:06,460
Gray has been, I've listened to his latest Hello, Internet episodes and he is going on

1433
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,460
a, not a crusade.

1434
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,460
He's got a operation Cyclops, which is.

1435
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,460
I don't have a way of what this is.

1436
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:21,860
To cut out social media usage, podcasts, Reddit, and just generally internet usage that is

1437
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:25,460
clearly wasting his time and the sort of stuff that he checks without thinking.

1438
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,460
Yeah.

1439
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:27,460
Good guy.

1440
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,460
I like you.

1441
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,460
I'm really into that.

1442
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,900
I've been into that for a while, but I've never gone like full force on it because I do

1443
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:41,460
kind of like, you know, it's, well, I mean, you justify it to yourself in a lots of ways.

1444
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,460
Yeah.

1445
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:49,020
I was talking about like in that, you know, let's play or something about a similar sort

1446
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,020
of thing.

1447
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,020
Yeah.

1448
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,460
I'm like, I was inspired by M dot strange because I've been like watching a bunch of

1449
01:03:54,460 --> 01:04:00,060
his blogs and he has his attitude towards social media is that he has never even bothered

1450
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,060
with it.

1451
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:04,460
Like he pretty much identified it as a bunch of horse shit from the beginning and just

1452
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,460
like, like out of pocket makes fun of it and is just like, yeah, it's totally worthless.

1453
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,460
And I'm like, this is a guy with a career as an internet content creator telling you

1454
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,420
that you don't need social media to do that.

1455
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:22,460
So like, why am I tricking myself into thinking I do, you know, good question.

1456
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,460
Yeah.

1457
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,300
So I was thinking about all that stuff and I'm like, what do I do?

1458
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:33,180
Like I could, I could feel when you're in the paradox of needing to be social media

1459
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,460
plugged into a podcast to tell you to get off the internet and stop wasting your time.

1460
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,060
I mean, they they talked about that in the hell of internet podcast was like, well, it's

1461
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,900
what are you going to say to our listeners then?

1462
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,900
Right.

1463
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,900
Yeah.

1464
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,380
But I think I don't think of a podcast as social media, though.

1465
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,380
Well not so.

1466
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:55,060
I mean, CGP Gray was was more about like things that eat up his time that he could do Twitter

1467
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:00,220
obviously and like whatever for me, like podcasts and like long YouTube videos.

1468
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:04,780
Like from the thing, the thing that I should probably unplug from immediately is like, I'll

1469
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,100
start up my day and I'll just start my day by like starting up some like some long like

1470
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,740
analysis video or something.

1471
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,740
I don't know.

1472
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:17,060
Listen to like start up an old like, I don't know, a Matthew Matosis or some yeah, start

1473
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:21,940
up a red letter media to a playlist or something and it'll just go throughout the whole day

1474
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,180
and I'll be like, well, just leave it on in the background.

1475
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,620
I won't pay attention to it, but like, at some point, at some point I start paying attention

1476
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,260
to it and at that point it becomes a waste of time.

1477
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,780
That's why ASMR is great because nothing in it is important at all, but just having sound

1478
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,660
is helpful.

1479
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:42,860
Just like is this podcast ASMR, nothing in this podcast is helpful at all.

1480
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:48,460
Well, I recommend Ben instead of throwing on interesting analysis videos, just throw

1481
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:54,260
on needle drop videos because I almost apparently uninteresting.

1482
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,060
That is deeply uninteresting to me.

1483
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,980
So like even more so than you.

1484
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,980
That would work.

1485
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:04,980
I mean, probably the best thing, the best thing for me is to put on music.

1486
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:09,220
Like when I put on music, it helps me focus, but I don't care about that.

1487
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:14,340
I can't man, music's too distracting, but whatever it's not just well, I think music

1488
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:24,100
I listen to music that isn't distracting fucking do you like my car, you know, put on

1489
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,460
Future Funk and Baby Waves mix, mix-taves.

1490
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,580
Yeah, I guess this guy doesn't even know shit about sludge fest.

1491
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:37,220
He's not even listening to raw, slow down, Alvin the Chipmunks, he's not listening to

1492
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:41,540
Country Eye Joe dubstep pre-mixes, he doesn't know what the place is going on.

1493
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,540
I was just putting, I was just starting, just starting, Hillary Duff, where'd you come from?

1494
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,540
Where'd you go?

1495
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:49,020
Hillary Duff, come rain night four, put on autoplay and just let it go, let it take you

1496
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,020
where it may.

1497
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,340
Yeah, makes sense.

1498
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:59,500
I've been like to do, to, like I've realized a lot of stuff is just you have your house

1499
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,100
and you have your computer and through that you get the internet and everything.

1500
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,060
And then like other things in your house are just not there anymore like they used to in

1501
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,620
old houses.

1502
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:15,220
Like everybody used to have a piano, everybody used to have like, you know, more like, you

1503
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:19,020
know, you have like the family bike or like a set of tennis racquets or football.

1504
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:22,140
You know, that old slut, they have chained up in the yard, the family bike.

1505
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,140
I hear you, I hear you.

1506
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,140
Yeah, family bike.

1507
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,140
Yeah, rider and all that.

1508
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:34,460
Like, there's just not a lot of stuff in my room and I'm like, like when I don't have

1509
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,500
the internet, I have video games, but I don't have like, I'm not a toy guy, I don't play

1510
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,500
with toys anymore.

1511
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,500
Yeah.

1512
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,500
And I threw a lot of them away.

1513
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:46,980
So like, what, what do I get to fill my hours with if not like editing or like, like leisure

1514
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,980
hours.

1515
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,980
Thinking, yeah.

1516
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:49,980
Yeah.

1517
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,740
Literal sitting in the thinker pose for hours on end and you know, yeah, why not?

1518
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:54,740
Why not?

1519
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,740
I ask.

1520
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,740
I can't think of anything.

1521
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,740
Nate, why not?

1522
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,740
I don't know.

1523
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,740
I'm curious.

1524
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,740
Nate, why not?

1525
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:05,620
Would you think with your brain to think about your ideas and who you are?

1526
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,620
My ideas.

1527
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,860
What's so retarded about that?

1528
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,980
My ideas are too dangerous, Munchie.

1529
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,580
The world's not ready.

1530
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:15,020
He needs to be distracted from the material goods.

1531
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:20,420
Thinking while that's funny to imagine just sitting down and thinking.

1532
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,620
Thinking in the shower is quite good.

1533
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:26,740
I mean, I spend a lot of time just literally sitting and staring at a wall and thinking

1534
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,740
about what I'm going to do.

1535
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,740
Well, okay.

1536
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:32,060
Literally thinking while doing a manual labor, I find very enjoyable.

1537
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:36,180
Like while doing the dishes can be a very helpful like time to think.

1538
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,180
Yeah.

1539
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,180
There's only so many dishes.

1540
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,700
There's only so many like tools to do.

1541
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,700
Yeah.

1542
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,700
Yeah.

1543
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,700
I'll eat food so I can survive.

1544
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,700
Yeah.

1545
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,700
Yeah.

1546
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,700
I'll drink some water.

1547
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,700
Yeah.

1548
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:47,700
Okay.

1549
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:56,060
What I'm trying to get at is that I've started to like right now get more into arts and crafts

1550
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,260
in a way that I used to like as a child and a boy.

1551
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,620
You mean like macaroni?

1552
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,620
No.

1553
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,620
I'm crocheting right now.

1554
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:08,460
I'm doing a little crochet and I've realized my brother has like a bunch of like modeling

1555
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,900
clay and I'm thinking, yeah, I'm going to get some like tools.

1556
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,500
I'm going to model something.

1557
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:22,020
I'm going to make 3D models, but like analog 3D models and like I kind of I kind of want

1558
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,700
to get like a wood carving knife.

1559
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,700
Oh yeah.

1560
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,260
The wristband I made munchy.

1561
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,980
I haven't let anything happen to it.

1562
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:32,100
I'm really I appreciate you going down this road hippo.

1563
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:38,740
I feel that I want to start doing something with my hands other than masturbate because

1564
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:44,300
like in Dick Masterson talks about this all the time that like as a man you need to have

1565
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:48,980
like a craft because like it's just something that makes you feel proud of yourself for

1566
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,300
like having built something.

1567
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:58,820
And I kind of got a taste of that by putting together Ikea furniture because I built a

1568
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:05,180
bed frame and this fucking mechanical desk I've got and it was just like that sense

1569
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:10,180
of man I took this this looks like it was going to be a pain in the ass and now it's

1570
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,980
a thing that I literally use constantly every single day.

1571
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,140
Yeah, it's a good feeling.

1572
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:21,060
What if I could just at any time do that like what if I just needed something and I could

1573
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:29,180
just put it together and then have it forever that would feel so badass, you know.

1574
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:34,700
I want it like I think you have to make things like I've always had like like dreams of like

1575
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,740
making a fucking real suit of armor with something like chainmail.

1576
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:43,420
It makes sense for me especially because I am so about like customization and like having

1577
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:48,300
everything be just right in my work environment where like I'm always frustrated when I go

1578
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,860
out to the store to like buy a shelf and there's no shelf that is the shelf I want.

1579
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:59,340
And so it's like what if I just you know blueprinted out the shelf that I want and then built

1580
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,740
that fucking shelf and it would probably be cheaper than trying to buy one.

1581
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:09,260
I mean it's not going to be as pretty but it will be the shelf I want because it doesn't

1582
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,500
exist you know.

1583
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:15,940
I have like fantasies of like having an office like Casey Neistat which I consider like Casey

1584
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:20,860
Neistat's office is like his reality marble from Fate Stay Night where it's just like

1585
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:25,900
in there he has infinite power and infinite control over everything that's happening.

1586
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,460
Yes.

1587
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,860
He should be a Fate Stay Night character and that should be his thing.

1588
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:35,420
I love his office too and it's funny because like when you compare his and MKBHD's like

1589
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:40,460
it's two radically different aesthetic approaches to the same thing.

1590
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:45,340
Both are just very clean, very organized environments but one is like about being uncluttered and

1591
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,860
one is about being like immediate.

1592
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:51,900
Casey's is so practical and immediate and we lean towards that one.

1593
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:57,260
I like yeah I definitely lean towards Casey's but like I don't even know if I'd want it

1594
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:04,540
to be so ridiculously organized like he holds on to stuff that he doesn't really need to

1595
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:11,340
like I feel as though he's so attached to having this as much visual noise as possible

1596
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,220
and I'm kind of moving away from that because that's how my old room was like I used to

1597
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:19,460
just have anime posters covering every fucking conceivable surface of the room and it was

1598
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:24,060
just like because I wanted it to be like you know the old otaku room pictures you used

1599
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,060
to see.

1600
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:30,140
And now I have more appreciation for just like well instead of just covering everything

1601
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:36,260
let's build unique areas like let's think about this wall and what can we make it into

1602
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:40,820
and like not necessarily that it's austere but that there's a theme or an art piece so

1603
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:46,780
that it's like it's not just a chord arrangement that's practical it's like chords arranged

1604
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:52,460
in a to create something like what if you you know spiraled all your chords that are

1605
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:56,300
attached to the wall until like you formed a Pikachu head or something you know.

1606
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:00,180
This image is basically Digi's perfect environment.

1607
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,540
His perfect work station.

1608
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:04,300
That's actually pretty great I would not mind that.

1609
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:09,620
Digi no this is a nightmare the whole point of this picture is that it's absolute hell.

1610
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,220
I don't know it seems pretty comfy.

1611
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,900
This is what like my setup was I mean aside from the fact that it's in a basement this

1612
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:20,300
is like what it kind of was when I was a kid like just a TV on a box and like you got

1613
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:25,820
a fucking you got a husband chair this looks comfy as fuck I mean a husband chair that's

1614
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,140
what that's called those are called husbands.

1615
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:33,380
We got to link this one this is a famous meme image of of I literally can't even conceive

1616
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,620
of what's wrong with this it looks comfy as long as it's like yeah as long as it doesn't

1617
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:43,940
stink and it's warm does it say rape sucks on the wall and no one knows what that says

1618
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,140
I think it says Ray sucks oh yeah it says Ray sucks or is it it might be rare as in

1619
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:56,260
rare abandoned Nintendo to go work with Microsoft I think it's RAYE Ray sucks okay I guess.

1620
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:01,220
All they would need is just like some carpeting like a blanket that would go a long way yeah

1621
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:05,580
well it's like the fucking pliers on the ground and this like shitty towel I mean are these

1622
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:09,860
in the main he probably use the walls and floor aren't good but the actual furnishing

1623
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,420
is great I mean I guess it's alright.

1624
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:18,180
Is this is this Jesse's is this the furnace room the furnace room it actually looks worse

1625
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:24,980
than this like this looks more comforting to me than the furnace room how how low how

1626
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,980
unfortunate.

1627
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:32,500
I like the two the two the two bottles of water there the two like jugs like once for drinking

1628
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,980
and once for peeing in right next to each other and sometimes he makes a little mistake

1629
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:43,380
and grabs the wrong one whoopsie what little oopsie dates.

1630
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,060
I mean he's got a great gamer thirst he doesn't have time to stop and check which one he's

1631
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:51,620
grabbing and guzzling currently I'm fairly certain that the VCR is just sitting on top

1632
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:56,180
of a toolbox and the pliers are sitting just outside of the toolbox and I'm thinking he

1633
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:59,620
was probably using them for something with the VCR because every chord you play into

1634
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:04,220
a VCR is like an impossible fucking wait is it I suppose is that is that a portrait of

1635
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:11,660
Iwata yeah it's a torii Iwata okay no way that can't be what that is no it is for Iwata

1636
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:18,460
it is Japan it's a torii Iwata you tell me they love video games he's kind of fucking

1637
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:24,980
oh it's good I mean Iwata is looking real good in this guy it's a real smug I'm I'm

1638
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:32,780
thinking PCPHQ right here I hope we get a set up this good in PCPHQ the love of God let

1639
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:37,500
it happen oh I think okay I studied this picture very closely and I think he's playing

1640
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:44,700
Twilight Princess I think I was wondering what you might be right because if you see those those

1641
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:49,900
like six icons across the top of the screen I think those like the horse whip things you know

1642
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:56,380
how like that could be you hit your horse repeatedly and hands zoom and hands Alexa now

1643
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:02,140
if you want to talk about truly being a poor boy picture if you want it you know this is how

1644
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:07,900
this guy's going to get out of the basement because he has a Gamecube copy of fucking Twilight

1645
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,460
Princess and those sell for like a lot he can probably refinance his house on that

1646
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:16,620
Luigi's Mansion is definitely on top of the stack who said gaming doesn't pay I think he's got

1647
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:21,980
fucking fancy star online on the bottom this is a true gamer right here because it looks like the

1648
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:27,500
box all right I mean maybe it's possible I mean it's out like the bottom box is like a color

1649
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:35,100
yeah that white to blue gray it's either like Mario Sunshine visual shit or Sonic Adventure DX

1650
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:42,460
or Fancy Star okay all right well all right does Iwata look a little bit George Costanza-ish

1651
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:48,620
in this picture to anyone I mean I suppose in general oh there's some more pictures of this

1652
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:53,020
well I mean yeah I just found this other one from this definitely confirms that it is Iwata

1653
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,740
yeah I mean 100% 100%

1654
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:01,740
oh he's got a hot pocket package like to the left of his TV in the second I think it's like a

1655
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:07,020
chicken pot pie like a frozen pie something like oh wait I do know what I see I see sleeves I see

1656
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:12,860
hot pocket yeah hot on the TV on the milk crate actually it seems like it's more like he's playing

1657
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:17,580
Luigi's looking at this space really is like a tactile experience like I can really feel what

1658
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:23,420
it's like to be there yeah I just I really like the tight and closed spaces because like is like

1659
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:30,060
laying on the ground that's not good oh that is gross yeah like get all just put it on just a towel

1660
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:35,980
on it's a towel on concrete it's literally well let me let me get a dank base I'm gonna go out

1661
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:42,140
on a crazy limb here and say and this this might be racist this is probably an Asian guy

1662
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:51,980
you think so this is just on the basis of my my Asian friends Iwata uh just it's Iwata's

1663
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:56,940
gamer set up he has a picture of himself on the wall walls and floor aside like this is exactly

1664
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:02,620
how my friend Donson would have been playing Gamecube like yeah towel on the ground two water

1665
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:08,140
like two full water jugs like two fucking gallon jugs towel on the ground not towel on the head

1666
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:13,980
and it's because the two water jugs lets me know that this guy does not intend on getting up like

1667
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:18,620
that's true he is not going to stop this sesh although he also has a soda but he probably

1668
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:23,500
just had that for his eating like he clearly ate a plate of something dude the presence of those

1669
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:28,620
water jugs and that like neatly snug fitting box is the most interesting thing here it tells me

1670
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:33,340
this guy is like serious about hardcore gaming incidentally he needs to fuel up what he has

1671
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:38,620
eaten is a banquet pot pie you can see the box for the pot pie I knew it yeah that's right and you

1672
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:43,660
can see the 10 there's also hot pocket things around there's a fucking hidden object game we're

1673
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:49,100
playing yeah playing where's wall though I just feel really comforted by this image in a strange

1674
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:54,940
way it feels like my childhood I I know it's so warmly tinted someone someone please like do a

1675
01:18:54,940 --> 01:19:00,140
gif of did you like phasing into this picture like like being absorbed into this world where he's

1676
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:07,020
finally at peace yeah it's like all shitty it's like shitty setups for sat like fantasy novels

1677
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:12,380
like the guy gets sucked into the book it's an isekai this is literally the digi isekai happening

1678
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:20,380
imagine like the opposite of like the getting sucked into the video game where like the

1679
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:25,740
the video game character comes out and then plays the game just sits there and plays the game that

1680
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:32,300
he was trying to do is so easy I think the box that's behind the chair is a glad bag box

1681
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:41,100
like a trash bag trash bags all right guys enough on this fucking picture no I I love this

1682
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:48,700
it's it's it's great I want to I want to go there yeah we all want to be a minute living in this uh

1683
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:54,460
this guy's basement you know what I'm talking about the minish from the minish cap oh yes

1684
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:01,820
living in him from arthur and the invisibles my favorite 3d animated family movie from the 2000s

1685
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:08,780
shout to the guy who made arthur and the invisibles I'm sure he's poor and died yeah

1686
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:16,140
um all right team uh what do we do should we should we go to questions now or anybody else

1687
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,300
want to bring up the topic to talk about questions I how long we've been going like an hour and a

1688
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,940
half yeah pretty close to an hour and a half did you what's this giant list of topics you've been

1689
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:30,060
talking about have you like what have you written down what are you talking about has he been mentioning

1690
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:35,420
one when did I say anything about a list of topics you said earlier like you've been making an epic

1691
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:40,140
list up all night intending to be on the pcp while making an epic list was the list the list has

1692
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:45,580
nothing to do with the pcp I am just making an epic list and that is why I've been up what what

1693
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:50,220
constitutes an epic list all right here is you want to hear about my list that I'm working on yeah

1694
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:58,780
I'll tell you yeah I do it is called is it a things I want to consume and so number one so okay

1695
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:02,620
you're I think Nate I think you're gonna love this once I've explained it all the way I think

1696
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:09,740
you'll actually be totally down for this idea so what it is is a list of every piece of media

1697
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:15,980
that I want to consume whether it's one that I haven't consumed before or that I want to

1698
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:23,020
re-consume like you know so rewatch replay so far I've gone through anime games books movies and

1699
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:30,140
tv shows so it's just the the the column it's a spreadsheet the columns are as follows format

1700
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:38,780
title time investment in total and time investment in pieces so for instance the first thing on the

1701
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:43,020
list sounds like this sounds this sounds like Oolulili is things I want to do before I die

1702
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:49,740
it's kind of like that except not as autistic just slightly less well that's one man's opinion so

1703
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:56,540
okay like for instance it'll say anime little witch academia time investment total seven hours

1704
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:02,140
time investment in pieces 22 minutes because you can watch 22 minutes at a time um I'm also going

1705
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:09,420
to code it by like categorize it by like casual consumption versus like immediate so you know

1706
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:13,500
something that you could just watch an episode of randomly forever actually way into this idea

1707
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,980
already I already love yeah because the idea here and this is this is actually related to what

1708
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:24,860
hippo is talking about um so I have a lot of these moments in my life where I just am not really sure

1709
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:31,100
what to do and I sit around for like an hour trying to think of what to do yep like I just go like

1710
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:35,420
uh do I want to watch a movie do I want to play a game do I want to watch an anime and it's like

1711
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:42,460
I know there's like hundreds of things I want to consume but like how do I fucking pick one like

1712
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:47,580
how do I keep track and then like a big part of it is I don't know uh do I want to like dedicate

1713
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:51,180
myself to a game that's going to take 16 hours you know because like the first game that comes

1714
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:58,540
to mind is some rpg uh so because I have this organized by time investment I can just uh you

1715
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:06,220
know just say all right well I want to spend four hours on a video game so I just literally

1716
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:10,860
go through and find a video game that takes four hours and I go oh I can play this game finally

1717
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:17,020
and then once I beat it it's fucking off the list and so like this making this list has been a really

1718
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:23,580
like I imagine this list is growing a lot faster than it's shrinking um well I mean it's brand new

1719
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:29,020
so it's growing yes it is growing way faster than it's shrinking um however I am being extremely

1720
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:35,340
spartan about this list it's like anything that I don't think I actually want to finish is not

1721
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:41,180
making the list it has to be like stuff that I'm like yeah I really want to finish this like I went

1722
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:46,380
through my mal and cold like shit loads of my on hold and plan to watch list where I was like

1723
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:49,580
because there's a lot of stuff that you tell yourself you're gonna watch because you think it

1724
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:55,820
would be like good to have seen it just to be like more worldly or because like it'll teach you

1725
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:00,940
something about a creator but you don't really care so like this is a list of just stuff that I

1726
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:06,300
like have a personal investment in that I'm like I want to see this thing through and so creating

1727
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:12,300
the list it's simultaneously is a feeling of man I've got a lot of shit I want to consume but on

1728
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:18,300
the other hand it's like this is all of it like I'm going through everything I'm going through

1729
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:25,500
like every recommended chart on you know on every fucking 4chan board like every rec chart every

1730
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,060
like list I have of stuff I've consumed and like anything I want to rewatch anything I and there's

1731
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:34,700
a lot of stuff that I'm just like you know what I don't need to rewatch this show like yeah it was

1732
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,620
good but I fucking remember it and I'm not going to get anything out of watching it again I don't

1733
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:46,060
care you know so it's not going on the list but so like I'm at 437 items right now and I'm pretty

1734
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:52,860
what is the total hours investment oh it uh make a spreadsheet I mean I spread it is a spreadsheet

1735
01:24:52,860 --> 01:25:00,780
spreadsheet oh okay you you might be able to to get a like a little formula to figure that out yeah

1736
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:05,580
I that'd be fun I might I mean it would take fucking forever but well if you if you have a

1737
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:10,300
column that lists things in like the format of just a number and you select the column it should

1738
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,900
auto add them if it's in excel then you can see on the right unfortunately I have it written as

1739
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:20,940
like the number and then the word hours and also the number then the word men um because I don't

1740
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:26,460
know why I feel the need to type it out every time but it just makes it more beautiful all right um so

1741
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:32,620
but like yeah it I do organize it that way so that like I can just you know click the column and

1742
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:37,900
then look at all the two hours stuff and be like oh what two hours thing do I want to you know consume

1743
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:42,860
today and and the basic idea was not not just to make it easier to pick out stuff to watch but also

1744
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:48,300
to cut out all the dumb bullshit I do end up filling that time with because usually this is the time

1745
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:54,860
that I'm gonna end up on Twitter and or I'm gonna end up on my discord and just like talk to people

1746
01:25:54,860 --> 01:26:00,300
for like an hour about nothing that in none of it matters like you know it's just like literally I

1747
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:06,860
go there to waste time because I couldn't think of what I wanted to do fast enough and this is easier

1748
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:11,660
and that's the main strength I think of this kind of list which is why I love it M dots what really

1749
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:16,220
got me on this was that M dot strange has this video called be your own dope dealer and he just

1750
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:20,620
talks about how like you know all the systems of all the social media is just to make you have dopamine

1751
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:25,820
hits for for everything that you click on and it got me thinking about like what do I go to for

1752
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:34,940
dopamine and it's mostly just the confirmation that people have consumed the thing I made like I

1753
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:40,380
don't really care about likes or views or any of that shit I ever since getting tweet deck which

1754
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:46,860
cuts my Twitter down to like like I have a mentions tab that's available right when I go on the page

1755
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:51,820
and there's nothing else there no likes no retweets no other bullshit it's just the mentions

1756
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:58,060
and since having that that is now the only tab I read I don't actually read Twitter I just look

1757
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:03,340
at my mentions because I get enough of them that I can you know that it that can occupy my time

1758
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:09,580
but it's like why why do I care that people are mentioning me on Twitter other than you know

1759
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:14,060
and eat a little ego rush of like ah people are paying attention to me you know it's the main one

1760
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:21,260
yeah and I get nothing like even when like you can trick yourself by being like well some of my

1761
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:27,180
friends tweet funny stuff or like some of sometimes people draw me fan art and it's like yeah but

1762
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:32,140
that doesn't you're just justifying this you know like that stuff is largely irrelevant you

1763
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:36,780
could spend the same amount of time you saw you spent reading that funny tweet doing something

1764
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:43,820
productive and in my case like consuming media is productive like it is something that will either

1765
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:48,860
give me ideas or enrich my understanding of the things I talk about because my job is media analysis

1766
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:54,220
so like the fact that I spend so much time on stuff that just is utterly inconsequential

1767
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:00,380
I'd like to cut that shit out you know and just focus on things that are that are the very least

1768
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:07,900
fun and enjoyable and like we'll have a lasting impact you know yeah so uh yeah that's my big list

1769
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:14,860
I also have made an epic list kind of recently not the same like not for the same reason

1770
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:22,220
but I just decided one one day to like list every video game I have access to because I own in some

1771
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:26,860
fashion like on Steam or I have the physical thing or it's on one of the consoles I own

1772
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:35,660
and I've made I googled like I made a spreadsheet and then I googled um for like a pick random thing

1773
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:43,340
from a list in excel or google.google sheets or whatever and now I go to that tab and I just

1774
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:49,100
click on the little button and it just pops out a game that I have and can play right then and there

1775
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,900
if I really wanted to by the way uh that's cool just if anyone's interested in making a list

1776
01:28:53,900 --> 01:29:01,660
like this themselves here's your pro tips for anime my anime list will tell you how many episodes

1777
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:07,020
and the length of each episode I just assumed for most shows 22 minutes but in cases where I know

1778
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:12,380
it's not I listed it differently so you know I just calculated the amount of hours based on 22

1779
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:18,060
minute episodes for games I used how long to beat which is a site that just tells you how long a

1780
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:23,740
game takes to beat there's there's like the main story and then main plus extras and then completion

1781
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:29,740
and it gives you those three times based on you know user submitted times I usually take about as

1782
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:37,740
long as whatever is main um and then for books there's actually a site called how long to read

1783
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:41,500
that tells you how long it takes to read a book based on if you can read 300 words per minute

1784
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:46,860
which I'm pretty sure I read slower than that but I just went with it um and then for movies and tv

1785
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:52,540
shows there's a website called binge binge or like binge time binge something like that that tells

1786
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:58,540
you how long it takes to binge a show so yeah you can find all of the fucking at least a semblance

1787
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:03,740
of the data online um yeah it's pretty sick I mean it'd be helpful I'd like to make one at least for

1788
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:08,300
like I don't know the top 10 things I wanted to consume right now and then just to have that so

1789
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:14,060
I can like ah like last night uh me and uh we watched um what was it um fucking uh we watched

1790
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:18,940
this movie uh Gerald's game do you guys ever see this it's a scary movie it's about it's about the

1791
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:24,140
the lady gets chained to a bed and then her husband dies on top of her and they're all like alone

1792
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:29,260
but a great movie highly recommended um but then after that I wanted to watch something and I was

1793
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:34,460
like I want to watch something what's going on I ended up watching um the purge at like the first

1794
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:40,220
purge it was shit it was garbage uh so I really wish I'd done something else if only I'd thought of

1795
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:46,540
something better or you know sooner than I had that movie instantly god that movie sucked um but

1796
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:54,460
also very funny also another thing about actually making this list sorry budgie is that uh like um

1797
01:30:54,460 --> 01:31:00,540
there's a lot of stuff that I am more encouraged now that I know how long it is because like with

1798
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:06,060
with video games in particular people don't usually tell you like the exact length of games

1799
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:11,980
and there's like a lot of games that that like seemed like rpgs to me that go on forever and I

1800
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:19,740
like for instance uh fable is only like 12 hours long that's shocking yeah and like I thought about

1801
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:23,580
it and I was like well that explains how I got so far in it as a kid because I almost beat it as a

1802
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:29,180
kid um but you know this idea of not knowing how long a game is I've wanted to I've I own uh the

1803
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:33,660
last guardian I've really wanted to beat it I just like haven't because I'm like as scared it's going

1804
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:38,300
to take a while but if I know that it's like five hours or something which it probably is

1805
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:43,420
be way more likely to actually play it dude I'm gonna hit you up literally right now it is 12 hours

1806
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:49,260
long okay all right good to know one of the one of the things I did as soon as I've made my gaming

1807
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:55,180
list is like I assumed that to be like the the average time would take to be like every game on

1808
01:31:55,180 --> 01:32:01,580
this list is like one week per game if I'm doing other things yeah and then it would take like

1809
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:10,220
actually let me check how many games there are there's like uh 510 games I guess so like 510

1810
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:16,220
weeks that's a lot of years yeah yeah like that's 10 years that's 10 years or so I mean yeah so like

1811
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:21,660
the prospect of buying a new game is like completely gone I didn't have much of a reason to buy into like

1812
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:26,940
to to keep up with modern games or to buy games or to to do things but like there's a lot of these

1813
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:32,380
I don't want to play but it's a lot of them that I do and I think yeah uh I've got I've got plenty

1814
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:37,340
of stuff to keep me occupied I think the biggest shocker on the whole list for me was Mega Man

1815
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:42,380
Legends which I had just because I've only ever played like the first hour or so of it multiple

1816
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:48,220
times over the years and I just had the impression it was an RPG and therefore long it's like a seven

1817
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:54,220
hour game like I could probably beat it in an afternoon in one sitting yeah um that was nice

1818
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:59,580
to know it's empowering yeah I because I will play a game in one sitting you know yeah try to make

1819
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:04,860
a list like this many times in my life like four or five or six times I've tried to but I've just

1820
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:10,940
never I've always wanted to have a mal but for everything I've never just like some media spreadsheet

1821
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:17,820
that was just you know I mean I I spent a lot of time a few years ago my everything list I have

1822
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:22,700
like spreadsheets of everything I've consumed in in each uh each media that I made like a couple

1823
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:28,940
years ago and I've tried to keep updated with but not really well mal is a lot easier obviously but

1824
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:37,260
um but like knowing all the stuff I've completed it doesn't like this how do I put it like with

1825
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:43,900
anime I had like the on hold list and the plan to watch list and like that kind of lets me know

1826
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:49,020
like what's left out there but like eventually I go through the on hold list and I'm like okay half

1827
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:53,100
of the shit doesn't need to be in here like half of this is stuff that I like watched the first

1828
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:58,140
episode and went oh well this wasn't bad so I'm not gonna drop it but then like a year later I'm

1829
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:01,900
like I'm never gonna find time to watch that fucking show like who cares that it wasn't bad

1830
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:08,620
it's not amazing if it didn't make my fucking if it didn't have my balls in a vice in episode one

1831
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:12,780
then it's not good enough to be like on the list of ultimate things I want to consume because

1832
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:17,980
even after cutting all the stuff I don't think I want to get better in the episodes

1833
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:29,900
one thing say one thing doesn't matter I just remember that like I looked into Buffy the vampire

1834
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:39,340
because Jesse is a vampire slayer sorry but like there's like eight seasons of that and every

1835
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:45,580
episode is an hour long right right and it's like some it's just too much like some of the seasons

1836
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:50,060
have like 20 episodes that's just I can't believe I watched three seasons of loss was it good

1837
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:55,980
it's all right all right yeah I was I mean I didn't I didn't see or no was it six seasons

1838
01:34:55,980 --> 01:35:00,140
I watched all but once I watched all but once season I didn't watch the last season I am consistently

1839
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:06,060
blown away by the fact that normies watch like entire shows like that they love this watch they love

1840
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:12,700
60 hours of a show in like three days and I'm like how do you even do that like people think I

1841
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:17,900
watched so much anime you know why did you know anime that takes that long outside of like Gintama

1842
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:22,220
you know it's cuz fucking people and this is fine I like this is with me and League of Legends

1843
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:27,340
before it's you they go to work for eight hours they come home they sit their ass down they watch

1844
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:33,820
TV that's what like every person in America does uh and that's you know it's fine but it's you know

1845
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:40,860
also gay so that's yeah I finally instead of just standing at the brink of the bus and just

1846
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:45,900
saying that I will soon I've actually actually taken the plunge and I'm reading books now

message during the question I saw this a couple times some female person said like hey pcp here's

1906
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:45,740
my question or you ever go to acknowledge your female fans first of all I was like what a terrible

1907
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:50,380
question that is acknowledge your female what is that this is why yeah let's just let's just rope

1908
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:54,860
like velvet rope a little corner of the pcp to acknowledge our female fans that sounds like a

1909
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:59,020
good use of time and not at all I didn't mean for her to turn into this I did not know it

1910
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:03,980
I didn't make congratulations one of our like one of our like six female fans you've just

1911
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:08,140
alienated so you know well done look I'm just ribbing her if she can't have a little ribbing

1912
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:12,540
then she truly isn't the rib from Adam that I thought she was all right here we go that's true

these voicemails uh there were a bunch of people who uh like left music on in the background

1920
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:51,900

01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:42,220
don't get me on the uh he's about to show his channel once bar google it you'll figure it out

1947
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:45,580
uh but sorry did you what were you saying what were you saying oh I was deliberately talking over him

1948
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:52,300
but any oh shit I get it the uh I actually don't even remember what I was fucking saying oh just

1949
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:58,220
that like everyone keeps opening with like hey hello pcp it's uh whatever and I'm like just get to the

1950
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:03,260
point yeah get get to it get to it we don't tolerate that from youtube video don't I don't want to hear

1951
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:08,780
voicemail yeah no there's no need for preamble no and keep it we know we are the shortest you

1952
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:12,780
possibly can I'll tell you people if you record one when I see one of these that is longer than a

1953
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:19,020
minute I'm like hmm I don't know about that so there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing in

1954
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:25,500
all of human knowledge that takes more than a minute to pull out the time tested uh a comedic

1955
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:31,020
goal that is hey blank I am blank and then you can proceed to tell your joke and it works every

1956
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:35,420
single time I'll read your name I'll read your name so don't even include that just say the question

1957
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:39,420
or get to the jump like the guy with the robo voice was good he didn't do shit just imagine

1958
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:44,940
just imagine that you're like uh like a drunk guy in the crowd like we're up on stage and you

1959
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:50,700
are heckling us you're just saying whatever comes to mind as loud as you can scream into the microphone

1960
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:57,740
I'd rather you do that I would say that if at all possible try and keep your message under like 15

1961
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:03,900
seconds I think that 99% of the time you can probably say what you want to say in like 15

1962
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,660
seconds that's probably true that work on it don't be afraid to do a couple takes I don't give

1963
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:15,020
that that last voicemail could have been hey fuckface all you get is credit dumbass shouldn't

1964
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:21,580
have maybe wasted all your time go to my channel yeah yeah once bar's a good guy but uh that that

1965
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:25,420
true there was some some rambling there so there you go buddy there's some constructive criticism

1966
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:29,980
for you I'm just saying that I made a lot of calls into the biggest problem the universe in the dick

1967
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:35,420
show right and every single time I just sat there and labored over what I was gonna say for minutes

1968
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:42,460
on end to try to make it as funny and concise as possible and I never got played even though I

1969
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:49,340
tried so hard because other people were even better so yeah you know it's a hierarchy uh all right

1970
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:54,140
well let's go to uh we got a fumble the second I fucking actually started talking fair enough uh

1971
01:48:54,140 --> 01:49:01,020
ultimatum juniper with another one here what do you what do you got what do you got I'm supposed

1972
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:09,740
to have been working right now okay hang on four years ah okay because of you fuckers

1973
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:24,780
I've lost that time now all I want really is compensation via uh the star fleet brand of

1974
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:33,900
communism you know the one uh so like you guys would be like put in a isolated chamber stop it

1975
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:39,900
where you have to wait stop stop it your time okay doing literally nothing wait no stop just

1976
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:45,900
gonna stop I just stop it gotta try all I want to say is that I ran the numbers I did the math

1977
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:51,740
and I'm pretty sure that if you listen to all of the pcp continuously it would take like eight and a

1978
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:57,500
half days that's a pretty good chunk of that's how much of your life we've stolen yeah there you go

1979
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:02,060
maybe he means like all our independent content too and maybe he like quit his jobs we could be

1980
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:07,820
ready for rad country and watch the whole thing you know I mean I know that my content in total

1981
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:14,300
adds up including pcp adds up to like a month and a half of total time so that's pretty good

1982
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:21,660
it's pretty good digi I recently made I recently made a uh a playlist like that for myself yeah

1983
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:27,180
I got like oh yeah so I got like I got like 450 videos on that it was more than I thought

1984
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:30,860
honestly I have way let oh I think you included everything in tbap and I just didn't go to the

1985
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:36,700
tbap yeah I did include everything in tbap yeah right including including equestria bound which was

1986
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:42,140
like a hundred videos and mine included absolutely everything even if I had like one line in the

1987
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:47,660
background like I put you have to eat your greens in mine like I there were a couple there were a

1988
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:53,740
couple things uh like um oh I I include I think I included analysis anarchy hell yeah

1989
01:50:54,780 --> 01:51:01,740
yeah that sounds good I just want to be thorough I even I included that that time that I called into

1990
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:08,620
uh uh jesse's uh pony show oh yeah and he took my that's like the second video on the channel

1995
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:37,900

only I think we should be are we gonna listen to this whole thing all right all right let's pause

2010
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:25,340
buddy uh appreciate that that was good but that's long so can can can people listen to the full

2011
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:30,700
things of these you know okay only we have access to you know what you know what the it is it is true

2012
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:35,740
the way that we listen to these is they are all up on a sound cloud where I upload all of them to

2013
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:39,740
listen to um now I was planning to like delete them and just use them to hold them there because

2014
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:45,180
like it just works through soundcloud but like this this chilling chocolate is up on soundcloud

2015
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:49,260
and can be listened to there publicly if people have the link let's just see if I can get the

2016
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:54,060
fucking link make sure you get in before we have to start taking them off to make room on our sound

2017
01:53:54,060 --> 01:54:00,780
cloud yeah question oh you know it's soundcloud.com slash the dash pro dash crastonators so if you go

2018
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:04,300
there you can listen to that you listen to the whole thing fun fact yeah fun fact I actually

2019
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:09,420
knocked myself out of ketosis this past week oh no and I think the way that I think it was

2020
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:15,420
I did not eat any carbs I think it was that I ate too much protein damn you Ben because damn yeah

2021
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:22,540
because because I went to the supermarket I went to Wegmans and I got like a deal I got like some

2022
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:28,300
like some there's a Wegmans near you yeah it's the closest supermarket well there's a whole foods

2023
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:32,620
and there's a Wegmans the Wegmans is cheaper we're constantly talking about how much we miss Wegmans

2024
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:37,500
because Wegmans is the only thing in Rochester basically and all the grocery stores here suck

2025
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:45,100
compared to it um do you miss uh do you miss food lion no food lion sucks do you miss uh do you

2026
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:51,420
miss Kroger I would have missed Kroger I would have missed Kroger in Rochester if not for the

2027
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:57,740
fact that Wegmans is even better but now I miss all of them do you have Publix in Virginia Beach

2028
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:03,740
no southern grocery stores are stupid and I hate them uh um chat to violence they need that

2029
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:11,740
they need the shout out from the pcp they need that endorsement um um um wait I was gonna say

2030
01:55:11,740 --> 01:55:17,660
okay I went to the supermarket I went to Wegmans and there was like a big thing of sausage super

2031
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:22,860
cheap for like like two dollars and change a pound for this Italian sausage but it was like you know

2032
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:27,900
expiring in maybe like three days yeah so I was like so I bought it and I was like I'm just gonna

2033
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:33,260
eat nothing but sausage for three days I did it was delicious ketosis completely destroyed

2034
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:37,980
it's not well I think I just I just ate too much protein and and yeah flew too close to the sun

2035
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:43,340
flew too close to the sun lost lost that ketosis that was good that was good sausage so cheap I

2036
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:48,220
I just realized that we're gonna have to go to questions after this why don't we just make questions

2037
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:52,300
not a thing and have them just all be voicemails and that will weed out the week who are gonna be able

2038
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:57,980
to do it well we we've been doing fewer questions yeah we've been doing less okay my my only thought

2039
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:03,500
on that is like I let's say someone just doesn't own a microphone but they have like a great question

2040
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:08,940
I'd like to give them away you know that's that's way too theoretical it's probably okay it's

2041
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:16,300
unrealistic people have phones better people do have phones now yeah we should um I suppose we should

2042
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:22,700
really like vet these questions and just pick out like you know the good ones yeah we don't vet them

2043
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:27,260
at all I mean I make sure that they're not like completely nightmarish before playing them but

2044
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:34,220
that's about it yeah speaking of which here's one from Ben St publicist let's uh let's see what he's

2045
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:43,420
got for us so what he goes to this website you see it's um seen comics no what's he got and there's

2046
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:53,180
this um there's this uh this story on there oh no called the vape men uh yeah vapor clouds

2047
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:58,940
and I just wanted to give a quick review uh so that you could improve

2048
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:05,660
your feature ads okay I can't there's not enough weed I can't so I noticed in this story

2049
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:11,020
you got a guy and he's kind of seeing uh so that makes it a zero out of ten for me

2050
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:18,620
and uh if you could just like post a revised version all right all right thanks for that buddy um

2051
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:25,100
I think he was onto something you know sad boys you gotta nix them gotta get rid of the sad boys uh

2052
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:31,740
makes sense all right let's do one more how about from um from you are the more bullet sci-fi

2053
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:39,340
what was that nothing okay all right actually do please don't just read me

2054
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:48,700
all right everyone the pcp is hostage at this very moment if you do not get the patreon

2055
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:55,580
up to 1100 yes by the next episode yes I I'm offing one of the members I'm gonna

2056
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:05,740
I'm sorry to say uh you better reach that goal or one of them's gotta go okay well I volunteer to die

2057
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:12,780
he volunteers to die so we don't have to listen to any more voicemails um I volunteer Nate to die

2058
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:17,020
I mean well he said he said it's a random the the the the choices in his hands we can volunteer

2059
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:21,820
someone but it's really up to him at the end of the day okay this is this is not his doing yeah he's

2060
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:27,180
he's he's subject to the whims of this just like the rest of us yeah so uh I mean there you go actually

2061
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:31,500
the the patreon was above 1100 before but it's dipped down after the end of the month which is

2062
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:35,980
understandable but you better start pledging everybody or we'll be dead so uh yeah I mean

2063
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:41,820
your your favorite you know your favorite pcp member might be no more on the other hand your

2064
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:46,300
least your least favorite one might be destroyed so I guess it's a it's a coin you can either give a

2065
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:50,700
little today and keep a lot tomorrow or you can give nothing in a day and lose it all tomorrow

2066
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:58,060
the choice is yours he's worked you've worked hard for this viewer don't all right that's enough

2067
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:01,820
that's enough of these voicemails here let's just grab like a pity question or two and then

2068
01:59:01,820 --> 01:59:08,700
wrap this shit up shall we let's see what we got yeah that's a wrap uh how about um oh no what do

2069
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:17,340
no no oh these are all shit no no let me let me uh this guy fucking posted a screen cap of a

2070
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:23,660
question too long to be posted in a uh fucking tweet can you give me can you give me the cliff

2071
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:29,660
the cliff notes is like what are your thoughts on the value of the game reviews that are objectively

2072
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:34,540
incorrect uh and then he goes on to say reviews of k-mart's two final mix you usually describe

2073
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:40,780
it as mindless button measure blah blah blah stop it stop stop it stop uh no that's that's just

2074
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:45,020
i mean i guess i'd say if it's objectively incorrect i'm not a fan oh by the way that was uh

2075
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:53,020
at karasu underscore b i i yeah here's one here's one from blue nimbus uh questions suck

2076
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:58,540
why would anyone ever ask one this seems like we've entered a paradox uh with this question

2077
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:04,540
iraq son says uh will you replace the voicemail segment with questions i maybe but in reverse

2078
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:12,780
wait yeah i think he probably meant to in reverse uh maybe yeah i don't know i don't know yeah i think

2079
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:20,060
bat sling says chibi bakas when oh yeah chibi bakas when soon munchie has an edited editing of one

2080
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:28,140
there is one they're not that hard am i allowed to say um am i allowed to say what uh what

2081
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:35,740
uh what it's about anime work we want to watch well i mean sure but don't get people's hopes

2082
02:00:35,740 --> 02:00:42,700
that this you weren't in the last episode no i haven't i haven't been on one yet right yeah

2083
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:48,700
you can talk about what you want yeah yeah sure oh i really want to do one for s cry ed i don't

2084
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:53,900
know what that is to happen i want i i think they will like it and i want it to happen it's great

2085
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:57,740
it's pretty dope it's pretty especially if you're only watching three episodes because the first

2086
02:00:57,740 --> 02:01:02,540
three episodes are strong and wait so is this supposed to be like scared but instead of the

2087
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:10,700
the middle it's cry s cry ed square squared it's like s dot c r y dash ed or something weird like

2088
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:15,660
that it's pronounced it's fucked up it's bizarre i think there's a meaning behind it but it's

2089
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:20,460
retarded and it doesn't matter yeah i there's only one question in here that i think is actually

2090
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:25,980
interesting um kajoro bitter thorn asks what's the most you've ever done to pamper yourself

2091
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:33,340
going to hawaiian vacation was a pretty big pampering experience i mean i didn't like go to

2092
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:37,580
like a spa but like i feel like it's like the same sort of thing that's probably the biggest i've

2093
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:42,700
ever done yeah yeah we've actually got a lot of questions in here oh yeah are they good

2094
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:47,260
in the quite are you guys looking at the i was looking at the that's where i pulled that one from

2095
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:52,220
and that was the only one i found that i thought was that could potentially lead to a funny story

2096
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:57,420
from somebody yeah i don't i don't know about pampering i guess i've been to a salon once to

2097
02:01:57,420 --> 02:02:01,740
cut my hair because i had too much hair and a barber wouldn't know what to do with it myself i

2098
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:06,540
don't like i don't like it i i want to get a massage so bad everything i get a massage for

2099
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:11,020
like an entire year but then i have to get my dick jacked off at the end and i you know i just don't

2100
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:16,620
have to go into a fancy restaurant with nate was a pretty big pampering of that was great

2101
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:21,500
shout out to uh uh jack ruby's the precinct or something like the precinct yeah i mean like

2102
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:26,620
because i pretty regularly pamper myself by just going to like expensive restaurants which i would

2103
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:32,700
consider to be pampering yourself oh what i'm what is like pampering is pampering buying something

2104
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:37,580
you like that is no pampering is like i've been pampering myself recently when i go and i buy

2105
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:44,220
pampers and i really you know i tuck myself in i pampering is pampering is you lay in a bathtub

2106
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:48,300
full of mud and you rub some green shit on your face and you put cucumbers over your eyes and

2107
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:53,100
you wrap your head in the towel there's no other way to pamper yourself pampering just indulging

2108
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:59,260
in things unnecessarily for your own benefit slash yeah treat yourself that's a good way of putting

2109
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:04,140
and i was trying to get a dictionary definition and it basically is that uh oh urban dictionary uh

2110
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:11,180
it's time it's time to bring it back oh my god oh our pcp pampering what do we got urban dictionary

2111
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:16,780
to pampering all right here we go it is something you guys aren't aware of most gentlemen and older

2112
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:21,340
men know this after a man and a woman are done with sex the man gets up and prepares a warm

2113
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:26,460
to wet washcloth by setting it in the microwave for 30 seconds the man then comes back to where

2114
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:31,580
his partner lay in either passes the washcloth to to her where she wipes herself down pampering

2115
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:36,620
and cleaning herself or he wipes the woman down thereby pampering the woman not only is the sweet

2116
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:41,500
gesture for your partner it also prevents uti and maintains cleanliness that's the definition

2117
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:47,100
of pampering apparently it's a very bizarre urban dictionary definition why would you why would you

2118
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:52,940
warm up the cloth after what i imagine would be like hot like vigorous sex like i want a cool

2119
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:57,500
cloth well i guess it's better for sticky stuff okay here's just a definition of pamper on urban

2120
02:03:57,500 --> 02:04:03,340
dictionary the only pamper the a word only ever used by women over the age of 40 meaning to treat
