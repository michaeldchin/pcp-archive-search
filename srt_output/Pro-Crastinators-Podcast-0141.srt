1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the theme song, this is the new theme song, this is the theme song of the show, this is the new theme song, it's the new fucking theme song and this is how it fucking goes.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the new fucking theme song of the podcast. The podcast has a new theme song. This is it right here.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is the new fucking theme. Oh God.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why am I forsaken?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There's no forgiveness. God does not exist. And if He did, we are abandoned.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He doesn't love us. In fact, He hates us. And He hates me the most.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is the theme song. Yes, this is the theme song of the whole fucking show. This is it.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you demanded a new fucking theme song, well here it is. Here's what you get.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Welcome back to another hilarious episode of Doug Funny.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Here we are. We're over here at that old...

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That old...

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That old...

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That old...

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All over his house. Hey, Ben, why don't you sing to us? Why don't you dance for us?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Dear journal, today Porkchop was looking real hot over in his little dog house in the backyard.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know what to do with all these feelings. I can't tell my dad. He's too hot also.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi, I'm Doug Funny and I'll see you in hell, fuckers. Doug out.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just so all the fans know, whenever you go to Ben's house, you know, you're looking for tips.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're looking to where to find the secret coins for each level, where to find the hidden power-ups.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You go to him and all you can talk about is just Doug Funny. Doug Funny, Doug Funny, Doug Funny.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's just talking about how much he remits. He laments about how he never got his big shot with Patty Wagon.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And how he never got to have sex with that cartoon character. He just limits how Doug screwed it all up for him.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Pat, the other day I legitimately, me and Crack almost, we were this close to actually putting on some Doug.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He was saying that Doug is like the biggest idiot. He's like, if you watch it again as an adult, you realize that Doug is unbelievably stupid.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think Crack might be unbelievably stupid.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You think so? I don't know, man. I'm kind of curious. I wonder. I wonder.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Doug fucking organized a band that had like eight drummers. How could a man like that not be a genius?

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So did SpongeBob and SpongeBob organize a band that had like eight thousand members.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah. I thought the whole point of Doug was that he's like a severely schizophrenic artist who like hallucinates full-on scenarios around him.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah. Well, I know.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is fucking Zach from Save by the Bell also like, is he hallucinating or is that real?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, the moment that I always remember is that like he has this full-blown like dissociative fantasy of himself like being thrown in jail or something.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Like it shows him like he's in jail and he's holding onto the bars like let me out of jail.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But then it like goes back to reality and he's like standing behind a bike rack like holding onto it like he's like a completely crazy person.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He needs to be locked up.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This episode brought to you by this image of Doug Funney and Patty Mayonnaise on this t-shirt.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Link in the show notes below.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a sweatshirt. It's a comfy.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I wonder how I got myself into this situation.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, let me tell you, it all started in January 1985 where I bought this sweatshirt, even though Doug came out of the 90s.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey, let me tell you about another show, right?

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm making a new video, right?

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's your own original content, your new show called Fun Dougie.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, I'm...

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, no, no, no. It's actually, it's Fun D as in Fun Dougie.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's trying to make season three of Doug Funney happen.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Fun to Dougie, everybody.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hashtag fun to Dougie.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm starting a new series which I may abandon.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I may abandon prematurely, but we'll see where I do an episode by episode analysis of the new adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're committed now, Ben. You've talked about it.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, I'm committed to...

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is your ghost in the shell.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm committed to at least two episodes.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to at least get to episode four, which won the Humanitas Prize, which is considered the Nobel Prize of American television.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Is that the one with Piglet going crazy?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, that's the one where Rabbit finds...

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's EO, isn't it? It's cure.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, it's the one where Rabbit finds the baby bird in the snowstorm.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, my God. Yeah, somehow I knew. Somehow I knew that was the one.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's, man, Rabbit's the best. Rabbit's the best guy who ever lived.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He's a fucking humanitarian. He deserves an award. He deserves a peace prize.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's true. That's true.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know, I'm not going to spoil. I'm not going to share my thoughts.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not going to share my thoughts about that episode, which I rewatched the other day.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But, man, it's kind of, you know, they're all really dumb.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They're all dumb to the point of like...

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What, the episodes?

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no, no, the characters. The characters are all dumb to the point that they're not even human.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, they're supposed to be childish, right?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They're supposed to be... I don't know. You know, maybe I'm spoiled.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Maybe I'm spoiled on such modern-day classics as My Little Pony and SpongeBob, where the character...

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Everyone, please drop PCP fan art of us as the individual Winnie the Pooh characters.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, please make me Eeyore.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Obviously, Jesse is Pooh.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hell yeah.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Obviously, Ben's Eeyore.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm thinking I'm Rabbit because he's so neurotypical, but also kind of autistic.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I think I'm probably a heflon.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who's Owl?

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Owl's Tom.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The most neurotypical activity there is is just wanting to tend to your garden.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like, I tend to my subscribers. You know, I'm out there hoeing my fields and sowing my weaguas and reaping the rewards.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's me.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm definitely a heffalump, definitely.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I guess I'd be like Kanga Mage. She's the closest to a tribola.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You remind me of Kanga because you're motherly mage, kind of.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, don't... Why?

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Is that a nice thing to say?

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Can we get some impreg fetish art of Kanga Mage, please?

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, no, no.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I refuse. I deny. I ban.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ben.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Who's Rue? Who's Rue?

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is Hippo Rue?

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, I guess me.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because I'm small and I jump.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I do jump.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like a piglet, kid.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
As we got on this topic, I immediately felt like I wanted to go off on a rant about Owl and how he's the worst guy ever and how I hate him.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He is deceptively terrible.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's the biggest pseudo-intellectual pretentious cock who ever lived.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He causes trouble.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He causes problems everywhere he goes.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He makes everything more complicated and more horrible.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Every situation is worsened by Owl's inclusion every time.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That whole debacle with Christopher Robin going to school and they thought he was going to skull.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That whole thing was caused by Owl. It was all his fault.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Listen, I have new adventures. I haven't watched the old theatrical shorts. It probably happens that too.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I watched six episodes and in one out of three episodes, Owl let someone fall to their death.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What the hell?

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, I mean, a bird can't really support that much weight despite what your enemies lead you to believe, Ben.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Owl's just being realistic about the situation.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's got Eeyore up in the sky on balloons trying to cheer him up and then he pops all the balloons and says it's time for his solo and lets him plummet to his death.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why would he do that?

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why would he do that?

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then in the next one, Kessie falls off the tree.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Rabbit can't hold onto him and he falls off the cliff and Owl finds him falling and he doesn't help him.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or hair, rather.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And he's like, oh yes, oh my uncle Horatio. Oh, a double aerial gainer. What an unusual technique.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because Kessie's doing sick gainers on the way down, bro.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I mean, he's just being a social Darwinist. This guy has to rise and fall on his own weight.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He can't be helping him out.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, I love every single character except Owl and I'm sure that Christopher Robin feels the same way.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Kessie does figure out how to fly on the way down. It's debatable whether Owl helped or not.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There you go.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I bet Owl doesn't even know how to use a 10 scale. Doesn't even know how to use a 10 scale properly. That piece of shit, Owl.

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Owl is Christopher Robin's mistake that he regrets giving life to every day.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, are you guys, I mean, you're probably familiar with this, but the original conceit for Winnie the Pooh was that half of the cast is stuffed animals.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Like poo and I think, and fucking piglet were stuffed animals.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Actually, I don't know about piglet, but then the other half were just animals that lived around.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Pooh, Piglet, Kanga, Eeyore and Tigger were the original toys.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
All the other ones were invented by Mill.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Was Rue real then?

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Like Kanga, his mother is a fake.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He probably made that one.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No, the mother was a real toy. Rue is not a toy.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, there you go.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Rabbit was not a toy. Owl and Gopher were not.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So there's a real Kangaroo in the woods and he has no mother and then Christopher Robin creates one for him.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They're on display in like the New York, in some museum or library in New York.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You know, Kanga bothers me a little because Kangaroos don't live in the forest.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They live in the fucking outback.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, now they're just fucking tigers, but you don't believe that.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's not a tiger, he's a Tigger, he's an idiot.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's a Tigger, you fuck, yeah.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't fucking tear you.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh my god, remember that one episode where Tigger loses all the stripes and loses his identity and just becomes so...

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, whatever.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We'll spend all day talking about the deep pathos.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I haven't seen that rewatch that one yet.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
When Tigger loses his stripes, he just becomes fat now.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You just called him Tiger, the shoes on the other foot now.

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What are you talking about? You made me do it. I got confused.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I got you fucking muddled me all up.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You fucked up, you fucked me up, you fucked it up.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was gonna say that when Tigger loses his stripes, he just gets fat and becomes Garfield.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But then I remembered that Garfield also has stripes.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So it doesn't make any sense.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So maybe when he loses his stripes, he becomes Tiger.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But Tigers have stripes too.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Dude, what if Garfield is also a Tigger?

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, he's just like a fat lazy Tigger who didn't see his potential.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's the only other one. They need to meet, they need to be friends.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You did it, the crossover, that's the secret.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But that can't be the only one, so they will have to kill each other.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The first episode, it's like the pilot episode of New Adventures.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I totally lost Ben.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Wait, am I there? Am I here?

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, we've got a weird connection.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The connection says it's not great, but the first pilot episode of New Adventures is very Garfield-esque.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know how John fucking brings Garfield to the beach and everywhere?

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He brings them on international vacations and it's weird.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The pilot episode, they all go to the movies and it's terrible.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What? That's weird.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Christopher Robin brings the whole gang, well not the whole gang, but half the gang to the movies

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and they all fuck around watching a Godzilla movie and Poo is eating candy bars and stuff.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And it's gross, it's gross and it's bad.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wait a minute, does the staff not notice that this kid's stuffed animals are sentient?

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Because that would cause problems, I think.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Is this diagetic snack-eating or is it non-diagetic snack-eating by the characters?

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Who knows?

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is Christopher Robin just picking up the candy and throwing it and like shit?

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You know, Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin and Hobbes takes care that any other character just sees them as the stuffed animal.

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But like Poo, I just think that the animals are never even on screen when like an adult is in there.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Like there's an usher that tells Christopher Robin like this is in the playground

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and just the characters just aren't there when that happens.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
In the new movie that came out they addressed it where it's just like

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Christopher Robin was like Poo, stop moving, you have to act like a real stuffed animal

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
because people were seeing a movie and talking and they were like

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
hey that bears fucking talking, what's happening?

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's like no Poo, you gotta be normal.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Is that the one with the Baxon?

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Were they afraid of the Baxon?

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No, they made a live-action movie recently.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Dude, forget this whole...

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is important, I'm talking about the live-action Poo movie!

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's when he's like grown up, right?

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, it's like hook.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was great, it was wonderful.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Dude, forget the whole feminism thing of how like it's like

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
women have to act a certain way, the patriarch is coming down.

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What about the literal like the nightmare existence of you have to move

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and pretend you aren't even sentient Poo and other toys like you?

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's the real civil rights per se we need to be on these days.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It was never like that though.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's the toy story thing.

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, they gave it toy story logic.

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The difference is Christopher Robin or grown up or whatever

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
is complicit in this evil...

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He's like no, no, no, we have to do it's like

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
even though I educated you my black African slave

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
we need to pretend like you can't read.

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We need to like act this way.

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It wasn't even like Christopher Robin is like

226
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
oh man, maybe I'm crazy or like...

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, he full on knew the whole time.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He was like, oh yeah, these are my like old stuffed animal friends

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
who are alive and live in a magical portal in a tree.

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I'm gonna pretend not for what?

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If this is civil rights issues, Christopher fucking Robin

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you need to defend their sentience and defend their personhood.

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And Andy on the other hand, he doesn't have that issue

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
because he doesn't know they're alive.

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But Christopher Robin does and he's culpable.

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Nate is becoming a robot for me.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Nate's becoming less sentient because he's so riled up

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
about these issues of stuffed animal sentience.

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
His Turing test results are going down and down and down.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Listen, the toys and toy story, their entire motive

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
for not wanting to be seen moving and talking about

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
so they can't be put inside the labor force.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They don't want to be put to work, plow in the fields.

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So whenever Andy comes in they have to pretend

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
like they're not sentient when obviously they are.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, Christopher Robin, he did learn a lesson in the movie

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
because they did the whole scene where Christopher Robin gets mad

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and he yells at him.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He's like, God damn it, Pooh, I'm 40 now.

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't got time for your stupid bullshit, you idiot.

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And Pooh was really sad and he went, oh, you hurt my feelings

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Christopher Robin.

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then Pooh got lost and he fell in a hole

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and he almost fucking died.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And then Christopher Robin is looking for him like, oh my god,

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I've killed Pooh.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What have I done?

260
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And so then he finds him again.

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And then they come back with the real world.

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
They don't know how to finish this point.

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is important, yeah.

264
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is my non-existent point just talking about what happened

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
in the movie where they come back in the real world

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and they all look, you know, like they look realistic,

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
like real stuff to animals.

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That was pretty fucking cool.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But, you know, they come back into the world

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and Christopher Robin has a daughter

271
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and like he's like, he's separated from his family

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
because he works too much.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I mean, it's just hook.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The movie is literally just hook.

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But then, you know, they go and they fight the fucking guy

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wait, they don't fight a guy?

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, they don't fight a guy.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But like Christopher Robin has this like shitty boss

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
who wants him to work and stuff.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And like they're talking about like woosles and stuff

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
because nobody likes a fucking woosle.

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And the movie comes up with this like really great metaphor

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
actually where it's like some humans are just woosles.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They're just like slimy, sleazy sacks of shit

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
who want everyone to be sad.

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So Christopher Robin's boss is like the biggest woosle of all.

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So they got to go and they got to tell them fuck off.

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And Christopher Robin like invents some new way to make money

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
at the grown-up money company or some shit.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't even remember.

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hell yeah.

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But then he becomes closer to his shitty family

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and they all, and he goes, hey, by the way, daughter,

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
this is my stuffed bear who is alive

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and my stuffed tigger who is not a tiger, but he's alive.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And he has to explain like stuffed animals are alive, daughter.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And his daughter just like pukes in her own mouth

298
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and like her eyes start bleeding.

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And she gets her pants.

300
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
She has a heart attack.

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
She gets like arc of the Covenant face melted in size.

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She screams.

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And so I guess whatever the fuck point I was trying to make

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
with all that shit, that's Winnie the Pooh.

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That sounds good.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I like that one.

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It was good.

308
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was great.

309
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You know, woosles aren't so bad in new adventures.

310
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There's actually like a giant woosle colossus

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that Pooh makes friends with.

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He's like a giant, he's like 50 feet tall

313
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and he's a demon.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But Pooh befriends him through generosity.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What a woosle is is so unclear because there's one woosle

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
who is literally just like an animal weasel.

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But there's this other one is like a giant stuffed beast,

318
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
like a giant stuffed humanoid like construct.

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know, man.

320
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Also the rules of imagination.

321
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
A woosle is a state of mind.

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Maybe.

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I guess it is.

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah.

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's like going hollow.

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like you go woosle.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She turned evil.

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If you're shitty enough you just become unto a woosle.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The rules of...

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's the default state of man as a matter of fact.

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The rules of how shit works is super vague.

333
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like just magical shit will happen

334
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and it's like sometimes there will be a line about imagination.

335
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Like when Eor is on the hill watching the sky,

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
watching the cloud painting,

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
it's like all it takes is a little imagination.

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But whose imagination?

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Is he psychically controlling the clouds?

340
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Wait a minute.

341
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Or is this all in Christopher Robin's imagination?

342
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Are you citing like the big one everyone remembers

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
of Eor on the hill looking up at like the Aurora Borealis type thing?

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't keep her a day.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is that actually not physically there?

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Is it imagination?

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's hard to say.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's hard to say.

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

352
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That opens up a philosophical can of worms

353
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
because if Christopher Robin has given these characters life

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
through his own imagination

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and they all have their own imaginations,

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
could they also create life?

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's a good question.

358
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And is that the origin of Kessie?

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh my God.

360
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It was that a rabbit needed something in his life

361
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
to give him meaning and to grow as a person.

362
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So he imagined that which was necessary to him.

363
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes.

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Kessie is rabbit's poo.

365
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh my God.

366
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's true.

367
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then Kessie abandons him.

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, because you know what I mean.

369
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's like if poo grew up

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and was like Christopher Robin,

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't need you anymore.

372
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm going south for the winter.

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll see you, never idiot.

374
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It finally evolves into Baron the Big Blue House.

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Welcome to the Woody the Pooh Theory podcast.

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's a lot to go through.

377
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Did you grow up with Russian poo bear?

378
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sorta, yeah.

379
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I have like one of the original Winnie the Pooh books.

380
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

381
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But I never read it.

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Have you guys ever seen Russian poo bear?

383
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No.

384
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No.

385
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's a little weird.

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's a little uncanny.

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It is a bit.

388
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah.

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You know what?

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll link it.

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll go find Russian poo bear.

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Pooh bear was an asshole, a bit of an asshole.

393
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What?

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He's kind of an asshole in the other.

395
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like he's kind of a selfish idiot a lot of the time.

396
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, he's just dumb.

397
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Not all the time, but sometimes.

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He comes off as kind of a dick.

399
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He's not super smart.

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So he just gets himself in situations where he needs help.

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like when there's one where his friends aren't home,

402
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
they're off in the land of milk and honey in the jungle,

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
which may or may not be imaginary.

404
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Who knows?

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Right.

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And he just like breaks into their houses,

407
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
like rummages for honey.

408
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then when he finds none,

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
he assumes that like a honey napper is out

410
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and like about, but like, yeah,

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
he just breaks into his house to eat their food.

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I just looked up Russian poo to see what he looks like.

413
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He looks like an actual poo.

414
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't like it.

415
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, look an actual poo.

416
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He looks like a Tanuki is what he looks like.

417
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He's round and he's brown and he's like smeary and smudgy.

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Down to clown.

419
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He's round and he's brown and he's down to clown.

420
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, this is interesting.

421
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, Eeyore looks weird.

422
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Eeyore looks weird.

423
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Eeyore looks fucking weird.

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Look at all this.

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is interesting.

426
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There we go.

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Anyway, also Tom is here in Mage.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This has been a great episode of the PCP,

429
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the poo conspiracies podcast.

430
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The poo see poo?

431
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No, no, the PC poo.

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Whatever, fuck it.

433
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If the procrastinators poo cast.

434
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's the one.

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, I mean, it was known as the poop procrastinators.

436
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Wait, no, never mind.

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I cut all of this the whole thing.

438
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, wait, no, the poop procrastinators.

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I coined a great neologism in my video.

440
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I refer to the rules of the poo universe.

441
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, yes, good.

442
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah, I want that one to really stick in the poo fandom.

443
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Wow, this was a great warm up, guys.

444
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Can we just start the actual show?

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That was the actual show.

446
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Voice mail's coming up.

447
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Here we go, everybody.

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So anybody, let's go.

449
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Anybody got something they want to talk about?

450
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
All right.

451
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I got to just mention it just so that's done,

452
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
because there's so many people here.

453
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's going to be hard to wrestle it in later.

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm currently doing a thing with the 2019.

455
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I initially was like, I'm not going to do a New Year's resolution.

456
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's dumb.

457
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But then I found myself, one day,

458
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
watching a series of extremely detailed analysis videos

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
about a guy's video about Dark Souls 2,

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
which took all day to watch.

461
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It was like 11 hours in total.

462
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
These were the ATB Armour Guy videos.

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The response to them.

464
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah, the response to HB Armour Guy's video on Dark Souls 2.

465
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And it was good, but I hated myself after I woke up.

466
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Watched all of it and didn't do anything.

467
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And from that day forth, I decided,

468
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
no more YouTube.

469
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It sucks.

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I hate it.

471
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So I've started the YouTube challenge,

472
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
hashtag YouTube challenge,

473
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
where I will not watch YouTube if I can avoid it

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
for the entire of the year.

475
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And so far, I've watched three videos.

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And that's my story.

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm doing a lot to increase productivity.

478
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I got a harsh bedtime at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m.

479
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I've been going to bed at 1 a.m. every day.

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And I'm starting to wake up earlier and it's like,

481
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you know, I can do stuff like this.

482
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I can live my life as a real human being.

483
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can make stiff.

484
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's fucking cool.

485
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, I've got a bedtime and I'm limiting gaming

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to two hours per day maximum.

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's the worst thing of all,

488
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
because now I can't play Minecraft with you, Mage,

489
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
for an entire day.

490
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I got to stop after two hours and then go to bed

491
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and get my warm milk and be fresh and ready to,

492
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
you know, do whatever I'm doing.

493
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And it's so far, like, one week in,

494
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
one week and a few days,

495
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
because I started just before the end of the year.

496
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's good.

497
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I would recommend,

498
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I would recommend at least the YouTube challenge,

499
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
mostly because I do get cravings for videos

500
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and it's only the ones I really want to watch

501
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that I end up watching because there's this thing

502
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
hanging over my head of,

503
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
okay, you can't.

504
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You baseline cannot watch YouTube,

505
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
but when I got to watch a YouTube video,

506
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you know, the longing is like, has to be really big,

507
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
so I only watch the videos that I actually really enjoy.

508
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
They're usually ones I've already seen.

509
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Like, I've done a video that made me very important.

510
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Huh?

511
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, I mean, yeah.

512
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, the Delta Room, right.

513
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Have you guys seen Liga's show notes?

514
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Delta Room, Susie in the Well Christmas Animation,

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Belly Inflation, Fetish, Lesbian, Intermingling.

516
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Nah, dude, it's not inflation.

517
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's weight gain.

518
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There's a difference.

519
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There's a distinct difference.

520
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

521
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Totally took two completely different ballparks.

522
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, they gotta, they know what's up.

523
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They know it.

524
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But let me ask you something.

525
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes.

526
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Surely, there are websites.

527
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's social media places that occupy more of your time

528
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
than YouTube.

529
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Like, for instance, Twitter.

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Twitter occupies a lot of my time.

531
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The thing is, it wouldn't be one or the other.

532
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It would be, I would, I would wake up and I'd be like,

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
ah, I gotta do some work today,

534
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
but I'll just watch a video for a bit.

535
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah.

536
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And then, once you're watching a video,

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you're like, well, this one in the sidebar looks good,

538
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
or there's another, like, there's more videos

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
that have been uploaded since I went to bed.

540
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
New subscriber videos.

541
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Like, I better catch up on all of these before I start.

542
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So, you know, clear the pilot.

543
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It never ends up being a good idea.

544
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I end up playing video games and listening to YouTube videos.

545
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And it's just, it's very, very difficult to stop.

546
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Twitter occupies a little bit of my time.

547
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't follow a lot of people.

548
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I only really go to Twitter when I want to say something.

549
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And then I go, you know, check replies to various things

550
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and leave.

551
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I guess Discord takes up a lot of my time,

552
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
but I've muted basically every chat I'm in

553
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and I've left a few, so it's not as much as it was.

554
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So, like, I feel like it's just, you know,

555
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
you cut what you can.

556
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You cut what you think is the least important.

557
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't like cutting out YouTube entirely,

558
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but it is helping.

559
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah.

560
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I've been less active on Twitter.

561
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I've been very inactive on Discord,

562
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
which is a source of great guilt and shame for me.

563
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I have been...

564
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
See, I don't like pop onto YouTube to be like,

565
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
oh, I'll just watch a video.

566
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I usually go to YouTube to put something on for background noise.

567
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And then...

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

569
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Which is a noble goal.

570
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I was like, oh, I'll put just a video on in the background

571
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
while I'm working.

572
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And the problem is that then while working,

573
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
if I feel like procrastinating,

574
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
then I'll just switch mental gears to actually watching the video

575
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
instead of doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

576
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So...

577
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Word.

578
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah, it's bad.

579
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's also bad.

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It has the same net effect as just not doing anything

581
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and just watching videos in the first place.

582
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
There's like this...

583
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sad times.

584
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What would you say is the main goal of this?

585
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Is it just the obvious you want to spend more time working

586
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
or do you feel like it's negatively impacted you

587
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and in the other way?

588
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's not so far negatively impacted me at all

589
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
because I found for a long time,

590
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
especially December of last year,

591
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I would just stay up at night in bed with my phone,

592
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
watching YouTube videos,

593
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and then go into bed really late.

594
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And I guess the main point is just to cut it out

595
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because a lot of the time I don't feel like the time I spent

596
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
or the minutes watched is equatable to enjoyment levels.

597
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Like I have a lot more fun talking to people on Discord

598
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
than I do watching a video.

599
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's more fun to just meme about stuff

600
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and hear about videos and like,

601
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
lol, what the fuck is this?

602
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I like doing that too.

603
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Two hours is enough to save me.

604
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's enough to save me and if you do it every day

605
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that's still quite a lot of gaming you're doing.

606
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Let me throw out a proposition.

607
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I include myself in this as well.

608
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Tell me if any of you disagree with this about yourself.

609
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I feel that we're all way too lazy

610
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and don't do enough work or put enough effort in our lives,

611
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
including me.

612
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
100%.

613
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What is your response?

614
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
My goal in life is to be more lazy as lazy as possible.

615
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I want to be a bum.

616
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I want zero responsibilities.

617
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I want no one depending on me.

618
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I want nobody looking forward to anything I do.

619
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I want nobody expecting anything of me.

620
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I just want to, my dream in life is to exist

621
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and be completely alone

622
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and just fucking do nothing.

623
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I want to do nothing.

624
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I want to lay in bed

625
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and fucking and watch the WWE Network

626
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
all day for the rest of my life.

627
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We got to do a remake of Office Space

628
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
but instead of being an office cubicle worker,

629
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
he's a YouTuber.

630
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Ooh, not a bad idea.

631
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's my actual life.

632
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
That's how it is.

633
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I agree, Nate.

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I also don't do enough

635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and I don't think I could ever do enough

636
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
because even on the days that I do accomplish a bunch,

637
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I still go to bed being like,

638
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
oh, I didn't do enough.

639
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I didn't get anything done.

640
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And then on the days that I actually didn't get anything done,

641
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
it's pretty much the same.

642
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's slightly worse.

643
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, let me rephrase that then.

644
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I guess what I meant is that I want,

645
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I need to, I want to work harder

646
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
at everything in life that is not this.

647
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Like, because accomplishing anything on YouTube

648
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
feels worse than accomplishing nothing.

649
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Well, it doesn't have to be YouTube.

650
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's fine. That's fine.

651
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Like, I want to work hard on things like,

652
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
like putting a resume together

653
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and going to the dentist

654
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and other stuff that like actual humans do.

655
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I do need to do that.

656
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Totally human core.

657
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Making a resume is very human core.

658
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's the most human thing I can think of.

659
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Nate, I would completely agree with you.

660
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I would still pretty much agree with you currently.

661
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
However, I don't want to get too much on with this

662
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
because it could be its own tangent now.

663
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But everything's arriving here in Boston, right?

664
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Leave my fifth or sixth trip here.

665
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I started up commissions and basically,

666
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I felt like a fucking god doing these commissions.

667
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Where I'll pretty much like,

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll either be doing commissions while I'm home

669
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
for an extended period of time.

670
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yesterday, I went out for a little bit into the world,

671
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
which feels productive,

672
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
even if you're just like fucking around outside,

673
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you're not really doing anything really.

674
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Going outside is an activity onto itself.

675
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You're being exercised, you're going out,

676
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
you're seeing other people.

677
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You're riding the subway,

678
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
which increases your culture by like 20 points

679
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
every single time you buy a ticket,

680
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
which is actually true.

681
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So I'm just doing that.

682
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And then I came home.

683
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I just worked on commissions all day.

684
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then I went out and I had dinner and it was lovely.

685
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That's a highly productive day.

686
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Sounds like a great day.

687
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You know, of social interaction,

688
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
as well as like actual working,

689
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm getting things done for monetary benefit

690
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and to hide in my chi energy.

691
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I mean, that sounds like a balanced day

692
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
of getting that social interaction,

693
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
like earning a living and stuff,

694
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
working towards your career type stuff.

695
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And also like the meal or whatever,

696
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
like relaxing and having a good day.

697
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Because I think it's important

698
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that people kind of challenge themselves every day,

699
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
at least a little bit,

700
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
to feel that like good,

701
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
like, ah, I worked out mentally or otherwise today

702
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and I am improving on this day

703
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and not getting worse or whatever.

704
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's like straight cougar says, you know,

705
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
there's no need to rush through breakfast.

706
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Breakfast is meant to be enjoyed.

707
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It leisurely pays.

708
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
The rest of that?

709
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah, the rest of everything else,

710
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
he's turning his car into a pink magic car

711
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and being like, ah, I fucking,

712
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I did it in a million miles an hour last time,

713
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
but this time I did it at a million miles and one.

714
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I've shortened the world, but only breakfast.

715
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Straight cougar is the only memorable character from Skryad.

716
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Mostly.

717
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Here is a little life hack for you,

718
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
which works for me more than you would think.

719
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Is schedule more social interactions?

720
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This will help you work, I find.

721
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
People resist that.

722
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
People resist that.

723
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They don't like having their life in a box.

724
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But when you have, for instance,

725
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in two days from now,

726
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I will be meeting an RFCK fan in real life

727
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and we have scheduled this interaction.

728
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I know what I'm going to meet him

729
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and I know when he will leave.

730
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And because I know that there's no way...

731
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And I look forward to that moment, especially.

732
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
There's no way I'll be able to be working

733
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
while I'm with him.

734
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We're going to be out on the town.

735
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That gives me the time, like,

736
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
okay, I'm going to be losing like four hours there.

737
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Unacceptable.

738
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have to work now so that I know

739
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I can, like, rest easy that day

740
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
knowing that I haven't wasted that time.

741
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So that entire day up to that point

742
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
before I meet him,

743
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm just going to be working really hard

744
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
or, you know, the night before or after he leaves

745
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
to make sure that I can reclaim that day.

746
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So it's nice to be able to know ahead of time

747
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
what time you're going to be spending.

748
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This goes to, like, work and, you know,

749
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
like scheduling podcasts or social interactions.

750
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Anything.

751
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Having a calendar is very important

752
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
so you can manage your time effectively.

753
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I feel like I'm...

754
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I mean, that doesn't really work for me.

755
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I don't know why.

756
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I feel like it's leading up to an event

757
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
where I have to be ready.

758
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I don't want to be, like, in the middle of something

759
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
when I have to leave.

760
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is, like, if this is happening on the same day.

761
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But, like, days before,

762
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I would generally, like,

763
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
try not to start any big projects

764
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
or work on any big projects.

765
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I would do smaller things,

766
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
leading up to an event that I knew was coming.

767
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And then once the event is over,

768
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I feel like I can start work on something big

769
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that would require me to stay inside

770
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and work really, really hard for a long time.

771
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm kind of the same, but maybe worse.

772
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Like, for example, I remember, like,

773
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
leading up to, you know, Christmas,

774
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
because I knew I was going to go visit the fam

775
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
for, like, two days or whatever,

776
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
like, a day and a half.

777
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And, like, the entire...

778
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like, two whole days before that happened,

779
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I wasn't getting anything done

780
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
because I was kind of just sort of milling about, like,

781
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
oh, no, I'm gonna have to...

782
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I gotta spend, like, a day and a half away from my computer.

783
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I won't get anything done.

784
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And then that anxiety, like, made me

785
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
not do anything for, like,

786
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
longer than I was even away.

787
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It was a nightmare.

788
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It was totally wrong-headed

789
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and pathological and bad.

790
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What do you mean by an event, Hippo?

791
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What would you describe an event as?

792
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Well, I mean, I'm not a very social person.

793
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't get outside much.

794
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So an event is, like, a social interaction

795
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
usually outside the house.

796
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, okay.

797
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If somebody comes over, then it's, like, whatever.

798
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But, like, going to a party,

799
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
going to a thing, going to meet someone,

800
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
yeah, any other thing of that nature.

801
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I guess it's mostly just social events.

802
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Also, there's, like, times like this Christmas

803
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
my parents bought tickets to a comedy show.

804
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And so that was, like, an event of the holiday.

805
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So I had to know that that day we were going.

806
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But that's easier because I can just easily just...

807
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, I don't know why it feels different

808
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because it's still a day out

809
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and you're still away from work.

810
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But it's more of, like...

811
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, I don't know.

812
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't know why that feels different

813
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
because it is exactly the same thing.

814
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I empathize with the idea.

815
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
When I'm back home, going out at all,

816
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
just, you know, to hang out with my friends

817
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
or just leaving the house to go for a walk.

818
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That does feel like an event for me

819
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
because I very rarely do it.

820
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But I really am thankful with the fact

821
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
that staying here in Boston,

822
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I am staying in a place with such great city access

823
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
where the city access is I walk outside

824
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and I'm in the city.

825
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So that has, like, 10...

826
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, that and Pokemon Go

827
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
has tenfold increased my, like, willingness

828
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to just, like, go outside

829
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and interact with the world.

830
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
There are times where I'll just walk around

831
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
just to have fun,

832
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
which is something I would never do when I'm back home.

833
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I would never even, like, thank for a second

834
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
to, instead of checking Twitter

835
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
or watching YouTube videos,

836
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
just go out and maybe walk in a park or something.

837
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I think, I mean, I think we can all agree

838
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
that that's a more useful, you know,

839
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
spending my time

840
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
going outside and walking, exercising.

841
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
One of the best things about, like,

842
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
the thing I'm doing is, you know,

843
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
it's not cutting out procrastination entirely.

844
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm not tirelessly working every second

845
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that I'm not watching a YouTube video.

846
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But I am doing more things

847
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that are, like, better things to do

848
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
when procrastinating,

849
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
such as doing the laundry, cleaning the room,

850
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
you know, doing things,

851
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
doing chores that need to be done anyway.

852
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And then also reading books.

853
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm reading books because I can't go on the Internet really.

854
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm like, ah, God, I want to play a game,

855
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but I've done my two hours gaming

856
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and I can't watch a YouTube video

857
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and I don't want to work on this thing.

858
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll just pick up a fucking Isaac Asimov

859
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and read that. I've wanted to read that for a while.

860
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You should really, like, choose your own adventure books.

861
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's kind of like playing a game.

862
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I do have one of those. Those are cool.

863
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But yeah, it's like...

864
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Any books you want to recommend?

865
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Uh...

866
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Do you want to link to your Audible?

867
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Link to your Audible?

868
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
If you like, if you like, um,

869
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
adventure-y, cool shit,

870
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the His Dark Materials trilogy,

871
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
uh, starting with, uh,

872
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I think the Northern Lights.

873
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It got turned into a movie called The Golden Compass.

874
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah. The movie, I don't think, was very good,

875
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
but the books are like, um, Harry Potter levels of...

876
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Harry Potter slash Lord of the Rings levels of cool,

877
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to me. They're like the...

878
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
like the... they're good.

879
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Have you read the last one? Have you read the whole series?

880
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I did. I read the whole series one summer

881
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
when I was like 12.

882
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, I read it when I was like in high school or something.

883
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And, uh, man, I don't know.

884
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The end of that series gets so far up its own ass.

885
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It is, like, so preachy and like...

886
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, maybe.

887
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So it's like...

888
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Like, you read that story when you're a nascent,

889
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
fedora-tipping atheist.

890
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because, like, in the end, they go and they kill God.

891
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And God is fake anyway, but they kill him anyway.

892
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah, it was pretty sick.

893
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And then they're like, man, the afterlife sucks and is stupid.

894
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's open a portal to, like, end the afterlife.

895
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So no one has to suffer through that hell that is life after death.

896
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, actually, I haven't re-read it. Maybe it's not that good.

897
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But, like, um...

898
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I haven't re-read it either. I just remember being like, wow.

899
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I guess I was younger when I read it, and I was like,

900
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
oh, my God, this is the first story I've ever read.

901
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah.

902
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And it's cool.

903
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Um, the...

904
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The first... the first book, Golden Compass,

905
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
is very, like, Harry Potter kind of, like, you know, alternate world,

906
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
like, you know, adventure and magic and stuff.

907
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And then, like, in two and three, especially three,

908
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the scope sort of expands out to this, like, interdimensional war,

909
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and it gets very, like, abstract and preachy and stuff.

910
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Also, teenage romance, which, you know, I enjoy.

911
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, we all do.

912
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Of course, of course.

913
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
To go back to what Hippo was saying before,

914
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
before we got on Harry Potter 2,

915
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I very, very much empathize with your wanting to limit YouTube time.

916
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I've been on a pretty similar kick.

917
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Not kick the messaging app to sex children.

918
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
No, stop thinking about kick the sexting app.

919
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm talking about kick, like, with my leg.

920
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Anyway, I've been on a big yearly theme kick

921
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
after listening to some great episodes of the podcast Cortex.

922
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't know if you're a fan of that Hippo,

923
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I know you're a fan of Hello Internet,

924
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't know if you watch it.

925
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I haven't listened to that.

926
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Very good, very good.

927
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Anyway, they are a big proponent of yearly themes as opposed to resolutions.

928
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And I've gotten very big on this because I've always been thinking

929
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
for the past couple months about this general idea

930
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
of wanting to limit social media in the particular way that I use it.

931
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And so this idea of the yearly theme has given me not the confidence,

932
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but more like, it's easier to get behind ideas

933
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
when you can clearly articulate them, you know?

934
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's better, you're more willing to push forward a plan

935
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
if you can clearly identify the actual actions you're going to be taking

936
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
to do said plan, as opposed to just think about it in the general.

937
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So I am not really someone who wants to outright ban YouTube,

938
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
like how you would want to, or outright ban Twitter.

939
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But I think the problem with Twitter that I have,

940
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and with YouTube and all other social media,

941
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
is that I use it in the exact same way every single day.

942
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And it just gets boring and doesn't, you know, help me in any way.

943
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Using Twitter to find what your friends are doing,

944
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
or using YouTube to watch a YouTube video that you really want to,

945
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
those are things that I feel like impact you in a positive way.

946
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But once you just, like, watch YouTube for six hours a day,

947
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
or check Twitter when you're outside having dinner,

948
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you should check Twitter over and over again,

949
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
there's no real reason for that.

950
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You're not getting actually anything out of it.

951
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's just you become addicted to it.

952
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So I just want to use...

953
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If you're following some Dank meme Twitter accounts

954
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and you just want to be on the uptake.

955
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Yeah, that's it.

956
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What about that?

957
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Dank memes are bad.

958
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Whoa!

959
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
My whole idea this year,

960
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm going to be trying doing more with my life in many ways.

961
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But in regards to this conversation,

962
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I want to use social media

963
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
to not just solidify the connections I have

964
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and just, you know, follow you guys and a few select others.

965
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I don't know if you know this, but I have something like 60 people I'm following,

966
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
where everyone else I know has, like,

967
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
easily over 100 to 200.

968
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I have a very, very small selection of people I'm talking to,

969
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
just even outside of Twitter, on Discord,

970
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
or in any social interaction.

971
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I have 56, I win.

972
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Just letting you know that. Okay, move on.

973
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Okay, that's cool.

974
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I hate Wendy's. Wendy's is fucking garbage.

975
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
No one should eat it.

976
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's the new topic for now.

977
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Please go on. I'm listening.

978
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I mean, I guess that's it. That's all I had to say.

979
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
What led you to this conclusion, at least recently?

980
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You had a baked potato.

981
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Alright, look.

982
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
At a certain point in my mid-20s,

983
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
like maybe 26, 27,

984
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't know when exactly it happened,

985
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
but at a certain point,

986
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
my body decided that it can no longer eat the spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's.

987
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I just can't do it anymore.

988
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If I eat one, I get, like, my stomach turns into, like, fire,

989
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and I poop, but, like, the bad kind of poop.

990
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Not the fun kind of poop.

991
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Like, hot fire in my pants.

992
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like, fire ants in my stomach,

993
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
creating a colony and then shooting out of my ass with their poison,

994
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and they're flaming, like, starship trooper bugs

995
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that shoot the fucking fire and acid out of their faces.

996
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That's the inside of my butthole and my tummy,

997
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
now that I'm, like, old, I guess.

998
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That's what happens when you get older.

999
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You just can't do, you can't eat the spicy chicken sandwich anymore.

1000
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So, like, it's the only thing that happens when you get old.

1001
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Everything else is the same.

1002
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That's second puberty.

1003
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You can't eat the spicy chicken sandwich.

1004
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I mean, I was, I wasn't, I don't know,

1005
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I was existentially horrified to realize, similarly, one day,

1006
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
that just eating candy, specifically chocolate, hurts my teeth now.

1007
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Dude, dude, you two, yeah, me too, chocolate.

1008
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't know what the fuck that is, but it happens every time now.

1009
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
There's, there's, like, one spot in my mouth

1010
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
that just hurts when I eat chocolate.

1011
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's, like, all my teeth, I don't know.

1012
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Unless I'm really careful not to get it in my teeth.

1013
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's weird.

1014
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Well, like, I can't eat the spicy chicken sandwich anymore.

1015
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So, I, you know, it took me, like, years to come to terms with that.

1016
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I didn't want to let it go.

1017
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So, like, I kept eating it.

1018
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I ate through the pain.

1019
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I, I kept, because, you know, it's, it's my favorite sandwich in Wendy's.

1020
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's what I eat when I go to Wendy's.

1021
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't want nothing else.

1022
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So, I, you know, but I finally came to terms with it and I, and I said,

1023
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
you know what, I'm not getting any younger.

1024
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm going to have to come up with something else to order at Wendy's from now on.

1025
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So, I perused the menu and I experimented and I, you know, I said,

1026
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
well, maybe I'll get fries today, or maybe I'll get nuggies,

1027
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
or maybe I'll get, you know, this is a regular burger that's not made of chicken,

1028
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
like it made out of burger, and, or maybe I'll get, you know, like a,

1029
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
like a single burger, or a baby burger, or a double burger.

1030
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Look at that damn baked potato.

1031
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
What are you talking about?

1032
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
There's no baked potato at fast food?

1033
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Is there?

1034
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yeah, Wendy's is.

1035
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1036
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, Wendy's, you can get a baked potato at Wendy's.

1037
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Well, that's, maybe I'll do that, but that's not part of the story.

1038
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's pretty, it's pretty okay.

1039
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It'll give you a big nut sack full of sour cream that comes with it,

1040
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and you just squeeze that shit on there.

1041
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's great.

1042
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's so nice.

1043
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
How's that for a visual, ladies and gentlemen?

1044
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I got, I got a nut sack full of sour cream for you.

1045
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Too obvious.

1046
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So I tried all the different foods.

1047
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I went, I went like 90% of the way to that joke.

1048
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You just did that little tiny, all right.

1049
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah.

1050
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And I, and I took all the glory.

1051
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I kill, I stole your kill.

1052
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I guess that's true.

1053
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So I tried all the different foods at Wendy's only to realize,

1054
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
after much experimentation,

1055
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
everything at Wendy's is garbage except the spicy chicken sandwich.

1056
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Everything else on the menu is pig vomit, dog shit, asshole,

1057
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
poopy food, and it's all bad.

1058
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Like Wendy's is just bad.

1059
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And the fucking, the smug Wendy's Twitter account,

1060
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
who thinks it's so fucking cool,

1061
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
some fucking 20 year old whose job it is to roast people

1062
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
from behind the veneer of this corporate fucking mascot,

1063
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
which is fucking sick and weird and creepy anyways.

1064
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But you know, they're so smug about it.

1065
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Like, oh, we're Wendy's.

1066
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
We're the best fucking place.

1067
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And we can just roast everybody else.

1068
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
No, you're not cool Wendy's.

1069
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You fucking suck.

1070
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
All of your food is fucking dog shit.

1071
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Wendy's burgers are, the beef is pretty good,

1072
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
but like they're sort of just like a loose kind of mess

1073
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
of like tasteless vegetables.

1074
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I don't know.

1075
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But Wendy's burgers are not frozen and square.

1076
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They're for quality.

1077
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The episode that me and Hippo can't participate.

1078
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Unless, is there a Wendy's in the UK?

1079
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Uh, no.

1080
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Wendy was banned like Lauren Southern from the UK.

1081
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
When I was in the US, I have had a Wendy.

1082
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh, how was it?

1083
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
By far the worst burger is Burger King.

1084
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Burger King burgers are actually disgusting.

1085
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh yeah, Burger King is hideous.

1086
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
No, no.

1087
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
They have, they have like, they have some kind of weird

1088
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
like smoky, like chemical mixed into the beef.

1089
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's fucked.

1090
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's nasty.

1091
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah, I made it.

1092
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Maybe in the, maybe in the US, but in the UK,

1093
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
at least the Burger Humania where I live is really good burgers

1094
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and they have like the best milkshake.

1095
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It could be different out there.

1096
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, like I know that like fast food is bad for you,

1097
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
but like Burger King tastes bad for you.

1098
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Like it tastes, like you said,

1099
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
it's got that weird smoky mutated taste.

1100
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It tastes like a fucking, like someone grilled up

1101
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
a living Dalek on a fucking bun.

1102
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It tastes like a weird chemical soup.

1103
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Uh, that's, it's, it's, it's bizarre.

1104
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It's bizarre.

1105
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't know why there's not more outrage about it.

1106
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm pretty sensitive to those sort of things.

1107
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So I don't think the Burger King near me has that.

1108
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Fair enough.

1109
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm saying people shit on McDonald's,

1110
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
but I think I would much rather eat a McDonald's burger

1111
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
than a Burger King burger.

1112
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, like, you know, McDonald's like takes the brunt

1113
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
because it's like the, the, the number one in everyone's mind

1114
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
to like make fun of fast food.

1115
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But like McDonald's is like actually good.

1116
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I like McDonald's burgers.

1117
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Really?

1118
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
They're not too bad.

1119
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
They're not too bad.

1120
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
No, they're not too bad.

1121
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I, I prefer Burger King to McDonald's as,

1122
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
as disgusting as it may be to admit that publicly.

1123
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Why?

1124
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Why though?

1125
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I guess I just prefer the, the, the, the grill

1126
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
instead of the fucking flat top that they do at Burger King.

1127
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But do you, do you acknowledge the weird smoky chemical taste?

1128
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I mean, to be fair, I haven't had Burger King,

1129
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
you know, in a hot minute.

1130
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So perhaps, perhaps modern Burger King has infused

1131
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
their, their burgers with more bullshit.

1132
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
But in my youth, there was a Burger King in a,

1133
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
in a McDonald's right next to each other.

1134
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And I would always want to go to Burger King

1135
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
because I just found the fries to be way better.

1136
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And, and the burgers would be better too.

1137
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Well, you know, the real advantage is that Burger King

1138
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
has onion rings and you know, McDonald's doesn't.

1139
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's a good point.

1140
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That right there was the deal breaker.

1141
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah.

1142
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Burger King wigs.

1143
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I like onion rings on a burger.

1144
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Me too, so you got to get your ass over to Burger King,

1145
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
which I guess you do.

1146
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The only thing Burger King ever did

1147
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
that was really courageous and brave

1148
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
was giving the world its first video game

1149
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
where you play as a rapist.

1150
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's something that only Burger King had the balls to do.

1151
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm sorry.

1152
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Can you elaborate, please?

1153
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Well, sneaking is like you literally just sneak around

1154
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
and you jump out of garbage cans and rape people.

1155
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'd argue that the first video game where you played

1156
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
as just any male is where you,

1157
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
because all men are rapists, so you know.

1158
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Got them.

1159
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Have you ever tried like breakfast wrap at McDonald's?

1160
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Do they have that in the Americas?

1161
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, they have that.

1162
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's my favorite.

1163
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's okay.

1164
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't like the sauces they use,

1165
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
so I always ask without sauce,

1166
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and then I just use their barbecue sauce,

1167
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
because they don't offer that,

1168
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
but their barbecue sauce is really good, so.

1169
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I always think McDonald's breakfast eggs

1170
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
are kind of tasteless.

1171
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Guys, I'm so bored.

1172
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm so bored, and I've got something.

1173
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I've got to say, I've got to get off my chest here.

1174
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Before you do that,

1175
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I thought of an actually good book recommendation

1176
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
that Munchie might like,

1177
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
because it's like thoroughly researched historical fiction.

1178
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah?

1179
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Wait, what?

1180
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, wait, that actually doesn't make sense.

1181
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1182
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Bernard Cornwell's trilogy, starting with Harlequin,

1183
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
it's a medieval fiction book,

1184
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
but it takes place in events that happened in England.

1185
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Could you show the author name again?

1186
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Bernard Cornwell, I'll type it.

1187
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Now that's an English name, if ever I heard one.

1188
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, it is.

1189
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You know what, books are very fucking good.

1190
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I used to know Bernard.

1191
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Hey, hippo.

1192
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Shit.

1193
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
When we're together in July,

1194
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I want to watch a BBC historical fiction series with you

1195
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
called I, Claudius.

1196
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Would you like to do it?

1197
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah, why not?

1198
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Sick.

1199
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's six episodes.

1200
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What are you saying, Jesse?

1201
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What books do you like?

1202
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh, these books that I like,

1203
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
that people don't talk about as much.

1204
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I mean, everyone, I think, knows about them,

1205
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
but they don't get talked about,

1206
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
because only the first one got a movie.

1207
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's like all the other Hitchhikers' guide to the galaxy books

1208
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
that came after the first one.

1209
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh, I've been...

1210
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, the whole The Five Book Trilogy?

1211
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yeah.

1212
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I read those so much as a kid.

1213
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
For years, I've been meaning to reread them.

1214
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And they just get like...

1215
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Everyone knows the story of the first one,

1216
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
because they made a movie about it

1217
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and there was a series about it

1218
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
in the 80s on the BBC.

1219
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
We talked greatly last episode, I think,

1220
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
because I mentioned Dirk Gently.

1221
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah, you did.

1222
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But the ones after the first book,

1223
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
where it just gets weirder and more obtuse

1224
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and more and more depressing with each book,

1225
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
the fourth one is really kind of somber.

1226
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, the fourth book is kind of a bummer.

1227
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Arthur ends up on Earth again,

1228
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and everything's normal, nothing even happened,

1229
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and he meets this girl and he falls in love,

1230
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and they learn how to fly together,

1231
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
and the whole book is just this romance,

1232
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
this really sincere romance of him falling in love

1233
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
with this girlfriend church.

1234
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And then at the end of the book,

1235
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
he gets zapped back to space,

1236
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and the whole thing didn't happen.

1237
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
She's gone, she's just dead,

1238
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
she doesn't exist anymore.

1239
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
He goes back to his own reality

1240
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
where the Earth was destroyed or something.

1241
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The whole book is just this,

1242
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
him falling in love just so at the end

1243
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
it can all be taken away completely irreverently

1244
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
with no sense of even that this is sad.

1245
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's like, hey, you're fucked, it's over.

1246
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And then in the fifth book,

1247
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
he has a daughter,

1248
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
but the daughter is fucking crazy

1249
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
because she thinks she doesn't fit anywhere

1250
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
because she was born in space or some stupid shit.

1251
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But she's like, I don't know,

1252
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
like the fifth book just ends

1253
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
with everybody on Earth

1254
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and the Earth blows up again,

1255
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
and everyone's just dead,

1256
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and that's how he ended the entire series.

1257
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And then they gave it to some younger guy

1258
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
to finish it, a new author,

1259
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and he made a new book that wasn't good,

1260
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
but the way that there...

1261
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
There actually is a continuation, does it?

1262
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
No, no, no, the fifth book's the last book

1263
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
in the Hitchhiker's trilogy,

1264
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
but there were other books in other series.

1265
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It was implied that Douglas Adams wanted to write another book

1266
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
after the fifth one, but he didn't get to because he died.

1267
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Really?

1268
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah, so that was the last book,

1269
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
but then 20 years later,

1270
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
they gave it to the guy who wrote the Artemis Foul books,

1271
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
and they said,

1272
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
make a new Hitchhiker's guide to the...

1273
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So they gave him an official continuation

1274
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
to write a new Hitchhiker's book and wrap it up,

1275
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and the one that he wrote,

1276
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I mean, you could tell...

1277
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Is it good?

1278
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
No, you could tell very clearly

1279
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
that it's another writer trying to sound like Douglas Adams

1280
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
on every page,

1281
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
and you realize very quickly that it can't be replicated,

1282
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and I was almost happier

1283
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
when the series ended with everyone dying

1284
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
than them getting to come back to life,

1285
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
but now it's a bad book.

1286
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I think we have to say that the fifth book is the true ending.

1287
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Let me just...

1288
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I remember when I was young,

1289
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Ben and his boys were big into it,

1290
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and as his younger brother,

1291
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I followed suit and read them all as well

1292
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and quite enjoyed them,

1293
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and I remember getting to the last book,

1294
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I definitely was too young to really appreciate it at the time,

1295
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
but there's the whole metaphor...

1296
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Mom gave me that book when I was 12.

1297
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
She gave me the first Hitchhiker's guidebook

1298
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
when I was a little baby,

1299
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
way too young for it.

1300
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah, maybe it kind of helps.

1301
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Given a challenging...

1302
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's not that hard to read,

1303
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
but the themes presented are fairly adult.

1304
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
The theme of the original story is

1305
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
there's an interstate trying to get rid of Arthur's house,

1306
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and then I forget when this...

1307
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
This might be in the first book, this happens,

1308
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
but they're trying to build a space intersection

1309
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
through their first chapters.

1310
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That's the very first chapter.

1311
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Right, okay.

1312
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah, that's the very, very beginning.

1313
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I think that happens in the beginning,

1314
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
but ultimately, it ends where...

1315
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I remember there's a time loop

1316
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
or alternate dimension or whatever,

1317
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
and that finally does happen.

1318
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I think Arthur gets killed in the process of that.

1319
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And I remember the last scene

1320
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
just being whatever corporate fat cat it was

1321
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
who instigated that to make it up,

1322
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
just looking down and being proud of his work

1323
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and is like,

1324
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
well, there's my interstate,

1325
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
time to move on to make another one elsewhere

1326
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and destroy these other worlds.

1327
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And it's a very somber, sad ending,

1328
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
but it felt like a message about...

1329
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I guess kind of corporate tyranny

1330
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
or about the suppression of individuality

1331
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
for the group benefit or something.

1332
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Those books, obviously, they are absurdist comedies,

1333
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and that's what they're famous for being,

1334
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
but they had a very dark profundity to them

1335
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
throughout the whole series.

1336
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
The part that I remember the most in the third book,

1337
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I think, was they go to a planet

1338
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
and they see an actual message from God,

1339
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
the last message that God gave to his creation.

1340
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Damn, I don't remember that.

1341
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And the message is written in these gigantic, burning letters

1342
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
on the side of a hill or something,

1343
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and the message from God, it simply says,

1344
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
we apologize for the inconvenience.

1345
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's like profound.

1346
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Like, if that were the actual real message from God,

1347
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I think it would actually make me feel better.

1348
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yeah, that's true.

1349
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I mean, how much better do you feel when you're listening?

1350
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Like, if you're put on hold, do you prefer to hear silence?

1351
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I can't think of anything I would rather hear God tell me.

1352
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I mean, yeah, having him say, I apologize,

1353
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
would at least be an acknowledgement of the many sins

1354
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
of the creator of the universe.

1355
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I have such a strong sense of deja vu.

1356
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I feel like I've heard Jess say that before.

1357
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I don't know.

1358
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Maybe.

1359
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I think we've all heard Jess say that often.

1360
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1361
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Wasn't it like the robot Marvin was it?

1362
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And he saw the message and that made him feel better?

1363
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah, and like Marvin is like dying, I think.

1364
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And they say like, does that at least make you feel better?

1365
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And he's like, yeah, I guess it kind of does a little.

1366
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's like the last thing that Marvin sees when he's croaking

1367
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and it gives him some manner of peace.

1368
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Seeing a real message from God wouldn't be a bad last thing to see, I think.

1369
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Tying this back to Winnie the Pooh, naturally.

1370
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I must have just had a real soft spot.

1371
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I must have just really like depressed voice of reason characters

1372
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
because I really loved Eor and I really loved Marvin.

1373
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
They were my favorite.

1374
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Wow, then you're so like original.

1375
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I bet you go to hot topic like every day.

1376
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah, like so cool.

1377
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Christopher Robin's final message to Eor.

1378
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I apologize for the inconvenience.

1379
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Comment below if you shared my proclivities, edgy teens,

1380
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
listening to this podcast.

1381
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Our sea of transsexual gay audience members

1382
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
are absolutely all going to come down on your side, Ben.

1383
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It's going to be a sea of, I don't know, what do they do?

1384
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Zero for Ben, you know, that kind of thing, yeah.

1385
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Maybe, probably.

1386
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
They'll buy a shirt.

1387
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
They'll go to the Ben Saints teespring and buy a St. Hart shirt.

1388
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

1389
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
They'll go to pray, throw crass news, I'm just being cool shirt.

1390
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Oh man, I feel like I had somewhere to go with that.

1391
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I could pick this up.

1392
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I just looked it up and like get a load of just like the depth of emotion

1393
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and the profundity of this passage.

1394
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It says, we apologize for the inconvenience.

1395
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
God's final message to His creation, written in letters of fire

1396
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
on the side of the, oh God, I'm too far away to read this made up bullshit word,

1397
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
on the side of the quenchilis quasgar mountains.

1398
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I think Marvin murmured at last from deep within his corroding, rattling thorax,

1399
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I feel good about it.

1400
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever.

1401
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That makes me feel like, hmm, that's a good feeling right there.

1402
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I felt really sad for Marvin.

1403
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
He went through so much crap and then this happened.

1404
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I mean, it's pretty funny, but also existentially horrifying

1405
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
to be designed specifically to be grumpy and upset about life all the time.

1406
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
He had to wait like how many years?

1407
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Millenials, I don't know.

1408
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah, there's some kind of time shenanigans where he gets sent back to the ancient past

1409
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and has to just wait around for millennia for the other characters to meet up with him again.

1410
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Damn, that sucks.

1411
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't know if he was designed to be depressed

1412
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
or if that was just a natural result of him being so smart.

1413
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, there were those doors, right?

1414
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
The doors were designed to love opening and closing for people to hate through

1415
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and gets massive enjoyment, and I think he, on the other hand, was designed to be upset about most things.

1416
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Too bad. Too bad. That's a shame.

1417
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Hey, but to pick this up, speaking of apologizing for the inconvenience,

1418
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I just want to say a short message to people who listened to the last week's episode

1419
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
because I feel like my energy levels were greatly repressed,

1420
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
and I just want to explain that that was because I had just gotten back from vacation

1421
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
and I had not even slept yet.

1422
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I wanted to be on the PCP so bad that I didn't take any breaks

1423
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and I feel like I didn't have my thoughts together.

1424
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So it's a mild apology from your God.

1425
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
A mild apology. That's the title of your autobiography.

1426
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So really, you should be thanking him.

1427
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah, that's correct. I want to turn this weakness into a you owe me thanks for doing this for you.

1428
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That's where I want to take it.

1429
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You have apologized for the inconvenience.

1430
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Exactly. Exactly.

1431
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
But I did remember a hilarious story that I wanted to tell people

1432
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
that I totally forgot to on that episode of my visit to Hawaii,

1433
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
which was basically simply that when we were first there,

1434
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
we went straight to go get some food.

1435
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It's like a Japanese-Chinese little food place.

1436
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And so we go in. I got curry.

1437
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I've decided my favorite food in the world is Japanese curry.

1438
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Put that in the books, folks. That's canon.

1439
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Put that on the prokarystopedia.

1440
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
That's right. Put it in there.

1441
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And as we're sitting there, our female waitress, who was Chinese

1442
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and with her accent, you could tell she was actually from China.

1443
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Spoke some rough English.

1444
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And she comes up.

1445
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And so it's me, Michelle, and Michelle's mom.

1446
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And she says to Michelle.

1447
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
She says this female waitress is to Michelle in like broken English.

1448
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So spare me. This is what she sounded like.

1449
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I'm not offending anyone here.

1450
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Well, this is what she said.

1451
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I'm not offending anyone.

1452
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You're offended. You're wrong.

1453
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You cannot be offended by this.

1454
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Here we go. She was like, oh, I want you to.

1455
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You can do it.

1456
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
You're so beautiful.

1457
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We're going to get deep platforms.

1458
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
She said something like, he want you to know out front.

1459
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You're so beautiful.

1460
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And we were like, what are you talking about?

1461
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And Michelle was confused.

1462
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What she was attempting to communicate

1463
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
was that either the chef or the guy at the front desk

1464
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
wanted to or at least had said that Michelle was beautiful.

1465
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Now, it wasn't implied.

1466
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
It wasn't conveyed if she had been given this message

1467
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
to pass along to Michelle,

1468
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
or if this person was just privy to this information

1469
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and chose to share it, possibly against their wishes,

1470
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
that we don't know.

1471
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
But I'm assuming it was that latter,

1472
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
because why else would you say anything?

1473
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Nate, the only reason you would want to relay this story is

1474
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
so you can be, haha, I have a hot girlfriend.

1475
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Also, I can make a funny racist voice.

1476
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
That's the only reason why you want to share this story.

1477
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Those are two great reasons to tell this story.

1478
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Does that matter?

1479
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Well, but here's the point.

1480
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay, here's the point.

1481
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And then she said, oh, me sucky sucky, big egg roll, Jackie Chan.

1482
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And then she said,

1483
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Shanghai Hong Kong egg-foo young fortune cookie always wrong.

1484
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Look, here's the point.

1485
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Here's the point.

1486
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Okay, fine.

1487
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
The message was conveyed.

1488
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
We all sat around just wondering what the point of this message was.

1489
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Because remember, Michelle's sitting there

1490
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and I'm sitting right next to her and her mom's across from us.

1491
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Now, Michelle is like Asian and Hispanic.

1492
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So she's obviously not related to me because I'm fucking white as snow.

1493
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And like, so I'm right there and we've got this lady coming across.

1494
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
By the way, she's like, I don't know, like 25 and the dude's also 25.

1495
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
We can like, we can see him passing along a message to my girlfriend

1496
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
that he thinks she is beautiful.

1497
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Now, I don't know if this is like more common in China or whatever,

1498
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
but it's like, what exactly is the end game of this,

1499
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
of this proposition of this information being passed along?

1500
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Are we attempting some sort of cucking situation?

1501
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Is that what we're going for?

1502
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
He thought you were easy pickings and he wanted to get out.

1503
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah, I think so.

1504
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah.

1505
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It was good.

1506
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I mean, I guess it could be.

1507
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
He figured there was no way that you knew Kung Fu

1508
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and would defeat him in an honor duel.

1509
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Little does he know.

1510
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I've watched so much anime.

1511
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
My power level is off the charts.

1512
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Could he see?

1513
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
There's probably just a weird way to try and get tips.

1514
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It could have been that.

1515
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Except it wasn't that she said that Michelle was beautiful.

1516
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It was that this guy had said she was beautiful.

1517
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And presumably she had been, she was passing along the message.

1518
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And that was it.

1519
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
All right.

1520
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that was my experience.

1521
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Good story.

1522
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Thank you for delivering us from boredom.

1523
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Thank you for your welcome.

1524
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You're welcome.

1525
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I think that was good.

1526
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
The podcast is saved.

1527
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We did it, everybody.

1528
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Thanks to the procrastinators girls.

1529
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And now we can move on to the...

1530
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Just for fun on that subject.

1531
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Michelle has told me that she's got Asian eyes

1532
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,000
and when her co-workers, she said, will attempt to say something back to her

1533
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
that she had said or whatever.

1534
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
She's noticed they will squint at her while they're just saying the words.

1535
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And she's like, why are you doing that?

1536
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Why?

1537
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
How does that help me understand?

1538
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I don't know.

1539
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It helps her empathize.

1540
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It builds your rapport.

1541
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
You want to see the world the way she sees it.

1542
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I want to question.

1543
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So when she's repeating the words that Michelle said, is that...

1544
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah, when they're trying to probably make fun of her or joke about something she had said.

1545
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's like when they come up to her and they speak really slowly because she's a foreigner,

1546
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
they squint their eyes and they say, do you know the...

1547
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
There is this thing, I'm not saying maybe the co-worker is trying to be racist,

1548
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
but sometimes when people are trying to focus, they do squint.

1549
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I mean, maybe.

1550
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I guess the implication is that this isn't done when quoting, I guess, non-Asian people.

1551
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I mean, I don't know.

1552
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I think it's hilarious and I'll laugh at Michelle either way, but you know, I'm just saying...

1553
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Racism is good.

1554
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I just want the world to understand that it's always funny no matter what.

1555
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
You don't even have to have a punchline.

1556
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
If you just say something racist, I swear to God, it's hilarious.

1557
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You know what they say.

1558
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Okay, listen to this, guys.

1559
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
High walls build strong neighbors.

1560
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I heard a joke.

1561
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I heard a joke and I'm going to repeat it word for word.

1562
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
This is a Louis C.K. joke that I heard on a podcast from 2015.

1563
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
All right.

1564
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It starts with...

1565
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Oh, no.

1566
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I don't remember.

1567
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It goes like, how do you...

1568
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
No, wait.

1569
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Hold on.

1570
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Let me just think.

1571
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I know what it is.

1572
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
God damn it.

1573
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

1574
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm tripping over my ums, but here it is.

1575
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So he was on a podcast with Bill Burr's black friend, Patrice O'Neill.

1576
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That was it.

1577
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And Patrice O'Neill.

1578
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Bill Burr's black friend, Patrice O'Neill.

1579
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I just forgot his name.

1580
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
God damn it.

1581
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
He was dead before I even found out about him.

1582
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Okay, anyway.

1583
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
God.

1584
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Patrice O'Neill was saying like, hey, did you guys know where the word kike came from specifically?

1585
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
They were talking about slurs.

1586
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And they said, oh, well, you see on Ellis Island, like something like the Hebrew word for circle

1587
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
is kykel.

1588
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And so what the, what the fucking, the people would say is like, oh, here comes the Hebrew,

1589
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
doesn't speak English.

1590
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
You know, one of these kikes is coming along, you know, doing the same kykel because that

1591
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
was the thing.

1592
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
That doesn't explain anything.

1593
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I know the clip you're talking about.

1594
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well, it was just like a shortened version of this word that was...

1595
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Why would they use the word circle?

1596
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Why would they use the word circle?

1597
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Because they didn't know how to sign their name in English.

1598
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And so they would simply draw a circle and they just abbreviated that.

1599
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So yeah, I left that point out.

1600
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Sorry.

1601
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And so in response to this, Louis C.K. comes in and he says, hey guys, you know where the

1602
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
word nigger comes from?

1603
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So one time there was this black guy and he was just being a real nigger.

1604
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And you know, so then they just started calling him that.

1605
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Get it?

1606
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Do you get it guys?

1607
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Why aren't you laughing?

1608
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Why aren't you laughing?

1609
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
That's really funny.

1610
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm picking up what you're throwing down.

1611
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Okay, good.

1612
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Best guy ever.

1613
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I'm really, I'm really feeling it.

1614
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You burst out roaring laughter at that joke because it's really funny.

1615
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I mean, that's what happens in the clip.

1616
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You really left me hanging.

1617
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
They all burst out laughing hysterically.

1618
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yeah, they do.

1619
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And it's great.

1620
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yeah.

1621
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I get it.

1622
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You know, in a different context, maybe I would have been amused, but...

1623
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I guess so.

1624
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Let's talk about nicer words like the word smorgasbord.

1625
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah, you know what?

1626
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
There's not enough talk about words that are nice that everyone agrees on and feels

1627
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
good when they hear.

1628
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay, but the word smorgasbord is just, it's just like, I just realized it sounds like

1629
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
something Starfire would like use to describe like from Teen Titans is just like one of

1630
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
those.

1631
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It sounds like a made-up word.

1632
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

1633
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
She'd probably be pretty excited about that word.

1634
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Although a quick question is Tameranian actually a different language than English or whatever

1635
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
they speak?

1636
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Yeah, it's like she used a lot of those words and that's why I said like smorgasbord just

1637
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
sounds like something from her language.

1638
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You're right.

1639
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
You're right.

1640
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Dude, you know what?

1641
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I like bogus.

1642
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Bogus.

1643
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I think we should say bogus individual instead of nigger.

1644
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
We should make a PCP bonus episode only called the bogus episode and it's like totally wacky,

1645
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
bro.

1646
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You know what I mean?

1647
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
No, that's a bogus idea.

1648
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
All our bogus episodes are bogus episodes.

1649
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
That's true.

1650
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
In fact, all of our episodes period are totally bogus.

1651
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
What word I love and I always thought it was a racist word, but then I looked it up

1652
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and I realized that I found out that it's actually was not racist like I thought it was.

1653
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Is it niggardly?

1654
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It's not niggardly.

1655
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Although that is also in this category of words.

1656
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Edimologically unrelated.

1657
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah, it's boofer.

1658
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I fucking, I love, I love boofer.

1659
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I love calling people boofers.

1660
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I love being called a boofer even though it's an insult.

1661
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Is that like a, is like a verb you can boof someone?

1662
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I just, no, like a boofer is like a lower class, poor, lazy person.

1663
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And so like obviously I could see why there would be racist connotations if you yourself are racist

1664
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and think that all poor, lazy people are black, but it's actually not.

1665
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
It's actually totally not racist.

1666
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You can say boofer all you want to anyone you want.

1667
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's okay people.

1668
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
We can say boofer.

1669
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
That would be such a good name for a boofer.

1670
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
That's true.

1671
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I might adopt that one.

1672
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That's pretty good.

1673
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Yeah, like when I was, when I was, when I was working on the farm as a teenager, you know,

1674
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
the person we worked for, she would yell down the stairs to us like,

1675
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
you boofers get up and get out there in the field and shovel that shape shit.

1676
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
What are you boofers doing playing your boofer ass video games?

1677
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Oh, boofer ass is such a good one.

1678
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I love describing things as boofer ass something.

1679
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It's great.

1680
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
With, uh, uh, spout off into the boofer core subgenre.

1681
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
She also called us work niggers a lot, but I,

1682
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
like, like, like, like our, our job was work niggers, but our,

1683
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
what we actually were as people, as human beings were boofers.

1684
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I'll just do it.

1685
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Okay, word uncanny.

1686
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Uncanny.

1687
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I, I, you know how it learned this word.

1688
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Garfield.

1689
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I learned that word from Garfield.

1690
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I, I, I was binge watching like some, uh, TV show about like paranormal activity and whatever

1691
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and every single episode there was this woman that would just like guess was like,

1692
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
that's so uncanny.

1693
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And I thought that it just meant like, oh, that kind of looks like something else.

1694
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But then I learned the real.

1695
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That it doesn't look like a tin can.

1696
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
What?

1697
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah.

1698
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I thought the word meant like, oh, it's, it, this thing looks like another thing.

1699
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh, you know, it's similar looking or whatever.

1700
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, it's, it has, it shares similarities because like the way she used it,

1701
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
she used it wrong apparently.

1702
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And so like,

1703
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Is uncanny a racial slur?

1704
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Have I?

1705
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
No, not at all.

1706
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Okay, no.

1707
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I'm just talking about a word.

1708
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Just a random word.

1709
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Okay.

1710
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Just a random, non-offensive word.

1711
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Sorry, got racial slurs in the mind.

1712
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Those exist?

1713
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yeah.

1714
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Well, get rid of your mind.

1715
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't know.

1716
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Oh, these fucking tin cans walking around with their AI and shit.

1717
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Fucking, yeah, uncanny for life.

1718
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Know what I'm saying?

1719
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Maybe.

1720
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Could be something like that.

1721
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Yeah, so I learned the actual meaning of the word and I still like it.

1722
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
It's a pretty useful word.

1723
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I just googled it by the way,

1724
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
because I didn't actually know the real definition.

1725
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It says strange or mysterious,

1726
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
especially in an unsettling way.

1727
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah, like uncanny valley and stuff.

1728
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
You know what I, you know what doesn't make sense to me is

1729
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
whenever white people get caught saying the n-word,

1730
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'm calling it the n-word now.

1731
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I've changed my ways.

1732
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Whenever white people get caught saying the n-word,

1733
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
they give that excuse.

1734
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It was like, hey, man, you know, I'm not racist.

1735
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I have a lot of black friends.

1736
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I know black people, you know, that's like people.

1737
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
That's like the quintessential stereotypical fucking white person excuse.

1738
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But really, I think it would be a better defensive yourself

1739
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
to say that you have no black friends.

1740
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Like if you get caught saying it,

1741
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
you should be able to say like, hey, I don't have any black friends.

1742
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm not hurting anyone's feelings who I care about.

1743
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I'm just saying it because I don't care.

1744
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I don't know anybody.

1745
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Dude, it's just like how my heroes, Mike Pence and Ninja,

1746
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
the face of Twitch, they won't associate with women.

1747
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I do the same with black people, man.

1748
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I've got a policy where I'm just not going to, you know,

1749
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
look, I know I'm not racist because I refuse to associate with blacks.

1750
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Wait, wait, they won't associate with women.

1751
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Well, it's a thing where they won't engage in like private meetings

1752
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
because like if they're alone,

1753
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
they don't want to like have rumors start or, you know,

1754
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I read an actual defense.

1755
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Well, it's different with Ninja versus Mike Pence.

1756
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Well, okay, I'm talking about Ninja.

1757
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Yeah.

1758
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
He won't stream with female streamers because he has a point.

1759
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Femoid streamers is the term he used, I believe.

1760
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah.

1761
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Because people like make you rumors and say,

1762
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
ha, are they cheating?

1763
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Are they going to have sex?

1764
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Am I going to make a rule 34 of Ninja and this female streamer?

1765
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So he says he's not going to stream with any, you know,

1766
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
female streamers who want to stream with him because of that.

1767
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Yeah.

1768
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
That's the unfortunate curse of being popular with the kids

1769
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
is that they will draw rule 34 shipping of yours.

1770
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So just what happened to the game grumps a lot of time.

1771
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I'm so fucking mad.

1772
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Whenever I say I want more PCP porn,

1773
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
everyone always draws shit fucking art that's like,

1774
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
oh, ha, ha, MS Paint.

1775
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
No.

1776
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
We need to get Shadman involved.

1777
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
We need to get him involved in this situation.

1778
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I want to be in the big leagues.

1779
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I want to make it big in the world and have people draw

1780
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
all the wrong porn of me and my friends.

1781
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Funny story about Shadman.

1782
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I heard second hand.

1783
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I don't know if I'm exactly supposed to relate this fact,

1784
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
but I don't see who would be harmed by it.

1785
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So whatever.

1786
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Okay.

1787
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You know that comics guy, Maryweather, who I know, kind of.

1788
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Well, he was doing, he had his, like a YouTube channel where he

1789
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
would interview some more or less famous internet people.

1790
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And he was apparently supposed to interview Shadman.

1791
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And he got Shadman in the call.

1792
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And I guess he and this other guy, EZK, were talking about it

1793
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
beforehand and they discussed what they were going to say.

1794
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And like before the interview started, Maryweather asked him like,

1795
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Hey man, so like, are you a pedophile?

1796
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And this, I think he was asking it as a joke or something,

1797
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
but Shadman took it super seriously and got really offended,

1798
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
you know, as you might.

1799
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And like basically just like tank the whole interview after that

1800
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and like wouldn't give any real answers to any questions.

1801
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So the thing like ended up never happening.

1802
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Well, okay.

1803
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
That doesn't like incriminate him or anything.

1804
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
He could just be sensitive.

1805
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Like I would be fucking mad if someone asked me that.

1806
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And like especially cause like I know probably a lot,

1807
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
like a lot of people say that about him legitimately.

1808
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So he's probably like extra sensitive.

1809
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That sounds like somebody overstepping.

1810
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
True or not.

1811
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It sounds like somebody overstepping their bounds is to like,

1812
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
that this person is like edgy, right?

1813
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So I can say really edgy things to them and they won't mind.

1814
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Like I don't have to be polite.

1815
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I mean, we all know that like in the modern era,

1816
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
like just the accusation like is smoke and you know,

1817
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
people just assume where there's smoke, there's fire and shit.

1818
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So like, you know, it's a little touchy, a little touchy there.

1819
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Sure.

1820
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yeah.

1821
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I mean, I can kind of understand both why the question was asked

1822
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and also why it was a disaster.

1823
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I think Shadman is an interesting guy though.

1824
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So I mean, it's too bad.

1825
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It's too bad it didn't.

1826
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I'd like to hear.

1827
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I'm gonna be best friends with Shadman,

1828
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
have him come on the podcast.

1829
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Why is Shadman so popular?

1830
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I'd have him on.

1831
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Exactly.

1832
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Because he makes Burger King foot lettuce porn and you know, what not.

1833
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
What?

1834
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh, that explains it.

1835
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That explains everything.

1836
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Yeah, he makes like porn of basically every meme and shit that comes on.

1837
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I feel, yeah, it's really bad.

1838
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
It's that he taps into the meme market and makes pornography

1839
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
that it is, like the fact that it is a porn of a meme

1840
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
is meme worthy and people share it and that's why he's well known.

1841
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's a weird thing to be the most popular guy who does.

1842
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's not, I don't think he's the most popular because of that.

1843
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
A lot of the time it's because he like takes, like, you know,

1844
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
he does normal stuff and then he does like really out there stuff

1845
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and people are like, oh my god Shadman.

1846
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
His stuff makes me feel like really prudish and uncomfortable.

1847
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I don't know.

1848
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I agree.

1849
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I agree.

1850
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I'd have you a Shadman call us.

1851
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Come on the show buddy.

1852
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Get in here.

1853
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Let's do it.

1854
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Get in here and defend yourself.

1855
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Defend yourself against the accusation that your porn is kind of weird looking

1856
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
and sort of makes me feel dirty.

1857
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
That's fair, that's fair.

1858
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Shit.

1859
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Did you guys see, now that we've thoroughly poisoned this podcast

1860
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
with racial slurs and talk of pedophilia.

1861
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Oh crap, we did.

1862
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's time to plug something.

1863
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Yeah.

1864
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Did you guys see that the guy Tectonic Improv did a PCP style lecture?

1865
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Of course.

1866
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You mentioned that, but I did not watch it.

1867
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
He picked up, I watched it.

1868
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
He picked up the lecture torch and he did like a full on like two hour lecture

1869
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
about a top the fourth wall, the Linkara series.

1870
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Just quick aside, you're aware of this.

1871
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Not about the person.

1872
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I was just going to say you're aware he's not the first one to pick up the lecture format.

1873
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
There was What's His Face.

1874
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Who did those like, what were they, I think they were like PCP lore lectures or something.

1875
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Yes.

1876
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1877
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I know your friend.

1878
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
No.

1879
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1880
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Was it just him like sitting in front of his computer though?

1881
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
No, he had friends and he was doing like a reel in front of a board.

1882
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Like the audio was shit and like the one or two that I heard though, so it didn't really

1883
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
work that well.

1884
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
He put the series though, I think.

1885
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I think he did.

1886
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Sorry, I can't remember your name, dude, but if somebody tells me, we'll like put a link

1887
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
or something.

1888
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Anyway, go ahead.

1889
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I don't remember that, but this Tectonic Improv atop the fourth wall, it's not about Linkara

1890
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
the person, it's about like the lore of the atop the fourth wall series, which I didn't

1891
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
know anything about.

1892
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It's pretty funny.

1893
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It gets pretty fucking wacky after a while.

1894
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:07,500
The lore that goes on with that guy with the glasses people, I could never figure out all

1895
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:12,300
of it because you'd have to watch all of their reviews all the way through because things

1896
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,000
could happen in the middle.

1897
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
It's like comic books, there's like too much continuity.

1898
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,760
I was excited when it first started back in the day, I was like prominent on the forums.

1899
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:30,360
I didn't like any of them, but because I was a part of the forums, I like through osmosis,

1900
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:37,500
I had a lot of exposure to the whole Vekar the glasses culture and I mean that's like

1901
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:43,160
a lot of what my old videos were sort of making fun of and satirizing because of the whole

1902
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:48,560
like oh here's a character and it's just me in like a new t-shirt but this version's

1903
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,760
evil and we have to battle for the fate of the world but like with no real self-awareness

1904
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,160
how silly it was, like they took it completely seriously and all the endless crossovers with

1905
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,080
all the different people on the site and they were all so bad.

1906
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,360
I don't have a point to this, they were all so bad.

1907
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:10,220
Even Spoonies was like he seemed to be like pretty self-aware except when it came to the

1908
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:14,460
skits he did where you go like big on the makeup and big on the serious tone.

1909
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:21,340
Spoonie was like easily by far the most talented of anyone on that site but like he fell into

1910
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:27,420
the trap of making his content their way and it sort of ruined his content and eventually

1911
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:34,540
it fucking ruined him and he just now he's sad and it's sad to see that he's sad and

1912
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:38,460
like his whole audience has turned on him and it's like it's like the worst fate that

1913
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,980
can befall any of us.

1914
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:48,780
I saw the down the rabbit hole about him, yeah he seems like he's kind of not doing so well

1915
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:55,640
let's all give our hopes and prayers to Spoonie, let's all raise our hands and try to give

1916
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,220
him our fucking power, he needs it, he needs to spirit bomb himself.

1917
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:04,500
For me the saddest thing and I think about this a lot like when I'm kind of tweeting

1918
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,300
a bunch and like haven't produced a video in a while to see him I don't know if he is

1919
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:12,060
like super recent but in all those videos he's like so active on Twitter so like you

1920
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:17,260
know he's like right there but just something's preventing him from like making content whatever

1921
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:21,340
it is like inside him or he just I don't know maybe he's scared to repose because he'll

1922
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,940
get all much shit and stuff.

1923
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:27,660
From what he describes of himself I mean these are his own words about his own like mental

1924
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:33,940
problems he's got like everything like he's bipolar he's manic depressive he's like he's

1925
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:39,260
always been that but then you take all that and then you combine it with like the stress

1926
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:44,500
of internet drama which we all know and just how much of a grind this can be even for something

1927
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,700
for someone of perfect mental health.

1928
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,980
Hey you know what I thought I saw the other day which warned my heart a little bit like

1929
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:55,140
I know he's had his issues with like all the that guy with the glasses guys but like you

1930
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:59,420
know that legendary moment of him and angry Joe at whatever conference that was where he

1931
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:04,980
just goes be trail or whatever yeah and like they like there's a bunch of people like got

1932
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:10,820
mad at them because apparently like that quote unquote lack of professionalism like cost people

1933
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:15,780
like there was a I heard one guy whining about how that the interview the interview with

1934
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:19,500
not the interview with not oh my god my channel would have gotten a million subs if I got this

1935
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:25,060
one I know is a stepping stone whatever the point is like I was just watching a fucking

1936
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:29,820
angry Joe just review which are pretty good videos that I like even in this day and like

1937
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:34,020
just like what like angry Joe just says I think about Fallout 76 he's just like yeah this

1938
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:39,060
game betrayed me be trail and I'm just like that you that's Spoonie you remember your

1939
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:47,140
friend Spoonie yes I saw that cute I really like yeah he um yeah bring Spoonie on for

1940
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:53,580
a fucking video Joe just do it you have millions of subs if I could bring him back yeah I wish

1941
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:58,620
if I could like do an interview with Spoonie if he were like open to taking like anything

1942
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:02,420
like that from anyone but I know that he probably wouldn't like I bet that Spoonie isn't a place

1943
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:08,220
now where anyone who approaches him he assumes is a troll and like I know that feeling like

1944
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:13,500
I totally get it he's just like he's he's sunk so far that like he's in like a bad place

1945
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,860
now and it's just sad to look at man needs like when it comes to his YouTube presence

1946
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:22,300
like I'm not trying to fucking psychoanalyze the guy but I like he needs like sincere people

1947
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:26,700
who just want to help him and like just like give him a little bit of confidence like get

1948
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:32,140
back and like he's obviously taken a lot of flack for shit that he you know is guilty

1949
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:37,540
of and he is imperfect in a lot of ways and he has clearly made quite a few mistakes but

1950
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:43,380
like of course there's always also shit that he takes that probably was outside of his control

1951
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,860
and probably wasn't that a big deal but now because you know all of the shit has coalesced

1952
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:53,540
into like a massive wall of hate so like even the shit that's not really that big a deal

1953
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:58,420
is mixed in with the shit that he did do wrong so like I he's probably like just he feels

1954
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:02,700
like you can't get out of it you can't do anything right anymore these these waves of

1955
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:07,980
hatred are fairly transient though relatively speaking so like like the current though the

1956
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:12,340
wave of hate at Spoonie's been in the doghouse for like years now and like and like he could

1957
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:17,740
like yeah he could just totally come back and like make a good video in the style of

1958
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:22,940
if he just started making the same stuff he used to make like I think a lot of people

1959
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:27,300
yeah like just come right back people hate him but they want him to be able to make a

1960
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:32,060
comeback like I've seen like his yeah that's ever his subreddit of like all of his former

1961
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:37,260
jaded fans who just fucking hate him now and like as much as they hate him like if he found

1962
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:42,500
the strength to like really go at it again I think he could make a comeback yeah I think

1963
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,780
so yeah yeah I agree everybody I've really never watched much of his content but everybody

1964
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:50,580
talks about him pretty well yeah if you've if anyone out there has like never seen Spoonie

1965
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:55,380
if you if you just know him as the guy who sucks now and everybody hates him and doesn't

1966
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:58,700
make any content and lines about Trump on Twitter and you don't get what the big deal

1967
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:05,580
is like I his fucking Spoonie's Ultima retrospective is like one of the best things ever on the

1968
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:10,180
internet it's like one of the best sort of video essay reviewer retrospective things that

1969
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:14,580
I've ever seen I still think it holds up I watched it pretty recently so anyone who doesn't

1970
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:21,300
know how good Spoonie was watch that or like his his ultima video I'm googling that his

1971
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:27,540
ultimate retrospective or his like Highlander videos he was good he was cool yeah first

1972
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:33,380
result when I when I Google Spoonie Ultima is Ultima retrospective complete no skits HD

1973
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:42,820
all the yeah people went in and took the skits I get it but yeah yeah it's they're not for

1974
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:48,020
everybody they're not for everybody I mean well some of those skits aren't like there's like five

1975
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:52,740
second clips of him just doing a silly voice in an medieval costume and like that's okay you

1976
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:57,180
can leave that in but I assume they got rid of all of them probably probably yeah I wonder if

1977
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:01,780
that means they took out the live act like all the live action bits because like I can understand

1978
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,980
not liking the skits and thinking that they drag but like part of the ultimate series like the

1979
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:13,540
sort of climax of it is this one like near the end of it he goes on this one long take of just

1980
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:18,700
like a live action bit of him just kind of talking about like when he was a kid and his brother would

1981
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:23,460
play ultimate with him and it gets it like really emotional and that's like the climax of the whole

1982
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:29,060
series and it's like really cut that part yeah like the dude is a great performer and a great actor

1983
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:35,220
and it sucks that he I guess hates himself and wants to die I'm certainly we all know that

1984
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:50,060
feeling indeed I do know the feel of hating yourself and wanting to die I ain't got no

1985
01:25:50,060 --> 01:26:00,540
iPhone my heart is racing thinking suicide I don't got no iPhone left turn left turn of a

1986
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:08,820
subject matter here but Ben on your suggestion I tried Instacart Instacart yeah the delivery

1987
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:16,100
service I'll tell you I signed up for the free one month trial bam in one hour I had my fucking

1988
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:22,580
shampoo and deodorant I needed I had some fucking bread I had whatever the fuck else I bought a bunch

1989
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:32,100
of shit and it was fantastic yeah I'm doing it maybe it maybe I should just bite the bullet and

1990
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:37,780
sign up for the subscription it's $100 for a year and that's probably less if you do it a lot so

1991
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:43,940
that's probably less than it yeah there's some hints back when I first started talking about

1992
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:49,460
Hello Fresh you you you stated meantime before about how frequently you use Grubhub for things

1993
01:26:49,460 --> 01:27:02,740
yes do you have any interest in cooking food do I have any interest yes technically yes

1994
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:09,700
you just turn into fucking Xavier renegade Angel for a second like want to become a

1995
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:14,740
cook massive relying on Grubhub and spending copious amounts of money well do I want to rely on

1996
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:19,860
Grubhub no of course I don't want to rely on Grubhub but I also don't give a shit about I just want

1997
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:24,500
to not worry about it and have my nutrition that's all are you trying are you trying to push Hello

1998
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:30,660
Fresh no okay however I'm ready to fucking fight I'm ready to fucking fight about however I fucking

1999
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:36,980
hate you Ben and everything you ever say is fucking so stupid and make Hello Fresh is the worst

2000
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:42,500
I okay what it does what a disaster Ben you are such a fucking freaking asshole maybe I could

2001
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,820
cook maybe I could cook my own food for more than it would cost me to go out to a restaurant and buy

2002
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:54,500
it hmm good good idea the whole point of Hello Fresh is just to build confidence it's not so that you

2003
01:27:54,500 --> 01:28:02,340
can use it for all of your cooking forever it is simply for new cooks and families who want to

2004
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:08,100
have easy instructions so like Nate says they don't have to worry about just fucking google a recipe

2005
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:13,780
it's the easiest thing sure I'm not saying that's unviable I'm just saying that there is a use I'm

2006
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:16,660
saying it's strictly better I hate you

2007
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:26,900
I'm unmount you side with this one okay it's fair yeah I can see that anyway I'm gonna be doing

2008
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:32,420
that a lot it's gonna change the game um Instacart's rad say it's like it's it's not that expensive

2009
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:37,140
and it saves you fucking like a several hour trip to the goddamn grocery store I'm saving gas money

2010
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:42,100
too I mean it's got to make up some of the difference so you know yeah yeah um incidentally

2011
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:47,380
saves me saves me like a fucking hours walk through the bitter cold yeah it's pretty great

2012
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:53,460
it's pretty great yeah I have things to discuss uh uh but does anybody else have any other subjects

2013
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:58,100
they want to bring up before we we talk about stuff I mean last subject I tried to bring up I was

2014
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:02,420
cut halfway through when we went into a conversation about Burger King and Wendy's so I'm just gonna

2015
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:07,380
resign myself to comment you know other people now I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off and

2016
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:14,340
make you feel sad with that Wendy's bit I just I don't know Nate it was Nate's fault he said to

2017
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,580
say talk about something else and I didn't know what to do hey hey Jesse just make sure you open

2018
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:25,620
all of your packages come in the mail for the next two weeks okay I'd be sure to give him a big sniff

2019
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:30,260
test open them inhale deeply before you do anything else well I'm just gonna I mean I mean just

2020
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:35,220
just put just just poke out all the wires you can hey hey don't worry about the the beeping noise

2021
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:41,060
just uh just just set it down and open it yep yep a bunch of ghosts for bomb I go for anthrax okay

2022
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:46,580
that's good I mean we can team up really that's true what if we blow anthrax all over his house so

2023
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:51,780
we can't escape uh hey wait wait hold on I'm sure there are a lot of people who want other people

2024
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:59,460
to not be breathing anymore what if we kill people for money and then we take that money and spend it

2025
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:05,700
on more weapons to kill people for more money oh my god we've just evolved into the people killers

2026
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:13,860
with a c podcast this is it well this is it send send us a request for who you want us to kill and

2027
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:22,980
we will uh dude we will split up with some people are dying directly so yeah um all right my life

2028
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:29,620
and I want to die I don't got no iphone should we should we go to voicemails let's go straight to

2029
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:34,660
the fucking voicemails I think uh we got we got a bunch today we got I got like 15 of these

2030
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:40,180
mother fuckers but they're good they're quality ones oh wait is that Tom is Tom here I am here

2031
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:46,500
Tom's been here the whole time yeah oh huh there was a bit I wanted to bring up earlier about books

2032
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:51,780
but it's too late now so fuck it let's go to voicemails talk about books talk about books talk

2033
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:57,780
about books talking about how like good book series and I wanted to just go out on the limb again

2034
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:04,020
and say anamorph's is good everyone judged a book by their covers and fucked up I'm a hundred percent

2035
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:09,300
positive I was thinking about an anamorph's retrospective I was thinking about maybe if I

2036
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:15,460
wanted to do that's my next pcb lecture I'm doing it on anamorph's wait oh really confirmed

2037
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:19,780
oh maybe maybe I subconsciously stole the idea okay well quick but it's so fucking long aren't they

2038
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:26,340
just like uh like four children I I can I can I can believe I can believe that anamorph's is like

2039
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:31,380
really good because all I know about it is that it's extremely long extremely complex and I like

2040
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:37,140
homestuck so like it could be the books are written yeah incredibly simplistically the font's big the

2041
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:42,660
words are just like very simple uh it's a children's book but the story if you like listening to

2042
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:47,540
trump speak you're gonna love exactly it's like a trump wrote books uh but like the the whole thing

2043
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:52,900
is about like an alien invasion like this like intergalactic politics and like the the effects

2044
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:58,020
of war on children that's what the series is about boring what phone type they use to the use

2045
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:05,700

2094
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:57,780
didn't we get one before that i completely didn't get uh shit i think that one was like way better

2095
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:02,580
this one was still good it's from one spark right great oh no no we'll never know i want to hear it

2096
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:07,860
oh hey we had a topic like actually like pre-written before this episode about how we're gonna argue

2097
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:14,260
about the intro oh shit i forgot about that oh oh yeah the intro sucks in every one of the

2098
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:24,820
one in the entire world every episode bitch oh oh the the the intro so i admit if i were a new

2099
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:28,740
listener to this podcast i would never listen to it because the intro would turn me off so much

2100
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:34,020
fuck you the intro sucks sasuke pro is a fucking champion and his intro is great it makes me laugh

2101
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:40,660
every time as if this podcast would ever have a new listener anyway there's no such thing as a new

2102
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:47,060
pcp fan we pride we pride ourselves on our high barrier to entry uh listen the pcp has a high

2103
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:52,340
better for worse okay we're gonna have to do another theme contest everyone send in your suggestions

2104
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:56,340
to the pcp voicemail and we'll listen to them weekly the theme contest was fucking based and you

2105
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:02,020
know it okay but here's the point uh uh we we see we see this vocal minority assuming that

2106
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:07,300
is okay commenting that they don't like the theme so here so here's what we're gonna do here's we're

2107
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:14,260
gonna do nothing imagine imagine being such a fucking low iq pennant that every single episode

2108
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:20,740
you have to see yeah just hold your you have you have to say something like man i sure am still mad

2109
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:26,180
that the that the my favorite pcp theme didn't win that a different theme song is the theme song

2110
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:32,020
get get over it imagine someone having criticisms of the show of the audio podcast

2111
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:36,980
show imagine being so fucking useless that you that you are still talking about it that you're

2112
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:41,060
still complaining different people every time everyone's just waking up to it at different

2113
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:44,980
times i i don't think i don't think that's correct munchie but it doesn't matter what i think

2114
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:49,940
because we're gonna just use hard data here's what we're going to do why doesn't everyone

2115
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:55,860
everyone who edits just use the the theme that they like i do i do i fucking put a different song

2116
01:38:55,860 --> 01:39:00,980
in sometimes yeah i use the main one like half the time and i use a different one why does the

2117
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:07,460
intro have to be like an important thing like a random stone it's not that question it's fucking

2118
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:14,740
nuts um it's okay well anyway here's what we're gonna do uh it's gonna be a link to a fucking straw

2119
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:20,740
poll vote in it for i don't know i'll probably do like uh if you if you're happy with the current one

2120
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:24,740
if you want it changed and maybe i'll put some options for like specifically what do you change

2121
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:28,980
okay or something no don't don't i don't have a spoiler all right all right i won't try to split

2122
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:34,420
no i i just i just want to i just want to yeah okay yeah go and vote and with the full knowledge

2123
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:39,140
that we're not gonna do anything about the results of the poll the poll means nothing here's the

2124
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:45,220
the purpose of this poll is because i think it really is a small number who even care so if like

2125
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:49,860
first of all if like 10 people vote it doesn't matter fine if like a thousand people vote or

2126
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:55,380
whatever and i think very few of them will actually complain about like the main theme song

2127
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:58,580
but we're gonna find out because we could argue all day about it but i don't give a

2128
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:02,980
shit about even my opinion i care about the numbers so that's what we're gonna do oh my god

2129
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:07,620
we're no no no i'm putting my foot down we're not changing the theme song even if everyone

2130
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:11,780
says we should we can't that's i'm not saying that we need that's fucking cowardly how is that

2131
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:17,380
cowardly that's addressing problems with the show and then that's lip no listen i feel strong

2132
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:21,940
that's literally pathetic that would be literally pathetic and disgusting are literally pathetic

2133
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:29,540
and disgusting what is going on look i hate it i hate it well then i okay i mean i don't

2134
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:36,020
think anybody else feels that this is what ben is outraged by and not me talking about like

2135
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:43,140
school shooting and being in favor of them and whatnot look nobody hates nobody hates the

2136
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,620
the zoomers are the problem they're the ones that are complaining in the comments i know it

2137
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:52,580
that's i know it to be true let's be real it's a bunch of munchie heads out there we know if it's

2138
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:58,260
zoomers complaining then i'm on ben's side let's throw them in the garbage a munchie

2139
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:02,340
complains a lot about the main heads but we all know there's a strong condition of munchie heads

2140
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,580
out there just shitting up you can tell you can tell by the fact that they don't say you can tell

2141
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:11,380
by the fact that they don't say lol when they type it's it's it's it's i don't know what you see a

2142
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:17,860
lot of grown-ups or grown-ups belong on the internet zoomers belong in a pot on the stove getting cooked

2143
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:24,900
in a soup and they die in the food what do you want to concentrate them all in like camps of some

2144
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:31,540
kind that might be a good way to you know separate them out um okay well we'll we'll get back to you

2145
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:36,020
by the way it's entirely possible that everyone likes the intro but i just choose to believe that

2146
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:40,420
everyone doesn't for my own we'll find out i don't choose to believe anything i just don't like

2147
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:47,300
i like it a lot personally i'm still way into it i don't understand okay well fair enough but i

2148
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:52,180
like it this is height moment nate has and why did it fucking win if everyone's such a everyone's

2149
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:56,580
such a fucking bitch about the intro why did it fucking win the poll why did we collectively

2150
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:02,260
vote for it because you're an idiot what does that fucking mean i'm actually mad i'm actually

2151
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:07,620
fucking mad that you would say that um you just got pwned we all fucking voted and it won

2152
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:14,980
and now we're so stupid for liking the intro we all voted for it and not once upon a time

2153
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:21,060
Ben you're making our side look unreasonable please restrain yourself i don't understand

2154
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:26,900
i don't understand one single point i'd not one single point did i give that so i don't

2155
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:31,460
guys it was just that there's a majority win i don't fucking get this fucking lip that i'm

2156
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:36,340
receiving in your opinions but just think of poor sasuke pros ego out there just the center of

2157
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:42,180
all this controversy not sasuke pro and bad feelings he doesn't deserve this he doesn't deserve this

2158
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:49,780
he's a good boy um but okay let's he is a good boy we'll come back uh this ongoing discussion i guess

i am back with virgin vengeance and after hearing you talk about me on the pcp episode i shall i've

2162
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:24,660
decided that the only way i could possibly possibly defeat you and the pcp and blue pill the world

2163
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:32,980

even process yeah it was like a me i'm a wacky character what are your guys plans for 2019

2185
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:11,380
what was the question it was like what's undervalued that's overvalued things that are unfairly

2186
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:16,820
maligned or things that are overly beloved and don't deserve it like overvalued undervalued my

2187
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:22,980
answer undervalued the pcp theme song diet soda vaping things that things people people shit on

2188
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:26,340
all of them for no reason and they're all just they're all just stuck in their ways they're all

2189
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:32,980
just afraid to embrace the future they're all good for you undervalued double decker a good

2190
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:43,140
anime that no one ever talks about never heard of it exactly uh and undervalued i'm gonna fix it

2191
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:49,780
radcon forever fund it now good good good job what a double double decker the anime sequel

2192
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:54,420
to uh blade runner where decker meets another decker and they have to decide which one of

2193
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:58,420
them is the replica that uh and then they both this is the original show these are original

2194
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:02,260
show that spawned double batman the uh the breakout success that would come later

2195
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:10,020
i'm trying to think of something that is unfairly maligned but i'm drawing a blank there's lots of

2196
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:13,860
things that i like that are good but i don't think anybody hates them yeah i mean i don't know

2197
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,220
like just the first thing that comes to the top of my head is a lot of people think that gun buster

2198
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:20,900
is way better than die buster but i humbly disagree but like who gives a shit because they're both

2199
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:25,460
good and everyone okay all right yeah everyone loves both of them here's something that that that's

2200
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:33,380
more maligned than needs to be uh uh people who are affluent like rich people and i don't mean this

2201
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:38,900
as in like people who are poor shouldn't get mad rich people for having money like that sort of

2202
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:46,420
side of it i just mean mo like like i have had the pleasure of meeting one or two rich people

2203
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:52,100
it and rich i mean just like not like rich rich but as in they can afford a good apartment in the

2204
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:58,340
city which is where i'm sitting right now uh and uh and and they're really nice and they're all like

2205
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:04,260
you know they all eat food and they're all just like yeah you know let's go out and let's walk around

2206
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:09,780
today let's go out to dinner i'm like yeah dude i like to do i like to go out and have dinner

2207
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:15,220
so that's why i like rich people yeah but yeah but they're doing every everything they're doing

2208
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:20,580
they're doing on the back of hoarding resources that other people need that's fine and that they

2209
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:25,860
and that they don't deserve if i'm friends with rich people then they'll give me things for free

2210
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:32,980
because i was gonna say they will give me things you see oh oh yeah that i guess i guess i guess you're

2211
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:39,860
right i guess you're right about all that i always felt like notch um billionaire now who sold

2212
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:49,460
Minecraft was like i mean he's maligned enough but like is he well at the outset of like like

2213
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:54,980
selling the company to microsoft uh he lost all his friends and he was really sad and i just felt

2214
01:48:54,980 --> 01:49:01,380
like that was a bit fucked up but i guess i can see it this is unfairly maligned is such a weird

2215
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:09,220
like thing like unfairly in like what content like how big is it unfair i just don't like seeing

2216
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:16,420
people be upset i i think rich people deserve more i agree i definitely wait wait wait hold on backup

2217
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:21,940
it's me muncher from the future i i i just saw the wacky and crazy plot line that will be revealed

2218
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:28,020
in two years and nine days to this exact date so check the pcb channel at that exact time for the

2219
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:32,820
wacky plot that i've just established and will forget about i've just come back to make sure that

2220
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:38,180
everyone knows that what i just said maybe five months ago was retarded and it was actually true

2221
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:41,620
but here's the real thing that i'm about to say right now rich people are good because they're

2222
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:46,580
smarter unironically they are smarter every rich person i've ever met is smarter than poor

2223
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:51,860
people that's actually true that yeah that's cuz they fucking got to go to fucking college

2224
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:56,100
because they didn't have to fucking take out a loan exactly i mean that's true yeah well ben it

2225
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:00,740
sounds like oh my god i'm what's what's interesting about this man is that so you seem to be complaining

2226
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:05,940
and not too fond of this d of like you're born into the privilege of wealth or something like that

2227
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:11,380
yeah uh however we were both born into some pretty decent wealth yeah i know yeah i know

2228
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:17,220
okay listen that's true and yeah i'm privileged but it's not fair sure it's not it's like the

2229
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:22,980
things that i had growing up it's not fair lots of people didn't have them and you know here's the

2230
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:29,460
thing if if i don't know if like the one percent of like billionaires out there you know didn't

2231
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:34,500
weren't billionaires then those resource like like more people could have had what we had okay but

2232
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:38,660
consider this and it's it's it's fucked up please consider this fact it's not cool it's not fucking

2233
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:43,620
cool being rich is wrong and it's bad it is and i agree and i hate the fact that people who are rich

2234
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:49,460
when people are when you're rich it's easier for you to be a good person so they they get away

2235
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:56,340
true with just like like life is even regardless of how much money they have life is just easier if

2236
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:01,220
you've had money because you don't have the fucking mental disorders and insanity that you

2237
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:06,980
gain from a life of having nothing and fucking suffering at every goddamn turn i hate people

2238
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:13,540
who have the privilege of being mentally sound and okay i hope that they all suffer i want to see

2239
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:21,140
them all but be broken logic if you're just born with a disability you should be furious at everyone

2240
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:26,420
who doesn't have you absolutely should absolutely no it doesn't do any good god damn it that's not

2241
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:31,220
the point you just have to survive and do your best well it's it's it's it's different because

2242
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:35,380
like if it's a genetic disability then there's nothing anyone could do about it but like if

2243
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:40,660
your disability is being destitute yeah there is something we could have done about that as a society

2244
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:46,980
but we we didn't it is we let that happen it's very important in my opinion to preserve the ability

2245
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:53,860
to pursue wealth even at very high levels to and like and being poor desire is like a disability

2246
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:59,780
that that no one cares about or even notices at a glance if you see a guy with no legs everyone

2247
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:04,260
knows well his life's hard obviously he has no legs we should you know everything that he does

2248
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:08,820
is better because he did it without having any legs but nobody looks at a poor person or a person

2249
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:13,860
whose life is just regular and crappy and says well everything he does is better because he's

2250
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:18,100
fucking poor his life sucks he had to overcome everything just to get out the fucking door

2251
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:23,380
today and and get like a job just to afford a crappy apartment above a bowling alley that's

2252
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:28,660
a fucking miracle anyone who has an apartment is is a god you've done something incredible and no

2253
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:35,620
one fucking cares i think you i think we all accept the basic fact i think shadow the hedgehog

2254
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:43,940
is unfairly like people make fun of it i know nate nate i think yeah i think you should be able

2255
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:50,580
to pursue wealth but the the amount of wealth that people can aspire to is insane and horrible

2256
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:57,780
and a nightmare like nobody nobody deserves a billion under but people can no nobody deserves

2257
01:52:57,780 --> 01:53:04,100
under appreciate is good shoes oh my god everyone who thinks like oh you know i can just get by with

that someone like jeff bezos can exist is proof of capitalism has run amuck that's not a complete

2297
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:42,660
thought that's not a moral argument it is a fucking moral argument he has more money than anyone

2301
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:07,540
ben you i think understandably are concerned with how it seems unbalanced and unfair i get that

2302
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:13,540
my concern goes more to okay given that this is reality what can be done to benefit people in it

2303
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:17,460
and so i focus kind of more on that aspect i think you focus on the other i literally think we

2304
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:21,540
i literally think we should just take but jeff bezos's money i literally think we should just

2305
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:26,100
do to an extent via taxes but we should take a lot we should take i think that we should i get it

2306
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:32,340
probably work on uh together as a as a culture we should all get work on uh assassinating the

2307
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:40,740
royal family and redistributing their wealth oh oh here's something that i'd like i'd like to do

2308
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:45,540
i prefer to do it non-violently first i talked to you was like oh i fucking hate the monarchs oh

2309
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:50,340
they have so much fucking money it's so fucked up they're still kings and queens jeff green likes it

2310
01:57:53,860 --> 01:58:00,900
um it's cool that kings and queens exist the queen is a nice lady i saw her once on tv

2311
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:07,700
she's she's fine listen they're fine it's just a it's the it's just the same shit they're just

2312
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:12,340
another dynasty they just have a title that like that like other rich people don't have but it's the

2313
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:17,380
same shit they just inherit their wealth i mean they're just i mean they're fucking they're obviously

2314
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:22,580
you know like luciferian wealth hoarders who like sacrifice children and eat babies and satanic

2315
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:28,340
rituals to prolong their lives i mean but you know they seem like nice people i mean yeah

2316
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:34,580
she waves really politely on tv in a little armored car correlating wealth with just evil

2317
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:39,860
yeah i am can we can we move on guys it is fucking it is fucking wrong that people have so much

2318
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:45,300
what other people have so little it's fucking wrong let's move on please we're not gonna go anywhere

2319
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:51,380
this is why why why you got okay why are you guys so afraid of talking about a real thing only

2320
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:55,460
because i think it's boring to people that's why i'm not afraid to talk about is it not on the

2321
01:58:55,460 --> 01:59:00,900
podcast because we're not going anywhere i mean we've got major whining about how you know it's

2322
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:06,100
you want to hear about camelism and i feel like commenters oh my god i i i we here we are having

2323
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:10,580
like a genuine ideological we're having like a genuine ideological disagree and we have an

2324
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:14,980
actual thing to talk about that we have strong opinions about and we're all like backing off

2325
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:20,660
we're not going to have a real conversation about it it's not going to actually bear any fruit

2326
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:24,420
it's just going to be people screaming at one other at the end of the podcast i guess that is my fear

2327
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:30,660
as well that's the whole fucking we're not going to do anything no matter what value is the real

2328
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:35,300
point so that will be entertaining people will enjoy it people fucking people fucking listen to

2329
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:39,780
this shit no people people listen to people talk about real things all the time i i because they

2330
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:46,660
actually have insight it's not just us or you read i just i look dialogue going on my thing is

2331
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:53,300
that i try to keep it a reverent because i i'm very afraid of being seen as a person who

2332
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:00,020
thinks that my opinion matters yeah okay i don't want to be seen as a creature of vanity

2333
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:06,980
it's it's too it's too it's too late we're all already no i want to i want to remove all vanity

2334
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:13,300
all ego from my existence i want to just exist and be i want to talk about like cheerios i think

2335
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:18,180
that plain cheerios are unfairly maligned they don't need to be honey not they can just be playing

2336
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:23,940
and you can put your own yeah actually i i'll agree with that a hundred percent yeah cheerios

2337
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:29,300
say we can talk for hours about how much i love i mostly feel that i've basically fully articulated

2338
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:38,740
my feelings on the on the subject anyway you know honey not honey not pretty excellent sometimes i

2339
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:43,140
forget how much i do enjoy that honey and then i nut that's how it goes all right over on to the

2340
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:50,980
next uh voicemail okay here we go we have 14 more of these this one's from real rogane let's uh go

2341
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:56,020
gamifying masturbation shut this off

2342
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:08,420
is it is it would it be like if if you masturbate that's like going more hollow and that's a bad thing

2343
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:15,780
you just try not to forever yeah is is is do you win or lose if you know that november like a thing

2344
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:21,620
is that is that content is that stupid that's kind of a game i guess that is kind of masturbation

2345
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:27,940
is not a game i take it very seriously i've always heard like the one sort of game is how many times

2346
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:34,180
can you do it in a day um you know that's a that's yeah probably theoretically i think there was a

2347
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:39,300
boy that died from doing that too much well was that like over a span of time because he like didn't

2348
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:43,620
eat and he like was only doing that or something or was it more that he literally i didn't read the

2349
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:48,020
story i just saw something i would i would be i would be surprised if you could kill yourself in

2350
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:53,140
one day but maybe if you were going for like weeks maybe if you're a true hero you could do it yeah

2351
02:01:53,140 --> 02:02:00,340
maybe one of our fair viewers right out there is gonna be that hero yeah um all right let's move on

2352
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:07,540
the point is game if we game well we can't do it if we gamify it i'll i'll do it during all of that

2353
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:13,060
here's a real actual topic that's not a voicemail uh we've been talking murmurs you know there's just

2354
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:19,540
been some some whispers here and there about brony con 2019 um literally let's just like get a panel

2355
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:23,380
i don't think it would be that hard one of my friends who isn't even a pony person just like

2356
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:28,660
asked for a panel and got one let's just get a panel for the pcp and they will fly us out there

2357
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:34,180
i'm not fucking joking right now yes let's just do it yes yes absolutely would they would they

2358
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:38,820
fly us out there that's the main thing um they would definitely pay for like our expenses in the

2359
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:42,100
sense that like you know we wouldn't have to get a badge and stuff like that we'd be able to go

2360
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:46,740
yeah so that's that's not enough there's a lot of money for me to go there um well we can talk

2361
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:52,020
about it we can we can we can we can email them stuff like that if this is if this is a one weekend

2362
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:56,500
event that costs me no money i would absolutely do it it's just a question of if it's going to

2363
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:02,900
actually be that um so yeah i mean we look into it that's cool with me all right i'm pretty sure

2364
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:07,540
i could get there for not that much yeah i don't mind paying even a little bit of money um but you

2365
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:12,980
know i just don't want to be like a big labor right okay okay if they pay for my hotel and my ticket

2366
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:18,580
i will go uh i'm yeah i don't think they usually do that for panel uh this is really relevant

2367
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:26,100
announcement my cat is on the table and he's adorable that is all excellent will he be at

2368
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:35,540
brony con no well then who gives a shit there's my question oh no no he's not he's never made a

2369
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:39,860
fucking youtube video you're not a real human being if you haven't made a youtube video well

2370
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:46,180
he's like yeah you know don't don't it's not you making youtube videos is so human when when uh

2371
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:51,140
facebook inevitably goes under because facebook is currently the repository of all human information

2372
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:55,380
it's going to be youtube accounts that are the sole currency that we use and only those people

2373
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:59,860
with youtube accounts it's going to be a dystopian nightmare where literal political influence is

2374
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:05,220
determined by subscriber count and is it is it not already that's not even not okay i guess right

2375
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:09,620
just indirectly do voicemail do voicemail do voicemail that was a joke but okay all right

2376
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:17,780
next one is uh cool guy is a completionist uh here we go all right i'm i'm just being cool here

2377
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:24,500
all right it's me again i will buy that fucking shirt soon yeah and yeah i have a dilemma for you

2378
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:31,380

2381
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:52,420
but to watch i don't want to watch your individual shit because it's not the group it's just one

2382
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:55,380
person and individually all of your content sucks

2383
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:05,060
the weaga whatever the shit it's fucking gay anime and i'm trying to watch in the the decompression

2384
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:11,380
chamber and it's fucking gay all of your shit is gay okay i tried arm retrieval like what the

2385
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:16,500

2386
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:23,780
hen home stuck okay um like you uh i don't know give me some content to watch i hear you guys

2387
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:30,180
talk about this aps adventures stop saying what the fuck is a t-bap and how do i find it all right

2388
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:38,180
i was gonna yeah um t-bap is the ultimate pcp content yeah um i was i was gonna say uh i was

2389
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:42,420
gonna say like i have a playlist of every video i've ever been in and digi has one too do you

2390
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:48,260
guys have i know i'm not i'm not that's totally complete yes i do have one i do have one but that's

2391
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:53,460
the thing this guy doesn't give a shit about yeah yeah we're one of best well but he's asking about

2392
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:59,700
t-bap he's asking if he wants group like like if he wants group stuff there's the podd cast uh

2393
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:05,060
there's this chibi backers there's the pony car so in code there's the old there's the old uh

2394
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:12,420
horse casts yep true the horse and yeah the horse is tbbap but actually the yeah the horse cast is

2395
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:17,140
a great idea uh that's a good one on uh that's on digi's channel and i think on jesse i don't know

2396
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:23,300
those those horse casts are like very old like a couple years old and i'm worried about the person

2397
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:30,260
that i was when i recorded them jesse i watched them all extremely recently there's nothing

2398
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:33,700
that i think you would be object to i think you've said way worse things on this very

2399
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:37,220
i'm terrified of anything i've said over a week ago

2400
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:45,700
as we are i watched them like six months ago they're fine um okay but anything else the best

2401
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:51,700
answer is endless war endless war uh i mean i made a vow to not say that or the name of the show

2402
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:56,740
that which it comes from this episode i made a vow to myself well well i did make any such

2403
02:06:56,740 --> 02:07:02,100
i will just i assume you've listened to the bonus episodes but if not that's 21 episodes

2404
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:05,780
right there available so i mean you've probably already watched them if you're a big fan but

2405
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:11,700
five dollar this is pretty deep in there this is this is like deep pcp lore not a lot of people

2406
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:18,260
know about about this particular genre of solo pcp content but there's this guy called mother's

2407
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:29,940
basement and he makes some legit anime uh analysis video essay this guy is just you know he's so

2408
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:36,020
he knows about any i don't know if i'm being sarcastic i don't even know if i'm doing a bit

2409
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:43,140
right now i see yeah uh um some of his content to be quite honest though sometimes he does

2410
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:49,300
waff a lot of it no i actually like jeff a lot i've i've seen like half of a mother's basement

2411
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:57,940
video ever uh i mean it really depends i do like most of his content i he had a video about dug

2412
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:03,060
i mean i mean archie and he had a video about persie jackson and the olympians that i really

2413
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:09,380
liked oh god oh i was really appealing to the zoomers with that one all right uh let's do the

2414
02:08:09,380 --> 02:08:17,780
next fucking call um this is from uh callum k64 apparently dumb so this is a question mainly

2415
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:21,140
for munching so i'm gonna you said you wanted to go to college so you could actually work

2416
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:28,020
it's okay things that you said online like when you yell the n word out on camera

2417
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:32,500
we'll ever come back to like bite you in the ass later like if someone like in the place that

2418
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:38,900
you're working at like see those videos i thought that was a good topic okay all right uh uh this

2419
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:46,180
guy is asking a question which yeah pardon me but i feel like i've said this all before a thousand

2420
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:52,900
times however like i guess like on scattered that name that show the show that won't be named

2421
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:57,940
right streams of stuff and stuff like that uh but the short answer the cliff notes version after

2422
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:05,220
boiling it over a thousand times uh yeah i'm scared it's making me shake my boots but you know

2423
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:10,260
you just gotta do it and you know fucking you know used to have like what am i just going to like be

2424
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:16,420
like it has the potential to ruin my life so i won't do what i want to do no i mean that there's

2425
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:21,220
i mean there's a chance it won't and i think there's a pretty big chance it won't so i'm just

2426
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:26,900
going to have to continue doing what i want in my life and hope that people don't take too seriously

2427
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:32,740
what i said was when i was 15 i mean of course in our current culture that might be unlikely

2428
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:38,100
but i mean you just got a chance it's only gonna get more common for people to be to like discover

2429
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:42,260
like you know raunchy stuff people said when they were younger as time goes it's going to

2430
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:47,940
become less and less of a big deal i think so yeah it really especially because of like like kids

2431
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:53,540
nowadays these zoomers doing like open role play on twitter like erp like all over the place just

2432
02:09:53,540 --> 02:10:00,260
publicly like this all like totally out there yeah and then kids and that's just gonna be with them

2433
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:04,820
forever they're gonna have a whole generation of people who have nothing to they can't hide anything

2434
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:09,380
so so hiding stuff will not we won't be a big deal it's all gonna swing the other way like once

2435
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:14,980
the once the zoomers start becoming irrelevant and a better newer generation takes their place

2436
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:19,860
then maybe we'll be we'll have we'll have some room again the groomers

2437
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:27,940
the tumors on the big the big bumping babies that's gonna be the name of

2438
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:29,060
them

2439
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:36,900
not the baby boomers just the big bumping babies the generation that hashtag stays babies and just

2440
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:41,700
stays babies their whole life it's i'm waiting babies for life that's the millennials you did

2441
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:47,460
already happen i guess you're right real ones stay thank god i have something this fun is i have

2442
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:52,500
something i have something i have something unrelated uh to mention it's just a side note

2443
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:57,300
thinking about the the t-bar made me remember okay so i said i've said before i'm making

2444
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:01,220
though that winnie the pooh video and it's probably gonna be out right now when you're

2445
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:08,180
listening to this uh but i googled a little bit and the only other person i could find who like

2446
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:13,060
had reviewed episodes of the new adventures of one of the poo is someone that i think we know

2447
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:19,460
it was a yeah it was a pony guy called the autistic brownie remember him oh yeah yeah he did

2448
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:24,180
yeah he did a cut he's the only other guy so it's me and him man it's me once again

2449
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:29,300
for like that's a crowded field for sure you're playing with the big boys now

2450
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:34,340
i should reach i should reach out to him why not do a collab dog that's how you do a collab

2451
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:38,660
yeah do a collab what do you have a pony you'll see you can do it autistic autistic brownie what are

2452
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:46,420
you doing in my interview uh uh uh i i i also i chose that uh message that munchie responded

2453
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:50,820
to already uh specifically just because uh i knew he had responded to it before but i i wanted to

2454
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:56,500
double down and just add my voice to the chorus people uh that i also think that uh like just

2455
02:11:56,500 --> 02:12:03,300
imagine the world where anything you've said as a child or in any context can be absolutely stripped

2456
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:08,980
of context and used you know in the worst possible way to disparage you maybe society will end up

2457
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:13,860
that way but that just sounds like it did fucking be destroyed so whatever where they're all gonna

2458
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:20,180
die anyway um so i definitely even on this podcast again i made extremely off-color jokes

2459
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:25,220
but they are in fact fucking jokes and i can defend everything i've ever said uh in my humble

2460
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:30,900
opinion and if people just don't accept that then frankly do you even want to like have yourself

2461
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:35,940
in a situation where the people that like are judging you would make that determination and be

2462
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:41,060
willingly uh willing to like strip things of context and condemn you even if you can make a

2463
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:46,740
case i don't i would rather not even work for those people so you know i emancipate yourself

2464
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:50,820
you're gonna be like mad sad nate you're just gonna be up on the you're gonna be up on the

2465
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:54,900
testimonial block and everyone's they're gonna bring out the pedophile accusations and all your

2466
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:59,380
leaked chat room things you're just like no it was a joke it was a joke that was all a joke

2467
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:05,940
that's gonna be me yeah it's gonna it's gonna be me all right let's um that's that's a good

2468
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:10,180
that was a good millennial reference these fucking zoomers won't understand it it won't

2469
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:18,100
fucking get it all right uh next one's from i like it uh from the chad ideas guy let's uh

2470
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:24,580
let's see what he's got for yeah you've all talked about inviting new guests onto the pcp for just

2471
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:32,260
one episode or so so why haven't you all done it already like seriously it's getting uh it's

2472
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:38,580
getting pretty dry with just the same old standard cast talking about the same old bullshit so why

2473
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:44,900
don't we get some interesting characters in there that aren't prerecorded uh well hold on uh we

2474
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:49,140
haven't had a guest in a long time first of all we haven't talked about it a long time and last

2475
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:55,700
time we did we had like two people on we were planning to have someone but they they couldn't

2476
02:13:55,700 --> 02:14:00,260
make it they're okay well i remember remember the whole thing about when i was trying to get

2477
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:05,620
laser by yes on here and he like led me on a fucking wild goose chase only very hard to get

2478
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:10,900
that guess only to reveal that actually i have no internet or microphone so i can't be on well

2479
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:17,220
yeah it was very it was very hard to depend on people people are worthless yeah uh yeah agreed

2480
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:21,780
agreed um i'm just gonna throw out there you know i um uh i do think we should have i'm you know

2481
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:25,860
what i'll make it up not a real commitment but uh zen huckstable come on the show come on the

2482
02:14:25,860 --> 02:14:30,100
show zen huckstable oh yeah i think you're cool oh yeah i like you so come on the show agreed um i

2483
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:35,780
don't talk about it i just think it is down to uh two days ago oh sorry would you say jesse i think

2484
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:40,500
i think we're all in agreement that guests are good it's just that we're all stupid and lazy

2485
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:46,100
and that's absolutely true i mean it's hard to convince people to come on a show where it's so

2486
02:14:46,820 --> 02:14:50,100
like they don't know what they're getting into they really especially after this episode

2487
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:56,500
i mean i i've heard about this a lot i have actually i won't i mean like people who i have

2488
02:14:56,500 --> 02:15:01,780
talked to i've offered to come on have said no for various reasons and one of them is just

2489
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:07,140
the show is overwhelming if you don't know all of us and like yeah like you can't just mesh in if

2490
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:12,100
you're like a new guy um just kind of an awkward fit it just yeah i don't know if i would want to

2491
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:17,940
be a guest on a coming onto a show where it's like seven people screaming at each other yeah i absolutely

2492
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:23,940
wouldn't so like i totally get why people don't want to i totally we we could try and like make

2493
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:30,500
a different show that is not the progress natus podcast which is about making it very like we

2494
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:34,980
have the same hosts every time and there's not a lot of them and it's all about asking questions

2495
02:15:34,980 --> 02:15:39,860
in order in order to have a guest it has to be like no more than three people yeah it should be

2496
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:45,380
something like that yeah i think like a guest is like it a guest should be like an interview situation

2497
02:15:45,940 --> 02:15:50,740
absolutely yeah so the structure of this show as a free form there's like seven of us right now

2498
02:15:50,740 --> 02:15:54,740
not great for guests but we could do something different um although somebody like zen i think

2499
02:15:54,740 --> 02:16:00,500
would come on and and do just fine as is or somebody like um i don't know who else have we had uh

2500
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:05,860
whatever various people can be fine so yeah we'll we'll work on it people we'll try to we'll try to

2501
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:11,620
get some more fucking shit going on uh all right next voicemail here we go this one's from uh our

2502
02:16:11,620 --> 02:16:17,780
old friend or rather our new friend kishin slayer aka sword man is calling in again yeah update us

2503
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:23,140
yo it's the sword man again since the last episode was a seriously shitty episode to ask

2504
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:28,900
a question of the entire pcp i'll just hope this episode works better to re-establish my goal

2505
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:33,700
is to make a lark sword for all of y'all who want one digi and ben have theirs mostly on lock

2506
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:38,740
but sadly i do not have the seven hearts of light and 13 shards of darkness to reforge the key blade

2507
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:43,940
for nate if he wants i could make him a katana so he could become a true calming the motherfucker like

2508
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:50,580
me but he would first have to man up and then maybe dm me to find any specific lens if you're

2509
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:54,500
lazy like digi then i would appreciate it if you at least specify what you would like to use your

2510
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:59,380
weapon for since i have to make the choice between a wall hanging sword and a whacking sword this

2511
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:04,260
this is an excellent opportunity for me to stretch my limits but understand i can't make stable

2512
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:10,900
curves very well you can dm me at sword man in the rfck discord or just use the email and the speak

2513
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:19,220
pipe i'm gonna i have i have unread notifications on discord from sword man right now in trouble

2514
02:17:19,220 --> 02:17:25,700
i was talking to him the other day i was talking to him the other day about about my specs i gave

2515
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:30,900
him my my design it's gonna be okay first of all i've already talked to sword man we've got my

2516
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:34,340
sword sword down it's the best sort of all time and it's gonna blow all of you out of the water

2517
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:39,140
even you hippo you think you're cool no give do you want to give us any details on what yours is

2518
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:47,220
i specifically don't want anyone to know okay okay um i don't mind saying that it is uh i like

2519
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:52,100
swords that are like historically kind of accurate so it will just look like a real sword but with

2520
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:58,900
subtle iconography that sounds cool i you know what like i could just say make me the komino katana

2521
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:03,060
i'm gonna think about it a little bit more and get back to you yeah i'll think about that ben i'm

2522
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:07,780
i'm gonna level the keyblade though scrap it i'm gonna level with you and this is not a joke or

2523
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:16,660
like any sort of podcast performance it it yeah please try just try to respond to me more

2524
02:18:18,020 --> 02:18:23,860
ocean please i i know i left you hanging for like for like three days this has been a ben thing as

2525
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:29,860
long as i've known ben ben's always been terrible at responding and extremely slow you know in the

2526
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:39,300
mind slow in the mind yeah yeah uh well i know you wanted to record an rfck thing and i after

2527
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:44,420
after new years i got sick and i didn't want to do it which is why i didn't say anything about it

2528
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:50,340
you could have just said i'm sick let's do it after i'm sick and i would have been okay and then

2529
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:54,740
no i know you know i know i could have done that it's bullshit that just because someone messages you

2530
02:18:54,740 --> 02:19:00,100
you're expected to respond like it's on you now it's munchy though it's not like just some random

2531
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:05,220
guy like this is a close acquaintance and co-worker and friend you know it's uh a little bit different

2532
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:13,620
of a context than like you know i mean are you picking it up i can't i can't i kind of agree

2533
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:18,740
jesse but i am i know i should have said something all i'm saying is that it makes me very distraught

2534
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:24,580
and upset and mad all the time well whenever i want to get a hold of you i can never do it and

2535
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:30,660
it makes me like you a little bit less unironically well crap that's funny because the reason i don't

2536
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:36,340
respond to people is because i'm afraid that they don't like me and it's and it's a self-fulfilling

2537
02:19:36,340 --> 02:19:43,700
prophecy fantastic okay short man good time we'll get back to you dog um uh okay so this is from next

2538
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:50,500
one's from dave dave uh go dave strider nate why do you keep letting through voicemail

2539
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:55,860
people this horrible recording quality you sound like they are speaking directly onto the microphone

2540
02:19:55,860 --> 02:20:01,700
and even worse european accents that i do not understand they make the words and i don't understand

2541
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:06,420
what they are saying and then you respond and i get confused because i don't know what they are

2542
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:13,380
responding to it's terrible there's no one speak english what are the sounds they make what his life

2543
02:20:13,380 --> 02:20:19,060
help um okay uh good despite trying to sound terribly sounded all right and i could understand

2544
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:23,300
everything you said too good at this he's too good such the undermine his own point of having

2545
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:27,940
terrible audibility and uh like his recording quality was pretty great i bet he has a good microphone

2546
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:33,940
um so yeah blue yeti sounded like he just he just sounded really fancy he sounded french

2547
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:41,300
fucking owned yeah uh debunked atheists kill yourself all right next one uh from cheesy manfredo

2548

cheesy manfredo uh go hey ben saint i hear you're in the market for some beef yeah well if you want

2549
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:53,220
some i got some for you you see i also make my own webcomic it's called bongo and luna and it's

2550
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:57,620
basically the opposite of all your comics first of all i draw it all traditionally therefore i know

2551
02:20:57,620 --> 02:21:01,860
how much you hate that shit it's colored and unlike your bitch ass who's always fucking late

2552
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:06,740
my comic updates twice every week i also upload our webtoon which is the rival platform that

2553
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:13,620
tapas so we got that shit going for us but we get personal i am a full-blooded mexican so we

2554
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:18,100
could have a race war kind of thing going for us i'm also way younger than you like my early 20s

2555
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:23,140
younger and that could open the way for a boomer versus boomer kind of situation that's your thing

2556
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:27,780
yep i'm also a clown so i could be your joker you know you always complain about society and you

2557
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:33,700
could be batman is this just a villain i'm here for you my twitter is at cheesy manfredo my webcomic

2558
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:38,340
is bongo and luna and my dms are open for you man and you could fuck off with that stupid ass

2559
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:43,060
endless warship it's fucking gay have a good day oh oh i fucking hate this guy

2560
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:48,660
nate why did nate why did you choose this one because he's attacking you personally and that's

2561
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:53,700
funny to me that's why this was just an ad but yeah this voicemail was just an ad i was aware

2562
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:57,380
that it was an ad i thought the fact that he was attacking you made me laugh enough that

2563
02:21:57,380 --> 02:22:02,100
it justified playing it even despite that i didn't like that it was an ad but you know i'm not gonna

2564
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:08,260
cut that out or whatever it's fucking annoying uh you know i started i upload maryweather keeps

2565
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:16,660
pushing the uh the uh not tapas what's the other webtoon uh i haven't i like uploaded everything

2566
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:21,860
there but i haven't like made it public because i don't know no how come i don't like tapas or

2567
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:27,620
webtoon um but i actually have like thousands of followers on tapas and i just forget about them all

2568
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:33,780
the time uh they're they're an abuse group the ben saint followers on on tapas what does it stand

2569
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:40,100
for the tap the tapas followers two angry profiles are it's a thing you eat i don't think it stands

2570
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:47,220
for anything it's it's food uh go to a ps adventures dot site read a real webcomic that is good only

that was you who drew that one i'm aware of that jack is boy is a cool guy whose content i do like

2597
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:36,980
but these thirsty ass voicemails need to end just stop getting drunk and doing them i mean

2598
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:43,140
i'm a big uh anti-alcohol guy uh it just makes you dumb and not better at anything so i think

2599
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:48,420
there's a problem right there you got to work on that dog uh just be sober when you decide to do

2600
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:53,860
things that are cool and that goes for everyone in the world um i guess that's just my personal

2601
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:59,460
message to jack is boy let's move on to the next fucking voice mail we're a straight edge podcast

2602
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:04,020
now um you know what i'm gonna skip this one there was a fairly cool one from lane fag but

2603
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:08,340
it's just some lane audio so i'm just gonna fucking skip that one um yeah all right here we go don't

2604
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:16,660
do this one instead is from uh nate's hr department let's see what they have uh this is bill from hr

2605
02:26:16,660 --> 02:26:21,300
and we just wanted to let nate know that he doesn't have to threaten interns with death if they speak

2606
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:27,860
about the pcp podcast i don't know like it's not a big deal so just just calm down you don't have

2607
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:34,820
to threaten him he's really scared actually oh contraire bill uh you have to curb this before it

2608
02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:39,540
gets out of hand and you have to crush those who could expose your secret cool internet identity

2609
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:45,700
before it leaks uh to the wider populace um okay i i guess that's it i guess that's it

2610
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:54,180
glad that's sorted i like slightly related to to stuff like that um since like stopping youtube

2611
02:26:54,180 --> 02:27:02,500
now no longer being a youtuber as career um it's like doubly awkward now when like people who

2612
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:08,900
are only just like coming to terms with the fact that i have an internet job because i've told them

2613
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:14,580
once are asking me about how it's going and i have to explain to them that i've stopped and it's like

2614
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:21,140
i don't know i mean you can definitely just say to someone excuse me i i get that like switching

2615
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:25,140
tracks is kind of annoying for that but you could just tell someone that you're a writer

2616
02:27:25,140 --> 02:27:30,100
which is a pretty good i mean i do that now that's what i do but like for for everyone who i had to

2617
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:35,860
like explain like uh i i do an internet thing i mean you wouldn't know like i had to do that and

2618
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:40,900
now they'd know that and now i have to undo it for everyone that knows that i guess if it was me i'd

2619
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:46,180
probably him and haw to like try to just say that it's going well i'm doing writing because like it

2620
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:50,340
technically is you know i mean it is online in the sense you communicate via the internet

2621
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:56,420
i get the point though okay fair enough all right so so our last three messages are all

2622
02:27:56,420 --> 02:28:02,420
somewhat related and i just want to remind everyone there was an active hot war going on between the

2623
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:08,740
discourse oh and uh these last three are are various messages about that we didn't talk about this

2624
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:13,780
did we talk about it would you say gib we didn't talk we didn't talk about the word oh yeah not

2625
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:18,180
to this point but i'm sure we'll have plenty to say uh as we get through these let's start with

2626
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:23,940
this first one this is a message from uh afy kuhn uh there's some big news people so listen up

2627
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:35,620
december 30th 2018 the rfck discord invades the poti discord

2628
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:44,820
they at spam everyone hitting both crew members and civilians alike

2629
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:52,500
the captains don't take kindly to it they nuke those motherfuckers right out of orbit

2630
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:59,940
banning them back to their terrible home we launch a counterattack hit them back with

2631
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:09,620
whatever we have been in their mad rage insanity overflows and they at ping themselves over 1,000

2632
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:20,260
700 times they destroyed themselves in a blaze of glory and for that i can respect them some

2633
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:28,020
but in the end they lost rest in peace rfck

2634
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:39,140
you will be missed god if it only for that easy we'll be back we'll be back stronger than ever

2635
02:29:39,140 --> 02:29:46,180
big news the poti escort isn't meeting even more servers everybody run

2636
02:29:51,060 --> 02:29:56,180
there it is uh they've they've actually personally launched raids on my personal

2637
02:29:56,180 --> 02:30:01,700
discords um i don't know what they hope to gain considering i'm already on their side um

2638
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:09,540
but they in fighting in fighting has indeed they're too aggressive um well i mean i they've

2639
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:15,060
invaded like my discord as well but on my discord i'm canonically someone else i'm hippo and then

2640
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:19,620
like the pirate me is like fighting me so like i will shit talk myself yeah from each

2641
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:24,260
i'll probably do that too and it's it's fucking funny as evaded but in our talk where people post

2642
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:30,420
other people's art or their own art they posted like the flag and the fanner so it's the flag

2643
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:34,820
waving that african made yeah yeah so that's not like i don't know it's not a meeting he's just

2644
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:41,140
showing off art i guess it was a it was a nice little invasion uh just to leave their stamp and

2645
02:30:41,140 --> 02:30:47,220
move on their way um sounds like uh sounds like a rose boy civil war a little bit it's all right

2646
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:52,020
things are coming down they know that their friendly fire uh needs to be corrected okay next

2647
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:57,860
one this is from them snakes we've got them snakes calling in again not everyone's favorite here we go

2648
02:30:57,860 --> 02:31:05,140
jesus okay i've done it i killed crunchy

2649
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:17,460
he had to die several weeks ago he impersonated me in a previous voicemail

2650
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:28,020

2651
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:42,020

2652
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:53,060

2656
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:27,220
in the in the in ben saint ben's cathedral um i think we should i think we should team up

2657
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:32,500
i think we uh i think we have common interests we've been discussing actually how there's no

2658
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:38,660
way if the rfck community united that any other single force would be able to stand against them

2659
02:32:38,660 --> 02:32:42,820
that probably is that they themselves are divided by infighting between the killers and the rowdies

2660
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:48,900
at all times one day they're they're they're they're and when they do come together it's just a

2661
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:56,180
curb stomp some juveniles indeed which we can all celebrate across every discord uh all right

2662
02:32:56,180 --> 02:33:01,460
one final message from chirpskay this is the last one and then we're done here we go go
