1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Now, this video was just me throwing out my own personal opinion, with no intent to shove my thought down anyone's throats,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,400
or to persuade anyone to feel bad for having different tastes from me.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,400
However, that doesn't seem to be how a lot of people interpreted it.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,200
Commenters, please kill yourselves and free me from this living hell.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,200
If your comment is mean and snide, then you can just fuck off and die.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Why do you feel entitled to spewing your bullshit attitude?

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,800
You're rude and crude and I hate you, so kill yourselves please and be cool.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
I pronounced the word wrong, I don't care.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,800
I didn't represent you, yeah, no shit, I am myself motherfucker.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Think I got a bad attitude, well you ain't seen shit.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
A shadow banned your ass to deal with it.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the process.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I am the best guy ever and we're joined today by Munchy where his tiny ass.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I've made it an irreplaceable hobby of mine to just draw and doodle on Pokemon cards

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,800
and sell them at a profit at local schools and flooding the market with my own artistic mashup pieces

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
on top of Geodudes and Machobs.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Excellent, Hippocrates is here.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Commenter rules, more like commenter eulogy, if you know what I'm saying.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Yes, excellent. Tom Oliver is here.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I just woke up, but I'm here anyway, I'm going to do it, I'm going to comment on comments.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
And Ben St.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
No comments.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Because I haven't heard the whole podcast yet.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Oh excellent, that's a good one.

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Incidentally, this is the procrastinator's podcast, a podcast with a bunch of internet boys

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,800
who are just here to talk about a bunch of stuff that we like, we all make stuff and we're all here.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Spread our intellect across the interweb.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I just looked at my hand and there's blood all over it, I should be fine, but I'm scared.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I think they're already fighting back.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh yeah, they're attacking from the future.

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I will say I've bled on the PCP more times and I've bled off the PCP, that's not a joke, that's accurate.

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Okay, I was going to say I've made your woman bleed, but I don't know why I was going to say that.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
That would be hard to understand.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
So today, we're talking about, it's Commentary Rules Number Two.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Commentary Rules Two everybody.

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
It's been a long time coming.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Yeah, Commentary Rules is one of our most proudest grace achievements from the past, from the good old days

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
when this podcast had a real good fan base and everyone was real nice and it was a great popular time

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,800
but now we're just surrounded by fools and geeks and goblins and everyone hates us now.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
One of our seminal works for sure.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
And just as a fun history lesson, I'm just going back, I've got it pulled up here.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,800
That was episode 14 of the PCP and I think this is episode 85 that this is going to be.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah, I think that's right.

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Yeah, and that was on April 3rd of 2016 that came out, so it's been almost two years.

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Look at year and a half, I guess, which is a long time.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
We've been doing this thing for quite a while now, fellas.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Jesus fucking Christ.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
And exactly what do we have to show for it?

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Absolutely nothing.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Yeah, it's pretty sick.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
The comments have indeed descended.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Our old selves would be so ashamed of our current comment section.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
That's true.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,800
You guys made a vow to ban all the people who disrespected and disregarded your Commentary Rules

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,800
and I think it's time we reinstate those rules and then stay true to our word.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
You're not wrong.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm for savage law enforcement.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm for some excessive force.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
With the release of the...

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I've come to a new appreciation of respecting the law after the Mad Bull, you know,

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Plebe and the Weeb has come out, so yeah.

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Well, I mean, you were there.

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
It's not like now that you've...

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Well, you just reminded of it, I guess.

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,800
The first time didn't do the trick, but the second time was really the charm for experiencing it.

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
To learn what Mad Bull was trying to teach us all along.

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Let me tell you this right now, commenters.

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
After we're done with you, you're just going to be shouting Michael Brown in the fucking streets

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
because we're going to use excessive force.

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
You're going to be saying to the hands up, please kill me.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Before we get into any of the discussion about Commentary Entitlement and Commentary Rules,

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I would just like to make a motion to ban any retarded offline analogies to like parties or shopping malls

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,800
or any sort of like non-literal, non-virtual, non-multiplayer focused first-person shooter,

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
like apartheid simulator.

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
They all get muddled and argued upon on the basis of their semantics

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
and they actually get to the point of the heart of the issue

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
and turn the entire thing into like a big old farce.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Let's keep things real, literal, and argue about things that are like comments in the real world

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
as they appear not in fantasy lands.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I don't understand.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I'll do my dance.

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
There was a lot of analogies made and we went around in circles.

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,800
There's an inherent difference between someone saying words and you reading text.

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
There's an inherent difference in which you keep the internet issues

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
in the context of them being on the internet.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh, I see.

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Yeah, all right, sure.

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's our focus here.

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
That's what we do.

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
That's where we live.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Okay, understood.

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
So one of the reasons that we bring this up is because there's been a couple of discussions,

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
as Monchi just said, about a commenter entitlement.

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Both Digi made a couple of videos.

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
He made one, people responded, and then he made a response to the responses to his video about that issue.

96
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
And Davoo also made one.

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
So you can go check out their channels if you want to see what they're talking about.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Yes, those videos will be relevantly linked in the description for you to go look at.

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
If you remember that, I'll put it in.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll log in and put it in.

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Okay, all right.

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Yeah, great.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Yeah, they're good context for this.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
So that's sort of, there's been, you know, we've all evolved.

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It's been like a year and a half, over a year and a half since the first commenter rules.

106
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
We've all grown, things have changed on the PCP and in our lives,

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
and we've all got new things to drink at the table.

108
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
And the hot topic right now is this commenter entitlement.

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
So I don't know, Monchi, you want to tell us what you know about this?

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
How do you stand on this?

111
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Where do I stand on commenters as a whole or with commenter entitlement as described?

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I guess specifically entitlement, but wherever you want, really.

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I am a pro comment boy.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I'm one of the least, I guess, hawkish of my comments.

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
But then again, I guess that's because I'm the little guy.

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I don't have a lot of comments to police.

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,800
But as a whole, I see a lot of good things come out of comments.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I like reading good comments, and I very rarely get bad comments.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
And whenever I do, they don't really impact me as much as my other people.

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I mean, I always want to salute you that despite the fact that Andrew Hussey

121
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
incessantly shitposts on every episode of Armour Travel that comes out,

122
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,800
you retain your strength and you're a respect for the law,

123
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
and you don't ban him out.

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,800
How would it reflect on me to destroy the person who's given me so much,

125
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
a.k.a. Brahmal, my favorite webcomic artist?

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Yeah, commenter entitlement.

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I think it's really up to the creator to do it every once.

128
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I just like comments. I just like comments a lot.

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
So I don't like when they go.

130
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I think I'm the only person who likes to see comments

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
and I would be sad if they were all deleted and disabled.

132
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Well, all right, as a other, like, small-ish YouTuber,

133
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I agree that sometimes, like, for me personally,

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,800
the comments on my videos are so few that, you know,

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
there aren't that many really bad ones and there are, you know,

136
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
there's quite a lot of good ones and it's nice to read all of them.

137
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,800
If I had a video that was, like, actually popular with hundreds of thousands of views

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,800
getting comments all the time, I would not want to see any of them.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,800
They would be terrible and I would want to disable the comments.

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Just because I've seen on other people's channels how absolutely terrible it is

141
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and I can't imagine having that as, like, a notification stream for me.

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I don't want that. So, like, I see both sides of it.

143
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Yeah, well, you know, I mean, none of us are huge YouTubers,

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
especially on this right now.

145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Digi, of course, is the biggest of us who's historically gotten the most comments.

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I currently, I think, anyway, have the second biggest channel.

147
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Actually, Mage might be ahead of me at something.

148
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I think she is. Last I knew.

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,800
I think she is. But in any case, like, the point is I am starting to get to the point where

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I still actually get notifications to my phone every time I get a comment,

151
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
just because I enjoy reading them. And that's the thing.

152
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm starting to get comments, like, every, I don't know,

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
every couple of hours I get a notification that I've got a new comment,

154
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
which is a pretty steady stream of them.

155
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
And I definitely get some bad ones, some annoying ones, especially when...

156
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Well, here's what it comes down to.

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Like, the bigger your audience gets, the more, like, normal randos

158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
who don't really know your history or your thing and are just likeable,

159
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
are likely to take the least charitable interpretation of your content possible,

160
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
or a less one, you know, they have less context.

161
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Like, for example, I just made a video about how I hate League of Legends.

162
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
It was inevitable that a lot of people who like League of Legends,

163
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
you know, want to protest against this and call me an asshole, call me a piece of shit,

164
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
say that I'm being a bully.

165
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Absolutely fools.

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Monsters, little trolls, little goblins.

167
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,800
And I don't like hearing them.

168
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
You know, I don't like hearing people insult me or tell me that I'm wrong and stuff,

169
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
but it's still worth it for me at this point to get the comments,

170
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
because I do see people agree.

171
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
And, you know, I get a little endorphin rush when I see a comment,

172
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
so I still like that. That's still fun.

173
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I think I just want to say for myself,

174
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,800
the only reason I create any art or show my face in any public scenario whatsoever

175
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
or even wake up in the morning is so people can say that they like me

176
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
and that they think I'm doing a good job.

177
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Of course.

178
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
That's the only reason I do anything in my entire life.

179
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
I think a lot of people agree on that.

180
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Whenever I get a good comment, that validates me making the art in the first place.

181
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
That's the only reason I fucking do literally anything.

182
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Well, here, let me counter-argue.

183
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't necessarily agree with the subtext that I think I'm hearing

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
in what you guys, especially you Nate, are saying.

185
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I don't think that a comment that disagrees with you is bad.

186
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Not only do I not think it's a quote-unquote bad comment,

187
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
like a shitty comment by an asshole,

188
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
I don't even see it as like a negative thing,

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
because I don't know, that's discussion.

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
And if people are discussing your content,

191
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
even if they're disagreeing with you,

192
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
that's still like a mark, that's still good.

193
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I hear what you're saying, but your biggest video is your Christian lecture,

194
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
and there are plenty of comments on that,

195
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
like look at these autistic assholes.

196
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I love those. I actually love those.

197
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You love them, huh?

198
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I mean, it's really funny, and I'm not insulted,

199
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
because I know this person has no idea what they're talking about.

200
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
And you know, I am a big loser, so fair enough, fair play on their part.

201
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I don't know.

202
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
I guess a little part of me is bothered by it,

203
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,800
but a much bigger part of me is like...

204
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,800
When it comes to the subject of mean people,

205
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,800
I notice a lot in my comic session.

206
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
A lot of people trying to be ironically mean,

207
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
and I guess I kind of parade that air around me,

208
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised when that happens.

209
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
But there's a clear distinction in my mind

210
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,800
between a bad comment and a comment that is mean,

211
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
or a bad one, since it doesn't like the video.

212
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
It's completely fine, and I don't care,

213
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,800
and it doesn't even bug me at all when someone doesn't like the video.

214
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I obviously, as I say before, I live for the compliments,

215
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
but you know, just because someone doesn't like it,

216
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
it's not going to be the end of the world for me.

217
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,800
What I don't like is the le epic, funny, mean comments

218
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
that are trying to be cutesy and get me to like them

219
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
by being rude and weird.

220
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
A lot of the time on Armitrable,

221
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
most of the time Armitrable comments are fantastic,

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
and I love them, but every once in a while,

223
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
there's a really weird, snooty comment that I don't understand.

224
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
That's one of the main things.

225
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I understand a lot of the comments made by bizarre people,

226
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,800
and it really, I just want a comment section

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
full of people who not just like what I like,

228
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
or you know, like what I put out, I mean, you know, I would like that,

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
but I just want ones where I can understand what they're saying,

230
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
and you know, I think like, you know, the autistic,

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
look at all these autistic people.

232
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I would get annoyed by that, but I don't think,

233
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
like if it was just, you know, some funny comment

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
that was negatively impacting, you know,

235
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
it was negative on the video itself.

236
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
I wouldn't get mad at that.

237
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I don't think that's immune from me liking that comment.

238
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
It all just depends on the context of the comment, you know?

239
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Well, I know what you're saying.

240
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, I do, and I think that's a good way to segue into

241
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
like the describing of the actual entitlement phenomenon

242
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
that's been discussed recently.

243
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
So like, you're talking about not liking, you know,

244
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
certain people who post particularly like me-me comments,

245
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
or people like trying to bait out upvotes and whatnot,

246
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
and that's sort of the issue that Digi was talking about

247
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
and DeVue and whatnot.

248
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
So the specific discussion that's been about the entitlement

249
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
of commenters is that, so right now,

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
YouTube is built in such a way that the comments are basically

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
an intrinsic part of every YouTube video,

252
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,800
and what Digi is talking about in his discussion is that

253
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,800
things do not have to be that way.

254
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
There could be social, not even social media,

255
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
but there could be like video uploading platforms

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
that simply do not have a comment section

257
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
and contrary to people's belief,

258
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,800
that does not violate your First Amendment rights

259
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
or any of those ridiculous claims that some people say.

260
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
That's, you know, that's not how that works.

261
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
And if someone chooses to close the comments, again,

262
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
that is not violating your rights,

263
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
because as Digi says repeatedly,

264
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
you can just go anywhere else you want

265
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
and make a comment on Reddit, on your Facebook,

266
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
you know, whatever you want to do.

267
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
The platform specifically allows for comments to be curated

268
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
and for comment sections to be closed.

269
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
I don't understand how you can argue

270
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
that it's wrong to do that in any way.

271
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
All of us here are totally comfortable.

272
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
It's not really like that it's wrong.

273
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I mean, most people, I don't know whether they actually think

274
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
it's wrong to close comments,

275
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
but they do think that it's cowardly,

276
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
because it implies things.

277
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
There's just like this arrow of like,

278
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I can't take it, therefore, I'm closing the comments,

279
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
which isn't true, it's just I would rather not.

280
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
This is the big issue at the heart of this.

281
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Do commenters deserve to have comments?

282
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Commenters don't deserve anything.

283
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
The word deserve, the word deserve there is the critical one there,

284
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
because again, the commenting is honestly, it is a privilege.

285
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
It is not a right.

286
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Someone has to choose to give it to you.

287
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
But hang on, I think Tom is going to say something.

288
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Tom, did you want to jump in?

289
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Well, I was just going to say that I feel like we're talking,

290
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
like, I haven't watched Digi's videos,

291
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
and I probably should have.

292
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I just watched Davoo's.

293
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
But in terms of just what we're talking about with comments

294
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
and how Digi is saying,

295
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
like we need a platform where comments aren't a thing,

296
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
like YouTube can be that,

297
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
like you can have your entire channel have no comments

298
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,800
if you want to have your content presented in that context.

299
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Yeah, but I think Digi's responding to the attitude people have,

300
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
where like they would call him like, you know,

301
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
a failure or a coward, or fighting their rights.

302
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I mean, I guess my perspective on all this is that,

303
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
like, I would never close my comment section because

304
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Yeah, but why does it have to be?

305
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Of course they would do that.

306
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Like, why can't we try and change their mind?

307
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Because here's the thing.

308
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Like, you're saying how people come into YouTube

309
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
and have this, like,

310
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
and they have like this expectation of comments.

311
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
But like, you're coming in here onto the platform of YouTube,

312
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
which is a social network,

313
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
which has this whole community aspect.

314
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Like, you're coming onto this platform

315
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
and people are coming to you with the expectation

316
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
to be part of the conversation.

317
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Like, that's why YouTube is successful

318
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
and that's why people like it.

319
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
It's because you have this, like,

320
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
smaller barrier of entry to, like, talking to a creator.

321
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
And while that's where you can argue the merits

322
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
of whether that's good or bad, that's the expectation.

323
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
That's why people are here.

324
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
And that's why people like comments,

325
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
is because they want to be able to be part of the discussion of the video.

326
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
You are completely right.

327
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
And I'm sure that played some role

328
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
in the growth of YouTube up to this point.

329
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I couldn't agree more.

330
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
That's definitely a plus that draws people to this website.

331
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
That ability to relate to what people are saying.

332
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
And I think guys like Digi might actually be undercounting.

333
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
If there was a platform where people couldn't comment,

334
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
they might be less likely to actually get into it,

335
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
because, you know, they want to be part of the conversation.

336
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Well, I mean, because you think of, like, something like Netflix.

337
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Netflix doesn't have comments or anything.

338
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
People can't comment on, like, the content and stuff.

339
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
So it's a totally different feel in terms of, like,

340
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
a platform that versus YouTube.

341
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
It's like gun control.

342
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Like, fucking comments are guns.

343
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
And as Americans, you have comments.

344
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
You have guns.

345
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
You can't take that away.

346
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
When people know they can have guns,

347
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
it's impossible to take them away.

348
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
But in countries that have never really had guns,

349
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
like the UK, I mean, we aren't clamoring for them.

350
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
We just, you know, they're just not a thing you can have.

351
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
You just really, really would like them.

352
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
You really like to be able to kill everyone.

353
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

354
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
I don't, I don't think about...

355
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
No, Toria's school shooter Hippocrates.

356
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Why is guns in the UK?

357
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
I'm never, I'm never, like, thinking,

358
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
man, I really should, I really should,

359
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
to have a shotgun right now.

360
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I really want that.

361
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
But it never comes up.

362
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Well, the difference is just that, like, there's a...

363
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I mean, it kind of isn't tried in law.

364
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
If I said no world, like, real life analogies, guys.

365
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I know, but I thought it was funny.

366
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
But the point is, the point is,

367
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
comments are a thing.

368
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Changing the public perception would be nice,

369
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
but it's kind of impossible to, like,

370
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
make people think that turning off the comments

371
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
isn't, uh, I don't know,

372
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
whatever, cowardly, or whatever they would think.

373
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
But it's impossible to change that completely.

374
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
But I think there should be some sort of, like,

375
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,800
you need, um, you know, 10,000 subs

376
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
in order to comment on this video.

377
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Like, just some sort of, like, way to...

378
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
That would essentially be the exact same thing.

379
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Because, like, 99% of people don't have 10,000 subs.

380
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
The majority of people who use YouTube

381
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
use it as a content consumption platform only.

382
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Yeah.

383
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
So, right.

384
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
My problem with comments is that

385
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
they don't have one defined purpose.

386
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
There's sort of a weird limbo of, like,

387
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
sometimes, like, messages directed towards the author.

388
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Sometimes messages, like, discussing the content.

389
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Sometimes, like, meta messages about the comments themselves.

390
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
And, you know, a whole range of spectrum in between them.

391
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Yeah.

392
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
It's just kind of a cluster of comments.

393
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Well, that's just what happens when you have an open forum.

394
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
You just have people doing their own thing.

395
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I know.

396
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Well, I don't like it.

397
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
You know, it's not good.

398
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I mean, yeah.

399
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Well, that's why you can disable comments.

400
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Just turn them off if you don't like them.

401
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah, but then when I'm a coward if I do that.

402
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
We all...

403
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Well, why do you care how people perceive you in that way?

404
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
It's like...

405
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
But, Tom, that is the whole...

406
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
The point is not whether or not you can do it.

407
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
The nature of this debate is whether or not, like,

408
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
people should call you a coward for doing so.

409
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
That's, I think, the nature of this discussion.

410
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
It's not going to kill me if someone calls me a coward,

411
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
but I don't understand why they would want to.

412
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
My argument is, if that's the point,

413
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
if you have the ability to turn off comments

414
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
and you want to turn off comments,

415
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
but you're afraid of the backlash,

416
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
then you are a coward.

417
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
So, they're totally right in thinking of it.

418
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
I think I agree.

419
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I think I agree with Tom here.

420
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I think I got to chime in.

421
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Yeah, but sometimes it's not really so much of,

422
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm afraid of the backlash.

423
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
It's like, like you were saying,

424
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
you know, if the comments were gone,

425
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
people wouldn't, like,

426
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
maybe would not like your YouTube channel that much.

427
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
You wouldn't get as much traction.

428
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
You wouldn't grow as much.

429
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Okay, then keep them on.

430
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Then they're not good.

431
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
They're not good if they're helping you grow.

432
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Then you need to just nut up, ignore the bad comments,

433
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
and let your channel grow.

434
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I mean, how much they actually increase anything.

435
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
The way things are now,

436
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
like, comments are good for growth.

437
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
And, like, I don't know how they play into the algorithm.

438
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I have some vague idea that, like, more comments

439
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
and more upvotes on comments

440
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
or something probably increases visibility

441
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
and feeds into the algorithm some way.

442
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
So, that's probably true.

443
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
But, like, then on top of that,

444
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
there's just the whole, like, people-like comments,

445
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
people-like the community aspect of it.

446
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
The community is fucking terrible.

447
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Yeah, but I don't think it's fair.

448
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
It is entirely...

449
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I'm trying to fucking say something.

450
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Okay, say your thing.

451
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I don't think it's fair that it's, like, across the board.

452
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
There's no good reason to turn off your comments.

453
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
And if you do, you're a coward.

454
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah, obviously, that attitude is shitty,

455
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
and it's not necessarily fair.

456
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,800
But, like, yeah, like Tom was saying,

457
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
you gotta just make a judgment call

458
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
of, like, are the comments worth it or not?

459
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
And, like, I don't think it's fair to be, like,

460
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
oh, well, comments are so bad,

461
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
but I'll lose out on the benefits by turning them off.

462
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
And that's not fair.

463
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
No, like, you can opt into that benefit.

464
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
You have to make your cost-benefit analysis

465
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
of whether comments work or not.

466
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah, they've got positives and they've got negatives.

467
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
And, yeah, I think it's kind of...

468
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I'll just fucking say it.

469
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I think it's kind of entitled for a creator

470
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,800
to come out and be like, oh, well, it's not fair.

471
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
It's not fair that there will be consequences

472
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
for turning off comments because you're benefiting from...

473
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I agree.

474
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah, you're benefiting from...

475
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
You're gaining things from having comments on in the first place.

476
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Like, you're opting into that system

477
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
because it has tangible benefits.

478
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm not saying I shouldn't be.

479
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I mean, fucking...

480
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I know that, like, things have...

481
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
stuff has consequences.

482
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Okay.

483
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I just...

484
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I just am angry that comments always suck

486
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
and I don't like looking at them.

487
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
And there they are.

488
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
We should not...

489
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I don't like it.

490
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
There's just nothing for them.

491
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
You're right.

492
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
There's just nothing for them.

493
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
We should not lose sight of the point of this whole discussion,

494
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
which was Digi propagating or pushing forward

495
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
a just a different website

496
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
that is just set up differently.

497
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
He's not saying change YouTube at all.

498
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
That's not his point.

499
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
It's that I wish there was a social media platform

500
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
that, you know, was...

501
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Well, essentially, things like that already exist.

502
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
You can make a WordPress.

503
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Like, I have a WordPress

504
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
and I put every video on Hippocrates on there

505
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
and there are no comments allowed.

506
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Is it possible...

507
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Is it possible Digi is just saying that

508
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
he wants all the benefits of YouTube

509
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
without the downsides?

510
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Is that...

511
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Is that what he's getting at?

512
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Am I...

513
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Am I turning against Digi right now?

514
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
It was a hypothetical, like, dream sequence

515
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
where he was just sort of like,

516
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
oh, wouldn't it be great?

517
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
But like you said, that does exist.

518
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
I mean, who wouldn't...

519
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I agree, which is why it was so weird.

520
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Yeah, okay.

521
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Yeah, you're right.

522
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Does the argument then turn into...

523
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Theoretically, there's two websites.

524
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
They're exactly the same.

525
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
But one has comments, like,

526
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
you just can't do comments.

527
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
And the other one is, like,

528
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
comments are always on.

529
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Does the argument then become what is better?

530
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
They're not exactly the same.

531
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
They're not exactly the same.

532
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
It's like the sharing is the same.

533
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
No, I know.

534
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm the same for the sake of argument.

535
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Like, are we going to go into, like,

536
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
the empirical value of comments

537
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
and whether or not, like, on, like,

538
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
an intellectual level are, like,

539
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
are they a just cause, like, inherently?

540
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
And to get into, like,

541
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
remove the option of them,

542
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
is that inherently bad?

543
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
I guess that's part of the discussion.

544
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
The thing was, like,

545
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I never really think about this.

546
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I don't think to myself,

547
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
ah man, comments in general suck.

548
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I really wish I could turn them off

549
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
without any downside.

550
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Like, I don't think about that.

551
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
This is just, like, a thing that has come up.

552
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
And I'm, like, just trying to, you know,

553
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
think of what my position is.

554
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
But ultimately, in this podcast,

555
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I think what I would like to do

556
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
is just to explain to people

557
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
why you should not feel like you should have comments.

558
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Like, why, like, the community,

559
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
like, all the pros that people bring forth

560
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
of why comments should stay.

561
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I want to slap them down.

562
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I want to push them into the ground,

563
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
into the mud.

564
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
And just watch them as they slowly writhe and shake

565
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
until they're completely...

566
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
You're taking the munchy road

567
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
of knocking people down.

568
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm really proud.

569
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Yeah.

570
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
That's a dangerous road to tread.

571
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I feel a little bit differently about this.

572
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I too have never closed comments.

573
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
I have banned very few people.

574
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Mostly, like, obvious spammers,

575
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
or, like, pushing products or whatever.

576
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
I mean, I would happily ban any spammer

577
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
who's just like,

578
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
hey, buy my book.

579
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I don't know, like, buy my...

580
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Subscribe to my website, guys.

581
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Let's, like, not relate to the content.

582
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
It's like, no, get fucked.

583
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
You delete yourself.

584
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Um...

585
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah, so that's an instant ban.

586
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't know.

587
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Like, the whole, like, concept of, like,

588
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
hate speech and shit,

589
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
like, people, like, being taxed.

590
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I don't know.

591
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
That's all vague.

592
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I don't understand it.

593
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I don't know how I feel about any of that,

594
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
so I just ignore it.

595
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
So, basically, I just opt out.

596
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I pull, like, the PewDiePie and say,

597
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I'll just let people comment,

598
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
and I'll just ignore it.

599
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
They can say whatever they want.

600
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Uh, you know, it's not my problem.

601
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I don't feel responsible for it.

602
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Uh, that's their world down there.

603
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I thought PewDiePie turned off comments,

604
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
or maybe he turned them back on.

605
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
He turned the back on.

606
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
He turned the back on a little while later.

607
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Uh, but, like,

608
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
do I feel like I want them to be part

609
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
of the videos?

610
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Like, I don't mind that comments are there right now.

611
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I absolutely don't mind.

612
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm happy to see them there.

613
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
It's fine.

614
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
But, like, I really think of my work as my own,

615
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
and I don't like the idea of anyone feeling entitled

616
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
to, like, be a part of it,

617
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
because what have they done to earn that?

618
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Nothing.

619
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I would say that if you don't want people to feel like that,

620
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
you just better not post on YouTube, you know?

621
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Like, if there was...

622
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Yeah, like, I wouldn't be against another platform

623
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
that didn't have comments.

624
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I mean, I don't...

625
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
I mean, I'm totally on board with not liking comments

626
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
and not feeling that people are entitled to them.

627
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Like, when I was making my website,

628
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I had people tell me, like,

629
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Ben, you gotta include a comment section in,

630
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
like, in the website, like, on the pages.

631
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
And I was like, no.

632
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Because for a number of reasons, one,

633
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
yeah, I don't want someone to be able...

634
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I don't want any chuckle-fuck to be able to go in there

635
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
and put their thoughts about my work right there

636
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
and attach it to the content

637
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
and have it be, like, a part of the reading experience.

638
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
I think it's... I think it's crass

639
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
and attention-seeking to put something like that there.

640
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Like, hey, guys, tell me what you think about my thing.

641
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Tell me right here so everyone can see.

642
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Um, it's a... I think it's a bad look

643
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
because, like, Ben, like, even a popular comic

644
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
will often have, like, empty comments

645
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
on, like, you know, pages where not a lot happens.

646
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
And, like, that doesn't look good.

647
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
So, yeah.

648
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Especially, like, to have one on every page,

649
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
that really interrupts the reading experience.

650
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I see that on a lot of, like, Dojin websites and shit.

651
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
And, like, those are funny because I don't take those seriously.

652
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
But on a real comic, I totally would not want that.

653
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Yeah, I don't, like, for a number of reasons,

654
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I was like, I don't want people

655
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
to be able to say whatever they want here, so no.

656
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Right.

657
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
No, thank you.

658
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Um, I forget where I was going with that.

659
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
That's how I feel.

660
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
You know, I'm like a fucking, like, kiss anime and kiss cartoon.

661
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Like, you can scroll down or, like, manga something or other.

662
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Like, there's some manga and anime, like, illegal sites you could go to.

663
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
You can see the thing, and then if you scroll down,

664
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
there is a comment section.

665
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
And to see people, like, like, I know it's illegal,

666
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
but it's like, it feels like this is the thing.

667
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
This is the show.

668
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Yeah.

669
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
You're watching it, and then there are people down there,

670
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
and it's like, this somehow reminds me of YouTube,

671
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
and therefore de-legitimizes the thing I just watched

672
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
as, like, a real thing.

673
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Because now I'm thinking of it as nothing.

674
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I can understand, like, the feel.

675
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
In an aesthetic way, I get it.

676
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
It's like a slight sort of, like, feeling.

677
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Like, I just don't like seeing a big old comment section.

678
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
It sort of casualizes the experience, you know?

679
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Even before I, if I don't, I don't need to, like,

680
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
read all of them to know that they were bad.

681
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I just see the comments, and I'm like,

682
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Oh, God.

683
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Oh, good job.

684
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I have never gone this argument that, like,

685
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,800
comments then become part of the video.

686
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Because I have never, not once in my life,

687
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
thought of comments as part of the video.

688
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Well, you gotta think about it in terms of, like, the worst thing.

689
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I think they totally are.

690
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
They totally are.

691
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
You watch the video, yeah, you watch the video,

692
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
then you scroll down to see what people are saying about it,

693
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
and then you fucking internalize,

694
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
you internalize the general consensus.

695
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Like, people are having the discussion right there,

696
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
and you're exposed to it.

697
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I agree that, like, having the comments there,

698
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
just, like, like...

699
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Yeah, it can really color how you feel about it,

700
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
because, like, immediately you get to see,

701
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
like, what the general opinion is.

702
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
And yeah, I think that it kind of robs you

703
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
of your ability to form your own opinion about something.

704
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Whenever I will watch a video, I will just full screen it,

705
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
and then I will watch the entire video,

706
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll come to my own conclusions,

707
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
and then, like, maybe one-third of the time

708
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
I'll go and see the comments.

709
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Most of the time I will not even, like, look at the comments at all.

710
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Well, that's...

711
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
They are not factoring my opinion whatsoever

712
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
of the comments at all.

713
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
If I find a video interesting at all,

714
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I always want to check the comments

715
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
and see what people are saying about it.

716
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Why would I care about what other people are saying about it?

717
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Well, well, much, I mean, the point we're getting at

718
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,800
is, like, if it affects, like, a lot of people,

719
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
then it's relevant to our discussion here,

720
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
and, like, the rest of us agree

721
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
that the comments do change things.

722
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
So we just have to go with the consensus, I guess, on this.

723
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
And people can disagree, but I think it's,

724
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I feel safe in saying that, like,

725
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
you can see, like, the view count,

726
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
and the likes and the dislikes,

727
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
and all those things weigh in

728
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
and change the experience a little bit, you know?

729
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
They're all relevant.

730
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Like, if you see a video with, like, five views,

731
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
you're like, what the fuck?

732
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
There's, like, a physical, like, line.

733
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Like, you have to scroll down to see the comments.

734
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
And that, in and of itself,

735
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
makes it not part of the content of the experience for me.

736
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
No.

737
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,800
One scroll is, like, not enough to separate it, I don't think.

738
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
And even then, even if the comments are gone,

739
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,800
the like bar is enough of, like, a damper.

740
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
You have to agree.

741
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
It changes my opinion.

742
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
That is a fundamentally different aesthetic.

743
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
To be viewing a YouTube video with, like,

744
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
comments just below the service,

745
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
you can see the like and the upvotes

746
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
and the downloads and the number of views,

747
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
as opposed to, like, watching a video in a fucking movie theater.

748
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
And then going to the goddamn ghostbusters, like, forums

749
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
to talk about the new ghostbusters for me.

750
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Okay, sure.

751
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,800
The like bar and the contents of the comment section,

752
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
like, put the video in a context, you know?

753
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
That's right.

754
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
And a lot of the time, some videos are just, like,

755
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
not visually that interesting.

756
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
So you will scroll while listening to the video

757
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
to read comments while it's happening,

758
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
because there's nothing else to do.

759
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
If we're expanding comments to mean the like bar

760
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
and the view count, then, yeah.

761
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Then those impact me a lot.

762
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Then I'll agree that that makes an impact.

763
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Like, if you click on just some random video,

764
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
like a podcast, and you see, like, a massive amount of dislikes,

765
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
and you're just, like, wait, I didn't,

766
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
what's wrong with the video?

767
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I didn't see anything wrong.

768
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Then you'll listen back and be like, oh, that's what it was.

769
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Now I understand.

770
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
It's the smash cut to Nate watching a eugenics podcast

771
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
seeing the message.

772
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Wait, wait, wait, what was wrong with this?

773
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Why didn't they like this?

774
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
What was wrong with this video?

775
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Everything checks out to me.

776
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Yeah, yeah.

777
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Okay, yeah.

778
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I mean, I guess, I guess, I guess I'm the minority.

779
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I thought I was going to speak for the unwashed masses,

780
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
but I guess I'm the native minority.

781
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
We're specifically talking about...

782
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
That's true.

783
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
We're just talking about if it's relevant,

784
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
if they sort of affect the experience.

785
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Yes.

786
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Which I think it's safe to say they do.

787
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,800
And I guess I don't think I don't think that at all.

788
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
But, you know...

789
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Okay.

790
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Well, considering that...

791
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,800
What we're explaining, saying, talking about is, like,

792
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
things added to the thing will affect,

793
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,800
and if the view count and the like bar is, like, does affect,

794
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
then it, you know...

795
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I mean, it's so...

796
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
It's a moment specifically...

797
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Assuming that the idea of something being close by...

798
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Assuming that that is true, then I hate it with all my heart,

799
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
and it's the worst thing I could ever make.

800
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
I would agree that comments definitely affect the perception of a work.

801
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Like, if you're watching a video

802
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
and you just have the video presented by itself,

803
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
then clearly that's one perspective.

804
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,800
But, like, if you're watching a video and then you scroll down

805
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
and immediately you see a comment contradicting things

806
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
or bringing up counterpoints,

807
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
then obviously, like, that's going to affect your perception of the work.

808
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Now, one thing I will say about this is, like,

809
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,800
it's the same, basically, as, like, watching a movie

810
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
and then watching a review of a movie.

811
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
You beat me to it.

812
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
That's right.

813
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
It's the same sort of thing, except people in comments

814
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,800
are not the same, like, even a terrible review,

815
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
at least goes over the basics and has, like, visual aids.

816
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
A comment is just a guy going,

817
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
like, even the best of times,

818
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
it's a guy going, but, like, with a monocle.

819
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Like, it's never actually as good as a review.

820
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,800
So, what Digi, I think, was saying is, like,

821
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,800
if you're going to make a critique of something in the comments section,

822
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I would rather you make a more substantial...

823
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
I think that's a good point.

824
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,800
I think more people should be creators,

825
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
and if you want to bitch about something,

826
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I think it would be more important to...

827
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
or better suited to making an actual product out of it.

828
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
I'll lay it out on the line, guys.

829
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I'll lay out my secret ulterior motive.

830
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,800
One excellent reason why I didn't want a comment section on my website

831
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,800
is because I would much rather that conversation take place somewhere else

832
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
in, like, a public forum.

833
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Or, like, on YouTube or something.

834
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Perhaps a website specifically designed for that.

835
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Perhaps patreon.com.

836
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
No, like, because if someone sees a comment section on there

837
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
and they're like, I have a strong opinion about what I've just read,

838
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
they'll go and just, like, fucking shit in my comment section

839
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
that doesn't exist to prevent this very thing.

840
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
But then, if they don't have that option,

841
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
then maybe instead they'll be like,

842
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
hey, something awful forums,

843
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
hey, 4chan, I just read this thing,

844
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
and it fucking sucked.

845
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Well, that's exactly what...

846
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
That's exactly what kind of Digi was talking about, I think, in his thing,

847
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
which, uh, yeah, you know, which is good.

848
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
It forces people to up their game.

849
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
And I agree that people upping their game is good,

850
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
and I would like to see more of it.

851
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Well, I guess that's all I have to say about that.

852
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Fair enough.

853
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
That's what I want as a creator,

854
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
is for people to make, like, well thought out

855
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,800
and have a real conversation about what I'm doing, you know?

856
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Right, which comments so often are not even close to that.

857
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
That is too shallow.

858
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm actually pretty warm on comments in general.

859
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Like, comments, like we've been saying,

860
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
are very much tied to the community aspects of YouTube,

861
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
which has both major pluses and minuses.

862
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Uh, you know, people can feel more involved and engage in it,

863
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
but then it creates kind of circle jerky bullshit,

864
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,800
and like, drama is really popular, and all that gay shit.

865
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
But, like, for a show like Viagra that I do,

866
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
like, that is very much like a community engagement show.

867
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
So, like, to me, it seems like reasonable to have comments on that,

868
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
whereas, like, I don't know.

869
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Like, something like my other...

870
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah, like, with one of those, like,

871
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
again, I don't really mind there being comments.

872
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
I don't really mind it at all.

873
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
But, like, that is, like, my...

874
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
It's like a movie that I made, and, like,

875
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I don't necessarily think that your fucking worthless opinion

876
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
is relevant to this movie that I just made.

877
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Uh, yeah, like, make a video response

878
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
if you loved it so much, or hated it, or whatever,

879
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
if you've got critiques or something.

880
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
You know what I mean?

881
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Why don't just, like, disable comments for videos

882
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
you don't want to have that conversation on?

883
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Yeah, like, there's some videos that, like,

884
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
like, is this video discussion worthy?

885
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Does this deserve discussion?

886
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Or is this just a game for two people?

887
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
And, like, we're talking about how there's a stigma to this,

888
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
but if more people did it, it would change...

889
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
you would affect the perception of the action.

890
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Because, right now, the only people who disable comments

891
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
are people like Anita Sarkeesian,

892
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
who just get fucking trolled into oblivion,

893
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
and they don't want to hear it.

894
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
And it's, like, it is a way of just, like,

895
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
censoring and not having to see that stuff

896
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
or have it be a thing.

897
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Some people have transcended it.

898
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Like, TotalBiscuit doesn't, I think...

899
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I mean, TotalBiscuit probably gets trolled for it to some degree,

900
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
but, hey man, no comment, so you can't see it there.

901
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
See, that's not being cowardly.

902
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
That's just saying, like, I don't want to hear it,

903
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
and I'm going to turn it off.

904
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
And if you want to do that, that's fine.

905
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
And, I don't know, I feel like the problem,

906
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,800
I think, for a lot of people who want to disable comments,

907
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
because that's not me, I'll keep them on no matter what.

908
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I don't care.

909
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
But for people who want to not deal with it,

910
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,800
I think the problem is I don't want to hear opinions

911
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,800
or I don't want to hear these, like, dumbass comments,

912
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
but I also don't want to give up the endorphin rush

913
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
or whatever of people agreeing with me and sucking me off.

914
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
So it's like...

915
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Well, we don't...

916
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
You gotta accept the good with the bad there.

917
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
It's like an all-in-all kind of approach.

918
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I don't want to let the commenters off the hook,

919
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
because, I mean, we can talk about the community engagement

920
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
and all that, but we know that they love the power

921
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
of being right there.

922
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
They get to be right there up on the video.

923
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
And if they're good enough, oh, my shitpost,

924
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,800
my deconstruction in one elegant shitpost,

925
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
or this guy's a fucking cuck or whatever,

926
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
a thousand upvotes, yes, I have a tie to this man.

927
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Okay, I totally agree, but don't you think

928
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
we have the exact same problem?

929
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Like, that's why we're posting on YouTube,

930
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
but not like our own website,

931
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
because we want the power of having our voice being heard

932
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
and having an audience to project to,

933
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
and that's why we're all on YouTube.

934
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Definitely, I just want to say,

935
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
and you're absolutely right,

936
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,800
it's just that I am superior to a commenter objectively.

937
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
I put thought into what I do, I work...

938
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Even on my comments, you'll find more thought

939
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,800
than a 10,000 other comments put together.

940
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Yeah, I mean, it really is like

941
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
we put more effort into making this podcast.

942
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,800
I mean, not much more effort than a comment, I guess,

943
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
because we're just speaking.

944
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
But, you know, someone has to edit it,

945
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
someone has to upload it.

946
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,800
It's a project, you know?

947
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
If more people turn their comments into videos,

948
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
I would care about them.

949
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
I would respect them more because they put more effort

950
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
into having a point.

951
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Is that the real problem then?

952
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Is it not so much commenter entitlement,

953
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
but commenter laziness?

954
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Or, like, not wanting to...

955
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,800
I mean, the thing is that I've noticed

956
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
is that if you have, like, an other place,

957
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,800
like a Reddit, where you have designated four comments,

958
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
you say, go there to comment,

959
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
and even if you have a link in the description,

960
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
the vast majority of the people who don't go

961
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
are so lazy that their comments wouldn't...

962
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
You would never want to hear them anyway.

963
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
So, like, only the people who actually...

964
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
That's the thing.

965
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,800
...gave even the tiniest bit of a shit to click somewhere

966
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
would, you know, I would respect them for doing even that.

967
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
So why don't more people disable comments

968
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
and do that then?

969
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Because then they're fostering better.

970
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
It's the stigma.

971
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Isn't that your problem, though?

972
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Isn't that your problem?

973
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Like, at some point, don't you have to, like,

974
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
say, you know, this is my responsibility

975
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
because it's my content,

976
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
and, like, I have to take the hit

977
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
in order to foster the discussion I want to see?

978
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I agree.

979
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
That's why I didn't disable anything,

980
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
and I probably never will.

981
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
At the beginning, I said, like,

982
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
I can see it from both sides,

983
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
but my channel is kind of small,

984
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
so it's not even a problem for me.

985
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,800
So my stance is that when it does become a problem,

986
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I will switch.

987
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
I just don't need to yet.

988
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Yeah.

989
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Yeah, like, that's the thing.

990
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
We should think of this from the perspective

991
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
of, like, a big YouTuber.

992
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Why should a big YouTuber have to allow this

993
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
and be called, like, a piece of shit for disabling it?

994
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Like, from the perspective of someone like a PewDiePie,

995
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,800
or, you know, whoever, like, a big YouTuber guy,

996
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
like, PewDiePie's comments were filled with garbage,

997
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
and people, like, shitposting,

998
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
and not even shitposting,

999
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
but, like, advertising themselves.

1000
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Like, I've seen his comment sections full of ads

1001
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
because it gets so many fucking views,

1002
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
and you can just go comment,

1003
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
and you're likely to get more hits on your website,

1004
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
probably, than, you know,

1005
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
like, making a fucking video yourself.

1006
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
So, like, there's an incentive to shit up his comments.

1007
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
So, like, it totally makes sense

1008
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
why he would turn them off.

1009
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I totally get it.

1010
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,800
But then, you know, the backlash from people was so strong.

1011
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
He's like, okay, geez, fine.

1012
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Like, that wasn't him being cowardly, I think.

1013
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,800
That's him sort of just cow-towing to what the mob wants,

1014
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
even though the mob is not making any kind of good points.

1015
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
How is that not cowardly?

1016
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,800
How is what you just said not cowardice personified?

1017
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Because it's not, I don't know.

1018
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Well, he's making a business decision.

1019
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
He's accepting an annoyance.

1020
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
It's not about being cowardly.

1021
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Yeah, I think the thing is,

1022
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,800
changing your mind, I don't think, is cowardly.

1023
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800
It's just like, you know, if the comments are annoying,

1024
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
you turn them off.

1025
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
But if the backlash is more annoying,

1026
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
then you turn them on.

1027
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Like, it doesn't...

1028
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,800
It's just whatever you feel is, like, the least bad.

1029
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Because the...

1030
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,800
My comment section has been more or less great,

1031
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
and I don't intend to ever turn them off.

1032
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
But the moment they stop being...

1033
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Like, the moment it goes from, like,

1034
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,800
49% bad to, like, 51% bad,

1035
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
then I will immediately turn them off.

1036
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
And, you know, as soon as they become positive,

1037
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
then I'll turn them back on.

1038
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,800
It's not, like, a one-time decision that I will make.

1039
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
It'll just be whatever my mood dictates.

1040
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Yes.

1041
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I just don't even know if people, after all this discussion,

1042
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
will still get the fact that you do not have a fucking right

1043
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
to comment.

1044
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
You don't have the right.

1045
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,800
People make that argument every time a discussion like this comes up.

1046
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,800
You have no fucking right to a comment section.

1047
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
You stupid, stupid people who make that argument.

1048
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
They don't.

1049
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
It's not a fucking First Amendment thing.

1050
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
I know we've already established this.

1051
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
It's just...

1052
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Understand this point, people.

1053
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Like, I don't deal with the riffraff and the scum of society

1054
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
that have opinions like that.

1055
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
So sometimes I forget that there are people out there

1056
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
that do feel that way.

1057
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
And every time I remember it, I get a little...

1058
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
I get the howling phantods and I gotta go take a bath.

1059
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
I will never turn off my comments.

1060
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
I mean, probably.

1061
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
I could at some point.

1062
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
But it's looking like I probably will never, ever do it.

1063
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,800
But still, to argue any differently on this point is absolutely absurd.

1064
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
And it makes me mad just to think about it.

1065
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,800
It's not a matter of like, do you like comments or not?

1066
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Do they have a right?

1067
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Of course not.

1068
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
This is not a government issue.

1069
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
This is not will you be thrown in jail if you make a comment.

1070
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
As has been stated by us, numerous times before in our past

1071
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
we are giving you a platform to do comments.

1072
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
And if we don't want you to have it, then why should you have it?

1073
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Which we won't take it away, by the way.

1074
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
But we could.

1075
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,800
It's like that comic by Vincent standing around Magda

1076
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,800
and he's like, dude, I could kill you right now.

1077
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Isn't that interesting?

1078
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
What the fuck is wrong?

1079
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
That's us.

1080
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
That's us right now.

1081
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,800
The guest mini-so that I like never fucking posted anywhere.

1082
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
I should do something about that.

1083
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Thank you for reminding me.

1084
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
You're welcome.

1085
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
We could close comments at any time.

1086
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Isn't that interesting commenters?

1087
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Don't you find that fascinating?

1088
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I do.

1089
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
My opinion.

1090
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Are the comments going to be closed on this?

1091
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
No.

1092
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
No.

1093
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
I mean, I don't see the need to.

1094
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
See, that's maybe inconsistent.

1095
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I don't see any need to, but you don't have a right to them.

1096
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Maybe we'll just for fun.

1097
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
My opinion has never been...

1098
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
I think I'll pin the worst comment I've ever seen.

1099
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I'll pin that one.

1100
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I never...

1101
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I don't want to get rid of comments.

1102
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I like the idea of comments.

1103
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I like the idea of fans or you know, trolls alike.

1104
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,800
You know, to say what they want on, you know

1105
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
on the things that I make.

1106
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,800
My only problem is that there are bad comments.

1107
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Comments that are not thought out and lazy.

1108
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I want to make comments great again is my mission statement.

1109
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,800
I don't want to get rid of comments or you know, remove it.

1110
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
To be a charitable.

1111
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
I want to just improve them, yes.

1112
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Right.

1113
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
To be as charitable to like Digi's point of view as possible,

1114
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,800
his whole idea is to improve the discussion across the board.

1115
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
He clearly has, you know, the best intentions in mind

1116
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,800
when he brings up this idea.

1117
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I, too, want to do what I can to improve the level of discourse.

1118
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
So like, you know, if that actually would do so...

1119
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,800
I think the main thing that has to happen for comments to be good

1120
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,800
is for if somebody just like makes a silly, not very funny joke

1121
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,800
and for plus ones, every time somebody pluses ones that comment

1122
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,800
they get an electric shock and Google will determine

1123
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
that it's not a very funny joke with it's like algorithm and shit.

1124
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,800
So only really actually good comments will be at the top.

1125
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,800
How do we define bad comments?

1126
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,800
If only there were some sort of rules in place

1127
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,800
that we could enforce with an iron fist.

1128
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Oh, oh yeah.

1129
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
It's the fucking name of the thing.

1130
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
We haven't even started talking about rules.

1131
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
That's true.

1132
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
We're in the weeds.

1133
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I mean, we got to define a bunch of parameters for you.

1134
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Can we just say that commenter upvotes and downvotes

1135
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
are definitely fucking up comments

1136
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
and that they probably shouldn't be a thing?

1137
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
It gives the people the wrong incentives

1138
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,800
to just be the least funny they could possibly be.

1139
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I don't think gamifying comments was a good call

1140
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,800
because that becomes less about trying to just express something

1141
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
and more like, I'm going to get the upvotes

1142
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
because I don't have a YouTube channel

1143
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
so my way of getting social recognition

1144
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
is getting thumbs up on this platform.

1145
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,800
The difficult thing is like, without upvotes

1146
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,800
the comments are like, you know, newest first or whatever

1147
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
because there's no top comment

1148
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,800
or even worse, like the earliest first

1149
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
which would mean the first comment is going to be first.

1150
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
I don't think latest first would be that big of a deal.

1151
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
I think that's fine.

1152
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Well, the only thing about it is that

1153
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,800
people repost just to be like the top comment or something.

1154
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
They'll just keep talking and posting to be at the top

1155
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,800
because as soon as they do it, they'll be at the top

1156
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,800
and it will make comments more...

1157
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
That would take more effort on their part though.

1158
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
No, what we can do, I've got the solution,

1159
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
we display comments in alphabetical order.

1160
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,800
That's the solution, that's how we do it.

1161
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Well then there would just be a load of A's before anything to say.

1162
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Exactly, and then it'll be A plus on every video.

1163
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,800
And then every comment will just start with A-la-mow

1164
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
and then it gets to the actual comment.

1165
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
Perfect.

1166
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Incredible.

1167
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
By the way, before...

1168
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Here, if you want to make a point, go ahead.

1169
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
I was just thinking, like didn't you...

1170
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
YouTube comments used to have like a character limit

1171
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
and now they don't.

1172
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
I'm just wondering.

1173
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I'm wondering if like it was like...

1174
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,800
But I mean, the short, like you are,

1175
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,800
like letter U, letter R, retarded.

1176
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,800
You know, like that's short and sweet.

1177
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Character limits won't fix any of those kind of comments.

1178
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,800
I would like more of those.

1179
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
I don't want to be strung along

1180
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
in like a very elaborate you are retarded.

1181
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I would like them to just be short and sweet.

1182
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Okay.

1183
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Well, you know what I wanted to say here.

1184
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,800
I did want to speak on behalf of the commenters

1185
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
in the context of this because like,

1186
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
I really do get where they're coming from

1187
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,800
because like I feel like I am in a risen commenter

1188
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
over the years because my origins here

1189
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
are from 4chan where I was a big shit poster

1190
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
and a memester and whatnot

1191
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
and I still am to this day and it's great and I love it.

1192
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,800
So like, I get being a commenter on YouTube

1193
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
and like wanting to like, like you were saying before,

1194
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,800
your angle is you can try to make a comment

1195
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
that's really good and people will like it

1196
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
and I feel like that's like,

1197
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
that's like the first job you can get

1198
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,800
is like your starter job like,

1199
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
oh, I'm going to work really hard on my comments

1200
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
and make them good so everyone likes me.

1201
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,800
And then if you find like, hey,

1202
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm getting good at like making things.

1203
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
Maybe now I'll try making a video

1204
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
and then you can like move up from there to making videos

1205
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,800
and like in that way it could theoretically function

1206
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,800
as like a stepping stone thing to getting you

1207
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
to be like a more creative person or like, you know,

1208
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
it's your way.

1209
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,800
It like, it empowers the anonymous individual.

1210
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,800
It gives them an ability to be recognized

1211
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,800
for their, you know, a degree of contribution.

1212
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,800
The problem is human nature does not actually reward

1213
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
the most thoughtful, like valuable comment.

1214
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,800
It rewards the most meme-y one

1215
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,800
or the most insulting one or, you know,

1216
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
anything of that nature.

1217
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,800
That's the problem with the system

1218
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,800
and because of that things don't work the way

1219
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
we all wish they would with comments.

1220
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,800
So that's just human nature.

1221
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
That's just budding up against human nature.

1222
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
We've got a steer human nature.

1223
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
We can control it to a certain degree.

1224
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Like human nature is also to murder and rape

1225
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
but we're working on that.

1226
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,800
We're working on fixing those.

1227
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
So we can work on this too.

1228
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
We can work on self, Nate.

1229
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Would we like to start ironing out

1230
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
the bullet point rules here?

1231
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
I guess we should.

1232
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
We've been doing this for a while now.

1233
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Before we get into the new, like the in you dash new rules,

1234
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
let's just refresh ourselves

1235
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
on some of the old ones I picked out

1236
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
because I actually watched the, you know,

1237
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
the old one in preparation for this.

1238
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Let's just go ahead and see if we have anything

1239
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
to comment on or a change or redact here.

1240
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Number one, do not publish a comment

1241
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
before finishing the fucking video.

1242
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
Excellent rule.

1243
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Excellent. That is the golden rule.

1244
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,800
If you've already done that, get killed.

1245
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,800
Yeah.

1246
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Yeah.

1247
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Before we do this, would you like to start?

1248
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Would you make good on our promise

1249
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
of banning people who do not abide by these?

1250
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,800
Is that what we're going to do there?

1251
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,800
I think we should.

1252
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
I think we should for this video at least.

1253
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,800
Who's going to turn to the time

1254
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,800
to review all the fucking comments?

1255
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
I'll do that.

1256
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,800
I'll do that.

1257
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,800
If you want to.

1258
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,800
Hey man, go for it.

1259
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
For our warning commenters, you're being warned.

1260
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
You should have watched the whole video

1261
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,800
so you heard this warning.

1262
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
If you violate the rules,

1263
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
you may be deleted from real life.

1264
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,800
You may be completely obliterated.

1265
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
I think it's time, you know, it's no secret

1266
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,800
we've gotten some riff-raff with our ranks.

1267
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
And frankly, I think it's time we start, you know,

1268
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,800
weeding out the weak from the poor.

1269
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Because we love the poor so much.

1270
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
We talked about closing comments.

1271
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
We didn't talk too much about deleting comments.

1272
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
But I guess that's just where the rules come in.

1273
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,800
Deleting comments is there's no problem there

1274
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
and it's good.

1275
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Yeah, it falls into the same jurisdiction

1276
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
as just closing comments.

1277
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Like if it violates the principles, you know,

1278
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,800
ethically, there's definitely nothing wrong with it.

1279
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
And I don't know.

1280
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Yeah, it's kind of got the same stigma about it

1281
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,800
that like it's cowardly,

1282
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
oh, you're censoring criticism.

1283
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,800
But like once again,

1284
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,800
since I don't believe that commenters

1285
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,800
have an inherent right to their comments,

1286
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
I don't think that any individual

1287
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,800
has a right to say their particular thing.

1288
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
And yeah, like comments aren't sacred.

1289
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Comments aren't sacred.

1290
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
This isn't, yeah.

1291
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
That's definitely true.

1292
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,800
You're not obligated to be like a free marketplace

1293
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,800
of ideas in your comment section.

1294
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Very true.

1295
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
But, okay, real situation here,

1296
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,800
someone makes a very thoughtful, critical comment

1297
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
of a video and the creator deletes it.

1298
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
How do we feel about that?

1299
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
It was a good comment.

1300
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
But it was a post.

1301
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
That doesn't matter.

1302
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,800
That's still the video and creator thing?

1303
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,800
I guess it'd be like how I feel about corporations

1304
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
doing evil things.

1305
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
So you're calling it evil?

1306
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Well, it's bad, it's ugly.

1307
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,800
It's cowardly.

1308
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
If someone makes a good point shutting you down

1309
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,800
and you're like,

1310
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,800
oh, I don't want to be publicly one-upped like this,

1311
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm going to delete it,

1312
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
then yeah, you're kind of being a little bitch.

1313
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,800
But again, it's still there in your comment section.

1314
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,800
That's what I'm here with in your rights, but it sucks.

1315
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,800
I would say the problem is that again,

1316
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,800
that's why if you have a nuanced point to make,

1317
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,800
you should make a video so the person you're critiquing

1318
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,800
can't just delete it right off their content.

1319
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,800
That's the comment you're being stupid.

1320
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,800
But I think that the stigma is there for a reason

1321
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,800
that are people who would delete comments

1322
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,800
because they challenge them,

1323
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,800
regardless of how well or how nicely you put it,

1324
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,800
or how constructive it is.

1325
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
Yeah, they should be struck with the task for doing that.

1326
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,800
I think that there should be,

1327
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
like, that guy's fucking,

1328
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,800
it's just the generalization of it.

1329
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
If a comment is gone,

1330
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,800
that doesn't mean that the person who got rid of it is

1331
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
running scared.

1332
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,800
It's fair to call them what they are, though.

1333
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,800
They're like, I mean, maybe not hiding scared,

1334
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,800
but I don't think that's a respectable thing to do.

1335
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
To be like, if someone makes a point,

1336
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
it might just be that you just legitimately think

1337
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
their point is stupid,

1338
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,800
but this is where we hit a little bit of a gray area

1339
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,800
because if I make a video, I make a point,

1340
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,800
and someone, like my League of Legends video, whatever,

1341
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
if someone makes a point that, like, no, you are,

1342
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,800
let's just say they're totally polite,

1343
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
but I think that every single point they make

1344
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,800
in their comment is wrong, but they're polite about it.

1345
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,800
If I delete that, I would say that's me,

1346
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,800
even if I just think that I'm right and they're just wrong,

1347
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,800
that's me, like, still not, like, really giving their ideas

1348
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
a chance to be viewed by people,

1349
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
and, like, obviously, I'm not breaking laws.

1350
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
You can do that, but I don't like that.

1351
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
I don't like that.

1352
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
Like, I think you should delete comments that are,

1353
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
one, like, they don't have a point.

1354
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,800
They're just being stupid, like, just, I don't know.

1355
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Like, I'm trying to think of a specific example,

1356
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
but, like, if somebody has a point

1357
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
and you don't agree with it,

1358
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,800
but, you know, I don't think you should delete it.

1359
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Relate to the tone of comments.

1360
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Unless you're deleting everything.

1361
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Relate to the tone of comments.

1362
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,800
Nice criticism is not constructive criticism,

1363
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
and, furthermore, more broadly speaking,

1364
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,800
you don't have to be a nice person to be a good person.

1365
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,800
You don't have to be, like, a nice, polite person

1366
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
to have your argument and comment.

1367
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
This is definitely a devout rule.

1368
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1369
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
And very accurate.

1370
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Yeah, yeah.

1371
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,800
Well, I'm just saying this was one of the rules.

1372
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,800
I'm just saying that right now.

1373
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

1374
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,800
I'm just saying, like, just because you, you know,

1375
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
just because you're nice doesn't mean you're a good boy,

1376
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
and, you know, vice versa.

1377
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Just because you're mean or rude or anything

1378
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
doesn't mean you deserve to be obliterated from society.

1379
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,800
That's a good reason, and because you are rude,

1380
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
you probably are not doing good,

1381
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
but, you know, it's not a rule here.

1382
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,800
Just look at unlikely hero Ebenezer Screws

1383
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,800
who has proved right to be a stingy old motherfucker

1384
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
all along.

1385
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
That was great. That was great.

1386
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
I never forgot that.

1387
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Another one of these rules,

1388
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,800
read the other comments before commenting.

1389
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,800
So you don't say the same thing everyone else has already said.

1390
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
Redundant comments are totally up for deletion.

1391
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,800
If they're just redundant, why the fuck out there?

1392
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
Those are out.

1393
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
I don't think, like, sometimes there's too many comments

1394
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,800
to read all of them, understood, understandable.

1395
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
But you should scroll, like, a couple times to see

1396
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
if, like, it hasn't been said recently, at least,

1397
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
or if it's not a top, already a top comment.

1398
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,800
Well, generally, this is, like, one of the most comment,

1399
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,800
like, common comments things that, like,

1400
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
this generally comes up for.

1401
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
So, like, it should be obvious.

1402
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,800
But, yeah, there's...

1403
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
And you can just control F.

1404
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
You can just control F here.

1405
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
True. Like, get good, you know?

1406
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
Yeah, yeah, great.

1407
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
I'm getting quite a few comments on my League of Legends.

1408
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,800
It's like, lol, this guy's just bad at lol.

1409
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
And that's fine. That's fine.

1410
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
But it is redundant.

1411
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
It is redundant.

1412
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,800
That's another...

1413
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,800
See, that's not, like, a mean.

1414
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,800
That's not, like, oh, I don't like you.

1415
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
That's not why that comment's bad.

1416
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
It's just because it's redundant.

1417
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,800
It doesn't have any actual point there.

1418
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
And it's a fucking lazy piece of shit.

1419
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
I think the reason those comments are...

1420
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Like, the comments that I find most frustrating

1421
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,800
aren't even the ones that are insulting.

1422
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,800
It's because making a video is an act of communication.

1423
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,800
So the most annoying things is when people misunderstand you.

1424
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Purposely or accidentally.

1425
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
When they either...

1426
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,800
Yes.

1427
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,800
They don't understand what you're saying

1428
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,800
and it's so obvious that they're wrong.

1429
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,800
And it's just, like, that's the most frustrating part.

1430
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Oh, dude.

1431
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,800
You will understand.

1432
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
Okay, another...

1433
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
Yeah.

1434
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
That is a good rule.

1435
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Let's get into the new rules.

1436
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,800
Wait, wait. Before you do.

1437
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
Before you do.

1438
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
About this, though.

1439
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
Like, what...

1440
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Here's another real situation.

1441
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,800
You wake a video.

1442
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,800
Someone makes a comment, like, saying...

1443
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,800
Like, no, I disagree.

1444
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,800
But the way...

1445
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,800
The thing they disagree with isn't your point.

1446
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
But let's say that lots of people think

1447
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,800
that you were making that point.

1448
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,800
So it is, in fact, you who misrepresented yourself,

1449
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
but their comment, like, misrepresented the point

1450
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,800
you were trying to make,

1451
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,800
does that make it viable for deletion?

1452
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Because you made the mistake, I guess.

1453
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
I think I've been thinking about the deletion thing

1454
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,800
since it came up.

1455
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,800
And I think if...

1456
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,800
Delete!

1457
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
Delete!

1458
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Yeah, very good, very good.

1459
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
I'm gonna delete that from the podcast.

1460
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,800
Aww.

1461
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,800
I think it should be like,

1462
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,800
you don't want any comments or you allow them.

1463
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
I don't...

1464
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,800
I feel like deletion should be relegated to things

1465
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,800
like spamming their own channel

1466
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,800
or like a link to a bad thing.

1467
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Or like something that is actively would hurt

1468
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,800
or damage other people in some physical way,

1469
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,800
like a punch to the face.

1470
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,800
Get rid of those comments.

1471
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
What if it's a microaggression?

1472
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
Microaggressions are basically real life violence.

1473
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
I love micromachines.

1474
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
I love Megatron.

1475
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
By the way, before we get into the new rules,

1476
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,800
just another old one just for...

1477
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,800
New rules for new males like us.

1478
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Exactly.

1479
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
There's a blast from the past here.

1480
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,800
That's very relevant.

1481
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,800
Ironic, me, me, cutesy, like,

1482
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
oh, because this guy said not to comment this,

1483
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
I'm going to comment this.

1484
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,800
Try and get these to go.

1485
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,800
Those are gone.

1486
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Those are gone.

1487
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Bye.

1488
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,800
I'm sorry, but goodbye.

1489
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,800
Delete those.

1490
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Yeah, those are awful.

1491
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
We don't like them.

1492
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Stop, please.

1493
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,800
Okay, okay.

1494
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,800
Now we're getting into the new rules.

1495
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,800
I really like understand, period.

1496
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,800
Understand what...

1497
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Understand the video.

1498
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,800
That is a great one.

1499
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
I like that a lot.

1500
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,800
That can apply in a lot of ways.

1501
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Yeah, exactly.

1502
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,800
Like, if you don't understand,

1503
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,800
or at least, like, like, you know,

1504
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,800
there are good people who think they understand.

1505
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
It's hard to know when you don't understand.

1506
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Yeah, exactly.

1507
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
It's hard to know when you understand.

1508
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,800
The way to understand is to get brain.

1509
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
And to get brain, you need to think.

1510
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
No, here's the real thing.

1511
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,800
Being smart.

1512
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Here's like the actual thing you should do

1513
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
if you're a commenter, okay?

1514
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,800
If you're a commenter and you don't understand the video,

1515
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,800
instead of leaving a comment with an assumption

1516
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
of what you think it is

1517
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
and making it idiot of yourself,

1518
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,800
leave a comment saying,

1519
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,800
I don't quite understand what you're trying to say.

1520
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Is it this?

1521
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Because by phrasing it that way,

1522
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
that's a good comment.

1523
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
It fosters a conversation.

1524
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,800
And I'm much more likely to respond to you

1525
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
to clarify my position.

1526
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,800
If you're asking it as a question,

1527
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
then making a declarative ignorant statement.

1528
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,800
Now, asking questions is such a great thing to do

1529
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
to get my attention.

1530
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Because I love explaining.

1531
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
That's the reason I make reviews.

1532
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
That's the whole reason I'm on here

1533
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,800
fapping about my opinion.

1534
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Let me talk about my opinion more.

1535
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,800
I would love to explain to you

1536
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
the specifics of what I mean

1537
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,800
if you have a question.

1538
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,800
Now, I want to explain my point on understanding,

1539
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,800
because this is a slippery slope,

1540
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,800
but I think me and Ben are going to have a real talk here about this.

1541
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Like me saying,

1542
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
I understand the video.

1543
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,800
It is not your duty to understand the video.

1544
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,800
If I have miscommunicated what I'm saying in the video,

1545
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
then it is inherently my fault.

1546
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,800
What I mean by understand to make a good comment

1547
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
is that you just have to make an effort to,

1548
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,800
and if you are intentionally trying to misinterpret

1549
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
what I'm trying to say,

1550
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,800
or misinterpret anything for your own benefit,

1551
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
then that's what's not good here.

1552
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,800
If you just don't understand, then again,

1553
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
ask a question.

1554
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,800
It is my fault that you don't understand

1555
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,800
at the end of the day.

1556
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,800
I agree with that,

1557
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,800
and I think that makes the...

1558
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,800
I know we're kind of joking,

1559
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,800
but I don't think you can say you got to understand the video,

1560
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,800
because if they don't understand, it's your fault.

1561
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,800
You fucked up.

1562
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Well, right, but...

1563
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,800
I think it depends on the terms of making an effort to understand.

1564
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,800
I think if there's one or two outliers

1565
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,800
who don't understand your point,

1566
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
then you can probably be safe to say

1567
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
that while it was your communication,

1568
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
their misunderstanding,

1569
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
it might be something on their part that they're missing,

1570
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
but if the vast majority of people,

1571
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
of your audience,

1572
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,800
seems to be misinterpreting what you're saying,

1573
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,800
then it's probably your fault

1574
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
for not explaining it very well.

1575
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,800
If you watch Mr. Betung's Mass Effect 3 review,

1576
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,800
and your comment is,

1577
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Star Trek sucks.

1578
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,800
You have missed the point.

1579
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
At that point, it's like,

1580
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
well, delete.

1581
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
You're gone.

1582
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
You're destroyed.

1583
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
Yes.

1584
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
Good.

1585
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
You have to make an effort

1586
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,800
to understand it on the level

1587
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,800
that the original creator is trying to convey.

1588
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,800
Also, if anyone ever comments that Star Trek sucks,

1589
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
I will come to your house.

1590
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,800
I'm not coming for you.

1591
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,800
You will come for them,

1592
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,800
and then ask them specifically which generation.

1593
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,800
And no matter what, it's still a delete.

1594
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,800
You just want to be clear.

1595
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah.

1596
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
I just need to fill in a little bit of paperwork

1597
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
before another deletion.

1598
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,800
Yeah, that's right.

1599
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
That's right.

1600
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,800
I have another rule.

1601
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Go ahead.

1602
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Don't take everything said so seriously.

1603
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
I think there's an element of like,

1604
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
it's hard to explain,

1605
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,800
but you take someone seriously on the internet

1606
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,800
in general,

1607
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,800
and you're kind of doing it wrong.

1608
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,800
But the points,

1609
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,800
if somebody's saying something,

1610
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
it's fair to say,

1611
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
if they're just saying it normally in the speech,

1612
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
normal speech,

1613
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,800
it's fair to say that they mean what they say,

1614
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,800
but you've got to try and think sometimes

1615
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
that maybe they might be putting on a character

1616
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,800
if you don't know what the character is.

1617
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,800
I don't know.

1618
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,800
I think I know what you mean,

1619
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,800
and this is actually,

1620
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
I wanted to make a similar rule to it,

1621
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
so maybe we can combine ours a little bit.

1622
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
And mine is like,

1623
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
it's basically like,

1624
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,800
give a reasonably charitable interpretation

1625
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
of what the person is saying.

1626
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
And so there's a lot of vague language there on purpose,

1627
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,800
because what I'm trying to communicate

1628
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,800
is that a lot of times,

1629
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
things are said,

1630
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
again, in joking ways.

1631
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,800
I've made tons of jokes about,

1632
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
I don't know,

1633
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,800
how much I hate women or something in my videos,

1634
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
and one could take that a certain way.

1635
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,800
But friends of you will know those are no jokes.

1636
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,800
Exactly,

1637
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,800
and I would see each other once to realize

1638
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,800
that I am not joking when I say these things.

1639
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,800
But no,

1640
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,800
I want people to understand,

1641
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
someone could just cut that clip out

1642
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,800
and say,

1643
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
look at this clip,

1644
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
this man is a misogynist,

1645
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
he's the worst man in the world,

1646
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
et cetera, et cetera.

1647
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,800
That is being a bad viewer.

1648
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,800
That is them nitpicking,

1649
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,800
cherry picking is the word I'm looking for,

1650
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,800
and they're not consuming it

1651
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,800
within the full context.

1652
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
So when I say a charitable reading

1653
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
or a charitable interpretation,

1654
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,800
it's considering the context.

1655
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,800
I don't know, man.

1656
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,800
What do you mean, Ben?

1657
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,800
What do you mean?

1658
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
I don't know if the viewer should be obligated

1659
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,800
to have seen all your content

1660
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,800
before forming an opinion about it.

1661
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,800
I don't think it's unfair.

1662
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,800
I think that's unfair

1663
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,800
to the people making the content.

1664
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,800
I think there is some degree.

1665
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Oh, that's not such bullshit.

1666
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,800
You have to watch all their videos

1667
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,800
and know their full context

1668
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,800
before you can have a opinion about it.

1669
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,800
No, that's why I'm saying a fair amount.

1670
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
What you're saying,

1671
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,800
I think we are,

1672
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,800
maybe I'll allow me to try and clarify

1673
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
if I'm totally off base, let me know.

1674
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,800
But I think what you're saying is that

1675
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,800
if you're a commenter,

1676
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,800
and this isn't even just commenters,

1677
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,800
this is like internet rules,

1678
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,800
if you see something online

1679
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,800
that gets your goat and pisses you off,

1680
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
don't immediately have a knee-jerk reaction,

1681
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,800
give them the benefit of the doubt,

1682
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,800
and at least try and double check

1683
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,800
and make sure what you're interpreting

1684
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,800
is actually the proper context.

1685
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,800
If it's not, you're making a big deal out of it.

1686
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
I agree that good commenting

1687
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,800
and good discussion,

1688
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,800
yeah, you do need to,

1689
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,800
you should at least have all the facts.

1690
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,800
This rule comes with a mathematical formula

1691
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,800
attached to it,

1692
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,800
specifically for the calculation

1693
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
of how to do this.

1694
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,800
So this is a real rule you can apply.

1695
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,800
And it's that a person's comment,

1696
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,800
a person's comment is inversely proportional,

1697
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,800
like credible or reliable,

1698
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
inversely proportional to the amount

1699
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
of content they've consumed.

1700
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,800
So maybe I fucked that up.

1701
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,800
What I'm trying to say is,

1702
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,800
the more they know about the creator,

1703
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,800
the more their comment should matter.

1704
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,800
So like for example,

1705
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,800
if like a crazy feminazi,

1706
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,800
just as an example,

1707
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
has never seen any of my shit

1708
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,800
and sees me make a joke about women,

1709
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,800
and then says like,

1710
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,800
ah, I see this three-second clip,

1711
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,800
I have decided this man is evil,

1712
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,800
that person should be proportionately less valuable

1713
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
of an opinion than someone who has consumed

1714
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,800
all of my content.

1715
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,800
I think you've got a bit of creator bias there,

1716
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,800
because sure, that would make their comment,

1717
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,800
like them having the context into you

1718
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,800
would make the comment matter more to you,

1719
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,800
but why should anyone else care?

1720
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,800
Because that's how we arrive at truth

1721
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,800
and the correct position.

1722
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,800
I think from your perspective,

1723
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,800
and I think what you're saying is like,

1724
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,800
they definitely have a more nuanced understanding

1725
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
of your character

1726
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,800
and how you would phrase arguments,

1727
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
but doesn't necessarily make it more valuable,

1728
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,800
because someone can come in who's never...

1729
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
That's some bullshit.

1730
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,800
What are you talking about?

1731
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
How can you say that?

1732
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Because someone can come in

1733
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
and just watch one video,

1734
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
comment on the topic of the video at hand

1735
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,800
without going into like the best guy ever back catalog

1736
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,800
and still have a relevant opinion.

1737
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,800
But what can I do to solve this problem?

1738
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
My catalog exists,

1739
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,800
only they can make things more understood.

1740
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,800
I have no power to further inform them

1741
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,800
other than make the videos available,

1742
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
which they are.

1743
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,800
I think this is an inherent problem

1744
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,800
with your chosen profession.

1745
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,800
I don't think the commenters are at fault here.

1746
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,800
I...

1747
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,800
Okay, but that's why I'm talking about a...

1748
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
not a solution,

1749
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,800
but like this calculation of how much

1750
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,800
someone's opinion should matter.

1751
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,800
Okay, I admit...

1752
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,800
I think saying opinion matters

1753
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
is poisoning the well here,

1754
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
because I was on board until you were saying that

1755
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,800
the more people watch my stuff,

1756
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,800
the more their comments matter.

1757
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
I don't think that necessarily is the case.

1758
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
But those people have the information.

1759
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Look, if you want to do like IQ test

1760
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
to see the people with the highest IQ

1761
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,800
who watch my comments,

1762
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
I'm fine with that too.

1763
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
But that's be practical, Tom, goddammit.

1764
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
Come on, stop suggesting crazy things.

1765
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,800
Yeah, I think my point was more about like,

1766
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
like in general,

1767
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,800
not to take everything you see at face value,

1768
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,800
but I just had this thought a while ago

1769
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,800
and I can't remember how I put it in words,

1770
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,800
so it's kind of like muddled,

1771
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,800
and I don't know whether it's actually

1772
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,800
what you're saying, Nate.

1773
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
Here's...

1774
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
Okay, they could be slightly different.

1775
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Here's a broad criticism

1776
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
of everything you've ever said, Nate,

1777
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,800
in your entire life.

1778
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Sure.

1779
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
I think, I mean,

1780
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,800
you're putting your content out there.

1781
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
You got to do that with the understanding

1782
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,800
that it's there for the general audience

1783
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,800
and the general audience consume,

1784
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,800
is comprised of a broad spectrum of people,

1785
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,800
some of which are real dum-dums,

1786
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,800
some of which just don't care about

1787
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,800
not acting like dum-dums,

1788
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,800
and you just got to understand

1789
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,800
you're going to get shit comments

1790
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
and I don't see the point of complaining.

1791
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,800
The way that I think about this...

1792
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,800
Guys here, we just want to elevate the people who are dum.

1793
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,800
It wouldn't...

1794
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,800
They're not going to be elevated.

1795
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Those people aren't going to listen.

1796
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,800
There's no point.

1797
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,800
There's no point.

1798
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,800
You just got to go with the flow.

1799
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,800
You got to go into this being aware

1800
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
and go with the flow on it.

1801
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
I absolutely do.

1802
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,800
I absolutely do.

1803
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,800
Which is why, I don't know,

1804
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,800
I feel like I could make...

1805
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
To people who really know my content,

1806
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,800
I could make all kinds of racial jokes

1807
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,800
and be incredibly dark jokes and stuff,

1808
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
but I choose not to do that kind of stuff

1809
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
in my main videos for exactly this reason.

1810
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,800
I don't expect everyone to have full context

1811
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
all the time.

1812
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,800
So yeah, I get it,

1813
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,800
but I still think it is a purely reasonable thing

1814
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,800
to suggest that just as we would treat

1815
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,800
the opinion on, I don't know,

1816
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,800
the rising ocean levels in the world,

1817
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,800
we would trust an oceanographer

1818
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,800
with his opinion on that more than a commenter,

1819
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,800
like just a random man off the street

1820
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,800
who runs a hot dog joint or whatever.

1821
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,800
I respect the hot dog profession immensely,

1822
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,800
but nonetheless, I think the oceanographers

1823
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,800
were qualified.

1824
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
I guess this commenter rule is white

1825
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
until you think you know a bit more

1826
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,800
about what you're saying.

1827
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,800
I guess it goes back into understand.

1828
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,800
Refer to my formula, everyone.

1829
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
Refer to the formula.

1830
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,800
When I say commenter rules,

1831
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,800
and I say about banning commenters,

1832
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,800
I want to clarify the fact that

1833
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
that is all that I wish,

1834
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,800
that they do not act like this in my vicinity.

1835
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,800
I would never get Obama on the phone

1836
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,800
and lock these people up for making a comment

1837
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,800
that I don't approve of,

1838
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,800
and there's no empirical objective law here

1839
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,800
that they have broken and validated,

1840
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,800
and therefore they are a bad person

1841
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,800
who deserves to be ostracized for the rest of society,

1842
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,800
for the rest of their fucking miserable lives.

1843
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,800
They don't deserve to be ostracized,

1844
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,800
but they do deserve to be Auschwitz-sized.

1845
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,800
That's what I want for all of them.

1846
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
All that I want here

1847
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,800
is when I have the power,

1848
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,800
which I do in this context,

1849
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,800
I would like to use my power

1850
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,800
in ways that I think is justified and good.

1851
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,800
If I was CEO of YouTube,

1852
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
I wouldn't ban someone for these reasons,

1853
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,800
because the terms of service,

1854
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,800
there's no law they're breaking here.

1855
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,800
These are societal things

1856
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,800
that I just wish that was upon the people.

1857
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,800
And there are people who have turned it not dumb.

1858
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,800
The old Fag PCP fans are incredible,

1859
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
and they are great commenters

1860
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
because they've listened to commenter rules.

1861
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
Exactly what I'm talking about.

1862
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
I've seen people become better commenters

1863
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
because of that video,

1864
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,800
and they take it to heart,

1865
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,800
and so there's a real benefit to saying these things.

1866
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,800
Maybe not to the swabs of the unwashed masses,

1867
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,800
but if I could make one person think the way I do,

1868
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,800
that's what I want to do in life.

1869
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,800
I want people to be like me.

1870
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,800
That's my goal here.

1871
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
I want people to be like me.

1872
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
If you're saying that my rule is too vague

1873
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
and impractical and won't,

1874
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800
like, I don't know, you can't enforce it or whatever,

1875
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,800
it doesn't make any sense, then so be it.

1876
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
But God damn it, I'll continue to dream.

1877
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,800
I'll continue.

1878
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,800
I'll never stop.

1879
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,800
Ben, no matter what you do to me,

1880
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,800
no matter how mad you hurt my feelings.

1881
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,800
I'll do whatever it takes.

1882
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,800
Your feelings are grass and I'm the mower.

1883
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,800
I thought you were going to say catano or something cool.

1884
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
Don't have been sick, dude.

1885
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:45,800
I do always agree that it is usually the creator's fault.

1886
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,800
The commenters do deserve leeway,

1887
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:54,800
and they deserve the benefit of that just as much as we do.

1888
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,800
But I think there's a compromise here that can be obtained.

1889
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,800
It would be better if commenters were smart for their own good

1890
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
because they wouldn't be retarded anymore.

1891
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,800
It brings me back to, like, if I made...

1892
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,800
I talk all the time about how I want the betterment of humanity,

1893
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,800
but if I just, like, made a joke one time about, like,

1894
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,800
yeah, blah, blah, blah, I want to literally kill all humans.

1895
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,800
And, like, just for whatever reason,

1896
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,800
that clip gets shared around and they're like,

1897
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,800
oh, look at, like, evil mass murderer,

1898
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,800
you know, wannabe best guy ever.

1899
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,800
And then, like, a news story sparks because of that.

1900
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,800
Like, that would be people being ignorant of, like,

1901
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
what I actually think.

1902
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,800
And it reminds me of the PewDiePie thing.

1903
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,800
That's, like, what happened to PewDiePie.

1904
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,800
People who didn't know shit about the context of the guy,

1905
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,800
just, like, taking his jokes at the context.

1906
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,800
Well, that comes back to just taking...

1907
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,800
to giving a generous interpretation

1908
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,800
to the things you have no context of.

1909
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,800
When is something inflammatory like that?

1910
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,800
I guess I would just say that the rules for a good comment

1911
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,800
are pretty similar to the rules for just being, like,

1912
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,800
a worthwhile person in general.

1913
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,800
Like, if you run your mouth about something

1914
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,800
that you have no context of and no idea what you're talking about,

1915
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
then, yeah, you look like an idiot and your comment is bad.

1916
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Like, if someone is, like,

1917
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,800
Nate said that women are bad,

1918
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
then it's, like, well, okay.

1919
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,800
Which I do.

1920
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
But he does it all the time and it's a joke.

1921
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,800
I mean, if they had more context and they were, like,

1922
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,800
well, I know that he's making all these jokes,

1923
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,800
but, you know, I don't like that he makes these jokes

1924
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,800
for these and these reasons, and they have, like, a well-formed...

1925
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,800
Like, that's two different stories.

1926
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,800
Absolutely.

1927
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,800
So just know what you're talking about

1928
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,800
in the YouTube comments section and in life.

1929
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,800
Just the other day, I got a letter on one of my weaguas,

1930
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,800
like, from a girl who's, like, uncomfortable

1931
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
with my, like, jokes about Hillary and stuff.

1932
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
And I just explain how, you know, like, I think it's all good fun.

1933
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,800
I'm not trying to hurt anybody's feelings.

1934
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,800
And I, like, I just gave, like, a thoughtful thing

1935
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
and a lot of people commented and said, like,

1936
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,800
dude, we really respect you for, you know, treating it this way

1937
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,800
and not just, like, shitting on her.

1938
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,800
And I respect her for, like, not just shitposting,

1939
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
but, like, this is two people trying to understand each other better.

1940
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,800
And that's what I like as opposed to shit-slinging,

1941
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,800
you know, just by respect.

1942
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,800
And that was a comment that was critical of your content.

1943
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
And that didn't mean it was a bad comment.

1944
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
Yep. Yeah, it was a great comment.

1945
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,800
I think that's something that's so lost on internet discourse

1946
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,800
that I really wish wasn't, is that instead of just

1947
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,800
immediately going to, like, trying to meme it out

1948
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,800
and, like, shit on people, just, like, have that dialogue,

1949
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,800
because then you're nine times out of ten,

1950
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,800
you're gonna come to an amicable understanding of some sort,

1951
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
even if they're still disagreements,

1952
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
like, well, at least I understand where they're coming from.

1953
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
Just, like, imagine you met this person in real life.

1954
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
You would never say these sorts of things to them.

1955
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
And, like, you know, like, guys like, like,

1956
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,800
like, Mumki, for example, it seems to me,

1957
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,800
like, the difference between us who, like,

1958
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
are talking about rules and stuff, we, like,

1959
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
haven't given up on internet discourse,

1960
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,800
whereas guys like him, and, like, a lot of people

1961
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,800
on 4chan are like, they're like, it's all a joke, you know?

1962
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
It doesn't matter. None of it's relevant.

1963
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,800
It's all completely goofy. Whereas, I think, at least,

1964
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,800
I feel, and I think this is shared, that we think we can,

1965
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,800
we can rescue this. Like, there is good to be found here.

1966
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,800
I don't think we can... Yeah, yeah.

1967
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,800
There is good. I don't think we can rescue it.

1968
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,800
But that doesn't mean that it's worthless.

1969
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,800
Fair enough. Fair enough.

1970
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,800
I think it can be improved.

1971
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,800
I think you can cultivate a nice place

1972
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,800
on your own channel, at least. Yeah, I suppose.

1973
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,800
Yeah, I guess, I guess I've seen that.

1974
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,800
I think for me, it's less about trying to, like,

1975
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800
change everything on a macro scale,

1976
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,800
and just, like, choosing the kind of people

1977
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,800
I want to interact with. Sure.

1978
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,800
But, you know, every, every one of these small changes

1979
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,800
affects the large degree, you know?

1980
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,800
I totally believe in changing yourself to better the world.

1981
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,800
I'm totally in that, and I feel that applies to you.

1982
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,800
Like, just to speak in defense of Monkey,

1983
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,800
like, I think that his, his, his ideas are fine too.

1984
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,800
Like, his comments are like a shit show,

1985
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,800
but there's kind of, like, some funny shit there as well.

1986
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,800
Well, that's how he likes it, and that's totally fine, of course.

1987
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,800
Yeah, and he's the creator, and he wants that to be the case.

1988
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,800
So there's no, there's absolutely no problem there.

1989
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
I, for one, would not like those comments to be

1990
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,800
on the PCP channel anymore, but that doesn't mean they're,

1991
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,800
you know, like, like, the reason those were made,

1992
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,800
is because they thought those were good comments,

1993
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,800
because, you know, that Monkey likes them.

1994
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,800
So, you know, I don't think they were made in ill will.

1995
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,800
You know, all, all of the, like, mean, like,

1996
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,800
fuck you, Monkey comments, all those are made in good will,

1997
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,800
because that's what he likes, and that's what he promotes.

1998
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,800
It's, it's a good time, or, you know,

1999
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,800
I don't want, I don't want to speak for him or anything, you know?

2000
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,800
But that's why this place is transpiring here.

2001
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,800
It's a difference of, of ideas about how to approach this,

2002
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
this subject, which is totally fine.

2003
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
You know, you know, these are just boxes of ideas.

2004
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Just don't, don't, don't limit yourself to just one.

2005
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,800
You know, atheism, Christianity, new age beliefs,

2006
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,800
you know, just pack them all together.

2007
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,800
Pick and choose and build your own theism.

2008
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,800
It's great.

2009
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,800
Yeah!

2010
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,800
It's like, it's like you're playing Minecraft,

2011
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,800
and these are your materials.

2012
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,800
You can just build yourself a house, build yourself whatever the fuck you want.

2013
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,800
That's what, that's what it is.

2014
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,800
Well, I only understand things in Minecraft terms.

2015
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
I think we understand each other pretty well.

2016
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
Um, if there's, I mean, I think,

2017
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,800
I guess we could talk all day about this, but...

2018
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
Well, I have one more rule.

2019
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
I was going to suggest going on to questions,

2020
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,800
but okay, I don't mean to...

2021
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,800
I have one more rule.

2022
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
And it's, it's kind of a short one because it's,

2023
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,800
it's kind of funny and silly, but it's, um,

2024
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,800
please swear more if you're going to be pretentious.

2025
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,800
Um, one thing I hate, like, like,

2026
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,800
you know how, you know, in the early days of the Internet,

2027
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,800
it was all like fuck, and that was like a big deal.

2028
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,800
Sure.

2029
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
Like people would swear and they could do it now.

2030
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,800
They could swear in front of people,

2031
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,800
and they could say swears and their parents weren't seeing.

2032
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,800
And like that was the thing.

2033
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,800
And there was swears everywhere.

2034
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
And then it was sort of like, oh, uh,

2035
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
swears are for babies.

2036
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,800
Like if you really want to get someone,

2037
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,800
you have to be a pretentious, know-it-all idiot

2038
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,800
who just types a lot of big words from the dictionary

2039
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,800
in the thesaurus, and you look like a cunt,

2040
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
and I don't like you.

2041
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,800
You're just really annoying me.

2042
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,800
Side note there.

2043
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,800
But a well-placed, a well-placed, um, swear word is hilarious.

2044
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,800
If you had your really pretentious, annoying comment,

2045
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,800
you know, smarmingly like brushing everything I said aside,

2046
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,800
and then at the end said, get fucked.

2047
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,800
It would make it better for me to read,

2048
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,800
and I would be like, yeah, alright.

2049
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,800
You got me.

2050
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,800
Side note from that, I love big words,

2051
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,800
and I hate this vilification of big words.

2052
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
I like reading old stuff because there's big old words.

2053
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
What does that mean?

2054
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,800
Big words are fun and funny,

2055
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,800
but if you use them wrong, the consequences are dire.

2056
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,800
So use big words, but only appropriately.

2057
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,800
You have to really understand the words.

2058
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,800
You have to read them and understand what the synonyms are,

2059
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,800
and then just, you know, pick one of those.

2060
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,800
It'll be great.

2061
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,800
I have a rule that may just apply to me.

2062
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,800
I don't know if anyone else will agree with this.

2063
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,800
It's being edgy for the sake of being edgy.

2064
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,800
And keep in mind, that does not mean don't be edgy.

2065
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,800
I am edgy.

2066
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,800
I like saying kill yourself.

2067
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
That's real good.

2068
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,800
I like that.

2069
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,800
But I think that, at least from my perspective,

2070
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,800
there's a couple times where I think I see comments

2071
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,800
in my comment section, especially,

2072
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,800
where people will just tack on edgy, kill yourself things.

2073
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,800
I don't think that's the tone of what they're trying to say,

2074
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,800
and they're just trying to say that to look cool or cute.

2075
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,800
This is just like, guys, you don't have to be mean.

2076
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,800
Be mean if you want to, but you don't have to be.

2077
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,800
That's not the thing that you have to be.

2078
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,800
I don't like you more because you say kill yourself

2079
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,800
or you fucking hack or something.

2080
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,800
Yeah, I know what you mean.

2081
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,800
It's like a foe, you're swearing or you're being edgy

2082
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,800
for the comedy, but it's not right.

2083
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Can we compare that to a rule along the lines of,

2084
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,800
if you're an internet tough guy, you get an internet time out.

2085
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,800
Something along those lines, you know?

2086
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,800
I mean, you know.

2087
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,800
I don't know how to enforce that, but we'll find a way.

2088
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,800
We'll find less harsh rules because they wouldn't ban someone

2089
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
for being like this.

2090
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,800
All of these rules are just guidelines.

2091
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,800
Oh shit, I forgot.

2092
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,800
We didn't really define, we talked about deleting comments

2093
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,800
and turning off comments.

2094
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,800
We didn't really talk about banning people from comments,

2095
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,800
which I guess is we could simply say,

2096
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,800
if you violate enough rules, enough times, or enough egregious ways,

2097
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,800
then you're just eligible to get banned.

2098
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,800
That's a long time offender sort of thing.

2099
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,800
If you show a lack of good faith

2100
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,800
and an indefatigable propensity to see big words,

2101
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,800
they're cool and I'm great, I'm the smartest.

2102
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,800
If you show a strong proclivity towards just shit comments

2103
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
and not knowing what you're talking about,

2104
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,800
then I think you should be banned and there's nothing wrong with that.

2105
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,800
Agreed, very much agreed.

2106
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,800
And so just like, you can be nice.

2107
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,800
You don't have to be mean guys.

2108
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,800
You don't have to treat the internet

2109
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,800
as a sewer for poo poo words, everybody.

2110
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,800
It can be a nice place, you know?

2111
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,800
It can be.

2112
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,800
It's difficult to be the nice person saying,

2113
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
I really like that video thumbs up.

2114
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,800
That's hard to write because your mom will kiss you

2115
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,800
and then you'll feel bad.

2116
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,800
Yeah, exactly.

2117
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,800
And I only have one last one.

2118
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,800
I don't know if anyone else has a rule.

2119
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,800
I've been carrying this.

2120
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,800
Thank you, everyone.

2121
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,800
This is specifically for me.

2122
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,800
This rule is in relation to ones.

2123
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
A very integral part of my...

2124
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
The people have been craving this one.

2125
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,800
Yeah, I have a very...

2126
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,800
I'm very torn with this.

2127
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,800
In and of myself.

2128
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,800
Because on one hand,

2129
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,800
I like scrolling down the Deagle Nation lecture

2130
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,800
and just seeing thousands of people

2131
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,800
with just a wall of ones.

2132
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,800
Just like that's it.

2133
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,800
Just a wall, a title wave of ones.

2134
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,800
Well, you know, sometimes there will be videos

2135
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,800
that I also want to see the discussion of Deagle Nation.

2136
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,800
And that comment section is really a beautiful mesh.

2137
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,800
Because here's, I think, how you do it the best way.

2138
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,800
You press one for as long as you want to,

2139
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,800
you hold that sucker down,

2140
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,800
you do some ASCII.

2141
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,800
You make a big one out of a lot of little ones

2142
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
and you ask you out of ones.

2143
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,800
All that sort of great stuff.

2144
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,800
And then you just do comma or enter.

2145
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
And then type your other comment there.

2146
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,800
I don't want there to be ever...

2147
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,800
A lot of people, our contemporaries,

2148
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
would not like a lot of the ones there.

2149
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,800
But I like the ones. I like it when you press one.

2150
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,800
Also, please make another...

2151
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,800
Don't make another comment.

2152
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,800
Make just one comment, please.

2153
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,800
Can we put down the language for this one

2154
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
as something along the lines of,

2155
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,800
when you press one, you may also comment after said one.

2156
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Something along those lines.

2157
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
You may also press two.

2158
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,800
If you're feeling saucy.

2159
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,800
You just call the rule pressing one is only step one.

2160
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one.

2161
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,800
I like that a lot.

2162
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,800
That's an invitation to keep going.

2163
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,800
That being said, a press one, everyone.

2164
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,800
Indeed.

2165
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,800
Take that first step.

2166
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,800
I just have a rule just to sum up.

2167
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,800
I don't know if this actually was in the first batch of rules,

2168
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
but again, just want to reiterate.

2169
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,800
The rule is this comment section is not your home.

2170
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,800
You have no rights.

2171
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,800
Your ability to comment is a privilege.

2172
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,800
I just want to put that in stone.

2173
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,800
That belongs on their side.

2174
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,800
Indeed.

2175
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,800
Well, sick.

2176
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
Questions?

2177
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,800
Let's skedaddle on over to the PCP Patreon Lounge.

2178
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,800
This is all the people who aren't bad commenters.

2179
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,800
These guys are good. They're real good.

2180
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,800
They have given us money and gone into the exclusive PCP.

2181
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,800
You know what?

2182
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Even if they were bad commenters,

2183
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,800
they've purchased annulments via their Patreon Lounge.

2184
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,800
I was just going to say that.

2185
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,800
That's exactly right, guys.

2186
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,800
We should add this as an incentive.

2187
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,800
You get an immediate comment or violation annulment

2188
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,800
by pledging to the PCP Patreon without a doubt.

2189
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,800
That's official.

2190
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
There you go. If you want to cleanse yourself.

2191
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,800
If you ever leave, if you ever sin again,

2192
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,800
you just need to up your pledge and it gets refreshed.

2193
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
Just keep that in mind, everybody.

2194
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,800
Before we get to the premium delicious,

2195
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,800
decadent Patreon Lounge questions,

2196
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,800
why don't you read the dirty, disgusting,

2197
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,800
malaria riddled, yellow fever,

2198
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,800
you know, jungle fever, a Twitter question.

2199
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,800
Sounds good.

2200
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,800
The token Twitter question.

2201
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
It is the token one at this point.

2202
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,800
Everybody, just so you know, this is at at TP Crasinators,

2203
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,800
our Twitter accounts, every Saturday when we record these,

2204
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,800
around four or five, we send out the full thing

2205
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
with hashtag askPCP.

2206
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,800
Just send questions using that hashtag and we'll read them.

2207
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,800
Here we go.

2208
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,800
Where did that go?

2209
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Here we go.

2210
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,800
What are some good Patreons to donate to?

2211
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,800
I can think of only one.

2212
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
Only one.

2213
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
My one.

2214
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Patreon.com slash save me.

2215
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:07,800
Obviously, the question is all of us.

2216
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,800
But you know, if you've got some money left over,

2217
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,800
obviously donate your entire wallet to us.

2218
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,800
But if you have some left over,

2219
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,800
that for some reason you can't give to us,

2220
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
what are some other creators we want to give to us?

2221
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,800
That's the question.

2222
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
I actually have a real answer for this.

2223
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
There's one.

2224
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,800
What's it called?

2225
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
I actually have been a patron for a long time.

2226
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,800
I'm pledging $1 a month to Japanese emoticons.me.

2227
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,800
They make like $7 a month.

2228
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,800
So I'm like a significant percentage of their...

2229
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,800
Would you give them five bucks or something?

2230
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,800
No, I give them one.

2231
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,800
I give them $1.

2232
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,800
Actually, I used to use Japanese emojis all the time.

2233
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,800
I haven't in a while, and that's probably a big mistake.

2234
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,800
I should definitely max revive those.

2235
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,800
I don't know, it's just a site with a repository of great,

2236
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,800
hilarious emojis, or emoticons, rather.

2237
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,800
And I just like, wow, they make $7 a month for hosting all this stuff.

2238
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,800
If notable homeless man Ben St. can give to a patron,

2239
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,800
so can you, noble viewer, noble listener.

2240
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,800
True, indeed.

2241
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:19,800
I have a little YouTuber that I famously on my Twitter

2242
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,800
have recently eaten top ramen while listening to,

2243
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,800
called Brain For Breakfast,

2244
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,800
who makes some real cool CGP grave videos,

2245
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,800
but they're better, and I like them more.

2246
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,800
So there you go.

2247
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,800
He makes superior CGP grave videos with CGP gray in them,

2248
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
but his are better, right?

2249
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,800
Yeah, he makes geography shit.

2250
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,800
So there you go, I like him.

2251
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
He's making like $200 or something.

2252
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,800
So like similar content to like the...

2253
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,800
Brain For Breakfast, yeah.

2254
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,800
Educational country things,

2255
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,800
and he uses pulling ball because he's a hack and can't drive, yes.

2256
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,800
I love pulling ball, excellent meme.

2257
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,800
Yeah, he's a good guy.

2258
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,800
Anyone else?

2259
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,800
I would never give money to anyone, so no, not for me.

2260
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,800
You can't forget about the classic Dr. Wolf.

2261
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,800
Oh, no doubt.

2262
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,800
That was a joke, ladies and gentlemen.

2263
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,800
Do not even think about looking at that.

2264
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,800
I patron, or I used to patron, hot diggity demon.

2265
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,800
I feel like that is like a good investment

2266
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,800
because those cartoons are like really good,

2267
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
early animated.

2268
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,800
I appreciate the work that goes into them a lot.

2269
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,800
I've actually been, you know, there's this one creator I'm following.

2270
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,800
Actually, it's these two brothers I've been following since like 2013

2271
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,800
and they've really gone downhill and I haven't posted in a while.

2272
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,800
But I'm just waiting for the day they come back.

2273
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,800
It's called T... I forget the name of it.

2274
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,800
It's something long, you know, T-B-something.

2275
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,800
Anyway, go try and search them up.

2276
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,800
They used to do pulling reviews and I'm a real big fan of them.

2277
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,800
I've been patroning them for a real couple of long years now.

2278
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,800
Now they're just hosting some shitty knockoff content

2279
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,800
from the Rowdyfuckers cartoon.

2280
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2281
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
I don't know what's up with that.

2282
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,800
What a bunch of bullshit that is.

2283
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
But frankly, it's disgusting.

2284
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,800
You know what?

2285
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,800
I realize, sometimes I am tempted to give to patrons.

2286
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,800
The only people I respect on Patreon, the only people,

2287
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,800
are the people who make gated content

2288
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
because they're the only ones who ever tempt me

2289
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,800
to actually pledge that I love you.

2290
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,800
Like me.

2291
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,800
Yeah, I have been tempted to pledge you so I can see those pages.

2292
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,800
Like me and my speed draw videos

2293
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,800
and my early pages and my beta testing period

2294
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,800
for the game that's out now on stcomics.com.

2295
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,800
I'm a proud patron of patreon.com.

2296
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,800
You are.

2297
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,800
It's very early on.

2298
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,800
And I love you a lot.

2299
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,800
And I would love you too, viewers.

2300
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,800
Yeah, if you pledged.

2301
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,800
Yeah, I made a deliberate...

2302
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,800
Well, I went out of my way.

2303
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,800
I wasn't making the speed draw videos, for example,

2304
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,800
but I was like, I should really make some gated content.

2305
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,800
Stuff that people that aren't interested

2306
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,800
aren't going to be mad that they're not going to see,

2307
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,800
but people that are interested will be like,

2308
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,800
yes, I'm getting my money's worth.

2309
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,800
I'm actually getting something for my pledge.

2310
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
And that's been pretty sick.

2311
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,800
I don't know if it works, but hopefully...

2312
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,800
You hear viewers, if you donate to patreon.com.com.

2313
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,800
been saying he will love you more than he loves Munchy.

2314
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,800
Only if you donate more than Munchy.

2315
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,800
Which is a lot.

2316
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,800
I think Munchy's donating about $100.

2317
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,800
That's the number to beat everyone.

2318
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,800
Is it also incorrect to say that the Champion Chapter 1

2319
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,800
will be fully out when people are hearing this podcast?

2320
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,800
It was out as of last week when the...

2321
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,800
Yes, correct.

2322
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,800
Yes, so by the time this post, it will have been out for a week

2323
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,800
over at stcomics.com.

2324
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,800
There's your warning, folks.

2325
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Stay away from that website.

2326
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,800
But I'll be starting Vapor's Chapter 3 soon,

2327
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,800
and that will probably be Patreon exclusive until it's done,

2328
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
so if you want to see that...

2329
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,800
Is this the one about the girl?

2330
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
It will be about the girl.

2331
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,800
Every single time Patreon comes up,

2332
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,800
I don't like the fact that my Patreon URL is my name,

2333
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,800
so I never say it.

2334
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
I really should change it to Hippocrite,

2335
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
but I don't know if I can at this point.

2336
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
I thought the point of that was that you didn't want

2337
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
you to tie down to Hippocrite.

2338
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
I know, and that's the thing, because it's like,

2339
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
what else the fuck will I use it for?

2340
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
Just do Hippocrite. I think that makes sense.

2341
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,800
And then you can change it again if you need to.

2342
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
It will be Patreon.com slash Hippocrite.

2343
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
The same as everything else.

2344
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,800
By the way, the reason I brought up Gated Content

2345
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
is I do want to salute the

2346
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
various porn Patreon people

2347
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
who I check in on.

2348
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
Yes, that's right, everybody.

2349
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
This is one guy, Pinoy Toons.

2350
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Pinoy Toons. I like him a lot.

2351
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,800
He makes very sexual drawings

2352
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
that I very enjoy with my penis.

2353
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
It's weird.

2354
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
It's this weird brand of pornography.

2355
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
The very sexy pornography.

2356
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
I would not agree.

2357
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
That's right.

2358
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
Shout out to him for Gating Content

2359
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,800
within the demo of his porn game.

2360
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
That piece of shit with the free version.

2361
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,800
In the middle of a fucking sex scene,

2362
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,800
he put the second part of it behind a fucking gate.

2363
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,800
I hated him so much, but I honestly

2364
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,800
respect him for having that audacity

2365
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,800
to just fuck me over like that.

2366
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,800
Like a piece of shit.

2367
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
If you ever want to know what makes

2368
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,800
my stomach boil and my hair fall out

2369
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,800
and my fucking body turn to dust.

2370
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,800
It's looking at the Patreon

2371
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,800
who's getting paid the most

2372
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,800
and having all the porn people

2373
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,800
and having all the actual people

2374
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,800
with real intellectual content

2375
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,800
making one-fourth of the stuff

2376
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,800
that the fucking disgusting porn people are making.

2377
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
When is our wonderful red-pilled warrior Patreon

2378
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
overlords going to come down

2379
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,800
on those filthy porn makers

2380
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,800
like they promised they would in ages ago?

2381
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,800
When is that going to happen?

2382
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,800
Are they not doing porn anymore?

2383
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,800
I'd say they were changing their policy at some point.

2384
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
You can't do any live action porn

2385
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,800
and any

2386
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,800
risqué drawn porn

2387
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
will get you shut the fuck down.

2388
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,800
You can't make risqué drawings

2389
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
on this website.

2390
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Are you implying that you can make non-risqué drawn porn?

2391
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,800
I don't understand the distinction there.

2392
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,800
The terms that they said

2393
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,800
is anything that was like

2394
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
rape or B.C. Alley

2395
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,800
or anything like French shit.

2396
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,800
You're not allowed to draw.

2397
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,800
You can do that missionary shit

2398
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,800
no problem and that's fine.

2399
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,800
What the fuck is that bullshit?

2400
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,800
That's the weirdest kind of context possible.

2401
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,800
It is pretty stupid.

2402
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,800
I just love vanilla.

2403
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,800
I guess they just want to make vanilla porn.

2404
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,800
Well, cool.

2405
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,800
The absolute cowards.

2406
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,800
Across the board demolish them is what I say.

2407
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,800
Anything even the tiniest bit risqué.

2408
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,800
Anything that can be confused for risqué.

2409
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,800
If you want to know more

2410
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,800
I made a great video on my channel

2411
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
where I'm talking about this called

2412
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,800
Jack vs. Jack in it.

2413
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,800
It was great.

2414
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,800
Oh, I watched that.

2415
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,800
10 out of 10.

2416
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,800
Excellent.

2417
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
Here's something that we've discussed

2418
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,800
among ourselves recently a lot.

2419
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
Too much to a heated extent.

2420
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
From Jackboy

2421
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
in the patron lounge.

2422
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
When do you guys think the PCPHQ will happen

2423
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,800
and then no

2424
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,800
proper grammar or syntax

2425
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
after we're just I'm gay?

2426
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
Well done.

2427
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,800
I'm glad you're comfortable with that.

2428
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,800
He's here and he's ready to stay.

2429
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,800
I don't know, dude.

2430
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
Maybe within the next year?

2431
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,800
I mean, plans are...

2432
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
Keep an eye out around May of next year.

2433
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,800
I'm just going to level with you.

2434
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,800
The more money you give us

2435
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,800
the sooner it's going to happen.

2436
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
You're not wrong. It's true.

2437
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,800
That is true.

2438
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800
I don't know how much you open your wallet

2439
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
is when this shit's going to go down.

2440
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,800
It is a major operation

2441
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,800
to readjust our entire lives

2442
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,800
if we're going to make this happen.

2443
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,800
It's a big thing. It's going to take a while.

2444
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
People need to get established

2445
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,800
and financial security has to happen for a lot of people.

2446
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,800
It will happen piece by piece, I am sure,

2447
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,800
when it finally does start to happen.

2448
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,800
It won't be a sudden change.

2449
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
If you want that insider info

2450
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
really the key players

2451
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
you have to look with your binoculars

2452
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,800
to see and digi

2453
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
and wherever they go

2454
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,800
then that's where it's going to be.

2455
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,800
They unfortunately decide

2456
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
the fate of our lives.

2457
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
Yeah. Well, I am 100%

2458
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,800
committed. It is my goal in life

2459
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,800
so we'll see and it's just a matter of

2460
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,800
the financial things being where they need to be

2461
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,800
so more money the faster it happens

2462
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,800
legitimately. It's not a joke.

2463
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,800
It is my goal in life.

2464
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
Any more questions?

2465
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,800
I'm scrolling through. These are pretty bad.

2466
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
These are not very nice.

2467
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,800
They're not very choice.

2468
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,800
I can check out the

2469
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,800
Twitter if we want to go...

2470
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,800
No, no.

2471
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,800
They got there. We threw them their bone.

2472
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,800
It's kind of silly

2473
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
how the people in the Patreon lounge

2474
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,800
they just throw away that chance of getting the questions

2475
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,800
to us.

2476
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,800
I don't understand.

2477
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,800
No, that's a terrible question. Never mind.

2478
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,800
Wait, okay.

2479
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,800
We've been going a while. I'm ready to call it.

2480
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,800
Let's do one more here.

2481
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,800
From the Twitter.

2482
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Here we go.

2483
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,800
At L33CH

2484
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,800
I think it's like Leech.

2485
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,800
With numbers and shit.

2486
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,800
At Leech asks, should we have a public execution

2487
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,800
of all crippled people?

2488
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,800
Specifically to you, Ben.

2489
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,800
Great question.

2490
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,800
Great question.

2491
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,800
I'm leaning towards you.

2492
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,800
And that's all for today.

2493
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
No further comments.

2494
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
Resounding yes. Goodbye.

2495
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,800
All right. Well, okay.

2496
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
On that front, thanks for listening everybody.

2497
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,800
Make sure you pledge to our patrons.

2498
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,800
Preferably, once you read a dictionary

2499
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,800
or grow a brain or a soul,

2500
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,800
please, so you can ask good questions.

2501
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,800
Indeed.

2502
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,800
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

2503
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,800
They have money, but not necessarily

2504
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,800
wit.

2505
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,800
Slammed. Fucking slammed.

2506
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,800
And of course, people, don't forget.

2507
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,800
$5 pledge is getting access to all the bonus

2508
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
episodes. There will be nine out

2509
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,800
by the time this comes out.

2510
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
So that'll be very exciting.

2511
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,800
Very exciting.

2512
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,800
All right. Bye.

2513
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,800
Hang on. We got red bubble stuff.

2514
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,800
You can buy merch. We got PCB logos.

2515
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
We got stickers. Check out Hippocrates Twitter.

2516
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
He's using those, putting them on things.

2517
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,800
Extremely helpful.

2518
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,800
Check out my Twitter for that information.

2519
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,800
Yeah, he's using them.

2520
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,800
Is there anything else I'm missing?

2521
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,800
We're on iTunes and Google Play.

2522
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,800
I do it every week. It's a lot of effort.

2523
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,800
Listen to it so it's not wasted.

2524
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,800
Thank you very much, Tom.

2525
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,800
All right. Thanks for listening, everybody.

2526
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,800
We'll see you next week.

2527
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,800
Bye.

2528
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,800
Goodbye.

2529
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,800
Gross.

2530
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,800
Yeah.

2531
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,800
I'm supposed to

2532
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,800
be working right now.

2533
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,800
I'm supposed

2534
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
to be working

2535
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,800
right now.

2536
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,800
But I'm not working.

2537
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,800
I'm doing nothing.

2538
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,800
My dick, I'm jerking.

2539
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,800
Myself, I'm sucking.

2540
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,800
I am an asshole.

2541
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,800
I am a stupid.

2542
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,800
I've got a deadline.

2543
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,800
Don't want to do it.
