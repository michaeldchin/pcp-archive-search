00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,720
not joking. I looked over the comments and the consensus cash money. Don't worry, I will

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:51,120
use my god powers responsibly. You wouldn't have them if you were going to use them responsibly.

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:04,320
If I don't, the police are standing by. Anyway, Ben Saint, welcome.

5
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:17,240
Little Ben, John Saint. There is Lil John Buuh, my favorite guy.

6
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,880
I don't want to be on the podcast this week. It's because I stayed up all night last night.

7
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Typical Ben.

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Crossing animals.

9
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,600
Oh yes, let's get right into it. Yes, tell us about it, Ben. Tell us about it.

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Well, I'll tell you this.

11
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I've had development.

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,520
I'll tell you the struggle. I'll tell you the struggle. First, I had to catch the new

13
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,720
sea fish. I had two nights ago.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,400
I caught a new butterfly today. It was based. It was green.

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I loved it.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,760
Did you have your bird wing?

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,760
You know what? I'll pull it up right now.

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
I'll tell you in just a second.

19
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Well, a couple nights ago, I had Ethan and Kazi over my island because it was raining.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,360
We all kind of visited each other's islands, but it was raining. There was a thunderstorm

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,520
and they both were like, while I'm here, I'm going to catch a sealocanth. We all fished

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
and everyone caught a sealocanth. Even I caught a sealocanth. I didn't even want one.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
I forgot.

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I forgot that the reason we were doing it was because Kazi had like a meteor shower and

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
so we're all there.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,280
Bro, I've been nuts with the meteor showers. I found like a hundred meteors in the sky

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,760
the first time, literally. Over a hundred.

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,600
I think I didn't know what to look for, but now that I know what the sound is to listen

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,680
for, I feel like maybe they've been happening more often than I thought.

31
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah, I think so.

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,400
But I got it today. I just happened to log in and Isabelle's like, by the way, tonight

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,480
there's going to be a meteor shower, so watch the fuck out, which I assume means there's

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,000
going to be like a lots, which is pretty neat.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Guess so.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,400
But anyway, so the other night they were doing that. We made wishes, caught sealocanth. Everyone

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,880
had a sealocanth. It was great, but I didn't want a sealocanth. I wanted the barrel eye,

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,880
which is another weird rare fish, and I hunted for it and I managed to find, you know, the

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,800
barrel eye was my white whale, you might say, and I got two of them legendary. But last

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,880
night I was like, well, there's a couple more fish I haven't got. I need the mahi mahi,

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:27,880
and I need the giant terravale, terravel, whatever.

42
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Don't know it.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,120
And so I fucking took me to like five in the morning. I don't know why. It was so hard to

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,880
get these two stupid fish. I don't even like them that much. I mean, they're fine, whatever.

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,480
But I did. I did it. And then I was like, I was up, and I was like, well, I can't go

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,000
to sleep now. And you know, I've been meaning to terraform my island and turn my little corner

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,920
of Yakitori Island into a steam and steel steampunk nightmare, a mountain fortress.

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,920
So I just started doing that. I just started building up giant walls, like three level

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:12,160
high walls around my little peninsula. And you know, things will have to move to accommodate

50
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,720
it. But it's just sort of the initial, just sort of the initial planning stages of my

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,080
industrial hellscape. You know, things will, but you know, it takes a long. It's so fucking

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,040
hard to get like a clean edge.

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,760
I know, it's a true nightmare.

54
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,880
To even get like the edge that you want on like your river or your cliff is hard enough.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,160
But to like get the river edge and the cliff edge, like to match each other on like, and

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,280
then to smooth out the cliff on both sides, including one adjacent to a river, like is

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,720
so it's so it's awful. It's just terrible.

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Took it.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,880
Did not have a plan for that one.

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,480
So, you know, that took me another like five hours. And it's not, and it's all not even,

61
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,440
and it's only even in the planning stages. It's still very much a work in progress, but

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,880
well, if it was easy, if it was easy, then everyone would lose interest with this shit

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
game instantly.

64
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
It's so poorly optimized.

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
That's true.

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
But of course, feature not a buff.

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Punked.

68
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,880
But no one will ever lose interest in Animal Crossing, New Horizons, certainly not now

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,800
that I just like nobody ever stopped playing the previous seven million games in the Animal

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Crossing series.

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Correct.

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Correct.

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Well, they live on, well, they live on as confusing counter data that you might find

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
while browsing a wiki.

75
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
That's true.

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
That's true.

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,720
They live on, they live on as misinformation telling you about when Nook's cranny opens

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,080
in the morning or whatever.

79
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,520
Truly their legacy is eternal.

80
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Yes.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,160
Thank you. Thank you, Tetus. Appreciate the contribution. It was a peacock butterfly,

82
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
which apparently has been available for quite a while, but I only caught it this morning.

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Well, you know what?

84
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,720
Looking in my museum, my butterfly exhibit is looking tight as hell.

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Well, you know why?

86
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
It's going to be voluminous.

87
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,240
I have a guess why you might have just caught the peacock butterfly.

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Yeah.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,280
It only appears when you have black flowers, which I do here and there.

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Oh, fascinating.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,920
So if you maybe just newly acquired those, you might now start seeing those we didn't

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
before.

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,680
I mean, we probably started doing our flower breeding maybe like a week or two ago.

94
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Wait, wait, wait.

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
It's not just black.

96
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
It's like black or blue or purple, I think, so.

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Okay.

98
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Yeah.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,920
The point is you need some crossbreeds to get a bunch of different bug types, but in

100
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,760
particular, the peacocks are good.

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,920
They're one of the more valuable ones, and they're not even, and then once you have the

102
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,840
flowers you need, they're pretty common, too.

103
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
So they're big moneymakers.

104
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
So Ben, did you...

105
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
An animal crossing sucks.

106
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
No.

107
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Nintendo Switch sucks.

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
No.

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Nintendo sucks.

110
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
I haven't made a good scene.

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,040
Hey, you idiot, complaining just because we're talking about a video game you're not

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
interested in.

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,280
Why don't you get with it, Scrub?

114
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,920
I say, sewing, moments before I will be suffering through another hour's long monologue about

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,280
Final Fantasy VII and thereby reaping.

116
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Indeed.

117
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Yeah.

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,240
Truly, that is a bra moment to which I say...

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Bozinga.

120
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Thank you.

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Thank you, Ben.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
What were you asking?

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,040
Did you rise with the morning sun as I did, Ben, of course, and I believe I saw that

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
you did.

125
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,920
Invest all your bells and turnips this bright and shiny capitalist morning.

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
I'm close.

127
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I know I did.

128
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
I invested a fuck ton of bells.

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,560
I put 700K down for those turnips this morning.

130
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,640
All my savings, basically.

131
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
That's all your savings?

132
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Chewah.

133
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Yep, pretty much.

134
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Okay.

135
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,520
We're gonna have to collaborate to make sure we don't lose our investments.

136
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, of course.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,840
I had about three and a half million in the bank, which I technically owe most of it to

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,080
Tom Nook, but I don't gain anything by paying it back, so I'm just putting that off until

140
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
it's not a...

141
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,240
So you've achieved your final expansion or whatever?

142
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah.

143
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,640
Yeah, I've got the final expansion, but I haven't paid it off, but you don't get very

144
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,320
much for paying it off, so whatever.

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,120
I had to just wait till Bernie gets elected and he'll just absolve you of that.

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
No problem.

147
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
Tom Nook will be dragged into Central Park in shot.

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
He...

149
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Wait, wait, wait.

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Oh.

151
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
What was it?

152
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
You're dead.

153
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
You're 3 million in the bank.

154
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Oh, yeah.

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
I was gonna just invest all of it.

156
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,080
I was gonna invest all of it in turnips, but it actually got...

157
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:37,320
I had to buy so many turnips that I realized that that would have been eight or 10 full

158
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,760
inventory loads, like you had to fill my entire inventory with turnips and go back and forth

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,880
to an island, because we're gonna collaborate, you know, we've all got an old Discord server

160
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
where you compare turnip prices.

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Yes, we do.

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
The turnip?

163
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,480
And I realized, like, I'm gonna have to go back, I'm gonna make like 10 trips, I don't

164
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,520
want them, that's tedious, so it actually, it was out of sheer, like, this is boring

165
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,840
and it's tedious, I don't wanna buy any more turnips that I stopped.

166
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,440
Truly, you have hit the skill ceiling of Animal Crossing when you start to feel that way.

167
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,880
Skill ceiling is how many turnips can I fit in my inventory?

168
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,040
And deal with the horrible mon...

169
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,680
Not to mention, you can't even store them, you have to place them in the island and then

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
you have to walk around and pick them up.

171
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Just save you...

172
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm not willing to place them on the island because I share my island and people and I

173
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
won't look...

174
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Right, right.

175
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
No, I had to fill my house with them.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,640
I had to take up most of the furniture, which, to be fair, most of my rooms are pretty sparsely

177
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,400
furnished anyway, so it wasn't that big of a problem.

178
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,560
I picked up all my furniture.

179
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:41,800
Now my attic, my basement, and two of my side rooms are all entirely filled, like, wall-to-wall

180
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,480
with turnips, and there's a few more in my back room as well.

181
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,720
And that is 2 million bells worth of turnips.

182
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:58,840
That is 4,000 turnips, I think is the number, or no, 40,000, no, 20,000, it's 20,000 turnips.

183
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,280
Now Ben, you and I are in this together, both heavily investing, so we turn up trackers.

184
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,360
Our stonks must reign supreme, so we will all collab in our server, in our secret investor

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,600
club where we will obtain glory.

186
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,120
And you know, I think it was Steve was red-pilling me.

187
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
We're all going to be billionaires.

188
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Indeed, indeed.

189
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,840
Steve was red-pilling me, I believe, or maybe it was Ethan, I forget.

190
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,640
On the whole, there are online communities where people coordinate on stuff.

191
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
That's gay.

192
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,720
I don't want to do that.

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,040
It's too much work and too uncool, not interested.

194
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,720
If we have even like two or three people, our odds of turning the profit are, like, enormous.

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Yeah, no doubt.

196
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
It's like incredibly unlikely.

197
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,480
Cassey hooked me up.

198
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,720
Cassey had the big spike, 315 bells per turnip.

199
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,920
Ooh, the profits were out of this world, paid off my house experience immediately.

200
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,960
Seika messaged me this week to say that her price has spiked to, like, 400, but I didn't

201
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
have any bells.

202
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,280
I didn't have any bells at the time.

203
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,480
I did get a spike that big once in the past, but I didn't have as many bells to invest

204
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
at the time.

205
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,000
I think I only had, like, 200k invested or something.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,960
It was a huge win-fall at the time, but it's nothing compared to what I expect this week.

207
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,920
It was bringing me back to watching the stock market in Endless War, all those years ago,

208
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,440
the glory days, and sparring in the dojo, investing your slime and slime coin, watching

209
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
that market rise.

210
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,320
And one final question, Oben.

211
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,160
Is there actually, lol, he's dead, guys, epic.

212
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
Is there much to be gained with the amount of bells that one had, like, the millions

213
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
and millions?

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
What do you actually do with those?

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
That's been my only question.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,360
I mean, mainly, you would just buy, I mean, there are some furniture items that are, like,

217
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,640
obscenely expensive, like, in the hundreds of thousands of bells.

218
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:58,360
So, I mean, if I wanted, if I wanted, like, you know, like, 20 grandfather clocks or something,

219
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,560
then I might actually need, like, millions of bells to do that.

220
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Okay, okay, fair enough.

221
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Yeah.

222
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,520
So it's not, it's not like, it's, I mean, if you hit, like, 10 million bells, then you're

223
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,360
probably at the point where, like, there's not much that I can't do anymore.

224
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Right, right.

225
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
But I'm not quite there.

226
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,080
I was even thinking of, like, maybe, like, actually, this is one thing.

227
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Where everyone harassed Steve online, because Steve has more privilege than anyone else in

228
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,600
the world playing Animal Crossing, because Kazian for me, he has the recipe for Sakura

229
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
lanterns.

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,520
He's the only man I know.

231
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,040
And these are the most beautiful, like, pink, glowing, made with the Sakura petals from

232
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,440
Spring Lanterns.

233
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,640
And now I understand the cruel, cruel mistress that is the, what is it, the making shit system

234
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,920
in this game, the DIY recipe system.

235
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,840
And I want those Sakura lanterns, and even having infinite money, like, I don't even

236
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,200
know if anyone would want all that money.

237
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
You have to have something to trade them, I guess.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,880
I just barely missed my chance to learn from one of Ethan's villagers a recipe for a golden

239
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,160
candelabra, which I'm a little disappointed by, but, you know, I came home and my best

240
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,920
friend, Carlos, who I now have a poster hanging of in my main foyer, because he's my bro, he's

241
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
the coolest guy.

242
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,040
I assume he has a poster of you, too, I would hope.

243
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
I should...

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,320
Oh, oh no.

245
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Maybe you can give him one?

246
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
What does this mean?

247
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,280
I mean, yeah, obviously he does.

248
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Yeah, of course.

249
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Okay, good.

250
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,520
Well, I mean, but he wears the jacket that I gave him, like, half the time.

251
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
That goes a long way.

252
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
And, you know, he looks really great.

253
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,240
Like, his girth is, like, stuffed into it in a very flattering way.

254
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,800
Fantastic.

255
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,160
But he gave me a recipe for, like, an iron, like, doorcrest, which is like a shield.

256
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,560
It's like black iron with, like, a shield with lions, and it looks so fucking sick.

257
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,080
It's way better than any golden candelabra.

258
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Sick.

259
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,720
So, yeah, I only got...

260
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,320
The only, like, Sakura recipe I got was, like, the Sakura Pondstone, which is, like, dumb.

261
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
It sucks.

262
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,920
I think I have one of those.

263
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
It's okay.

264
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Yeah, I didn't...

265
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I didn't...

266
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,320
You know, I caught Sakura pedals.

267
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,400
Like, I didn't, like, I was no slouch about catching them.

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,600
I don't know why I didn't get more recipes, because, like, there were some that looked

269
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,480
really nice, like the Sakura lanterns and the Sakura bag was pretty good.

270
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,560
But, like, I don't know, I guess I missed my chance until next March or whatever.

271
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,120
Until the cruel question looms its head, now that I'm bored, is it finally time to start

272
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
time traveling?

273
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Oh, that's what I'm thinking.

274
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,880
Right now, I'm able to hold off the demons.

275
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,640
My switch owner said his condition for us playing on his island was, you can do whatever

276
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,920
you want, but no time traveling.

277
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,040
But perhaps a Judas, a Brutus, backstabbing.

278
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,840
It's for fake gamers, he said.

279
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,760
And we signed the pact in blood that we wouldn't be fake gamers.

280
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,680
Well, understandable, understandable.

281
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,760
The quest continues onward for Animal Crossing Dominance and Supremacy.

282
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
We should've played the jingle.

283
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Okay, whatever.

284
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,440
Bum, bub, bub, Ben St. Animal Crossing Hour.

285
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,960
Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.

286
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,520
And I have a lot of, and I have a lot of black roses and a lot of purple ones too.

287
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,440
And I gave Kazi some black and pink ones, because she wanted them, and it was cool.

288
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,840
And that's the story.

289
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
Ah, fascinating as always.

290
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,920
Eleazar, put in timestamp this moment in the description.

291
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,240
Podcast starts here.

292
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,400
No.

293
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Lord of Ghost, Lord of Ghost chapter seven is out.

294
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,640
Act two is finished.

295
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,240
Oh, I read it and I loved it.

296
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,240
I have not read Act seven yet.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,680
Acts, you mean chapter seven, but yes.

298
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay, yes, sure.

299
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
It's, it's, it's, it's really cool.

300
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,240
Don't say Act seven.

301
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,120
I have bad connotations with Act seven.

302
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,120
Wait, Act seven is actually okay.

303
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,600
That's the one page flash, right?

304
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,880
Act six is the bad one.

305
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,000
Uh, yes.

306
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,640
Okay, all right.

307
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,160
No mind.

308
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,160
Would be fine if Act six didn't exist.

309
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,480
Right, right.

310
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,080
You are right.

311
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,560
It's always been my opinion.

312
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,160
Okay.

313
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,320
Read Lord of Ghosts, everybody.

314
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
It is great and I did love it.

315
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,320
And the events that transpire, I will not spoil, but who, baby, it's great.

316
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I really like it.

317
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,880
Yeah, it's, it's, it was a start of the little like, I wonder if I could make it

318
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,360
like a real comic sort of thing.

319
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,360
And it's, it's pretty, it's pretty close to something that's like, yeah, you

320
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,560
know, like actually good people saying, oh my God, I didn't realize you had any

321
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,400
talents at all.

322
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,880
Lol.

323
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,200
Lol, haha, dude, I say that all the time.

324
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,680
Um, I'm tempted to, I'm tempted to ignore you guys for a while and go read it

325
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,480
right now on, on the podcast, haha, but not tell you that I'm doing that or

326
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
anything.

327
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,760
Well, that would be so crazy if you did that, but it's not that long.

328
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,080
So it wouldn't be that big of a deal.

329
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeah.

330
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,040
Well, I will, I will say that for now, for the next three or so months, it's

331
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,400
going on hiatus for a very specific, important reason that I am going to apply

332
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:23,680
for the Tezuka Award contest thing, manga contest show in Japan.

333
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,040
I will submit a manga and I have to make that in three months, which is why I

334
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,080
can't really work on Lord of Ghosts because the maximum page, I'm already

335
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,480
way over that with Lord of Ghosts.

336
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,200
It's like almost a hundred pages now.

337
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,160
I see, I see.

338
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,640
How, so to tell me about the specifics, I'm very curious about this and how, how

339
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,480
you plan to go about it, just technically speaking.

340
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,200
Right.

341
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,680
So the Tezuka thing, it's the 100th anniversary of the thing.

342
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,960
If you, it's the thing, it's, and they're opening it up to Spanish speaking, English

343
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,280
speaking, I think Chinese and Korean speaking countries for the first time.

344
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,720
So it's always been a Japanese manga contest.

345
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,920
Aitra Oda submitted famously.

346
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,080
And you got second place, second place, baby.

347
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah, I have no, I have no like delusions of grandeur that I'm ever going to get

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,840
anywhere close because it's like, there's so many people who could enter and

349
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
there's so much talent out there.

350
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,240
But I think it would not be, it would be pretty cringe if I didn't try just

351
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,920
because of that.

352
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,640
So I'm going to, I'm going to take an idea.

353
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,160
I've come up with a little, little plot and I'm going to make a 30 page manga.

354
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,160
It has to read right to left, but they will translate it for you before it

355
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,240
gets sent to the Japanese where they will judge it.

356
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't expect, I, the way I'm expecting it to happen, there's no like

357
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,800
information, but like the judges include Akira Toriyama and Aitra Oda and some

358
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,960
other people that I can't remember the names of.

359
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,800
So like if it gets to them and my comic appears in front of them, that would be

360
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,120
incredible, but I feel like there's, there's only five of them.

361
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,360
Let me just get the link to the thing.

362
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,600
Sure, sure.

363
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I assume they probably won't like read every single one.

364
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,440
There's probably got to be some filter before it gets to those guys.

365
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,680
There's got to be a filter.

366
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
So here it is.

367
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:28,160
So the people is Aitra Oda, Kazue Kato, Kohei Hirokoishi.

368
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,880
I can't see his names, but they're notable people, obviously.

369
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,600
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,640
Looks like the creators of Bokunohiro, Slam Dunk.

371
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,640
I don't know.

372
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,040
Is that fucking sorted on?

373
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,600
I don't know what that is.

374
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,720
One piece, Dragon Ball and Blue Exorcist, Kazue Kato.

375
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Oh my God.

376
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,960
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,160
I've just arrived at a twist in a certain webcomic that I am not currently

378
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,080
reading while you discuss something that I haven't been paying attention to.

379
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,440
Does it have anything to do with a problematic creature?

380
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,120
Yes.

381
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
OK, all right, all right.

382
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
Probably.

383
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,920
You could probably say that about a lot of things, though.

384
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,760
Well, I think there'd be a more obvious yes.

385
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,960
If it's OK, maybe I'm wrong.

386
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,520
OK, anyway, I think.

387
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
Oh, no, I see what she's mean.

388
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,800
I see what she's mean.

389
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,640
OK, no, that wasn't even the one I was talking about.

390
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Oh, fuck.

391
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,360
All right, Jesus, fucking Christ.

392
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
Oh my God, I just want to say, since you're OK, I won't I won't spoil it.

393
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,960
But like the way that you do the very end of that chapter, you build it up

394
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,880
and you just you just give that little joke at the end.

395
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,120
Perfect.

396
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
Mwah, the best.

397
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,240
You don't end on a big, gay, total thing.

398
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,360
It's the I love it.

399
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,200
I just love the way that was done.

400
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,400
That's why you're going to win the Tezuka Award.

401
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,280
I believe in you.

402
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,320
The whole thing is a big, gay, total thing.

403
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,440
Yeah, you're right.

404
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
You're right.

405
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
Well, yeah, they got the.

406
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,680
Japanese people, I hope that it would get to them,

407
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,040
but I'm pretty sure there's going to be like thousands of other people

408
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,600
vetting, like choosing the wheat from the chaff.

409
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,200
Got to be, got to be.

410
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,480
Hopefully, these guys will probably see the finalists get me far.

411
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,640
I don't I don't I don't want to try and be like, oh, I have to be Japanese

412
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,760
and exactly like everyone else if I want to win.

413
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,960
Right, you just got to be cool.

414
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,160
Yeah, that's what that's what I'm sure that's true.

415
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,720
Thinking back to his style and how he's always been like very different.

416
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
You know, it's it's funny.

417
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,040
There's definitely like a generic anime look like the A1 pictures look

418
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,840
that we're all familiar with.

419
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,880
And of these, like the blue exorcist one is I think that's Kazue Kato or whatever.

420
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,640
I think that's who that is.

421
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Like that one is a little bit close to it.

422
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,200
I mean, Slam Dunk a little bit, but Slam Dunk's always had like very kind of

423
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,320
realistic and I don't know, cool masculine art and maybe Deku a little bit.

424
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,360
But even like, like all the others have very distinct styles.

425
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,600
And like, sure, Dragon Ball has gone on to like influence a ton,

426
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,720
but it has a very different style for a lot of these birds studio.

427
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,680
Bird Studio, I mean, I was I looked at the picture of Goku expecting to see

428
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,920
Toriyama. If you scroll down a little bit,

429
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,600
you'll see a picture of the six judges and their names are Kira Toriyama.

430
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,960
Oh, cool, cool.

431
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,000
It's got to be like, but I'm saying, I don't see a Kira Toriyama.

432
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,120
It says, I scroll down and his name is there.

433
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,480
Oh, in comments from the judges or something.

434
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,800
Yeah. Oh, in the article, I see. Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Oh, yeah. Well, in any case, yes, as long as it's good,

436
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,960
I mean, I can't speak to the rest of these guys necessarily,

437
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,920
but I am sure that Oda is at least open minded to appreciate all different

438
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,200
types of styles and they probably all are.

439
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
These guys are comic artists, right? They know what's up.

440
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
They've been around the block a few times.

441
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
So very, very exciting.

442
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,720
Yeah. So I just want to read Slam Dunk.

443
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,920
Slam Dunk looks so cool.

444
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,800
I love the art from Slam Dunk.

445
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,920
But yeah, I'm going to be doing that for the next three months.

446
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:01,640
I it's going to probably be very like a lot of ghosts is built off

447
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,600
of ratty fuckers cop killers.

448
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,640
You know, it has that law already going into it.

449
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,080
This is going to be a completely unique story that has to be built

450
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,520
from the ground up with characters and stuff.

451
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
So I'm hoping I can do that.

452
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,360
You've done it before with a canon story once or twice.

453
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
Yeah, you know, I look at it.

454
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,960
I could just submit that really.

455
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,280
Just submit that I'm really excited to see what you produce.

456
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,480
Do you know the like the hard deadline for like when you need to have it done

457
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,760
to turn in or whatever first of September?

458
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,000
OK, OK, shit, dog.

459
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,280
That's really exciting and I can't wait to see what you produce.

460
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,960
I mean, I'm tempted to say, maybe I should join.

461
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,240
I should submit something too.

462
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,520
But like do it. I don't know.

463
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,680
I mean, maybe if I think of something that I want to do with that, I would.

464
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,760
But if I don't, then I won't.

465
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,320
And then that's what I have to say about that.

466
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
Fair enough. Fair enough.

467
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,120
So, so, Ben, you've you've read the chapter now.

468
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,160
What do you think of the Lord of Ghost chapter seven?

469
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,360
What do I think of the Lord of Ghost chapter seven?

470
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,200
I think that it's the final nail in the coffin.

471
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,520
I think that it's like a personal attack or something.

472
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,720
Christ, I hate it.

473
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,360
I hate that fucking much.

474
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,280
I will end you.

475
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,360
I think I don't know.

476
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,640
I think it's based, but not very breadpilled.

477
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
And that's what I have to say about that.

478
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,760
There's two criteria you've got to meet.

479
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,040
And if you meet one and not the other, dead, dead.

480
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,280
Wait, I'm just clicking through the end of the end part now.

481
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,320
Lo Dan.

482
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,360
He read it fast.

483
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,840
He's just looking at the pretty pictures.

484
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
He doesn't know the lore.

485
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,280
He doesn't know the the pathos, the ups and downs, this fucking guy.

486
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
I chose the name.

487
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,840
Oh, yeah, let's just wait for Ben to finish rereading the chapter.

488
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,200
That sounds like they're discussing the name.

489
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,760
And I've got to see, OK, what else do they say about the name?

490
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,280
After I got to that part, I kind of skipped ahead.

491
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,000
OK, OK, what's the short way to say the name of the the town?

492
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,800
New, New, Biggin by the sea, aka Neo York, right?

493
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,360
Yeah, I mean, I can't think how to.

494
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,800
New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New, New.

495
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,560
By the sea, aka Neo York, it'll be butsakini.

496
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,240
Butsakini.

497
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,320
It's like Osaka, but different, but London, butsakini will sick.

498
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,200
There it is.

499
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,560
We'll put that in the show notes so everybody could see that.

500
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,520
Well, this is fucking based.

501
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,360
It continues.

502
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,000
It continues to be my favorite content on the Internet.

503
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,320
Hell, yeah, I can't think of anything better right now.

504
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,760
Oh, perhaps with one small check, though, it is a different sort of thing.

505
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
And it is. All right.

506
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,680
We guys, we got to address the big thing, the big elf in the room that we've been

507
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,960
beating our ourselves around.

508
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,120
Of course, the big beating our me too, got to stop, got to stop ignoring it.

509
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:28,080
We have to talk about the new Plinkett video that came out about Star Trek Picard and how it was based.

510
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040
All right, here's my hot take.

511
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,600
I felt like this was a kind of a bad Plinkett review in so far as it doesn't contain

512
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,520
all the necessary context in order for you to really understand what's happening.

513
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,360
And I didn't really feel like I understood what the reason for it existing is, because it feels like

514
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,000
it's just sort of saying a little bit extra on top of those reviews that they did of the show.

515
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,720
I understood the context, but it's because I've been watching the reviews.

516
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,320
So I basically had all this information already.

517
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,120
Yeah, I watched the reviews as well, but like I won't go back to watch this Plinkett review

518
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,640
because I need to watch the reviews as well in order to really get it.

519
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Like it doesn't stand as well on its own.

520
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,080
That's that's my point, you know, I mean, I've been following this with great interest.

521
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,160
And I've rewatched those the reviews on Plinkett like many times, because I mean, I am a huge

522
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:31,960
I got into Star Trek due to Red Letter Media's Plinkett reviews of the like the old movies,

523
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,520
like the next generation movies and stuff.

524
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
And I love those.

525
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,920
And they're basically a very similar style of content to what this is.

526
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,040
So like to me, it was kind of like a return to the classic old Plinkett from way back.

527
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,640
And, you know, maybe it's true that they like those ones do a better job of explaining the context.

528
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,440
But those weren't built on the back of like existing reviews that had already been done.

529
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,160
So perhaps it's slightly different context or whatever.

530
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,040
I also just happenstance.

531
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,880
Like I've been rewatching, re listening to all of the Plinkett reviews.

532
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,000
Star Wars Awakens, the original Phantom Menace and all that.

533
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,520
And I've noticed that there are a few that I like to rewatch.

534
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,120
And there are a few that I just they don't stand up like the Titanic one.

535
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,400
You know, it's OK, Indiana Jones.

536
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,520
That's all right.

537
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,720
The Ghostbusters one is really good.

538
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,520
That one feels like a full like it feels like it's not just here's some bad

539
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,880
media and here's me talking about why it sucks.

540
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,440
It's like a bigger thing than that, because there's a lot of stuff

541
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,760
around the Ghostbusters movie to talk about, right, right.

542
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,560
And, you know, the original the original Plinkett reviews were about

543
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,440
the prequel trilogy of Star Wars and how people don't realize that it sucks so much.

544
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,240
And he's trying to explain to everyone that George Lucas is a hack fraud.

545
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,040
And he's right.

546
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,320
There's much more to those.

547
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah, like it's not just bad movies.

548
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,440
It's like George Lucas was never that good, actually.

549
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Empire was the one he had the least to do with creatively and all that sort of stuff.

550
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
Star Wars Awakens review is about the fact that Disney is a terrible company

551
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,920
and is going to ruin our lives forever, not just the Force Awakens review.

552
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,640
So like things like Baby's Day Out, the Titanic.

553
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,960
Don't hold up this Picard one.

554
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,160
I feel falls into that.

555
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,400
I'm probably not going to rewatch it that much.

556
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,640
So it's still fine, but like some of the jokes also were a bit.

557
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,120
I don't know, forced.

558
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,360
He made a poop joke once.

559
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,040
Oh, but that's classic.

560
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,760
It's classic.

561
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,040
But I feel like there wasn't enough of it to be.

562
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,480
If you know what I mean, like you just threw it in there because

563
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,440
Oh, Plinkett's supposed to say, oh, shit, joke.

564
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Let's put this one.

565
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,440
Definitely, I mean, it definitely was a little more bare bones in like the

566
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,960
I would say like the Plinkett lore and the comedy.

567
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,040
It was more of a straightforward discussion of the series.

568
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,000
And then there was like some funny bits like the what was that intergalactic treaty

569
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,600
intergalactic and it's really funny.

570
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,640
I'm watching Star Trek Voyager right now.

571
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,040
It is a huge.

572
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,200
OK, I don't know the full Star Trek lore post Voyager,

573
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,760
but like this this show takes place probably a few decades after Voyager ends or whatever.

574
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,200
And but the idea of a transgalactic treaty, as mentioned in that, I mean,

575
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,680
since I'm currently experiencing Voyager for the first time, the entire conceit

576
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,520
of Voyager is that they are so far away and the galaxies divided into quadrants

577
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,640
in Star Trek for I don't know how that works, but that's how it is.

578
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,080
And they're in the Delta Quadrant and they're trying to get back to the Alpha

579
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,360
Quadrant, where like all of Star Trek took place.

580
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,960
And they are 70,000 light years away.

581
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,520
And there are various types of they call it trans warp, like like faster

582
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,480
than the hard limits beyond the faster and the speed of light that warp travel

583
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,760
gives them that would make journeys like that potentially possible.

584
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,480
But like the idea of a transgalactic treaty that there can be no like

585
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,200
synthetic life is it's just one of those things that any Star Trek person would

586
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,840
immediately be like, you're telling me that the like the Romulans and the

587
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,040
Klingons and the human, the entire Federation and the fucking Vorta and the

588
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,400
fucking Founders in the fucking Delta, that's the Gamma Quadrant of the fucking

589
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,000
Dominion, they all agreed to not make sense.

590
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,800
Very silly, very silly idea.

591
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,560
It's it's it's a it's a game of thrones.

592
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,720
It takes two minutes to sail all the way to the fucking.

593
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,160
Yes, it's very much like that.

594
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,840
Like they don't understand the scale.

595
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
I mean, I'm not a Star Trek person, so I don't know any of that.

596
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,440
And I don't feel like Plinkett made it like abundantly clear how ridiculous that was.

597
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,040
I don't blame you or anybody else who feels that this video was a little bit

598
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,120
like lacking in the punch or more of the Plinkett stuff they would love.

599
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
But for me, it's because these guys become a deep or Star Trek guy.

600
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,640
Sure, sure, that's fine.

601
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,320
But it's just that I brought the context with me because I know all these

602
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,960
characters and I've explored it over the last like the last like five years have

603
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,560
been me getting ready for this video.

604
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,000
So like I have been fully prepared watching like all these shows during that time.

605
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,040
And it was just in time to consume this.

606
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,640
So I recognize I'm in a slightly different position from from people who who have not.

607
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,320
But for me, it was a big coom after after a long time.

608
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,440
But, you know, there's another personal element that I appreciated.

609
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,080
It was that this video was made in a very fast period of time.

610
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,960
It is like a real Plinkett video.

611
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,640
You know, maybe it's not one of the best like wouldn't be rated by critics

612
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,920
throughout history is like the best.

613
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,240
OK, understandable.

614
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,760
But they made a real Plinkett video after finishing Picard

615
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,640
like a month or two ago and they got it together.

616
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,320
I thought it was pretty great in a lot of ways, really impressed.

617
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,360
And I just find that inspiring as a guy who struggles to get content out.

618
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,240
It made me feel like, you know what, Nate, maybe you don't really need to like overthink.

619
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,040
And of course, the video instantly gets a million views.

620
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
And it's it is like the best.

621
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,880
Even if you love the reviews of Picard, which I do, I absolutely love them.

622
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,400
And I've watched them many times.

623
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,880
This video is the best condensation of the arguments, basically.

624
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,640
And, you know, it's got extra style and pizzazz.

625
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,720
And I love the little gimmicks that they put in there.

626
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,560
I take a lot of inspiration from that personally.

627
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,000
So I will continue to suck Red Letter Media's Dick.

628
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,960
This hit really well for me personally.

629
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,000
But I get if you were to rank in some cosmic order, what are the best Plinkett reviews?

630
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,240
This probably would not be the top based on like everybody's experience of it.

631
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,640
But for me, it just hit the right spot.

632
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,080
And I really got a lot of good feels out of it.

633
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,680
You know, no.

634
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Delicious Keto ice cream.

635
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,600
Can't get enough of that wonderful stuff, baby.

636
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,800
But wondering, Nate, about like your

637
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,200
your workflow, like, how's how's how's that working out for you?

638
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,760
How are you dealing with making stuff at the moment?

639
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,880
Well, I mean, since deciding to shift the way that I'm releasing content,

640
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,880
I have I know I've talked about it here and there, but just in summary,

641
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,400
I've I basically fully committed to a process

642
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,280
where both I have multiple videos in the works.

643
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,680
I have like two at least two scripts basically being worked on at any one time

644
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,640
with my editor, no need for like just doing the edits on

645
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,080
like the visual edits after I've done like the the writing and the mixing and all that stuff.

646
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,840
I sent off to him.

647
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,320
He's working on that while I'm working on a separate one.

648
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,640
And that's like a separate script that's been

649
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,640
whatever, prepared like I'm editing that with all my little autistic touches and whatnot.

650
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,000
And basically, I think that right now I'm setting myself up for

651
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,000
a much improved rate of output with higher quality videos.

652
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,560
And I am pretty close to having stuff ready to release with this like updated workflow.

653
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,760
So basically, I know it doesn't look like it right now.

654
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,560
There's been no results of this change yet.

655
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm very keenly aware of that.

656
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,200
But I think that in the next like two to three months,

657
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,640
people will see a change in the output specifically with the way I'm doing things.

658
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,760
And I think a lot of people are going to be like, oh, shit,

659
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,480
this is like this is like classic Nate stuff and we're getting it like faster than ever.

660
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,000
We no longer need to wait like six months between videos.

661
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,560
Now I'm getting one like every month or whatever, or maybe even sooner.

662
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,920
So, you know, again, like I don't want to do that thing where I'm just talking up about,

663
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,080
oh, it's going to be so great soon, guys, just wait and see.

664
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,240
It's but I do have a lot of confidence that with the changes I've made

665
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
and having having another edit I'm working with.

666
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
And if I could get like even another editor

667
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,720
who I would also happily pay and work with and stuff,

668
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,480
then I would probably have three projects be working on at once.

669
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,520
And ultimately, I would love to get to that position as well.

670
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,160
Just have more people to work with.

671
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,520
But but for now, I'm pretty damn confident that

672
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,960
at least my patrons will be will be happy boys pretty soon with my output.

673
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,160
And really, the patrons are all that matter.

674
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,600
Yeah, there you go. That's that's my thoughts on that.

675
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,960
OK, you know, speaking of content,

676
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
you know, man, OK, so this is weird.

677
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,800
I was going to bring this up, but now I have a final twist to put on it.

678
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,160
I was I tweeted angrily the other day

679
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,840
about how no new episodes of Mon Ben have gotten translated recently.

680
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,720
Orisao and now Kinoman Ben, which I've talked about before.

681
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,000
I probably do I need to explain what that is again?

682
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
Just would you quickly?

683
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,840
Briefly, this guy, Orisao Nauke, is a mangaka

684
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,680
who has done a bunch of pretty famous manga.

685
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,760
He did 20th Century Boys and yeah, there's a couple.

686
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,320
He did Pluto that they talked about in the show,

687
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,520
but I don't think that one was is like as well known.

688
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,320
Yeah, it's it's not.

689
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,160
There's a there's a couple others.

690
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,480
I mean, he's done a lot for getting them.

691
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,520
But you know, Pluto, I read that one.

692
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,160
It's pretty good. Which one? Huh. It's about it's called Pluto.

693
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,320
It's about robots. I like that one. OK.

694
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,240
20th Century is my favorite by him.

695
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,840
And it's like there's like four seasons of the show.

696
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,120
And in every episode, he places cameras in the like work

697
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,240
station or the workplace of other mangaka films them for a week.

698
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,160
And then most of the show is like there's a there's like a narrator

699
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,200
who sort of narrates like what you're seeing, like they'll talk about

700
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,800
like the kind of pen they're using or like what goes on, what's going on.

701
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,960
They'll sort of get this narrator will like give context to the footage

702
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,520
and also give like commentary on the conversation that they have.

703
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,480
And they basically Urasawa Naoki and whichever one he's got this week,

704
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,640
they'll like sit down and sort of like have a conversation where they watch

705
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,200
the footage and like sort of talk about like, oh, you do this.

706
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,040
Oh, you do that. Like, oh, I noticed this about like, oh, that's like,

707
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,160
well, don't don't you think don't you think artists are kind of like this?

708
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,600
Like, yeah, yeah, the thing about art is that it's all about fetishism.

709
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,600
Every time I draw the male clavicle, you know, like that's the secret fetishism

710
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,080
coming out. Yes, art truly is the most the most honorable of professions.

711
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
Indeed.

712
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,720
Anyway, there's like there's like 16 episodes, right?

713
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,320
It's four seasons and each season is like four episodes.

714
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
And I think there's a pilot.

715
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,200
So there's 17 episodes.

716
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,280
But we were missing one, two, three, four, five.

717
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,680
There's like six, six episodes that I never found.

718
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,440
And they're they're not in order.

719
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,960
It's not like the last six.

720
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,280
It's like one from season two, two from season three, three from season four.

721
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,120
I can't find them anywhere.

722
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,000
There is this one guy who's uploaded the ones that exist on this daily motion

723
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,480
channel called Habanero S. And that's where I found all of them.

724
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,120
And actually, since making that tweet, I found one more.

725
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,080
I think it is season two, episode four.

726
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,360
It's one that I had not seen before.

727
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,080
So I did find a new one, but it was uploaded on another daily

728
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,040
motion channel that is named Naoki Urasawa.

729
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,000
So it might even be the guy himself uploaded this one as like a sample or something.

730
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,160
OK, so I found that other one, right?

731
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,600
But there's still five episodes that I've never seen, don't seem to exist

732
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,920
anywhere on the Internet.

733
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,320
And I'm like, God, somebody fucking dropped the ball or or there was or

734
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,480
maybe there was a copyright issue or something.

735
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,240
And but just now, as I was thinking about this, I see this tweet from

736
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,640
Echophoria, who replies to the tweet saying, I know, right?

737
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,920
The last I heard the guy doing the translator was undergoing chemo.

738
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,080
I'm afraid to say it, but he might have died.

739
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,720
Jesus Christ.

740
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,840
So that's wild.

741
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,320
I wonder I don't know how that's that's such a specific fact to know.

742
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,200
I wonder how they know that.

743
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,960
But or where they heard that from.

744
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,520
Yeah, I don't know.

745
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,240
I don't know. Maybe it's not true.

746
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,920
But in terms of how it affects me personally, it sort of doesn't matter

747
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,400
if it's true or not.

748
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,240
It seems at this point that unless somebody else steps up and does something,

749
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,480
I might never get to watch the rest of Mon Ben.

750
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,840
They have some time in time.

751
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
Someone someone will take.

752
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
I hope so.

753
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,680
Hopefully I fucking hope so.

754
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,360
They have, man, they probably they probably already translated the one

755
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,680
with the most famous people like they did.

756
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,440
Um, yeah, they did the Junji, the Junji Ito one got translated like last year.

757
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,640
And there's another one with, um, fuck, I've always forget his name,

758
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,840
but the guy who did Poon Poon.

759
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,080
Yeah, yeah, I forget his name, too.

760
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,840
They did one with the guy who did Poon Poon, Inio?

761
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,800
Inio? God, I don't know.

762
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,240
I don't remember at all.

763
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,400
And and the guy who did, I think they did one with the guy

764
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,080
who did I am a hero, the zombie one.

765
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,840
Yeah, yeah.

766
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,720
OK, I know that one.

767
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,360
And there's a couple others that I had never heard of anywhere else before,

768
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,440
but maybe they're more popular in Japan.

769
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,240
It's such a good show.

770
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,440
It's so interesting.

771
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,960
My favorite one is the guy who draws like another one I'd never heard of,

772
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,000
but he does like very like he's like totally into like just action shown and stuff.

773
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,520
Like that's all he does.

774
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,000
And he's like an older guy, but his work, like.

775
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,680
There is like this this woman,

776
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,480
the one like the first episode that's other than the pilot is about this woman.

777
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,760
And she is like incredibly prolific.

778
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,840
She pumps out like a new like 30 page chapter like every week.

779
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,520
Sometimes she does it on like multiple stories, running concurrently.

780
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,280
And she's got like a huge team.

781
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,440
She's got like eight assistants.

782
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,400
They all work in this little office and they're all like

783
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,160
they're all like running around with like folders and like like like pens and pencils

784
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,400
and like just doing little like jobs and stuff.

785
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,760
And it's kind of it's it's it's pretty assembly line.

786
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,320
And that but that's cool.

787
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,880
But then there's this other guy, this the shonen guy, his workspace.

788
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,600
He just it's just him and three assistants just sitting at a table

789
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,880
and they play like heavy metal music all the whole time.

790
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,360
And like the rule is like no silence.

791
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,520
Like we've got it like we're like the atmosphere has got to be like upbeat.

792
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,680
We got to be like cracking jokes the whole time.

793
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,840
Just like having a good fucking time while we do this.

794
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,120
And they're just like passing pages around.

795
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,600
And like that's he's my he's my favorite.

796
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,480
He's my favorite dude.

797
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,400
That's cool.

798
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,480
What a great fucking program.

799
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,720
And what a shame if I don't get to see the other five episodes.

800
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,000
That is a fascinating idea.

801
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,680
Yeah, I should watch the show.

802
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,080
I'm just remembering that when Munchie came to London as depicted

803
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,120
in Lord of Ghost Comic, but also in real life.

804
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,360
Spoilers, dude. Spoilers, spoilers.

805
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,520
Spoilers, dude.

806
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,440
When when Munchie came to London, we went to I think it was the British Museum.

807
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,400
Something there was a a manga exhibit

808
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,160
and you go in and there's a bunch of like original pages.

809
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,160
Like we we saw the the page in one piece

810
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,320
where Luffy remembers that he has friends after the the Marion Ford War and all that.

811
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,120
Ah, yes, like that actual page.

812
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,520
I could see how he shaded in the the hair.

813
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,560
I was like, whoa, it's right.

814
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,520
It's just right there. Hell yeah.

815
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,840
Um, lots of cool stuff.

816
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,200
And then also on a TV was Man Ben and it was subtitled.

817
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,560
And I'm like, wait, is there an official subtitled version of this?

818
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,120
It was just on a it was just on a loop on it on a on a on a on a TV

819
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,680
and a little thing next to it saying Man Ben is a show where it goes around to

820
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,680
manga authors. I was like, oh, I know that from Ben St.

821
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Huh. That's you know, I also got the impression that there was an official

822
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,240
subbed version because I saw like the one on the channel called Urasaki

823
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,800
Naoki. I might have say the name wrong.

824
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Naoki, that's right.

825
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:49,480
Yeah, Naoki, the one on his channel, it's subbed in the exact same way as the

826
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,640
I want to know where this Echoforia person gets their information

827
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,280
because my, yeah, my impression that these were official subs

828
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,680
that had just not been released due to some kind of copyright issue

829
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,480
because there is a website, Naoki.

830
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,400
There, there is a Naoki Urasawa dot com, which you would think is his official

831
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,320
site, but it's not. It says, I'm not Naoki Urasawa.

832
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,160
I'm just a supporter of his work.

833
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,440
On this site, you'll find English subtitled versions of Urasawa, Naoki,

834
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,040
Noman, Ben, the interview series created by himself, blah, blah, blah, blah.

835
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,080
I didn't actually read this, but I should probably.

836
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,960
OK, OK, so he and he has a bunch of episodes posted, but then he updates

837
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,240
on January of last year.

838
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,840
He says NHK flagged his videos for copyright and his YouTube account

839
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:48,160
got taken down, which I did see and then, but like the videos are still

840
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,040
listed on the web.

841
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,080
There are some of the videos are still listed, but they don't seem to be listed

842
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,360
on YouTube. And when you click them, they don't see not available.

843
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,200
They say publishing in progress, which I've never seen before.

844
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,440
That is strange.

845
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,880
And other ones of them say video on available as though it's a YouTube thing.

846
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,400
That publishing a process might be that thing where with YouTube, if you set it

847
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,080
to automatically be public, but like it goes through a process of first

848
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
it uploads and then it processes.

849
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,920
So maybe the video is technically available publicly, but it maybe it's

850
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,440
stuck in that limbo due to copyright.

851
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,800
You'd think it would just finish processing and then say blocked on

852
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,920
copyright grounds or whatever.

853
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,320
I mean, the fact that I have never seen this message on any YouTube video

854
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,400
makes me think that it's not that.

855
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,360
Yeah, you might be right.

856
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,640
But I don't know what it is.

857
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,840
Anyway, anyway, the point is that my impression was that these were

858
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,680
officially subtitled episodes that were just being distributed, you know,

859
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,480
underground and that had been like claimed by the copyright holder.

860
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,520
You should ask that.

861
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,280
But maybe if I went information, but maybe if I went and I watched the end of

862
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,480
like, if I actually looked at the subtitles, you know how the subbers will

863
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
like include their like subber credits?

864
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
Yeah, yeah, right.

865
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,480
I could probably find out if I just watched and paid attention.

866
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,160
That's a good idea.

867
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,960
That's a good idea.

868
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,080
Yeah.

869
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,760
And then maybe I could go look them up and find their blog where they say,

870
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,720
hey, guys, I'm undergoing chemo and I might die.

871
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,480
And then the blog goes silent.

872
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,520
I go, oh, that would be.

873
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,680
Interesting information.

874
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,040
Yeah, that'd be.

875
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,320
Yeah, totally.

876
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,040
Oh, no, please.

877
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,240
All right, well, that's that's all well and good.

878
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,680
Let's see what happened with that.

879
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,120
But seriously, we're glad to that guy.

880
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,160
Maybe there's he could probably just hook you up.

881
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,840
Is is my maybe if he has information,

882
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,680
unless he's just talking Abel Salute out of his ass, doesn't know where he's

883
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,480
getting all I was just asking, like, where did you get this information?

884
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,720
Gonna need a link, bro.

885
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,520
Gonna need a source fam.

886
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck you.

887
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,920
Yeah, fuck you.

888
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,240
Indeed.

889
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,840
Oof, hmm.

890
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,520
Well, should we talk about Digi?

891
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,360
That's, you know, that's the thing.

892
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,600
I mean, I was asking about she's a woman now.

893
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,640
Well, there's not much to say.

894
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,200
There's definitely not that much to say.

895
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,640
You would think there'd be more to say.

896
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,160
But I mean, yeah, I can acknowledge it.

897
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,640
I mean, OK, I guess I will say that.

898
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,760
I thought it was a joke.

899
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
Digi also seems that she phrases a joke.

900
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,000
No doubt at first.

901
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,920
She needed to clarify that no, actually, I know it sounded like a joke

902
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,680
when I said it the first time, but no, this is serious.

903
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,880
And I asked her in the discord, I said, hey, is this real?

904
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,560
Or is this like a ruse?

905
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,280
And she said, no, this is real.

906
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,360
And I said, all right, well, I will match your level of dedicate.

907
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,080
I will take it as seriously as you do.

908
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,440
So if you're serious about it, then OK, fair enough.

909
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,320
And that seems to be the case.

910
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,080
And she thought I was saying like she said like, oh, you know,

911
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,440
I will say funny, funny, funny.

912
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:07,240
This is before that she made the posts about it,

913
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,840
being a girl or whatever.

914
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,440
I had post, wait, no, I can't say it.

915
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,840
It's a spoiler.

916
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,240
Spoiler, OK.

917
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,560
You know what I'm talking about.

918
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,320
Oh, I do know what you're talking about.

919
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,160
Yeah, is that a spoiler?

920
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,080
I'm going to say yes.

921
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,080
I'm going to say yes.

922
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,080
We've got to keep that in mind.

923
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,040
No particular reason.

924
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,640
I posted a female character in the discord

925
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,320
that was based on myself for some reason.

926
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,200
Shut up.

927
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,000
And I was like.

928
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, you cut all that.

929
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,840
Cut all this.

930
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,560
Don't cut all that.

931
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,080
Don't cut all that.

932
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,840
It needs content.

933
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,200
It's fine.

934
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,520
It's fine.

935
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,720
Look, don't worry about it.

936
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,560
And a 10 of viewers will be rewarded with nuggets of information

937
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,440
that they can piece together bits of the puzzle.

938
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,000
And I posted that.

939
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,800
And Digi was like, is this your trans sona?

940
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,200
And I was like, lol, no.

941
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,960
I mean, I thought it was a joke.

942
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,000
But no.

943
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,440
And then later, she said, oh, OK, no.

944
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,520
I actually thought this was a legit trans sona.

945
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,160
I didn't realize what it was actually for.

946
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,760
And I was like, lol, what a silly mistake to make.

947
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,160
And then when I said, OK, I will match your level of dedication

948
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,560
to this.

949
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,480
And Digi said, oh, you mean you're

950
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,360
going to be dedicated to being feminine?

951
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,040
And I was like, no, no.

952
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,920
I mean, to you being feminine.

953
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,920
It's spreading like a virus, boys and girls.

954
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,520
What they tell you is all true.

955
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,840
Digi just now, Digi has the trans agenda.

956
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,160
And she wants to spread it.

957
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,800
And she wants to spread it and propagate it.

958
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,040
She wants to sink her claws into me and turn her,

959
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,880
turn me into a genus.

960
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,040
All I see.

961
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,520
As well.

962
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,960
I turn my gaze out.

963
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,120
All I see is eggs.

964
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,120
For the fate of the white race, we must resist.

965
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,200
All I see is heroic trans individuals and eggs.

966
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,440
And except, of course, in over 30-year-old women.

967
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,600
Now they have no eggs at all, of course.

968
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,100
Yes.

969
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,200
It's just science, guys.

970
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,280
But yeah.

971
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,440
Delicious, delicious eggs.

972
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,120
So that's my story.

973
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,520
That's my struggle with Digi coming out as trans.

974
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,000
This is how this has affected me.

975
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,480
And I will persevere.

976
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,080
And if you want to support me in my endeavors,

977
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,080
in spite of all the hardship I face,

978
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,960
patreon.com.com.

979
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:32,600
Slash, Ben Sains, to help me get through this trying time.

980
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,520
Thanks very much.

981
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,560
It's kind of funny.

982
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,080
There isn't really much to say about it.

983
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,280
It's just sort of like, oh, cool.

984
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,920
But there were a lot of people.

986
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,800
I was curious why so many people said, oh,

987
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,560
I've seen this coming for a million years.

988
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,680
This is bound to happen eventually.

989
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,320
Lol, I saw it coming.

990
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,960
And I'm like, I didn't.

991
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,520
Do I not know Digi well enough?

992
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,520
Am I stupid?

993
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,080
Did I not pick up on all these things that they say?

994
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,560
Don't you remember all the times

995
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,760
that Digi talked about wanting to be a little girl?

996
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,120
I just thought that was an anime thing.

997
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,960
I just thought that was a hymn thing.

998
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,600
I mean, it could be.

999
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,440
It could be.

1000
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,840
But I heard people say Digi is an egg.

1001
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,480
And I thought, I guess I could see it.

1002
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,760
And now it was true.

1003
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,720
And I'm like, yeah, not a huge shock, I guess.

1004
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,360
Yeah, I'm not too shocked.

1005
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,680
It's just like I'm a little confused

1006
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,400
as why I couldn't see the signs or what.

1007
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,360
I don't know.

1008
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,320
I mean, visibly outwardly, Digi's always

1009
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,640
presented pretty male.

1010
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,520
Or that seems to have been due to sheer laziness, which

1011
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
hey, we all do, right?

1012
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,080
The biology there is male.

1013
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,920
Got a beard and whatnot.

1014
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,760
What can you do?

1015
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,000
So I mean, who can say what's going on in a person's head?

1016
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,240
So I don't know.

1017
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,600
Yeah, not that surprising.

1018
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,240
I mean, she said, you say, a person says,

1019
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,560
I want to be a girl a whole bunch of times.

1020
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,040
Like what?

1021
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,880
Like, you know.

1022
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,720
Yeah, but who doesn't?

1023
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,960
I mean, Digi personally has been like

1024
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,800
confused specifically.

1025
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,720
I mean, you know.

1026
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,440
What man has not wondered what it would be

1027
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,880
like to be the other sex for just at least a day?

1028
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,720
I guess.

1029
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,960
Indeed, indeed.

1030
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,400
Nate, I missed what you said.

1031
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,240
I don't know.

1032
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,080
Nothing important.

1033
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,840
I mean, Digi has constantly expressed confusion.

1034
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,360
So I mean, I don't think it's crazy to be like,

1035
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,240
okay, who knows exactly how this will pan out?

1036
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,800
Again, it seems like a pretty reasonable way to turn out,

1037
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,720
but yeah, that's it.

1038
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,560
Anyway, anyway, all this is to say

1039
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,320
that she's kicked off the podcast.

1040
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,160
Yeah, she's.

1041
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,000
That's correct.

1042
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,840
Okay, now.

1043
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,400
And we kind of buy that.

1044
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,120
Looking forward to the makeup tutorials and the,

1045
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,880
you know, the, what is it?

1046
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,120
Well, where do girls shop?

1047
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,720
Girl, clothing, hall,

1048
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,560
girl, store.

1049
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,040
Women be shopping.

1050
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,320
They be shopping, man.

1051
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,560
And it's disgusting.

1052
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,760
Yeah.

1053
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,520
Prepare to receive the white hot lens of my misogyny.

1054
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,280
And it's going to come in hot and hard.

1055
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,400
So be prepared.

1056
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,120
Okay.

1057
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,000
But like women, am I right?

1058
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,720
What's going to be really embarrassing is that,

1059
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,240
you know, when we have Raek on five

1060
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,320
and we do our customary like gay orgy,

1061
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,400
it's not going to be gay anymore.

1062
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
There's going to be a woman there.

1063
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Oh, gross.

1064
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,120
Well, now it's not funny.

1065
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,480
No, canceled.

1066
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,320
Well, hey, Digi did say that Fuda was the preferred

1067
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,440
identity of choice.

1068
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,760
So Fuda is somewhere on the gay spectrum, right?

1069
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,040
Um.

1070
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,040
I'm going to go with a yeah.

1071
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,000
Oh, wait.

1072
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,040
I mean, I don't know.

1073
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,680
Hotly debated, I guess.

1074
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,520
It is debated.

1075
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,400
It is debated.

1076
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,640
One day the scholars will inform us,

1077
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,560
but we'll just have to wonder until then.

1078
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,840
Well, I mean, there you go.

1079
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,680
You jackals.

1080
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,360
There's your hot takes on the trans question.

1081
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,560
Asked and answered.

1082
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,840
We saw it.

1083
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,680
How much you say?

1084
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,600
We sorted it.

1085
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,360
Yep.

1086
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,200
Settled the issue.

1087
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,720
I mean, hey, that's all I got.

1088
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,560
I got voice mails.

1089
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,080
Surely something else.

1090
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,880
Surely something else must have happened

1091
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,200
in my life this week.

1092
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,040
Oh, wait.

1093
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,880
You're saying something?

1094
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,720
It's quarantine.

1095
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,720
I was just going to say that I've been rereading Berserk.

1096
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,680
Yeah, from the start.

1097
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,520
Yeah.

1098
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,480
Well, I rewatched the anime,

1099
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,400
or rather I watched the anime all the way through

1100
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,240
for the first time.

1101
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,800
I was like, oh my God, I love this.

1102
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,120
It's probably one of my top 10 anime favorites.

1103
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,440
It is really good.

1104
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,680
It is just exactly what I like in a show.

1105
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,400
It's slow and it's epic and it's quiet.

1106
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,160
Have you watched the famous bloopers

1107
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,240
that are attached to the Berserk anime

1108
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,520
and the English dub?

1109
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,160
They are the stuff of legend.

1110
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,720
Like I have not heard that.

1111
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,920
I will acquire for you the link.

1112
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,200
The Berserk anime is famous for its blooper reel

1113
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,000
or whatever that are wrong takes done to it

1114
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,600
and you should definitely check it out.

1115
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,520
Berserk anime bloopers.

1116
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,960
Cool.

1117
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,200
It's like 10 minutes long.

1118
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,400
Or no, it's like 40 minutes long.

1119
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,240
Jesus Christ.

1120
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,080
Okay, here we go.

1121
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,360
But yeah, I watched the anime and I was like,

1122
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,160
okay, let's read the manga from this point.

1123
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,120
Because I've read all the manga all the way anyway.

1124
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,840
So I'm rereading it and I'm like, dang,

1125
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,080
this is just like, this is so good.

1126
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,160
This is how many pen lines is that?

1127
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,160
That's like one million little pen lines on that drawing.

1128
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,400
How does he do that?

1129
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,920
How does his hand not fall off?

1130
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,920
I'm just being enamored.

1131
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,640
I think it's that one image

1132
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,280
in the latest Lord of Ghost chapter

1133
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,520
with this lot of shading, a lot of cross-hatching.

1134
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,960
That was because I was looking at the part in Berserk

1135
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,960
where it's in the holy place with the tower.

1136
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,920
With the priest and the, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1137
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,200
Yeah, and it was, it's like night is falling

1138
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,800
and all of the big scary gloop monsters

1139
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,800
are sucking up everyone and climbing the tower

1140
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,640
and forming a giant hand.

1141
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,720
It's just like that.

1142
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,960
It's like so fucking visceral,

1143
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,240
so fucking well-drawn, every fucking frame, a painting.

1144
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,000
I love Berserk.

1145
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,480
It's so much of an inspiration to me.

1146
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,640
I think about it constantly now.

1147
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,960
I'm just, I just, if there could be anything

1148
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,000
I could do in my life, it would be to draw Berserk.

1149
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,120
That's plus one to the list of the things I just want to do.

1150
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,640
I want to draw one piece, draw Berserk and draw Homestuck.

1151
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,080
Any thoughts?

1152
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,480
Oh yeah, go on Ben, go on.

1153
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,200
Well, I was going to say,

1154
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:55,200
I also revisited a classic work of massive cultural import

1155
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and breathtaking, stunning quality and craftsmanship.

1156
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,760
I'm talking, of course, about the entire angry video game,

1157
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,760
nerd, videography, I like played the entire fucking series.

1158
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,120
I just put on the playlist and let it go

1159
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,720
for like a whole week.

1160
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,760
Did you listen to the series videos like hours long?

1161
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Yeah, yeah, the ones that are the entire series

1162
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,960
put together in one video, right?

1163
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,120
Yeah, those are great.

1164
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,480
Yep, I just, that's what I've been sort of like having on

1165
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,040
for like the past, however many days or whatever.

1166
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,920
It's so easy to just do all of them when you start,

1167
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,560
but like watching many of them.

1168
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,040
Like, it is, it's like, they just kind of,

1169
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,760
it doesn't really feel like one ends

1170
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,040
and a new one begins a lot of the time.

1171
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,360
Really?

1172
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,800
Sometimes it does, other times it doesn't.

1173
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,240
Yeah, a lot of the endings are like really abrupt

1174
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,120
and don't really like, I think a lot of the time

1175
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,520
he just ends an episode with like taking a dump on the game

1176
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,840
and then the next episode just ends with him

1177
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,400
like talking about, so this game is a piece of shit

1178
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,160
and it feels, and it makes me feel like a piece of donkey

1179
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,400
doodoo hurled out of a grizzly bear's vagina.

1180
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,400
And what were they thinking?

1181
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,360
What were they thinking?

1182
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,200
That's a good one.

1183
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,560
I don't know, but you should have that as one of your sounds.

1184
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,040
I'm adding it to my note,

1185
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,600
the what were they thinking anime video?

1186
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,240
What were they thinking?

1187
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,080
I've been saying that.

1188
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,640
The anime video game nerd, that's gonna be me, yes.

1189
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,760
The anime video game nerd, that's pretty good.

1190
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,760
That's right, Konnichiwa, fucku-faisu, fucku this game.

1191
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,720
Sakuwe fucku of Shinobi Dick.

1192
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,680
If he's the anime video game nerd,

1193
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,200
he's not gonna be angry, he's gonna be anime.

1194
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,040
Yeah, he's just a video game nerd who has-

1195
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,600
He's just a nerd who is an anime anime.

1196
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,840
If only I had this much sound, but I'd play it.

1197
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,120
Well, okay, this one works.

1198
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,760
When he's angry instead of screaming

1199
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,800
or when he's playing a video game, instead he goes,

1200
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,240
Yeah, you give us one of those, you know?

1201
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,080
Yeah.

1202
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,080
We'd also do that, doke doke, yo!

1203
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,920
You know that one.

1204
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1205
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,560
The one that- That's a classic.

1206
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,680
The one that you hear at the beginning

1207
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:25,680
of the pastel defender heliotrope game.

1208
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,360
And you hear at the beginning of Jiraiyo's theme

1209
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,160
and the Naruto artist theme.

1210
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,640
I don't care about that.

1211
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,080
Watch my fucking J.D. Jennifer Dayan Wright's lecture

1212
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,840
and at the beginning, there's the game interlude

1213
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,840
where you see the video game that has a yo-hoo, whatever.

1214
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,960
Yo-hoo!

1215
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,960
It's a kabuki thing.

1216
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,000
Little kabuki theater fucking sound effects

1217
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,720
and she mixed with like pinball video game noises.

1218
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,600
Legendary, aesthetic experience.

1219
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,200
Bass.

1220
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,040
I should add that.

1221
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:00,880
It's so fucking good.

1222
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,400
You should add that, that's a good one.

1223
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,840
You should add the entirety of Berserk to your soundboard.

1224
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,880
That's a good idea.

1225
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,360
Auto play.

1226
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,560
I have, I did remember one more thing that happened to me.

1227
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,600
More thing that happened to me this week.

1228
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,880
I ordered more, remember how I was making gummy worms?

1229
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,720
Of course, of course.

1230
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,840
But then I ran out of that syrup

1231
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,040
and the distributatively weren't selling it anymore

1232
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,880
for mysterious reasons.

1233
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,720
Right, right.

1234
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,680
Well, I have good and bad news.

1235
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,960
I ordered the powdered form of it, not the syrup form.

1236
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,120
That's the good news, I got the stuff again.

1237
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,400
The kind of bad news is I was like,

1238
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,080
what is the relation of this syrup to the powder?

1239
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,840
Is the syrup just the powder dissolved in water?

1240
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,960
I don't know.

1241
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,440
So I tried just mixing it in water and it kind of worked?

1242
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,440
Like it did mix and it did give the gummies like more of that.

1243
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,480
I think maybe I put too much in because like,

1244
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,720
I don't know, there might be a balance to be struck here

1245
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,520
because I tried using this stuff.

1246
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,800
It did give them more of a gummi-ish texture.

1247
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,680
It gave them too much of a gummi-ish texture.

1248
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,160
They were like very sticky

1249
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,040
and they didn't hold together very well.

1250
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,440
And also, but also it didn't mix perfectly.

1251
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,060
And there were sort of like kind of like the bottoms of them

1252
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,200
were kind of a little bit hard and chewy.

1253
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,000
And sometimes there were even like kind of lumps in them

1254
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,960
that you couldn't even really chew at all.

1255
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,680
And it was a little unpleasant.

1256
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,760
So there's work to do.

1257
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,960
There's work to do on getting it right with this powdered form.

1258
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,120
But we'll get there.

1259
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,320
We'll get there boys.

1260
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,120
And one day maybe we'll return to the Promised Land.

1261
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,480
That sweet, sweet tapioca-soluble fiber syrup

1262
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,320
once it returns to the internet wave stores.

1263
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,160
And that will be-

1264
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm looking forward to it.

1265
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,840
I'm looking forward to it.

1266
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,680
Was that it?

1267
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,440
There we go.

1268
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,940
Classic.

1269
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,780
Base.

1270
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,200
I love Japan period.

1271
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,200
Well hey, I guess for voicemails

1272
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,640
because I've said all I have to say.

1273
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,480
I'm ready.

1274
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,480
I'm ready to go.

1275
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,420
All right let's do it.

1276
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,180
Let me see here.

1277
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,280
Where did I put them?

1278
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,360
Oh the chocobay.

1279
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,820
Oh that's not a voicemail.

1280
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:26,160
that's the Joker baby easy to confuse let me say okay here we go here we go

1281
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,760
my favorite part of the Joker movie is when Joaquin Phoenix turns to look

1282
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:40,000
directly into the camera and says now I have become the Joker hmm now we did it

1283
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,440
Batman now we finally became this face now this face is the mask the makeup is

1284
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:57,280
my true self I don't I actually haven't seen it he might very well say that I

1285
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:07,000
haven't seen it I meant to see it but I never got around to it I don't watch

1286
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,400
any movie base animal I'm a Philistine what are you I have a movie I think I'm I

1287
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,920
think it's like a depression thing where I like don't appreciate art anymore of

1288
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:25,840
any kind the thought of it sickens me except the Lord of Ghosts the only thing

1289
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,120
that doesn't make me feel that way speaking of saturation due to an

1290
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,000
overabundance of media if that's not what I was not what I was talking about

1291
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,200
alright but depression at least partially induced by hating the universe in

1292
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,200
the world and being sad its existence that yeah her to me but before we

1293
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,040
discuss that listen to this voicemail called where I put it this is a reverse

1294
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:54,000
nostalgia okay take it away go I had a really strange experience recently so I

1295
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,040
like had not played Animal Crossing at all prior to New Horizons coming out and

1296
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:05,000
like I'd played Smash Bros you know and there's like Animal Crossing characters

1297
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,800
and stages and music and stuff in there and all of it was just kind of like okay

1298
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,000
yeah whatever that's neat to me you like you know it was it was just like okay

1299
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,880
it's a game I don't really play but I mean it doesn't it doesn't it's like

1300
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,080
whatever but now after having played Animal Crossing New Horizons I get like

1301
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,680
almost all of the references and stuff and it like feels so invigorating like

1302
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,720
playing Smash Bros again just like to know all the Animal Crossing shit and

1303
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,360
like I know that I want to do that for more games now like I haven't played

1304
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,400
every single game on the Smash Bros roster but that this experience has made

1305
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,000
me want to play more of them just to like get that feeling because like I

1306
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,280
would like get all of the like I don't know Mega Man stuff or whatever like

1307
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,160
Mario you know yeah because I had played those games and it's like oh yeah

1308
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,160
that's like the level from the whatever the character but like there's some that

1309
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,760
I just don't even fucking know man like it's crazy I don't even know how to

1310
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,360
describe this feeling it's like reverse nostalgia there it is title drop what

1311
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:18,080
it's cool is that I saw it and I clapped that's what you're feeling I know

1312
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,800
exactly how it feels I feel the same I played Earthbound long after Smash and

1313
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,720
then I was like oh shit I want to go check that out I don't know if I feel the

1314
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:33,600
same way because like a lot of the time like like in um fuck the city the

1315
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,640
earthbound city that's it's it's Eagleton right or Eagletown I think it's

1316
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,760
on that no no on it Eagland is the name of the country on it is the town you

1317
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:47,040
know you see on it in Smash Bros and it's like all 3d and there's all this

1318
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,320
stuff happening you play earthbound and on it is like it's just like some it's

1319
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,520
just like some pixelated houses it's like it's like it's not much more than

1320
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:01,160
like a Pokemon town oh yeah yeah but it's fun to when I things are interpreted

1321
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,480
I guess but I feel like I would feel the same way about like a Mega Man level or

1322
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:11,120
something or whatever I think what a lot of my experience with this kind of thing

1323
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,960
is a lot of the times I'll see something reference as like an important

1324
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,640
video game history thing yeah or whatever and then it in the unlikely

1325
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,400
chance that I do go back and you know play the thing watch the thing whatever

1326
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:33,160
and get that context a lot of the time my thought is like oh like that's all

1327
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,760
it was back then like because it was because a lot of the time if it's

1328
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,920
something that's like became famous it at the time was just like a pretty humble

1329
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,200
thing that maybe didn't even call much attention to itself you know what I mean

1330
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,320
yeah that's true like the town of on it was not like this landmark thing it

1331
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,000
wasn't like the game wasn't about it it wasn't fleshed out that much but I guess

1332
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,960
just because it was the thing in the game that was such a hit it you know got

1333
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,960
recognition and became sort of sort of famous in its own right and then

1334
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,080
especially so when they put it in a smith because I needed a setting from the

1335
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,000
game what's the setting for Earthbound first one to come to mind on it I guess

1336
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,480
okay we'll go with that all right now it's a famous video game location as long

1337
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,280
as people don't have some like weird expectation I guess they should like you

1338
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,680
should know like okay this game was made like 19 what like 89 I don't know like

1339
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:27,080
like super NES way back in the day you should just keep that in mind you're

1340
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,320
like okay like it's not gonna be it's not gonna like blow my mind but then there's

1341
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,520
a lot I mean there's a reason people love that game I played it like way later in

1342
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,720
life and I absolutely loved it even as like a kid either as like playing game

1343
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,880
well earthbound is we're not talking about that's just an example the only

1344
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,240
thing I know about earthbound is that it gets really really fucked up and that

1345
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,440
there isn't a really fucked up earthbound stage like why is that is it

1346
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,520
doesn't it get into like psychic horror almost well there is the the big city

1347
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,200
from mother three in in brawl that was put in there and that has like the

1348
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,680
chimera which is a big fucking monster I mean they could have done nightside but

1349
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,920
like nightside is like a weird version of like what is it forson that city or

1350
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,440
whatever I can't remember exactly we're like four cent garbage the one the one

1351
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,720
where like yes is no and no is yes yeah yeah that would have been I mean they

1352
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,120
only have so many stages and it just reverses all your controls or whatever

1353
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,960
yeah fuck you player you just have to you have to ask the smash staz to why

1354
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,440
they thought some made for better stages than others but but this question was

1355
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,640
not about earthbound I was just using this no no right right we just fine I

1356
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,120
mean I totally know what this guy I mean when to city I was coming out the city of

1357
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:43,000
Final Fantasy in like 2008 that along with my longtime fandom of Final Fantasy

1358
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,880
I was like okay fuck this I need to now go play like all the final fantasies that

1359
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,680
I've missed and then I went back and I think I played like three and I think I

1360
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,560
played four and like the I don't know if the sequel to four was out then I'd

1361
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,880
already played like five and six I think I think I played like I tried to beat a

1362
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,240
but didn't finish here something I don't I played like a bunch because I wanted

1363
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,360
like oh yeah like I don't know who the fuck onion knight is I want to know what

1364
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,520
onion nights about so I'm gonna go play Final Fantasy 3 turns out like there is

1365
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,040
nothing to onion night that's just the default class and it is good and cool

1366
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,800
but I mean a better thing is that like in the original dissidia and they fucking

1367
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,520
changes for the sequel which is stupid the Bartz's ultimate attack like cloud

1368
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,920
has omni slash okay big iconic of course that's ultimate attack Bartz's is

1369
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:32,200
rapid-fire dual-wheeled spellblade which is just a really efficient and strong

1370
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,080
combination of powers from Final Fantasy 5 it's like literally called that

1371
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,040
which is just like a meta thing that like the community was aware of and it

1372
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,400
became like his quote-unquote ultimate attack which is pretty pretty based

1373
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,480
pretty cool so I don't know it like and it's fun to just go back and like learn

1374
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:55,040
how such things came to be such that whatever that that's not like really a

1375
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,280
cultural touchstone this particular combination of attacks but I mean in the

1376
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,000
community it is I don't know whatever I certainly get where this guy's coming

1377
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,800
from oh there was another thing I want to say about this guy so that voice is

1378
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,280
probably familiar to you ladies and gentlemen because this guy leaves a lot

1379
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,920
of voicemails I don't know if he has like a handle or a name I just want to

1380
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:21,520
say for the record this man this this creature left like 16 voicemails this

1381
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:28,520
week and I got to 16 and I'm letting you know I tweeted about this before I just

1382
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,400

1383
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:39,400
guy again don't leave you there's stop don't do that I don't have time to listen

1384
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:46,240

1385
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,320
that just did this one yeah that guy I mean this question was fine it was the

1386
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,240
first one I heard but then he just went on to do more and more and more and like

1387
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,560
some were fine but I just got absolutely bored I was like I'm no I'm not

1413
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:17,480
what's the big hey did I talk about the history of cheese making memes I don't

1414
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,880
think so all right let me just let me just break in here to tell you about the

1415
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:26,000
funniest thing that happened to me this week sure and sad to say it was just a

1416
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,080
meme that I found on the internet okay I was kind of drunk but I saw this meme I

1417
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:37,760
saw a tweet that said all I can do now is make history of cheese making memes and

1418
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,200
there were a couple of memes but let's tell you the best one it was you know

1419
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,800
the one of the anime guy who's gesturing at a butterfly and he says is this

1420
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:53,000
something right of course well this one was the guy was a human being in

1421
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,520
Mesopotamia circa 5,000 to 7,000 BC he's gesturing at the butterfly the butterfly

1422
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,600
is a goat's bladder can a sheep's bladder containing rennet an enzyme that

1423
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,440
promotes curdling is this a good place to store milk

1424
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,880
that's it's well I was like that's good out of breath

1425
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:29,000
there were a couple other I guess I guess I guess that no no no no you see

1426
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,760
there was another meme attached you see he would think no the answer was no but

1427
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,000
then there was other me with it's sort of like the Drake reaction but it's like a

1428
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
girl and the first she's going like but the second she's going hmm and the first

1429
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,520
is like opening up my sheep's bladder to find that the milk I stored in it has

1430
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,800
curdled and then the second one is realizing I've just invented cheese

1431
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:59,800
the thing about being the thing about being a human in Mesopotamia circa 5,000

1432
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,200
to 7,000 BC is that you would never ever go anywhere without your trusty

1433
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:13,240
sheep's bladder you're always looking for places to store all this milk like what's

1434
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:17,600
the point of doing like it's like no no no the first guy who put who put milk in

1435
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,520
there in their rennet rich sheeps bladder it was like the guy who first put

1436
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:29,440
peanut butter on chocolate

1437
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,760
my question is how do you get the cheese out do you have to squeeze is it still

1438
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:39,320
liquidy I guess it is yeah yeah okay okay fair enough I was wondering if you

1439
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,480
have to lose a perfectly good bladder for such things there was a third meme I

1440
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,720
don't know it was also about rennet what I don't give a fuck you get the point

1441
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,280
more rennet try to link those if you can find a band for adoring you know I'm

1442
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:55,320
sure it won't be hard for me to find okay okay all right let's move on to our

1443
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,400
next voicemail yes of course Caligula is calling in he apparently has something

1444
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,960
to say take it away see dog hey guys last episode y'all talked about melee and

1445
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,240
there's a lot of misinformation I'm a melee player I'm super in on the scene I

1446
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:15,160
want to give some things oh cool one melee is not like super big we get really

1447
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,240
good viewer numbers but we're not a very large community we don't have the

1448
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,400
biggest numbers especially evo ultimate pulls like double almost triple the

1449
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:27,120
amount of entrance we do but the real reason melee was kicked last year is

1450
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,000
because with ultimate coming out you know 2019 didn't want to have two smash

1451
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,160
games for like the fifth year in a row they only have nine spots for so many

1452
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,360
fighting games and they're really important they're already doing it and

1453
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:43,000
melee does use CRTs which are harder to get especially now in 2020

1454
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:51,160
archaic tech so mr. wizard the evo owner kicked us and most people think it is

1455
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,320
not just because of those reasons but also he doesn't really like melee he's

1456
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:00,640
insulted the game a lot we only got enough like a donation drive in 2013 and

1457
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,720
we just were big enough he had to keep us around on pressure but yeah it really

1458
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,760
wasn't any reasons a Nintendo or anything like that it was really just no

1459
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:14,280
two smash games CRTs are kind of annoying and mr. wizard really does not

1460
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:23,920
like melee okay that was just an ad no it wasn't an ad that was just a response

1461
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,880
to our discussion about melee it was just giving us an inside scoop it was an

1462
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,440
um actually but that's fine you know I guess it kind of was an um actually I

1463
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:40,000
guess that's fair to be honest I was gonna make a comment sorry voice voice

1464
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:50,000
jail it bored me voice oh no come on okay damn it you got one voice bail per

1465
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,720
episode if you're on the episode all right okay well let's see if this one

1474
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:54,640
teen see you know oh that sting oh what who was leading the teen CP I think was

1475

just called teens with a teen CP yeah his teen CP is just shrinking right

1476
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,200
becoming more teensy by the second he's become fully RFCK pill he doesn't care

that's right it is very I really cringe every time I look at it but I mean that's

1482
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,520
some that's a me problem other people might feel differently mm-hmm there's at

1484
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:47,720
going to bat I didn't know I know I like listening to it because sometimes they

1485
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,960
talk about me and that's all I care about is me I guess I guess I sure hope

1486
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,720
they are the primary audience I guess I should probably give it a listen I mean

1487
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:02,080
I am I guess they're mascot so I yeah um you could descend from the clouds do

1492
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:28,960
lukewarm non-committal endorsement of that certainly not the best not validating

1493

1496
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,160

1497
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,760
like that wasn't bad that was awesome in its own special well I don't I don't

core behind this terribleness of it putting the boost in your myth or I

of embarrassment all right I'll die take it away no oh sorry didn't see you there

oh I'm just busy self-flagellating for my horrific offenses you know that's good

1537
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:38,280
last night I said that in my she directed die buster when it was actually

1538
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:48,560
I can't I can't bear you that's the sound of just a moment you're right you're

1539
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:54,640
right I deserve to be here until I can prove that this is not characteristic

1540
01:26:54,640 --> 01:27:06,120
please I must suffer for this until you've realized you know until you no

1541
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:11,320
longer identify as someone who mistakes the director of FLCL then then we can

1542
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,440
have a conversation this could be the start of a redemption arc perhaps I like

1543
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:21,520
to think so I like to think see his fellow inmates first step I but he I'll die

1544
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,320
is sending a good example for his fellow inmates by going above and beyond

1545
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,200
what our normal jailers do of torturing and beating them daily by doing it to

1546
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:33,400
himself in his own time and I just want him to know that that is appreciated and

1547
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:37,160
we respect the effort if I think we should send him to voice jail so that he

1548
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,080
could be a good example to all the other inmates he's already there he's already

1549
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,080
there that's the thing oh he's uh oh okay well good see my instincts were right

that this is a Chinese company this is a Chinese company I'll just I'll fucking

1629
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:27,560
say I'll fucking it's time to oh shenzhen long you crafts hmm hmm how much

1630
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:38,560
cheaper are they than the original thing they are good quality some amount

1631
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:44,680
I don't remember exactly they're they're considerably cheaper but also shipping

1632
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:49,720
costs a lot more it's the reason why it's not like a as big of a savings as I

1633
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,720
was hoping for is because shipping is fucking murder but it's still probably

1634
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:05,040
saving maybe like at least like 50 bucks a pin no yeah we're saving probably

1635
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,760
saving like at least several hundred dollars by using these these Chinese

1636
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:13,920
dudes indeed indeed because they have they have more like they're more granular

1637
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,680
they give you more options like the the UK based company that I had been using to

1638
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:22,400
make pins it's like they don't they they they will charge they will charge you

1639
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,680
like they they wrap the the production fee for the mold into it they don't

1640
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:30,720
charge you separately for the mold they just charge you a base price that

1641
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:34,400
includes the mold and a certain number of pins so you can't like fine tune it

1642
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,360
like that they don't charge per color they just have like you can get up to

1643
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:42,680
this many colors yeah presumably they just charge the max as assume that you

1644
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:50,960
will do the maximum stuff like that but yeah this this one looks like pretty

1645
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,720
much identical in quality so you know thumbs up success oh you know what I'm

1646
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,840
just reminded all of a sudden that I want to extend the olive branch to one

1647
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:04,560
sigh a.k.a. the cyborg because I saw somewhere I think of the car S. Y. Y.

1648
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:11,360
Yeah S. Y. Y. Okay yes not Gungham style not not Gundam style not that sigh not

1649
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,040
any other sigh okay because sigh felt I think at least somewhat wronged by my

1650
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:20,800
interpretation of what I self-described as an overly long and dull voicemail

1651
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,920
about how the voicemail sucked and and we dabbed on them for a little bit based

1652
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:29,760
on that I just I'm sorry if I misrepresented yeah that's why that's

1653
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,720
all I just follow the crowd I think it wasn't the most uncharacteristic but

1654
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:38,640
sigh I want you nobody no bad blood on this I'm sorry if I misrepresented your

1655
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:45,240
point but you have my love and respect that that's it that's it anyway let me

1656
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:48,480
see what the patreon as we said speak pipe leave more voicemails but I

1657
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,120
certainly don't need like a dozen from a single person let's be reasonable here

1658
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:56,520
people let's uh let's not burry Nate under a flood just just you know write

1659
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:00,640
down your ideas and just at the end like the day or two before be like okay I'll

1660
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,840
be like these three these three are the best ones he probably wasn't gonna play

1661
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,680
these ones anyway and to save me the time or I will just skip them cuz as

1662
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:15,280
somebody sitting in 16 I'm just guessing they're not all absolute gems all

1663
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,520
right there you go and nobody wants to hear the same voice ten times on an

1664
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,760
episode anyway even if they were theoretically all good okay space that

1665
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,920
