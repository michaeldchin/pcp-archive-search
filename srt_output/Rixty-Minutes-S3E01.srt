1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
I don't give a fuck, bitch. Welcome to the first episode of Digibro and Best Guy Ever. That's you.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,240
Dickin' Boardy Time, baby. Yeah, baby, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,240
We're talking about Rick and Morty, everybody, season three. Season three. You know, the season

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,600
three premiere came out on April 1st on Adult Swim. It was a big deal. Everybody was excited about it.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,440
And we're thinking about maybe talking more about the rest of season three. So here we are

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,360
starting things off with that episode. Rick and Morty is like my favorite show ever.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,640
It's just rewatching that episode again just now. It's really hard to argue that that show

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
isn't like the most dense with high quality content show anywhere right now.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
I mean, that's what I love about it. It's so fucking, it's so dense. It's so dense.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Every single shot has so much going on, yeah. It's fantastic. I was a huge fan of the first

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,800
season, watched it like five times. Still haven't really rewatched season two. I intended to do

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,040
that before three started and three seemingly had snuck up on it. But then it hasn't actually.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,960
It was just a weird April Fools thing. Confused the shit out of me because I was in Atlanta

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,120
when it came out. I didn't get the chance to see it. And then every week I was like,

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,400
why am I not hearing about the new season of Rick and Morty? Sounds like you were out of it.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,720
I thought I was just missing episodes and no one was telling me somehow. And I was really confused.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,640
So let me just talk about how great this was as an April Fools episode.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,200
So April Fools every year is terrible because everyone tricks you and says like,

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,640
hey, I'm going to do this and then I'm not going to do it. And then you're disappointed.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
Am I the only one who loves April Fools? Yes. We were all complaining about it,

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,840
but me and the rest of the PCP were all shitting on it. I love April Fools because people always,

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,960
well, it depends on who it is. Some people just do some bullshit, but I love when people pull out

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,400
all the stops to do some crazy shit. That's what makes it good. If you follow the old web

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,240
comment XKCD, every year he would do some kind of like insane shit, like turn his entire website

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
into a fucking text adventure game or something, like some crazy programming shit. Well, that's fine.

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,880
It used to be that websites would really go all out and make like a crazy thing for April Fools

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,080
Day. And it was always exciting to see like what everybody was doing that day. And I historically

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
have always made April Fools videos. Well, what you're describing is the good side of April Fools,

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,560
but there is the downside, whereas people say like, oh, I'm going like, oh, Half-Life 3 is out.

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,480
Wow. I'm so excited. Oh, it's not actually out. Okay, fuck you. But what, I mean, but this episode

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,120
is exactly that. Watch the fucking calendars, people. That's all I'm saying. Everyone loves

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
fucking Rick and Morty. Everyone agrees. It's fantastic too. Like on April Fools, get this like

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,440
loop of the new episode that is so legitimately good and well crafted and has, even the episode

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,480
itself has a ton of Mr. X as Rick and Morty episodes tend to do. Like this is exactly what an April

35
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,200
Fools should be. We're getting more. We're not being cheated or lied to. We're just getting extra

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,360
stuff. That's what you should celebrate about the day. Yeah. I mean, that's the best way to April

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
Fools is to make an actual surprise. Surprised by people by giving them more shit, by making them

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,000
happy as opposed to pissed off. That's what I like. Though personally, I think you should just

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,520
know what day it is. It's not hard to know April 1st is coming. I don't know. Maybe because I make a

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,160
big deal out of it, like I always have plans for April Fools, so I know it's coming. But that just

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,040
means one day of the year, you just be like, oh, everything's a lie today. No one is telling me

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,840
the truth today. That's just annoying. I don't want that. Maybe it's a nice change of pace, I guess.

43
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,880
I fucking get pissed off by it. But anyway, forget that. To me, it's like the classic festivals

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400
like the masquerade. No one's themselves today. It's an escape from the normalcy.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,600
And again, I think it's been hurt by the fact that the internet is now real life. There are

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,800
real life repercussions of changing everything. Where 10 years ago, YouTube did a thing where

47
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,760
the entire front page, everything linked to Rick Roll. YouTube could never do that now because

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,320
it would hurt too many people's careers. That's true. It would be a huge fucking deal. Now,

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,680
April Fools is always like some lame shit you have to actually go find.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,440
Yeah. It's like, oh, I already know what it's going to be. I know it's April Fools' day. You

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,520
can't fucking trick me today, you know? But I miss when sites would do, I mean,

52
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,880
fucking 4chan still does, like, they'll have a song looping in the background of the entire

53
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,200
fucking website. And you know what, that is annoying, but 4chan is not really essential

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,600
for anybody. So that's more okay. It doesn't really interfere with your day.

55
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,920
Anyway, Rick and Morty. Yeah, I feel like that's an appropriate interlude to discuss

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,600
Rick and Morty anyway. Well, I don't know how long we plan for these podcasts to be,

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,760
but we can go on as long as we need to. There's a pilot episode and we don't know when we're

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,680
going to be covering the next one, when it will be out. No one knows when the next episode is

59
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,160
going to be out soon. And I mean, this episode, like the biggest question on everyone's minds is

60
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
because it was like season two ended on a huge fucking cliffhanger. How are they going to start

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,280
off? You know, they have to open season three with something kind of epic. Yep. And the show

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,040
opens up by lampooning this. Of course. It starts off with this joke that they're all in a shoneys,

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,680
and oh, who wants to hear about how I escaped from prison? Like, that would be stupid. And like,

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,040
it's like, I'll even admit, like, even though I knew I'd heard spoilers for this episode before

65
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,680
I watched it, even though I knew that I still had that reaction of like, oh, you motherfucker.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
But then, of course, when it turns out to be a lie, that's like, oh, okay, that's exactly that

67
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
April Fool spirit I love. They act like they're fucking you over, and then they give you everything

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,560
you want it. And it's so great. Oh, and the actual shit that Rick does, it turns out it was all part

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,640
of his fucking plan. And they do this whole rigmarole with all this new technology of like,

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,920
mind transferring we haven't seen before. Oh, it's the best. Yeah. So this episode continues

71
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,080
the sort of trend that I saw happening through season two, and especially with the ending of

72
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,520
season two of I feel like Rick and Morty owes a lot to Game of Thrones. Yeah. Like, I think the

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,920
way that this show uses like brutal violence is sort of like, because we are now in a, in a culture

74
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,120
where that's like a normal thing on mainstream television, like, like insanely violent scenes

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,400
has HBO become mainstream television, or is it just the popularity of the show? Like, yeah,

76
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,760
because HBO now is way more easily accessible. Well, it used to. Torrents are a thing. Well,

77
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,520
yeah, but it, you know, Game of Thrones is the most torrented show of all time. I believe it.

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,560
I believe it had like millions and millions of torrents. Yeah, okay. So everyone's everyone's

79
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
seen it. Everyone has seen Game of Thrones. It's it's that's the culture where it now is like

80
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,360
that this kind of hyper violent, like crazy dark shit is what gets talked about. And I mean,

81
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,920
the ending of season two was clearly a Game of Thrones parody. It was a red wedding. Yeah, it was

82
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,800
the red wedding like redone in Rick and Morty. And I just love the way the show. It totally like

83
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
gets into the headspace of like, who is the audience of Rick and Morty? Like,

84
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,920
what kind of cultural stuff are we? Because like, a lot of the show is in reference to

85
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,400
like, cultural touchstones. Yeah, like, there's lots of movie parodies. There's like a whole

86
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
episode on the purge planet. It's like, right, which was great. What would it be like if there's a

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,960
planet that does the purge and the way that Riley and matter of fact, we address like what a real

88
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,120
purge planet would be. I mean, in their lampooning way, it's great. It's wonderful. And so when they

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,320
do like a red wedding scene, like they know exactly how the audience is going to feel at every step

90
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,120
of the way. And the moment that like really got I mean, that episode is fucking amazing. A lot of

91
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,040
shit happens in that episode. But the moment that got me the most was right after bird person gets

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,280
shot. Yeah, then Rick screams like bird person, no. And literally he said that while I was saying,

93
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,560
no bird person. It's like one to one, me and Rick saying it at the same time. And I'm like,

94
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,480
because they knew that that's what the audience was going to do. They knew you were going to yell,

95
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,560
no bird person, you know, and so they they matched it. And it's like, they totally get

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
the ebb and flow of your feelings and stuff. And like, it's well written, man. It's well written.

97
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,240
There's so many like, there's so much stuff that they've allowed themselves. This show does what

98
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,040
like my little pony fucked up with its background characters. Oh, yeah, you're right. It makes you

99
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,360
care about them in a real way. I mean, in all fairness, it was one episode that was garbage that

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,040
pretty much ruined that whole thing. But what I mean is that like in in in MLP fandom, for anybody

101
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,520
who doesn't know, because we're a few years out from it, and people probably don't know what we're

102
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,160
talking about anymore. The fan base of my little pony, like really ran with every random fucking

103
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,600
background character that was in the show. They all had like fan made backstories and like people

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
had all these ideas about them. And like they each one was a popular character in their own

105
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
right, because they would show up in the background all the time or have like one line here and there

106
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,360
and stuff like that. And so all those background characters became kind of famous. And eventually,

107
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,200
the show writers became aware of this. And they kind of tried to do something with it. And it was

108
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
terrible. Granted, some people don't agree. Some you know, there were some decent things like the

109
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
way they handled the fact that Bon Bon had like two cannon or like there was a fandom name and a

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,480
real name. They made her a secret agent with an alias. Like that's one clever way to handle that

111
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,880
kind of a thing. But there were many things that were bad and shitty episode itself. The episode

112
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,000
was garbage. So yeah, yeah, like and just the general way that they tried to like they're trying

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,800
to pander to the audience. But it's like they're trying to give us what we are saying we want.

114
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,400
Yeah, Rick and Morty knows what we want and gives it to us in ways we don't expect, such as it's

115
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,080
got all these background characters who people just naturally started caring about people love

116
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,640
bird person. People love, you know, all these random weird wacky characters. That fucking

117
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,200
half dude whose name I forget. Squanch. Squanch, yeah. Squanchie. And instead of like giving us

118
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
some fan service episode, or it's like, Hey, it's all your favorite background characters.

119
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,160
They murder all of them. Yeah. And it makes it even more memorable, because it's like instead of

120
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,360
just like, Oh, here's bird person again, we know you love bird person. Here you go. Have as much

121
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,320
bird person as you want. No, like the second or third episode he's in, he gets fucking shot and

122
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,280
dies. Yeah. And it's like, because they know you actually do care about him in this weird way,

123
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,960
this guy with like two lines, but he's such an endearing character that when he gets shot, you're

124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,480
like, Oh, no, not bird person. But it's, it's also that like, they can get away with that because

125
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
it doesn't it never feels too dark because of the fact that they're all just dumb background

126
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,520
characters. Yeah. Like a guy, you see a guy get shot whose name is like Schmoopy Doop or something,

127
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,120
or Poopy Butthole. Poopy, Mr. Poopy Butthole. Yeah. You know, like, like it's the scene is like

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,720
drawing out like this pathos and everything. And it's everyone's crying, it's like that. Like,

129
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,040
on some level, it hits you emotionally, because you kind of care about Poopy Butthole. Not to

130
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,600
mention, but it's not like they murdered your favorite character who you really care about.

131
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,840
And a lot of that has to do with the way that Rick himself is such like an anti social,

132
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,080
you know, whatever, misanthrope. And I'm using that word right, the one who hates people. Yeah.

133
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, I was wondering if it's the one who hates men. I'm not saying that. It's the other thing.

134
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
But like the way he doesn't give a fuck about anyway, about anyone and the way that he does

135
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,200
react when bird person dies, and like continually has this relationship with him. And he talks about

136
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,960
like, Yeah, we fought in the war. It's like, we're buddies to actually have that character care about

137
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,680
someone makes us care about them to and makes their death all the more impactful. So from that

138
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,760
perspective, too, it really works. I definitely think that like, because Rick is presented as

139
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,680
someone who's like, so yeah, over the edge and like doesn't care about anything. Yeah,

140
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,720
anytime he emotes, right, it feels serious. Like it's that much more impactful. Like when he

141
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,360
like the fucking self an episode. Yeah, after dating that girl and having been like cut off. Oh my

142
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,840
God. And I do Jesse freaks out about that episode. That one's devastating. Oh my God. Just because

143
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,240
it's like Legion. No, whatever. You just like, oh my God, it's like, yeah, he does like that.

144
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,760
My favorite thing about Rick and Morty and I know Tom, Tommy Oliver had a problem with this

145
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,480
aspect of the show. He thought it was ruining Rick showed so much emotion. That's my favorite thing

146
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,560
about the show is that there is this like, like at heart, he is highly empathetic. And the reason

147
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,680
that he the reason he acts this way isn't because he hates people. It's because I think he cares too

148
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,360
much about people. And he knows that like, the universe is an unchanging, unfeeling, you know,

149
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,600
like monstrous place, like caring about people is just going to lead to pain. So don't do it.

150
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
It's like he's a man who's gained the knowledge of a God and is, you know, aware of how insignificant

151
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,480
everything is. It's really fucked him up. Yeah, he's like, you know, how can I bring myself to

152
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,680
give a shit about people when I know what's going like that they are nothing, you know, but then

153
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,120
like he can't help himself because he is still human. That's true. So like sometimes he has,

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,840
he can't help but care, you know, and like if he really falls in love, like he did in that episode

155
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,040
and loses out and and I mean, it's not even just that it's also he's drunk and yeah, it's too

156
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,240
emotional, you know, and like he's fucked up on drugs and shit. And it's like, yeah, that's the

157
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,400
moment when you're like he could have easily killed himself that if he hadn't passed out. He really

158
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,520
tried he really put his best effort really like did it and just failed. The fact that he didn't

159
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,440
push out he went all the way and really tried to do it. I mean, it's been said, but that's such

160
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,560
intense moment, great scene. And yeah, and then when we see like with this at the end of season

161
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,160
two, when he's like, what are you in for? And he says everything. It's like, you know, I've

162
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,680
like he finally realizes, you know, I can't bring myself to say I don't care about my family.

163
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,680
But of course, of course, all this, I mean, you know, we were saying this to but all this,

164
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,960
you can you can compare to is in parallel to how like him turning himself in at the end of the

165
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,160
second of season, you know, to supposedly save his family and like, you know, give them back

166
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,400
the life that he stoned from it was actually I mean, and it's kind of ambiguous, but it seems

167
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,720
like it was actually all part of a plan to depose Jerry as patriarch of the family and become like

168
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,400
the ruler and get more to exclusively because he's so evil and fucked up. That's the thing about it

169
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,920
is that with Rick, you can never say for sure. And I mean, I personally think that like,

170
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,960
I think that he is ultimately empathetic because we've seen him do it in moment like

171
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,240
when he tried to kill himself, no one was there to witness that there was no benefit to that.

172
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,080
When he goes back, like the first moment we really see Rick act that way is when Morty gets like

173
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:25,360
almost raped by the Jellybean King. And Rick, when he realizes that Morty is upset, he like changes

174
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,000
gears and like tries to comfort him and like leads him and then he shoots the Jellybean King just

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
out of anger. I love the fact that he murdered that guy because he deserved it. He didn't push

176
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,960
the out. Well, that's that's one of my favorite scenes in the show because the fact that it's like

177
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,480
it shows that Rick like on even though he doesn't care in general, like he saw something happening

178
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,960
right in front of him to someone he does kind of care about. And so he was like, well, I can do

179
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,360
something about this. I can kill that guy. You know, that kind of speaks to a fundamental like

180
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
psychological, you know, facet that humans have where we're much more empathetic about things

181
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,640
that are directly in front of us as opposed to like news that there are billions of people dying

182
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,040
elsewhere. Well, because it just when you hear how big it is, you're like, I can't do anything about

183
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,360
that. But even it's interesting. It's just like, oh, well, I literally know I can do something about

184
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
this because it's right in front of me. It's interesting to me that even a character like

185
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,960
Rick, who is the smartest man in the universe, even he like retains that perspective, that very

186
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,120
human perspective. And that's the thing, like when you meet first meet the Council of Rick's and

187
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,960
everything, it's established that he's like right on the edge between like being the evil.

188
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,800
If you're slightly more evil than him, you're an evil fucking master villain. But if you're

189
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,680
slightly more righteous than him, then you're like a little bit like he's right in the perfect

190
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,120
interstice to be the most interesting Rick, which is why we follow this right. Right. Right. It's

191
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,640
really he's a who's a real reflection of humanity, like a certain perspective of what a human being

192
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:02,560
is. You can see in that. It's real cool. So I this episode accomplishes a lot of things that I

193
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,720
wanted to have like, okay, after season one of Rick and Morty, like my biggest thing that I wanted

194
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,240
to happen in season two was for Beth and Jerry to split up. Right. Like because the way I saw it was

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,560
like season one was constantly suggesting it. And like this is a show that has plot progression.

196
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,320
So like, let's do it. Let's do away with this nuclear family dynamic. Like, you know, because

197
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,000
the first season was constantly bouncing between like home life and crazy sci fi A plot. Yeah.

198
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,120
And like, it did sometimes feel a little restricted by the fact that it had to do like normal shit.

199
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,160
The cutaways to the Jerry and Beth bits are almost every time the worst part of the episode.

200
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
Yeah, even when they're good, like even when they're good, the Gazorp is or stuff with them is

201
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
actually great and is probably the best part of that particular episode. But not every time they

202
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,440
are, you know, in general, they're the weakest part or the the the TV episode. Did I say Gazorp

203
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,120
is or I meant to say Mr. Meeseeks. I meant to say Mr. Meeseeks. Oh, yeah, that's fantastic. Yeah.

204
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Yeah. Like, so it's just that it felt very explored in season one. So I was really hoping

205
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,440
that season two would like start off with them getting divorced. Yeah, it didn't happen. Instead,

206
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,800
season two went even heavier on the divorce element. And like, again, it had ultimately the

207
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,920
episodes were good. But I was just like, I get it. Yeah, like, I want these two split up because

208
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,440
this is going to go on forever. And like, I feel like we've done everything we can with it. Yeah.

209
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,320
So the fact that this episode, a big part of it is getting Jerry out of the picture. And like,

210
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,600
the way that Rick talks to Morty at the end is obviously meta. He's like describing to Rick or

211
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,520
to Morty, like, we have done this as writers, we are writing Jerry out of the show to get rid of

212
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,680
him because we're sick of him. I still though, in the context of a character saying these things

213
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,600
to Morty, it's just so so wonderfully black and dark and evil. It's great. It's fantastic. It's

214
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,160
like your father was your father crossed your father and the entire galactic government crossed

215
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,400
me. So I got rid of them both. That's what a fucking badass. That's so sick. God, I love Rick.

216
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,640
What I love about this show is it's never content to just be status quo. Like,

217
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,160
like, um, I mean, that's what most most episodic comedy shows like this, you know,

218
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,640
they have to have this baseline thing they can always return to this sense of normalcy that's

219
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,600
kind of in the background. And it can be hard to change that and break away from it. And like,

220
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,560
I was really scared that after season two, like, are we always going to have this Beth Jerry thing

221
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,680
going on? Like this is getting tiring, you know, and they did some like, like episode two of season

222
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,320
two where they had Jerry in the daycare was fucking genius. Yeah, that's a great one. That's a great

223
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,320
way to do a Jerry B plot. But like, um, you know, Jerry's a he can't develop as a character because

224
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,960
it would defeat the point. That's right. He's a character who's like inherently static. And

225
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,200
he's boring now. So let's get rid of them. And they did, they cut him out. And I'm like, I fully

226
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,120
expect him to not show up throughout season three. Yeah, I think we'll a little undercut what they're

227
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,720
going for here if he just was back. Exactly. And, uh, and then they're also doing away with the

228
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,760
Rick Federation thing, because obviously that's limiting in a way that like it always puts Rick,

229
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
like there's there's a definitive opposition he has. Yeah, that's always around. And it's like,

230
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
we've explored a lot of it. And I mean, it's not that they couldn't have done more with it,

231
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
but like having it there means like there's certain rules we've established like Rick can't do this

232
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
because the council will intervene. There's certain things that like we've made it. So

233
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,200
if, if this or this happens, we have to involve these characters. And so I see the writers going,

234
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,520
all right, that's too limiting. We want to do crazy or shit. We want to make it so Rick can do

235
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
those things. It's very exciting that they're changing things on such a level. That's really

236
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,800
is a good sign. So now we've taken out like the entire power structure of the universe.

237
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah, the galactic government and the rest of the things. Yeah, right. Like from here,

238
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,400
the show can go anywhere. And there's nothing that's, there's no like system that was in place

239
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,040
that's going to hold it back from doing my only kind of fear was that they really had established,

240
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,040
like those were, as you were saying, like they were the highest level authorities that existed.

241
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,960
And it's a little hard to imagine like what could easily replace those. It's going to take

242
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,280
some creativity. So I highly anticipate what you say. I wouldn't be surprised if we got like,

243
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,720
you know, Rick forming a new government himself or something. Well, there's no Rick would be.

244
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
I mean, he might do that just to like deal with the problem and then divorce himself from it because

245
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,040
he can't be involved in bureaucracy. Not at all. But like, yeah, just like he did with the with

246
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,280
the devil shop. Maybe it just turns the fucking whole world completely anarchic or the whole

247
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,040
universe goes to anarchy or something, you know, like, you know, that's maybe this whole season

248
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
is just like batshit insanity all the time. The only reason I think they won't go that way is

249
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,600
because that is a little bit harder to write for than I expect them to go for. Yeah. I mean,

250
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,040
there is a bit of a formula here that I think they generally want to stick to.

251
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Yeah, I'm just really curious where we're going to go with with no Jerry and no, no Rick council,

252
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,960
which like, you know, it's it's almost sad because like the Rick council is such a cool

253
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,720
I know I loved it that I could have watched it forever. It's such that at the same time. Yeah,

254
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,840
it's really ballsy to just kill like to take this great idea and say we've done all we want to do

255
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,000
with it. Let's just like make sure you know as a viewer that it's gone. You know, they really

256
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,560
hammered in those points. And I just love I mean, this is just a compliment of the entire show.

257
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,960
How logically consistent everything is like with Rick having an interdimensional portal gun,

258
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
of course, there would something like the Rick thing would develop and the way it impacts his

259
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
character. Because he has the portal gun, he developed this, you know, lack of care about

260
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
anyone and anything in his life because there's literally infinite copies of him. It doesn't

261
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,040
matter what he does at any point. And these ricks are going to form the Federation to live their

262
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,000
like own outside existence outside any kind of like galactic government that existed. It's just

263
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,960
and and everything's just so consistent and wonderful. And it's just why the show is so good.

264
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,400
And continues one of my favorite things about Rick and Morty is how breakneck it is. Yeah,

265
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,840
like, there's the scene where the the Rick Council breaks into the alien thing and just

266
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,160
Rick himself gets shot in the face immediately. Yeah, like our Rick, we see get fucking shot

267
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,480
in the face. And it's like, whoa, you know, but you also kind of know that he just left. So it's

268
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,440
just like, you're barely able to keep up with the things that are happening. It's like, people are

269
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,000
getting shot, people are taking a shit. It's a wild ride, you know. Yeah, take a shit. That was

270
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,440
that's a great recurring thing. I think he's using that as like his I need to leave this room

271
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
now and go to other stuff. I got to take a shit. And it's just because no one would question anyone's

272
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,440
saying that. And it's the the great way they use the dialogue and such a snappy pace, like he walks

273
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
into the room and is like, whoa, you can't be in here. This is the room where if you press a couple

274
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,080
buttons and knobs, it like teleports the entire Citadel. He's like, well, he probably shouldn't

275
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,040
have designed it that way. Beep, beep, explosion. Yeah, plot moving along and break that immediately.

276
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,840
Like the very first thing you see is it's just a shot of the Citadel reappearing inside what

277
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,040
is clearly the world government. It's just like, yeah, everything's done now. Like what in that one

278
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,160
shot, we totally understand that both of those governments are just gone. You know, it's just

279
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,400
like, well, moving along. And they spoon feed you a little bit, but they're just like, you know,

280
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,360
oh, no, we teleported here. Everything bad's happening. I that's great. It's it's really good.

281
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Yeah. Every all the ricks getting shot, the brutal and more ricks and Morty's getting killed left

282
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,760
and right. And again, it's all like a pre-established background character. So like you care a little

283
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,960
like rest in peace, hammer Morty, rest in peace, hammer Morty is just some weird background like

284
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,680
gag like what if one of the Morty's is a hammer. And this one, we see the Rick wielding the hammer

285
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,360
Morty like beating people to death with it. And then it gets shot like so it serves it's one other

286
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,880
purpose it could have. It has two purposes, one to be a random background gag to die used as a

287
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,280
Shekhov's gun and then to just get killed. It's like perfect. That's all we needed from him.

288
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,640
He never has to show up again. Doesn't have to be like once per season. Oh, here's hammer Morty.

289
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,760
Yeah, like don't don't you don't want to be pulling like a an adventure time style party

290
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,520
God and like try to make this ridiculous character that should show up exactly once

291
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,000
into like a regular character. Yeah, that's the mistake. And they don't do that here. Thank God.

292
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,480
How about that Sejuan sauce? How about well, how about the whole memory sequence where I mean,

293
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,880
I had to watch this twice to really understand what was going on. So he does this whole thing

294
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
where so he's been captured and they're trying to extract memories from it. And he's got this like

295
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,040
so Rick immediately figures this out and the way he plays them and you know, they do the fake out

296
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,400
where like they're exploring his memories. They're like, Hey, you better go to the place

297
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,240
where you invented your interdimensional travel gun. And so that he thinks they think that he's

298
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,240
leading them to that. And we see in the midst of that we see like his wife the mysteriously absent

299
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,360
wife mother of of Beth character that everyone's been wondering about. And then like it plays you

300
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
the whole way. And then when you get to the end, both the like the way that he came up with the

301
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,240
portal, the interdimensional portal gun and the mother character were both fictional. They were

302
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,640
not real. So they got played and we got played at the same time. I mean, I was suspicious of that

303
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,040
memory because it seemed way too straight like straightforward, right? Yeah, wife and daughter

304
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,320
died. And also why would Beth have gotten blown up? Well, interdimensional, you know, went to

305
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,480
another one, I guess. Yeah. I mean, that was as soon as that happened, I was like, Well, what the

306
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,280
hell? That's not the real story because Beth can't be dead unless he was going to rebuild her. But

307
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,360
like, I mean, we've already seen Rick abandon one Beth and just get a new one. That's true. You

308
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,760
know, we've seen that in the show. Yeah. Incidentally, they we get to see the new the world, the Cronenberg

309
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,080
world that was abandoned, which was great. I love that. The Cronenberg world comes back. And once

310
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,880
again, we bring back the Cronenberg world. It's a great reference to an old joke. Immediately all

311
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,760
three of them get frozen, probably dead. So we don't have to go back there again. Yeah, I am

312
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,600
content to know like, it's good to know what these characters are doing because they were these were

313
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,560
the characters that we grew up with through all season one. And yeah, to see to just see them,

314
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,640
they're doing fine. They're doing fine. Don't worry about it. It makes me happy now. I bet they'll

315
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,880
be okay. I know that actually freezing did like totally will actually kill you, but it's magic

316
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,600
space gun. So in the first episode, someone got frozen and immediately fell and broke to pieces.

317
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,840
They didn't fall and break to pieces. So maybe they're okay. Yeah, by the way, can we talk about

318
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,640
how how great and like, so the thing that we're wondering is so Rick's got his plan, but what

319
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,040
are like Morty and Summer going to do? I mean, I personally was wondering like, what agency

320
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,840
can like Morty and Summer do to like get involved in the plot again? And the idea of digging up the

321
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,120
dead Rick and finding his portal gun that gives them an end back into like actually doing something

322
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,840
relevant in the story, just a really good use of these like dead bodies in the background in the

323
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,040
backyard, really, really good stuff. Yeah, the portal got smashed so they can't use it anymore.

324
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,960
Well, but but that was great because you know that it was a great way to give you something to do.

325
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,480
Yeah. Yeah. I think I really want us to like, I think the number one promise this show made in

326
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,680
season one that hasn't been delivered on is the evil Morty and this, this general idea that I

327
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,560
think our Morty is special, you know, and like Rick says so in that episode as kind of like a

328
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,880
haha, we're buddies kind of thing. Yeah, like as the show goes on, we more and more see how

329
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,680
our Morty is like growing ever more cynical and more understanding like how he literally tried

330
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,400
to kill Rick this episode. He did his best to murder Rick. But like, you know, other Mortys are

331
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,800
presented as like significantly more retarded. Yeah, that's true. Even when we were first introduced

332
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,960
to there being more than Morty, it's like ours is supposedly the good Morty, the one that's like

333
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,040
they tell of in legends, you know. True, true. And in this episode, he himself is like, oh,

334
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,080
my lawyer is a fucking Morty. Like, obviously, this is unfair. So like even though our Morty is

335
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,680
still like an idiot in some ways, like he's definitely smarter than he's supposed to be.

336
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,680
He's developed a lot as a person and character. And while it's mostly made him into like a

337
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,400
cynical asshole, he still cares about summer, though, you know, he's he's become cynical

338
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,760
and the way that he tries to pretend that he doesn't care about Rick anymore, specifically

339
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,360
to protect summer show some real maturity and development. And I'm interested to know if we're

340
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,000
going to get like, if Morty is going to become, you know, more of a hero or if he's going to

341
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,680
keep growing as like a, you know, I kind of want to see him get out of this phase he's in of like

342
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,280
really like depressed kind of, you know, like he's really upset with like, like what's going on

343
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,200
with Rick and everything. Like it's kind of breaking him down to see this nihilist. Well,

344
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,960
ending the episode the way Rick chose to is not good for that for healing his mental faculties

345
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,640
at all. I'm just wondering if we'll see Morty evolve more or if he'll if we'll bring back the

346
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,880
evil Morty finally like that's gotta happen. That's the number one thing we all want to see.

347
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,040
Everything else has been brought back. That's right. The show has never like had a promise

348
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,280
that it didn't deliver on right. So that has to appear at some point, you know,

349
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,840
they've got to be these guys are way too smart to not do that. There must have been a plan for it

350
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,360
in the in the cards. Maybe they just haven't figured out how to work it in yet. You know,

351
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,320
the only danger is once that happens, like I'll still love the show. But I'll I always want

352
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,720
something to look forward to, you know, they got to give me something to establish more

353
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,600
shit. Now, you know, there's definitively this feeling of like putting a lot of stuff behind

354
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,480
us and being like, OK, we're tying up all these loose ends so we can introduce new shit. Yeah.

355
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,800
But there's still some loose ends like, you know, Evil Morty and stuff like that. But yeah, tying

356
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,120
up the whole Beth and Jerry thing is I'm so glad. I was just like, oh, thank you. Yeah. I'm glad they

357
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,040
did it like in kind of a glib way where they were like, look, we know you get it already. Like

358
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,360
they've we've already seen like if they made a whole episode about them like finally getting

359
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,440
divorced, it's like we've been boring as shit. Yeah, like we've already seen that character

360
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,440
arc happen. You know what? This this is not do it flip. And the way they did it quickly was

361
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,960
really good because it actually made me like Jerry. This is probably the most I've ever liked

362
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,200
Jerry. He's just like, you know what? This is it. I'm actually taking action in my life. I'm

363
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,920
saying it's me or him right now, which is entirely appropriate to do because Rick is a fucking monster

364
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,200
more or less. And yeah, just really the right way to do it. Yeah. Um, what else happened in this

365
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,880
episode? Why don't we talk a little bit about the sage one sauce? Because that is relevant.

366
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,920
That's important, I think. And the discussion that's gone on around it is is, you know, we did

367
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,360
a little research. I really feel like it's worth talking about. Nate was telling me that, um,

368
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,560
the Shazwan sauce that they bring up in the episode. It's a meme. Yeah. Yeah. I guess there was like a

369
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,120
campaign because they're making they're remaking Mulan. Are they really? That's why it was a

370
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,840
campaign is that there's a Mulan remake. And so people were saying bring back the Shazwan sauce

371
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,440
for the Mulan remake. Wait, I think you're confused because that's what it said on that

372
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,960
article we were reading. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I mean, I know there is a Mulan remake

373
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,640
coming. So like they were saying, Hey, Rick and Morty talked about how great the Shazwan sauce

374
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,800
was for the fucking 90s. Bring it back. It's perfect timing, I guess. Yeah. And then we read

375
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
an article about how it wasn't coming back and that there were people who are arguing that it

376
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,760
was a problematic sauce. Yeah. It was a problematic sauce. It was a cultural appropriation of Chinese

377
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,600
culture because of the Shazwan. Okay. First of all, do you people even fucking understand what

378
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,120
America is? America is a place where you bring stuff and you make it appeal to people and they

379
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,800
buy it because they like it. It is inherent to the foundation of the nation that we combine

380
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,680
things. If you think that it is a wrong thing to do, okay, first of all, there's a couple things

381
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,280
we were thinking about might be the actual argument here. If you think that it is wrong

382
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,920
for other cultures to like eat the foods that you invented in your culture, first of all,

383
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,040
you are 100% wrong. I don't respect your opinion. Go away. If your argument is that it is somehow

384
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,120
like it's like evil to misrepresent a culture by like having something like a McDonald's dipping

385
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,320
sauce that is supposed to be like a quote unquote Chinese sauce, but it like isn't spicy enough.

386
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,240
It isn't like real Chinese. I would say I still that is that is fundamentally flawed because

387
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,800
it is on the individual to realize that, okay, this doesn't actually represent China.

388
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,360
This is a fucking sauce that McDonald's is selling to represent like a movie that we're

389
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,440
making in America. It's not fucking China. So what is the actual arguments that there's something

390
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,000
like harmful about this sauce? I do not fundamentally understand this idea of cultural appropriation

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,400
being bad in this context. Do you have anything to add to this point, did you?

392
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,560
It's fucking McDonald's. I know.

393
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,520
I because I really hilarious to me. I don't want to fuck around on this issue. I want to

394
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,280
actually address people's real concerns and respond. I like, I mean, this is this is what it

395
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,360
always is. Yeah, it's always it's it's just that it's so unimportant. Yeah, who the fuck cares?

396
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,200
It's like what what Chinese person is like upset that their culture is being besmirched by a

397
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,360
McDonald's dipping sauce. McDonald's itself is an affront to all life and culture as it is.

398
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,400
Yeah, like the entire existence of McDonald's is an evil skirmish. American American like

399
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,560
burger culture is like poorly represented by McDonald's to begin with. So really,

400
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,840
we should be more insulted than anyone. Exactly. Like it's just literally who gives a fuck. Just

401
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,400
give me the fucking Shezwan sauce. It's fucking hilarious. Stop being a fucking show. Jesus Christ.

402
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,920
And you know what? We might be making a mountain out of a molehill here because we only read like

403
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,520
one or two articles. But the fact that there's any discussion like just the fact that I typed in

404
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,040
Shezwan sauce Rick and Morty and the first the first article was sorry, Rick and Morty fans,

405
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,320
but the problematic Shezwan sauce isn't coming back and I immediately burst out laughing when I

406
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,800
read that headline. Fuck you guys. Fuck you guys. I don't give a shit. I don't know how we got onto

407
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,360
that from a Rick and Morty discussion, but it's funny. They made it about that, dude. The people

408
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,320
out there made it about that. Bring it back. And I love that that like, you know, that Rick

409
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,480
went out of his way to do that in his memory because of course that's something he'd care about.

410
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,040
That's that's what I love. They make that kind of like super obscure cultural reference.

411
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,520
I totally get it. Like they make it out like, oh, haha, it's Rick being silly. But I'm like,

412
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,880
nah, man, like I would pretzel pub chicken sandwich from Wendy's. If I had for some reason, I was

413
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,160
going through like memories of 2009. I'm getting a fucking pretzel pub chicken. There's there's like

414
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,960
some mushroom burger at Wendy's every once in a while that I always am on the lookout for and

415
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,960
is gone most of the time. Cheddar and mushroom. Yeah, like mushroom cheddar burger or something.

416
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,000
I want that. That's see, that's my one dipping sauce right after the pretzel pub chicken,

417
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,160
they brought in that sandwich was also great. Yeah. And then they they kept they kept they

418
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,280
had like a revolving door of sandwiches ever diminishing in quality.

419
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,160
Well, the point of it is that's hilarious. And you know, it's a fucking joke. I don't understand

420
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,880
why anyone would even be mad about in the slightest. So let's let's all suck it up. I mean,

421
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,160
if you're gonna be mad about the sauce, just be mad about the Mulan movie in the first place,

422
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,520
which I know, I think they would be, I'm sure they would be, they'd make the same argument that

423
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,520
no, it's watering down our culture. And you know, the thing about that is almost every time one of

424
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,280
those things happens, the actual culture loves it. Yeah, like most of them are like really happy

425
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,000
that their culture is being represented at all. Do actual Chinese people get really mad that

426
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,240
like Mulan exists and is like, Oh, this is a shitty Americanized version of our culture.

427
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,040
Like they got things to do. Yeah, I don't want to speak for them. But I don't think they would

428
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,760
consider it a big fucking deal. I've seen it all the time. Yeah, like Japan, for instance,

429
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,080
where like, they get really excited to even have reference to Japan in an American film, you know.

430
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,520
And they they appropriate Americans and Japanese films are the most fucking

431
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,200
flanderized, like misrepresented. We're literally all blonde cowboys who scream,

432
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,280
fuck and shoot guns. Yeah, every American character in Japan. So like, you know,

433
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,040
oh, but you know, but racism is prejudice plus power. That's the issue. That's the fundamental

434
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,360
disagreements that we have here. Anyway, anything else about this Rick and Morty episode? Well,

435
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,120
there's that little teaser at the end with bird persons back, you know, that's that's a little

436
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,320
something. I don't know how I feel about that. I know what you mean. It's a little bit disappointing.

437
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,080
Kind of liked that bird person was gone. Like I like bringing back Tammy as like an evil. Yeah,

438
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,200
she's alive and relevant. Yeah, like she I mean, she's kind of like an archvillain now. She's kind

439
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,800
of like the big bad. She's she's the one who initiated all of this. Yep. And, you know, I don't

440
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,120
know what she's working for now that the world government's gone. Shit. And can we just reflect

441
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,640
on I believe the first word we ever heard Tammy say was wasn't she said like, Yeah, I love Bukake

442
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,760
really into Bukake. And she is our main villain. Yeah, love it. Love it. And she's great. She's hot.

443
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,640
She fucks. She fucks. She fucks birds. Yeah, it's a little bit. It's a little bit disappointing

444
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,400
that they're kind of going back on that and just reviving him like that. But I mean, he's evil

445
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,400
now. And I mean, they might make it like, I don't know, it kind of reminds me of like when a chef

446
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,760
died in South Park, and they brought him back as like Darth chef, but just for like a second,

447
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:59,200
you know, I don't know what they're going to do with this Darth bird person. Yeah, yeah,

448
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,360
like we'll say seeing it and especially like just doing it as like a really tired reference to

449
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,720
Star Wars was like, Oh, I don't know, man. Like, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I don't know. He looks kind

450
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,680
of Borg ish too. Yeah. Yeah. Cyborg, dude. I will say hopefully it'll be good. Yeah, I'm not that

451
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,560
worried. These guys are good writers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. There has not been a bad

452
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,040
episode of Rick and Morty. Agreed. There's been a couple. Yeah. Yeah, there were there's a couple

453
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,960
like that night chameleons and raising gizorp is or are probably the two worst episodes. And those

454
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,080
are pretty fun. Agreed. I mean, fucking, I don't know. Chameleons has the the fucking. Yes. Wait,

455
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,160
which one's that again? Yes, the one where Jerry gets trapped in a simulation. Oh, yeah,

456
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,160
recognized that it's a simulation. My man. Just his favorite line. My man. Yeah, like that even

457
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,040
like half of that episode is amazing. Yeah, still the worst episode of the show. It's hard to fault

458
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,920
this hard to fault Rick and Morty. Yep. So yeah, we'll definitely be looking forward to the rest

459
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,160
of season three. No doubt. I got to rewatch season two soon because I still have like the first

460
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,720
three episodes because they were leaked, I watched them like over and over and over again. Yeah. And

461
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,160
the rest of them I watched on TV and never saw again. So like got to get got to get my season

462
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,880
two knowledge up to snuff so I know all the background characters and lore references

463
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,560
where you know that I could look out for when season three gets underway because I'm sure

464
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,960
I'm sure any surviving character we're going to see again. No doubt. That's very much a Dan

465
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,600
Harmon thing. You haven't seen any of community. Have you? I watched all season one. Oh, yeah.

466
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,400
Yeah, I didn't watch beyond that because I got bored. It definitely gets better in season two.

467
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,760
I like season one quite a bit. All right, that's cool. But yeah. I mean, a lot of the arc structure

468
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,760
of Rick and Morty, the meta-ness, all of that is extremely like community. Yeah. Yeah. And obviously

469
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,240
they can do even more on this show because it's fucking you can do literally anything. Yep. And

470
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,400
it's always willing to just... What I love about Rick and Morty is that it's not even that it's

471
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,720
pushing the boundaries, it's that it's just past all of them. Like it represents that we're kind

472
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,520
of in an era where you can literally do anything. Yeah. You can go as violent as you want. You can

473
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,800
say whatever words you want. You can fucking present the most insane concepts you've ever

474
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,720
heard of at the drop of a hat and just keep going. There's no like hand-holding. You know,

475
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,320
and I mean, you could argue that the daily life scenes are like to give retarded audiences like

476
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,960
something to cling to. But even then, I just feel like this show can do literally anything. And

477
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,360
it's like where is the line anymore? Like what's holding it back other than it has to be 22 minutes

478
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,840
long? Yeah. That's like the only real thing. And I really do trust these writers to whatever

479
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,240
they choose to talk about. They will do it in a hilarious, intelligent, and like well-thought-out

480
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,400
way that fits cohesively into the overall structure of the show. So just one of the best fucking shows

481
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,960
I've ever seen and definitely airing right now. Yeah. Absolutely fantastic. Cannot wait for more.

482
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,800
Please give us news about when it's coming out, people. All right, y'all. Join us next time

483
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,360
whenever that is. Whenever it is. Yeah. I mean, maybe we could like try to maybe do some back

484
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,920
episodes while we're, you know, if we want to make this like a weekly show. Yeah. Yeah. Leading

485
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,960
up to whenever the hell the actual show starts. It gets a good 24 weeks if we want to do it also.

486
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,720
Yeah. So yeah, I mean, we don't have to do every episode. We can just do the highlights.

487
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm down. All right, everybody. See you then. Goodbye, moon man. Goodbye, moon man.
