00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,000
the best guy ever, et cetera, et cetera. We got Gibbontake over there.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,120
Hey guys, go to Gibbontake.site to read the Lord of Ghosts comic. It's good and you should

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,320
like it and you should read it. Yeah, it's good. It is good. I'm all proud of it.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,800
I am its biggest fan. I am the most known best ghost of the Lord of Ghosts comic. That's

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,960
its defining characteristic. We've also got a creator of new video game, Tom.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,160
Yo, go to tomolver.itch.io slash ninja suffering to play ninja suffering.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,080
Indeed. But can someone acquiring all those big juicy boigas really be said to be suffering?

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,120
These are the questions of our time. I don't know. You eventually die, so.

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,400
I guess that's true. Just like real life. Indeed.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,360
Speaking of dying, Endless Jess, good to see you buddy.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,720
Hey guys, I'm here this week, so that means we get to talk about the Final Fantasy 7.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,480
All right. All right. I'm opening up another tab. I'm going to start up an audiobook or

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,160
something. It's it's funny. You guys say that somebody messaged me on Discord yesterday and was

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,440
like, you know, I just want to tell you the last like four episodes of PCP have sucked.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,000
I hate to talk about Final Fantasy 7. Funny. I feel the exact same way.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,640
If we can certainly talk about that. I'm bored. I never want to talk about it again.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
What do you know? Talk about Ninja Suffering, the better video game.

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Sure. Sure. Hey, here's the thing, Tom.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,760
And me and me, Ben Saint, patreon.com slash Ben Saint. I'm the last one.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,360
Okay. Right. Yeah. I won't even like watch videos about it anymore. Like I see

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,480
like guys who like normal under normal circumstances. I'd be like, hey, that guy did a review,

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,960
but now it's like, no, no more. I'm done. Everyone's talked about it. No, I've talked about it.

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,760
No more. No more truly exhausted by the discussion. However, unfortunately for me,

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,240
I am in the middle of my own labor by Sisyphean task to articulate my full thoughts. Right.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,520
It is a struggle of the critics. I have been thinking very strongly about undertaking

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
a similar labor. However, because I have other things on my plate at the moment,

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
sure. I've put it to the side and also I'm thinking maybe that's better because then

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
if and when I ever actually do it enough time will have passed that the market will not be

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,600
as flooded. Yeah, that's true. That's that would be a good thing. I think people are waiting a

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,000
little bit for like, I don't know, whenever like a new video game comes out and I find it interesting

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,640
and people talk about it, there at some point there comes a time when the definitive video has

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,600
been published by someone like a, I don't know, like a Matthew Matosis review of Dark Souls 2.

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
That's also my fear is that the longer I wait, the more chance there's going to be for like a

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
nine hour Matthew Matosis come out and fucking I give up forever.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,080
Matthew Matosis would stoop so low as to play Final Fantasy 7.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,320
I certainly hope not. He's smarter than that. Hey, you know, I did beat the true Super Boss the

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,080
other day. And so I finally, I did that thing. It was kind of fun. Kind of fun. Okay. Well,

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
that's interesting. Right. Well, wait, wait, I've got a breaking breaking news. I have just a piece

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
of breaking news. We don't have to discuss long, but it's that so right as I was doing the voicemails

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,160
before we started this very episode of the PCP, it appears there was a shooting in front of the

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,560
apartment building next to my house. I heard a loud rat, tat, tat, tat. And as I do, I'm just like,

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,840
Oh, I assume that's just bangs and pops as I hear in my neighborhood. I always think it sounds like

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,800
a gunshot, but I never really know. I thought I thought shootings didn't happen anymore. It's

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,440
It's only coronavirus news now.

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,320
Maybe they shot coronavirus bots.

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,720
That's what the news is telling me.

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
All the things that we thought were problems

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,560
are no longer problems.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,360
This is the real problem, guys.

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
We're serious this time.

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,600
This is clearly a case of cabin fever.

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,760
They're going haywire.

54
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,080
I have no idea what happened.

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
I did run over to the building after a while.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
There were a bunch of cop cars.

57
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
There's like 10 cops, I don't know,

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,800
like six, seven cops swirling around.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
I have no idea what's going on.

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,920
I looked for people who are dead.

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,120
I did not see anything.

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
I didn't see any ambulances or anything.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,680
But that did happen.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,760
And good ol' Sensi.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,040
I love living in the ghetto.

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
It's great.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,800
It's great.

68
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
That's all.

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,320
Okay, well, moving on from video game talk

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
to real video game talk.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,880
Real video game talk.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,160
Tom, Izumi the burger eater.

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
I played it a bunch of times,

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,000
but sometimes burgers don't appear

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,680
and I run out of stamina and that feels unfair.

76
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,720
How does the burger algorithm work?

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,560
How do you decide when and where they appear?

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,160
That's probably the biggest problem with the game right now

79
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,520
is just that they spawn every five to eight seconds

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,160
at a random Y location.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,240
So the platforms and the burgers use two separate,

82
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,480
I guess, equations, but they're like baby equations.

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,680
I don't know how to do math.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,560
And they just spawn in different locations.

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,960
And so the way the game works right now

86
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,080
is that it's just the same three platforms

87
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,280
over and over again.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,040
Just when they get to the other side of the screen,

89
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,320
they just instantly teleport back to the other side

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,880
at a random Y value.

91
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,000
So it kind of gives the illusion that you're moving somewhere,

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
but you're actually just staying still

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
and things are scrolling.

94
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,320
So then there's a separate piece of code

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,480
that controls the burger spawns.

96
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,160
I was considering for a while to possibly make it more

97
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,000
like Dark Souls and have burgers be something

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,880
that you start with three of them

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,240
and you can just use them whenever, kind of like S this.

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,320
But I wanted to very much have it be a one button game

101
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,360
that you could play on anything.

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
And I couldn't think of a good way

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,920
of integrating something like that

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,400
without having to put another button or something.

105
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,040
So I kind of just said, I guess we'll leave the thing as is.

106
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,600
And if anybody like Gib asks me why the burger spawns,

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,440
so shit, I'd be like,

108
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,880
well the game's called Ninja's Soffering,

109
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,320
it's all about the inevitability

110
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,440
of like life first purpose proposal.

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Yeah, but it's like, I play the game and I'm like,

112
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,720
I hear Jack's blade has like a billion points

113
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,160
and I'm like, okay, let's see if I can get a billion points.

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
And it just seems like luck.

115
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,080
It seems like luck if you get the right burger spawns.

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,880
There is some R and G.

117
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,680
Well, sorry, my high score was like 500, 600.

118
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,040
So I'm feeling pretty good about that.

119
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,280
Is your complaint Gib that the burgers just spawn

120
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,240
in almost impossible to reach spots

121
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,080
or that they simply don't appear at all?

122
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,680
No, not necessarily impossible to reach,

123
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,200
although that sometimes is a problem.

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,320
It just sort of feels like I can go for too long

125
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,720
without seeing a burger and like I'm playing perfectly well.

126
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm like jumping, not losing that much stamina,

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
but I just don't get a burger in time before I die.

128
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
And I'm like, yeah.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
But you said Tom, they appear every what,

130
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
five to eight seconds?

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
Is that still true?

132
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,040
Or is it just like you're getting a lot of eight second ones

133
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
and it's just fucking over?

134
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Yeah, maybe, maybe I'm getting a lot of eight seconds.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
I think the thing is, from what I understand,

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,440
like the reason it feels like it takes so much longer

137
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,080
is that every 100 points, the game speeds up.

138
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,920
So once you get to like five or 600 points,

139
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,280
you're doing way more jumps

140
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,920
because the game's moving faster

141
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
in those five to eight seconds.

142
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,760
So the longer you go, the less, the same amount of time,

143
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
like physical time is passing,

144
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
but you're doing a lot more platforming

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,520
because everything's moving at a higher speed.

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,640
That makes sense.

147
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,760
Yeah, it's more of the story is get good.

148
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,840
It is like Dark Souls.

149
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
No.

150
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
No RNG in it.

151
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,600
It's all about your own reaction time.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,080
Like it, it's, there's no like, oh.

153
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, there's some RNG.

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,400
Will that guy's weapon clip through the wall

155
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,960
that yours bounces off of

156
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
when you're trying to dodge out of a room?

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,040
It's up to chance.

158
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,400
You just have to know which enemies have Vorpal weapons,

159
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,240
which is all of them.

160
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Yeah.

161
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,920
You don't ever.

162
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Yeah, I love them.

163
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,960
Remember Vorpal weapons guys?

164
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,800
I do.

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Fucking sick.

166
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,480
What did they do?

167
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
It's like sometimes you press the S.

168
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,600
They instantly cut off your head if you crit.

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,440
They were the best.

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,320
Wait, in Dark Souls?

171
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,400
No, Dungeons and Dragons.

172
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Dungeons and Dragons.

173
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,760
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

174
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,600
Right.

175
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
Vorpal weapons are stupid, by the way.

176
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,280
I fucking hate them.

177
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,040
Dungeons and Bunions.

178
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
I just started playing D&D again.

179
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh, hell yeah.

180
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
I got roped into it.

181
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,840
I am a frog.

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
Dope.

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,080
That's it?

184
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Like, like.

185
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,440
Dude, it's sick.

186
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,120
I'm a little dark frog, man.

187
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Dude, frog heck of standing habitant?

188
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800
Fuck yeah.

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

190
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
He's a brewer.

191
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
He was like a folk hero.

192
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,160
He was like a folk hero from his hometown of the pond, right?

193
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,640
Like, it's all about the pond,

194
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,920
but he's like the town hero

195
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,000
because he led a water strike, right?

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,480
He led basically a hunger strike, but for water,

197
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,360
he led a hunger strike, a water strike to protest imperialism,

198
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,800
but from the dry folk.

199
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,160
And now he's their fucking champion

200
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,920
of their shitty little pond with like a hundred people in it.

201
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,480
But he's the coolest one of those like

202
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
shitty little hundred people.

203
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
And now he's finds himself whisked away

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,280
to this fucking magic cave that he can't get out of

205
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,080
and it's a struggle because he needs water.

206
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,040
And if he doesn't bathe in water for one hour a day

207
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,960
for six days, he'll die.

208
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,000
So the first game, which is all about like finding a wizard

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,760
and being like, how much will can I pay you

210
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,720
to please just make me a tub of water?

211
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
Please conjure a tub of water for me so I can live.

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
And it worked.

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Worked like a charm.

214
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,600
If he was stuck in a desert, would he, A,

215
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,920
and he had to acquire water and there wasn't any around,

216
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,480
would he either try to find an enemy

217
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
and bleed them and use their blood

218
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,040
or would he try to hurt their feelings

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,160
and collect their tears

220
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,040
as that is a superior water source?

221
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,720
Probably blood, but the thing is he can't,

222
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
he doesn't, just drinking, it's not enough.

223
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
He has to bathe in it.

224
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,720
Okay, so we need to kill a lot of people.

225
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,920
He needs to really get ambitious.

226
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,800
No, he needs to manipulate, like upset a lot of people.

227
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,040
He needs to troll a lot of people, make them cry.

228
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,840
A true Pakistani note.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,280
He's like frog Jesus, basically.

230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,320
He is a God among frogs.

231
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,200
Someone was asking him about,

232
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
tell us about the history of your world

233
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,240
and the DM was like, just improv it.

234
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,840
And I was like, well, everyone knows

235
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,720
that the world started 60 years ago with the great flood

236
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,640
that created the entire pond.

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
What else was there before the pond?

238
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Doesn't matter, it's not important.

239
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,520
I was thinking today,

240
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,240
I've had sort of weird annoying mind fog.

241
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
I was just like pacing around my room just thinking,

242
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,960
but like nothing was, like neurons were like trying to fire,

243
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
but there was no, nothing in the chamber.

244
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,240
I was trying to think of world building and characters,

245
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,320
but I was only just thinking of those words.

246
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,720
I wasn't actually doing anything creative.

247
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,400
World building and characters.

248
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,360
I was imagining, like thinking of stock footage

249
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,320
of people writing on laptops

250
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
and like people sitting down at desks to write.

251
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
And I'm like, that's me right now, but I'm not doing it.

252
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,680
And I don't know what's going wrong with my brain.

253
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,360
I think I might have dementia.

254
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,920
I think I might be going to die soon.

255
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,000
I just wanted to think of something creative.

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
It was really annoying.

257
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,520
I couldn't think of anything.

258
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,080
You just have to think creatively.

259
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
Oh, sorry.

260
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,080
I also experienced constant brain fog.

261
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,160
I have a D&D story to go with Ben's.

262
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,360
Yeah. Oh, fuck.

263
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,000
It's like this one time, a couple of years ago,

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,640
I started playing D&D with like a group of people that I know.

265
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,120
Because I had never done it before.

266
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,440
And I was like, this will be cool.

267
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,840
So I meet this D&D group and like only one of them

268
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
I actually know and the rest are like her friends.

269
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
So we're playing D&D.

270
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,080
It's me and my old secretary, if you remember her.

271
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
Oh, of course.

272
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,280
So we were playing D&D and so I was making my guy

273
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
and I made a guy called Bartholomundus

274
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,160
who is like a dragonborn monk.

275
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,120
But I, so he's like a lizard man.

276
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,600
And I just played him as Donatello.

277
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,080
And I would do the voice for like the whole session.

278
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,320
And it was awesome because like I would take

279
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,920
completely insane risks

280
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,720
and do the most retarded shit imaginable

281
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,640
that was like bound to get the whole party killed.

282
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,360
And it was like really frustrating everyone.

283
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,320
And like one guy in particular was like really mad.

284
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
And he was even more mad because like everything I did,

285
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,640
even though it was like the stupidest possible decision,

286
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,840
I would like roll a 20 every time.

287
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
And like it would work out great.

288
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,920
And this guy, he like thought he was like

289
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,200
the king shit of the D&D group.

290
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,080
He was, and he was like, I'm a bard

291
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,000
cause I'm a ladies man.

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I seduce all the women cause I'm a real charming.

293
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,720
And you could tell this man was not a ladies man in real life.

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,560
Of course.

295
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,720
He was like the stereotypical D&D player.

296
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Like all the things that could be wrong with a human male.

297
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,680
At once.

298
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,720
But he, for...

299
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,240
Such as being a woman, for instance.

300
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,400
But for the purposes of the game, he wanted to be a bard.

301
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,920
And he was like really like,

302
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
he was really like playing it up.

303
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
Like he had a voice too.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
And he was like in character the whole time.

305
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,440
And he was like trying to like swagger and be confident.

306
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
And all right.

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
So he's the bard.

308
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,880
And he's like trying to seduce all the characters.

309
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,960
Was Donatello doing the rapey stuff?

310
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Alongside that?

311
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
No, I wasn't doing rapey stuff.

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,160
Donatello was a rapist.

313
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
Bartholomundus is not.

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,760
That is the one key difference between these two characters.

315
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,600
I see.

316
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,720
Yeah.

317
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
He was just like,

318
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,680
he was so like,

319
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
this is like I'm gonna be the coolest guy in the D&D party.

320
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
But like I became like really popular in this group.

321
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,960
Like by the end of the first night,

322
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,880
everyone loved me because I was fucking funny

323
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
and I was doing stupid Donatello shit.

324
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,240
And like all my dumb plans were working out successfully.

325
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,920
And he was over here like trying to be a bard

326
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,080
and seduce people.

327
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,840
And like all of his like cool ideas just didn't matter

328
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
compared to my complete retardation.

329
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,960
And he was getting more and more frustrated.

330
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
And that's the story.

331
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,160
It just, I ruined his entire D&D experience,

332
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,640
but I had a great experience.

333
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,600
The struggle between like the D&D veteran

334
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,880
who's really interested in like playing their character

335
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,960
seriously and immersing in the lore versus just,

336
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,800
I guess it would be the Chad doesn't give a fuck

337
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,080
about the setting or characters or anything.

338
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,480
Like I would be,

339
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,400
I feel bad except that I don't

340
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,040
cause he was a fucking jerk.

341
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,080
And he was like really smug and elitist about everything.

342
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,680
And I enjoyed ruining his time with my antics.

343
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,520
I understand that.

344
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,360
It's just that I've been that guy too many times

345
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,760
and it feels bad to reflect on how everyone hates you.

346
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,240
Okay, actually it was only one time

347
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,960
when I D&D'd in college.

348
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,760
I know I've talked about this like years ago,

349
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,720
but I made my one campaign and I planned like,

350
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,560
you know as I do,

351
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,320
I planned like every detail of the entire setting

352
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,680
and it was about like two brothers or something,

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,160
one of which like was involved

354
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,960
in like a demon summoning plant

355
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,080
or demon summoning fucking ritual or whatever

356
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,800
to like gain power over his brother

357
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,280
who he was like rivals with or whatever.

358
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,120
Like I don't know,

359
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
fucking Saban and Edgar from Final Fantasy VI,

360
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,280
but I don't know evil and dark or whatever.

361
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,080
And so I like sprinkled clues throughout,

362
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,920
like, whoa, there's like a corpse of a demon here.

363
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,760
That shouldn't be here.

364
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
Like some Dark Souls world building in my head.

365
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,080
And I mean, I don't know,

366
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,640
it went along fine until at the very end I had laid,

367
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,280
ooh, in my master plan,

368
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,160
I had laid all these hints that like,

369
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,600
while of course you could go for the bad ending

370
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
and kill the demonic brother,

371
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,960
I in my infinite wisdom as DM had sprinkled

372
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,640
tons of details throughout that he was actually savable.

373
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,600
If only you would try to negotiate with him.

374
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
He would renege on his good ways

375
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
and you could get the true good ending.

376
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,960
But then my fat friend Mike was just like,

377
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,760
fuck that shit dude.

378
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,560
And he fucking snapped his neck

379
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,400
and the worst part was that I got visibly mad.

380
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,640
And I said, well, you killed the Lord,

381
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,440
you get nothing, you get no rewards,

382
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,920
you leave the castle, you leave the kingdom,

383
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,360
you get nothing for this.

384
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,920
You ruined the good time,

385
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
you ruined my master fleet constructed core.

386
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Yeah, that was odd.

387
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,200
Why would you do that, Mike?

388
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
This guy was so mad that he couldn't have his little

389
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,720
like alpha male fantasy of like being the Bard character

390
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,440
because I was too busy making the game fun.

391
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,000
And like, he was the only one who was mad.

392
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,160
Like he was just sitting there like stewing over it,

393
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,560
like for like four nights in a row,

394
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,680
he would stew it every time I did anything.

395
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,040
And everyone else was like laughing and having a good time.

396
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,080
And like, it's not like I was being like

397
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
deliberately disrespectful to the lore

398
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,000
or the story or the game or whatever.

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,560
I was just like, well,

400
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,760
and like, it wasn't even my fault that the character

401
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,840
ended up like a weird Donatello type

402
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
because I just, I'm like, okay, I'll make a lizard man

403
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,700
because lizard men are cool.

404
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,720
And this is his name.

405
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,760
And like, as I started playing like,

406
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,520
I just like, it's just my sense of humor

407
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,960
and I was just making people laugh.

408
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
And like, it started out,

409
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,440
he was just getting mad at me just for being funny.

410
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,760
And so the more mad at me he got,

411
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,120
the more funny I got.

412
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,480
And so he kind of created his own monster

413
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,040
because the more funny I got, the more powerful I got,

414
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,200
and the more stupid my character became

415
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,320
in response to his visible frustration.

416
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,000
And so he did it to himself.

417
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,560
And eventually it just, I don't know,

418
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
I thought it turned out great.

419
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,480
Like I had a great time.

420
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,120
I had a great first D&D experience.

421
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,440
The point of D&D is to have fun at the end of the day.

422
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
I made friends who I never spoke to

423
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,960
or cared about seeing again, but friends nonetheless.

424
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
Indeed.

425
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,640
Which are the best kind of friends you can have.

426
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
So there you go.

427
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,400
The moral of the story, kids is just be cool.

428
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Which you can do by going to teespring.com

429
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,520
slash whatever it is by the just being cool T-shirt.

430
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,240
I rolled my character's name randomly.

431
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,640
And by that I mean, I literally rolled like,

432
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,960
I had a consonant dice and a vowel dice

433
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
and I just rolled that shit

434
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,640
and just went with whatever it was.

435
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
And the name that it came up with

436
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,120
was Higgs Ozoks.

437
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,880
And I thought that was pretty fucking based.

438
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,720
Higgs Ozoks the Dry.

439
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,160
Who ironically you said is a brewer?

440
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,000
He is a, yes.

441
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,800
And I was gonna have him be a woodcarver

442
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,360
because I sort of wanted him to be frog Jesus.

443
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
But I was like, it would be ironic if he's,

444
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,640
if he had, because when you're a folk hero,

445
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,360
you gotta have some like humble profession

446
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,560
that you come from.

447
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,880
And one of the options was brewer.

448
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,520
And I was like, that would be pretty funny

449
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,840
if he was the dry, but he made booze.

450
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,520
Okay.

451
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
That's one of the intellectuals in the crowd.

452
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,680
If you really think about it,

454
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,960
you might ascertain some significance,

455
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,240
some juxtaposition of concepts there.

456
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,920
But I doubt it.

457
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,760
Have you ever played D&D?

458
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,320
I know Tom has, I think we played together once.

459
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,520
Oh no, we just did more games.

460
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,240
I never did a D&D that had stats.

461
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,800
I did that one campaign with Munchy

462
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
and a bunch of other people

463
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,360
that didn't really go very far,

464
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
where I was playing,

465
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,720
we were playing in like a Scandinavian like fantasy land.

466
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,600
And I was playing like a crippled boy

467
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
who had found like a Boston Dynamics robot.

468
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,360
Like ancient technology, Boston Dynamics.

469
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,320
And he had tried, like his quest was to try

470
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,080
and like save it from like shutting down

471
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,560
because it needed batteries.

472
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,600
And they don't know what the fuck batteries are.

473
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,440
And so he, like he has no legs.

474
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,800
And the Boston Dynamic robot is like his legs.

475
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,040
And that was a pretty cool character.

476
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
I really liked that.

477
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,040
But they never really went anywhere.

478
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,240
That we didn't really get to a point

479
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,400
where we were having adventures.

480
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,560
It was just sort of like starting up.

481
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,400
We didn't have stats or anything.

482
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Yeah, the campaigns die in their infancy.

483
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,560
No stats, damn.

484
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,280
What is it without stats?

485
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,120
Nothing.

486
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
I mean, like when you and I did another one.

487
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,960
You just jerk each other off.

488
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,280
It was a Homestuck one.

489
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,560
What was that Homestuck one we did called,

490
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
or was it Luke?

491
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh, Sperb, Sperb.

492
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,520
Sperb, the Homestuck RP.

493
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,120
Have I talked, I'm sure I've talked about that.

494
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Yeah, you talked about it.

495
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,280
That was like no stats.

496
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,600
It was better.

497
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,000
Did a lot of it through texting.

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The thing with the DMing,

499
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
like you were saying, Nate,

500
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,800
like you had you perfectly crafted a story.

501
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,760
It seems like a fool's errand to try and do that.

502
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,600
Cause basically what you're doing.

503
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,680
See, what I was doing was video game design

504
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,640
when I should have been doing like talking

505
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,800
with friends design.

506
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,600
Like you're writing like a story,

507
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,480
but like you're writing a story like in a public place

508
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,040
and people can just come up to your laptop

509
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
and type something in and you have to keep it in.

510
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,680
So you're like, oh God, fine.

511
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,560
Like you're trying to write a novel,

512
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,240
like fucking Game of Thrones man.

513
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,040
Type in his thing and then some jackoff says,

514
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,920
huh, and then they take a shit.

515
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
And he's like, that's stupid.

516
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,080
No, that's not correct.

517
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,520
Your character isn't that doing that now.

518
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
Yeah.

519
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,360
It was a, you know, I mean, it was my first time DMing.

520
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,040
I way over prepared kind of, and I learned it,

521
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,440
but it also kind of soured me.

522
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,760
And I'm like, well, fuck this shit man.

523
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,200
It seems like so much work.

524
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,320
You need to be a real like lover

525
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,680
of seeing people interact in that sort of setting

526
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,400
to get into DMing.

527
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,840
Being a DM is like, it's like a,

528
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,360
it's your new hobby if you do it.

529
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
You can't, you can't just like,

530
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,080
I mean, I guess if you want it,

531
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,320
maybe you could just like show up and just improv it.

532
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,280
Or like, I guess you could buy a pre-prepared campaign,

533
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
to the time that wouldn't work out so well.

534
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
The pre-prepared campaigns are stupid though.

535
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,560
You gotta, you do have to do a lot of improving,

536
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,400
no matter what.

537
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Even if you're good, and even if you prepare shit,

538
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,720
you do have to be able to like adjust your plans

539
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,560
on the fly.

540
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,480
I think we, like we as the PCP could do

541
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,440
like an improv D&D thing.

542
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
Somebody just makes shit up.

543
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,640
Yeah, we were supposed to,

544
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,120
we were supposed to frickin' do it.

545
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,040
We were gonna do that one by Don Jolly, right?

546
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,880
Yeah, we were gonna.

547
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,920
He said that Don Jolly made a game,

548
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
and we were gonna, it was like,

549
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,200
it's called the Gorefest, I think.

550
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,240
Gorefest, yeah.

551
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,880
Yeah, we were gonna play it at Radcon,

552
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,520
and we never got around to it.

553
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,960
That's true, that's true.

554
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,080
We could still do it.

555
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,320
We could still do it any time.

556
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,480
We could just do it in a Skype call,

557
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,840
or a Skype call, wall, discord.

558
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,920
Yeah, imagine.

559
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
The fuck is a Skype?

560
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't know.

561
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,240
Never think about Skype.

562
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Try not to.

563
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,760
I've gotta use Zoom,

564
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
that all the kids are talking about these days,

565
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
for a Mother's Day.

566
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
I think, Mother's Day Zoom call.

567
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,520
The change from Skype to Discord

568
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,560
is the point where reality shifted

569
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,680
into a parallel, worse dimension,

570
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,160
and the point where Discord is now shifting into Zoom

571
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,280
is gonna be an even worse dimension than that.

572
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,640
We have to stop changing these things.

573
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
We have to stop bringing new timelines.

574
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,400
We all need to go back to AOL Instant Messenger.

575
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,120
Yes, that was, because that was when

576
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,640
life was last good.

577
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Oh, good new bed, after all.

578
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,520
I don't know, right?

579
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,960
My biggest memories of AOL Instant Messenger

580
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,320
are being a kid with crushes in high school

581
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,920
and middle school, acting on none of them,

582
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,640
and feeling bad a lot about my inability

583
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
to talk to women.

584
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,040
I didn't have that in AOL.

585
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,320
I had that in MSN.

586
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,160
Yeah.

587
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,520
Was that one removed?

588
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
That was around the same time.

589
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,560
Yeah, similar kind of things.

590
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,880
I had the email address of a girl I liked,

591
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,560
but she wrote it, and I typed it in wrong.

592
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,240
No, I think she wrote it, and I couldn't read

593
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
one of the dashes or an underscore,

594
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,200
and I got it wrong.

595
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,920
And so I emailed her, but I didn't realize

596
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,320
that it was the wrong one.

597
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Did you just assume she hated you or something?

598
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,920
Huh?

599
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Did you assume she was just blowing you off and stuff?

600
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,920
I can certainly see that happening.

601
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
I can't remember what happened.

602
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,680
It wasn't that big of a deal, but it was just very,

603
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,160
oh no, she doesn't give a shit.

604
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,000
I wish you never noticed.

605
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,080
I wish those things never existed,

606
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,000
and that we lived in the Stone Ages or whatever,

607
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,160
because then I never would have had

608
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,560
those late night, extremely embarrassing

609
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,400
like hours and hours long conversations with girls.

610
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,800
I just wanted to say, I am sexually attracted to you.

611
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,720
Please understand that fact.

612
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,360
Ignore all the stupid shit I'm saying.

613
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,560
That is the point of this conversation.

614
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,640
Instead of, you know, just going on and on

615
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,520
about whatever the fuck happened at school that day.

616
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, it's, I did that.

617
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,600
Truly a waste of time.

618
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,000
I mean, I skipped the small talk

619
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,840
and I made an embarrassing comment

620
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,640
that was too sexually charged,

621
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,000
and I think-

622
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,080
What's wrong with that?

623
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
You know what, it's not embarrassing.

624
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
It's better to err on the side of that than-

625
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,040
I agree, I agree.

626
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
You don't want to err on the side of that.

627
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,840
You waste less time that way for sure.

628
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,760
But I feel like I became not like a big rumor,

630
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,880
but like a little bit like a guy.

631
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,280
He cares about sex.

632
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,080
What a degenerate, no one does that.

633
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,920
My biggest fear was that anyone would find out

634
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,360
that I was sexually attracted to anyone.

635
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,320
That was my nightmare scenario.

636
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,080
No one can, to this day, I don't want anyone to know

637
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
that I feel those things.

638
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,560
It would be career ending to say that-

639
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,400
It is, it is, yeah.

640
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
That was pretty shitty.

641
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,840
Yeah, indeed.

642
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
Good times, good times.

643
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,080
Yeah, pretty good.

644
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,440
No one should have that power over you ever.

645
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,280
That's what it truly means to be a man.

646
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,120
That's true.

647
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,400
That's why Migtau is the greatest man on the planet,

648
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
and I aspire to be just like them.

649
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,800
I really was not a fully developed human being

650
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,160
until I went to Japan and became the samurai warrior,

651
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,960
and it felt real good.

652
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,560
Yeah, you became a real man in Japan,

653
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,640
but as soon as you came back,

654
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,880
you reverted- I lost it all, yeah.

655
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,000
You've never been a saint since.

656
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,520
Yeah, that's true, unfortunately.

657
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,280
That's where my heart, what is it, my heart?

658
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,320
What's that fucking line from it in that poem

659
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,160
that the fat kid wrote to the hot girl?

660
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,600
Oh, yeah, mine burns there, too.

661
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,720
My heart burns there, too, or whatever the fuck it is.

662
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,800
Yes, that's me for the land of Nippon,

663
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,280
my Japanese brethren.

664
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,000
You know, me and Michelle have talked about

665
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,280
winding up a trip one of these years,

666
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,600
maybe next year, I don't know, maybe the year afterward,

667
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,920
specifically to go see the Sakura Blooms.

668
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh, and Victor was telling us about his trip

669
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
and giving us some tips about where to go

670
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,680
for reasonably cheap flights,

671
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,600
and it's not even, I don't know,

672
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,360
if you have $3,000 that you're willing

673
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,120
to invest in that kind of a trip,

674
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,240
which you could save up, not too hard for,

675
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,760
yeah, you could make that shit happen.

676
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,280
It doesn't have to be just a dream, ladies and gentlemen.

677
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,240
One of these days, go see the Sakura Blooms.

678
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,160
I have a dream of walking the earth

679
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,200
and being around no one and disappearing,

680
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,520
and the dream kinda, it's hard to rationalize that

681
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,600
with also having someone who wants to go places with you

682
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,960
because it's like, oh man, someday I'm gonna go over here

683
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,600
and to this country, and I'm gonna go over there

684
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,960
and I'm gonna travel the world and go to all these places,

685
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,160
and then you meet someone and they're like,

686
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
oh yeah, we can do all that together,

687
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,480
and it's like, no, you don't understand.

688
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,680
The whole point of me traveling is to have no one

689
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,920
be around me ever again.

690
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,560
Me traveling is not a fun thing to do

691
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,480
with somebody who I love.

692
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,160
It's a break glass in case of emergency.

693
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,680
All the other options have been used up.

694
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,360
It's time for this now.

695
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
I getcha, I getcha.

696
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,160
I guess with me, I mean, my real everyday drive,

697
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,920
all I wanna do is play the video games

698
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,120
I wanna play sometimes and work.

699
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,240
These are like my, and I gotta know, exercise sometimes

700
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,080
and eat the food I like.

701
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,480
It's like, yeah, cause like if I have someone

702
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,120
I like hanging out with here,

703
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,240
what the hell's the point of going anywhere else?

704
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,920
Yeah, I mean, I physically feel a desire to travel.

705
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,200
Also, god damn it, I just wish I lived near the ocean,

706
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,320
which I will before too long, I think.

707
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,680
That would make my life just feel better.

708
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,640
You know what, you're right.

709
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,840
I think this might be one of those fake opinions

710
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,760
that I sometimes have about them,

711
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,360
and I realize it was all, it's not even true.

712
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,720
It's a nice idea, just the idea of being like

713
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,440
an explorer, but like, you know, like a rugged,

714
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
like I don't give a fuck.

715
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,440
I'm just gonna walk around the world.

716
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,040
I saw a video once of like a guy who took a picture

717
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,400
every day while he was traveling the world

718
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,720
and his beard grew to like two meters long or whatever.

719
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,960
And I was like, that's a cool thing,

720
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,600
but then I realized how annoying it would be

721
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
and how expensive and time intensive

722
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
and like planning would, you know,

723
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,440
you can't just do that without dying instantly.

724
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
There's gotta be cheaper ways.

725
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,840
Like if you're, obviously if you're traveling the world,

726
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,040
I assume you're not, well, I mean,

727
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,520
you're not gonna fucking like, I don't know,

728
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,960
drive through like all of Europe and all of Asia.

729
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,240
No, this particular guy like walked across

730
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,240
like the entire, like from, I don't know, China

731
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,400
to fucking Italy or whatever.

732
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,240
Britain or something?

733
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,080
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

734
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,240
I think there's like, I think there's like a clear line

735
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,560
between like couples traveling

736
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,440
and like finding yourself traveling.

737
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,360
Like when it comes to like couples traveling,

738
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,520
I have like, I have like these little dreams,

739
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,280
but they're not like goals.

740
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,320
They're more like images where I see myself like,

741
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,480
hey, it'd be cool to take that special woman

742
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,840
and just be like on the street in Paris,

743
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,120
just like sitting while that Paris music plays

744
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,380
like in that episode of X-Men

745
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,120
where Wolverine finds God and Rogan Gambit are like sitting.

746
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,960
Yeah.

747
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,320
Like I always picture myself as Gambit in that exact scenario

748
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,080
and like, yeah, that'd be fucking cool.

749
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,000
You know, lecturing my woman about atheism, like,

750
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,120
I say it's all random, Cher.

751
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,400
Live hand you a full house or a busted flush.

752
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
That'd be fucking cool.

753
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
But then when I picture like solo traveling,

754
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,320
I picture like, like everyone thinking,

755
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,560
like faking my death and living in a temple

756
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,280
and like fucking Thailand or something for a year,

757
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,800
like up in the mountains.

758
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,680
Like doing chores, like carrying like the stick

759
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,360
with the two buckets of water on it, up the steps,

760
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,280
you know, learning to like find some kind of spiritual remedy

761
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,600
for this affliction that tears us all apart daily

762
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,160
in this cruel world that we live in, this cruel society.

763
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,760
You know, I had a buddy, I had a buddy in,

764
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,240
I don't know, high school growing up

765
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,520
who went after I left high school and stuff

766
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,000
and joined a monk, I don't know, what do you call it?

767
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
Like he gave us all his possessions

768
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,800
and did that shit.

769
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,640
Buddhist monk thing?

770
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,960
No, it was like a Jesuit monk, like that kind of thing.

771
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,320
It was like Christian oriented, I think.

772
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,880
He just did that for a while.

773
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,840
And the funny thing was, like afterward,

774
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,800
you know, I can't speak to what's going on in the guy's head.

775
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,920
I don't really know him particularly well,

776
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,080
but afterward, after like years of doing that,

777
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,800
he just kind of seemed like the same guy.

778
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,480
I was just kind of like, what was gained?

779
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
What was gained by all that?

780
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,640
Maybe he just enjoyed it.

781
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,320
It was enlightening in some way.

782
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,360
I'm not privy to.

783
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,240
Frankly, we've never really talked about it that much.

784
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,440
Well, that's the cruel irony about personal growth.

785
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,440
It's not like on TV where the character arc happens

786
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,880
and everyone can see it and appreciate it.

787
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,800
You know, in real life, you learn and you grow as a person,

788
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,680
but like it's still like in your head

789
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,040
and everyone still treats you like the same old asshole.

790
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,800
If he hasn't changed his hairstyle visibly,

791
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,480
it doesn't count as character development.

792
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,520
Like in time-skaps and anime.

793
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,920
If you don't make a fucking YouTube vlog series

794
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,120
that people can watch as a TV show, then you haven't changed.

795
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,760
If you're not constantly narcissistically talking

796
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,400
about yourself in public for all to see and comment on,

797
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,840
then nothing you do counts and no change has actually occurred.

798
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,200
What you can actually do is like take your life experience,

799
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,560
put it into a character and write a story

800
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,080
and then people like the character and then they like you.

801
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,240
Yeah, then you go surprise motherfuckers.

802
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,680
It was me that you liked all along.

803
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,560
Did you guys ever read Siddhartha by Herman Hess?

804
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,520
I think I read that.

805
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,800
I don't know what a book is.

806
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,120
Our dad told me that that book was about Buddha.

807
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,960
It's not.

808
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,200
It's not literally Buddha, no.

809
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
But he doesn't mean Buddha in there.

810
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,400
So Buddha is a character briefly, I think,

811
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
if I remember correctly.

812
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,800
He's mentioned, I guess so.

813
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,640
Maybe I should get in the back of the doubt.

814
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,920
It's just about a guy finding enlightenment basically,

815
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,600
which ultimately ends with him like he's just like a man

816
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,360
who like works a river crossing,

817
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,560
but he goes through like all this, I don't know,

818
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,200
like he follows a path of spiritual enlightenment

819
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,560
much like the Buddha did.

820
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,440
He goes gay.

821
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,160
That's how he finds enlightenment.

822
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
He gets his river crossing boyfriend.

823
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,840
No, Ben, no, that's not the canon.

824
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,520
That's your fanfic, Ben.

825
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,480
They're just best buddies.

826
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,720
They're definitely gay.

827
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,640
Okay, they may be gay,

828
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,880
but the thing they're gayest for

829
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,680
is crossing that fucking river and they love that shit.

830
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,520
Sure.

831
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,920
They do that shit over on the same page there.

832
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,080
And I don't know, that book was pretty cool.

833
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,800
I think that was one of the books famously I did

834
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,200
before growing a brain,

835
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,560
but even then I think I still got the gist.

836
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,040
There's probably a lot of like fucking farmers out there

837
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
who just like are, I think enlightenment just means-

838
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,360
Who also just whisper ohm into their gay lover's ear.

839
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,200
Right, right.

840
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,040
And fucking giggle about him.

841
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,400
As they peg him from behind.

842
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,240
God.

843
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,560
It makes me wonder, the way that like he ends up

844
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,320
after reading that book, it made me feel like,

845
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
are there just like people out there

846
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,440
who just don't spend every waking moment

847
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,960
like concerned with like their destiny and like the future

848
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
and are just like enjoying being alive

849
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,840
that like technically count as enlightened.

850
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,560
I think, cause that's kind of what it is, right?

851
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,640
That's what that's what Buddha's about.

852
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
It depends on your perspective on what enlightened is,

853
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,040
I suppose, I think for a lot of people

854
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,960
that would be like enlightenment,

855
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,760
understanding that the impermanence of life

856
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,120
and how all you're striving for

857
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,200
doesn't really matter at the end of the day.

858
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
I finally beat my high score in Ninja Suffering.

859
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Holy fuck.

860
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,000
Congratulations, Tom.

861
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,840
Well, that's what you're high score.

862
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,960
Wait, wait, wait, go back, go back to the thing

863
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,440
about how everything's meaningless work.

864
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,600
That's what I wanna talk about.

865
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,800
It's like, hey guys, when we die, we'll forget everything.

866
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,440
Well, that's kind of a hideously depressing irony

867
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,920
where like the person actively seeking enlightenment

868
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,880
by seeking it is less enlightened

869
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,320
than the stupid dumb shit who just doesn't care

870
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
and is fucking sitting around all happy and shit

871
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,720
like a fucking bastard.

872
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,920
As the timeless phrase goes, ignorance is bliss.

873
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,800
Okay, but surely like, I mean, in Siddhartha,

874
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,240
the guy like goes on a quest and then he like,

875
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,800
you couldn't call that guy ignorant or whatever

876
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160
because he's seen it all.

877
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,800
But maybe it's fair to say that like,

878
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,760
because he's like deactivated the nodes of his brain,

879
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,120
that's like, well, what was the point of worrying

880
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,960
about all that?

881
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,760
I will just help people cross this river

882
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,000
and that'll be my life

883
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,120
and I'll enjoy the simple pleasures inherent in it.

884
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,840
Is that like, you know, willful ignorance perhaps?

885
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,280
Or is that just a realization that through all my struggles

886
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,160
of trying to understand what's going on in the world,

887
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,960
I find that like the answers were all, you know,

888
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,640
just to be present and enjoy life

889
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,880
and there is no greater truth I could discover,

890
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't know, like that I have the tools to find.

891
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,040
We don't have Star Trek tri-quarters,

892
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
so I can't figure out more than, I don't know,

893
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
even that, that's all like physical stuff.

894
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,440
I mean, tri-quarters?

895
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,960
That's what they call their little scan things.

896
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,320
They used to deduce everything in Star Trek.

897
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,680
I don't know what it means.

898
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,760
It means something, but I don't fucking know.

899
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,040
Gabe, what were you saying something?

900
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,360
Well, I was saying like personally,

901
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,360
the idea of there being like a, you know,

902
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,000
an enlightened state where you understand the universe.

903
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,200
Like I hear about these things,

904
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,160
people talking, waxing philosophical

905
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,160
about having, you know, understood things finally.

906
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,480
And I'm like sitting here and I'm like,

907
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
you know, I don't know whether I have or haven't.

908
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,800
I don't think I'll ever understand the moment,

909
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,960
when or whether or if I ever like understand anything.

910
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,640
Like how best to enjoy life,

911
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,760
whether I'm wasting my time,

912
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,440
not striving for something where I could be,

913
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
or whether it's not like important to do that.

914
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,280
A lot of the time I just think,

915
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,480
oh, if I don't fucking care, I'll just jack off

916
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,800
and it'll be fine.

917
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,960
We all agree that like, okay,

918
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,480
we don't know about any afterlife or any of that bullshit.

919
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,560
Maybe it exists, I don't know, probably not.

920
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,120
No reason to think so.

921
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,200
So like all we've got is like the time that we're here alive

922
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,960
and like what quantifies as a good usage of that time?

923
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,800
Is it like-

924
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,640
Jacking off.

925
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
I don't know.

926
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,320
You're right.

927
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,520
It's the only thing that qualifies.

928
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,600
I'm curious, what's more enlightened theoretically

929
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,720
about like being a river crossing guy

930
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,040
who helps people cross versus like literally

931
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,440
just the extreme example of being hooked up matrix style

932
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,120
to like a pleasure machine and just, you know,

933
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,000
getting that fed to your brain at all times

934
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,960
to keep you like perfectly satisfied.

935
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,600
What is more enlightened about that

936
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,480
rather than just recognizing, you know?

937
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,800
I've thought about this because there was, you know,

938
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,560
it's a common like idea.

939
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,440
I've seen it before.

940
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,920
The idea of a machine that just gives you pleasure

941
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,400
is disgusting to me as a person who knows

942
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,840
that I'm not currently in one and I could go into one.

943
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,600
If I was born in that and I had no other knowledge,

944
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,160
then obviously I'd enjoy it.

945
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Because there's like a very, like there's a fakeness to it

946
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
that I can perceive as a person

947
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,880
who is not currently hooked up to a machine,

948
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,680
although I might be, you know, in some like real matrix,

949
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,280
like, oh, there's a fucking another level to it.

950
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,200
But like, if there was a choice, you know,

951
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,080
do you want to get hooked up to a pleasure machine

952
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,240
or do you want to suffer in the life

953
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,800
that you currently live in and sometimes feel good?

954
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll be like, nah, I'm good.

955
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,440
I'll just, you know, poke at rocks on the ground.

956
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,840
I mean, that's pretty fun.

957
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,720
I don't need pleasure all the time.

958
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,800
I would just leave me alone.

959
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,640
I mean, okay.

960
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,160
I mean, I don't know, like, is it all just hedonism?

961
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,080
Like, because we know that like a perfect pleasure machine

962
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,280
certainly isn't a realistic thing.

963
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,080
It's like, oh, don't be tempted by, you know,

964
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,800
like drugs or stuff like that

965
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,960
because it probably won't work out very well.

966
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,480
Like, what's the metric?

967
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,080
Is it specifically like happiness in life?

968
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,120
Is it?

969
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,360
There is no metric.

970
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,520
I mean, it depends on the individual.

971
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,400
Oh, this fucking sucks.

972
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,240
This is a stupid question.

973
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,560
If there's a hypothetical, like, it's just good

974
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,000
and there's no bad quote, this just is pleasurable.

975
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,520
I would still be a bit like iffy

976
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,240
because I know that it's a machine

977
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,600
and I feel like real things are real.

978
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,280
Even if once I'm hooked up, I would be perfectly happy

979
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,200
hypothetically, then I just still would be like,

980
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,440
nah, nah, you have fun, kids.

981
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,280
I'm just gonna die.

982
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,120
I'd rather die.

983
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,280
I've been living my whole life with the idea

984
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
that eventually I'm gonna pass away

985
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,840
and that this is what life is.

986
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,200
I don't wanna fucking, I just don't wanna think about it.

987
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,040
Just leave me alone.

988
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,880
I hope I don't die.

989
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,040
But that's what the machine is for.

990
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,520
The machine will make you not think about it.

991
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,720
Nah, nah, these people come into me with clipboards

992
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,960
and goggles and they say,

993
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,880
wait, this is the new fucking science thing.

994
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,600
And I'm like, shut up, I'm jacking off here.

995
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I mean, I think the mechanism, fair.

996
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,440
I feel the mechanism we have in our brain

997
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
that makes us feel like, oh, that's like fake and gross

998
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,560
is a thing that's been built into us

999
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,360
that's like a human skepticism of things

1000
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,440
that are too good to be true, must be,

1001
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,600
and truly it'll actually be bad for me in the long run.

1002
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,440
But I mean, what if they work out the bugs?

1003
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,080
I like being a stupid monkey,

1004
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,000
scrabbling around on the ground with rocks

1005
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,240
and not knowing how to do things.

1006
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,960
It's funny, it's just funny.

1007
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,120
I like being that.

1008
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,520
It's funny.

1009
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
I kinda feel the opposite.

1010
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,520
I'm always hoping to find that new plateau of wisdom

1011
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,280
and like better myself as a person.

1012
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,920
Nate, I think you agree with that.

1013
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,920
The rest of you too,

1014
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,800
I don't know why I singled out Nate.

1015
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
Only Nate, only Nate.

1016
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,680
You know, and I feel like, yes, every year,

1017
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,520
I do feel like infinitely smarter and wiser

1018
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,000
and like I've grown as a person

1019
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,320
and I'm better than I was in the previous year.

1020
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,160
But I have yet to cross the threshold

1021
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,960
where all of that increased exponential wisdom

1022
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,320
yields happiness or any kind of contentment or...

1023
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
I'm concerned.

1024
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,920
It seems to just make me more miserable every year.

1025
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,760
The more better a person I feel.

1026
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,240
I'm concerned that now,

1027
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,360
now that I'm deeply depressed all the time,

1028
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,080
I have crossed that threshold

1029
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,200
and now I do have the clearest idea that I've ever had

1030
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,240
and it's just that the truth is bad.

1031
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,520
Oh God, listen, I would have been better off not knowing.

1032
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,320
Oh, don't talk about how the truth is bad.

1033
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,560
I don't wanna think about it.

1034
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,200
My perspective is that pleasure is bullshit and wrong

1035
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,080
and it should be a spice in life and not your end goal.

1036
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,560
People should be searching for purpose, not pleasure.

1037
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,840
Those are different things.

1038
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,200
Purpose is doing something that is long-term,

1039
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,560
continues to be something that you build towards

1040
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
and you understand that purpose means

1041
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,680
you are going to have bad times.

1042
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,000
Things are going to be hard and it's going to suck.

1043
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,320
I think I did hear once from somewhere,

1044
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,240
I read it somewhere, somehow it got in my brain

1045
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,000
that the idea of happiness as a state of being

1046
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,720
as opposed to just a fleeting emotion

1047
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,200
is a relatively new concept in human history

1048
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,120
that was invented in the last 100 years or so

1049
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,120
and that invention of this idea of just being happy

1050
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,960
has irreparably destroyed humanity.

1051
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
Yeah, I don't think it's good.

1052
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,000
I think it's damaging.

1053
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,080
It's like a state that cannot naturally be achieved.

1054
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,760
It's only been in the last 100 years

1055
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,080
that that was even something that could be conceptualized.

1056
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,600
Back in the day, you were a surf, work in the fields

1057
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,600
and it's just like, what do you mean happy all the time?

1058
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm happy when I don't have the plague.

1059
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,360
Right, it's like life was kind of like miserable.

1060
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,560
Happiness is just the absence of all the bad things

1061
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,880
you're usually thinking about

1062
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,520
for like five fucking minutes or something.

1063
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,760
Yeah, definitely true for me.

1064
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,480
I don't even live in the present.

1065
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,040
I'm mostly like 90% of my time,

1066
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,920
I'm either like dwelling on horrible things

1067
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,120
that have happened in the past or things I regret or rue

1068
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,920
or I'm imagining a wonderful future

1069
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,760
where I've achieved enough or accomplished enough

1070
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,960
that I feel good enough to no longer

1071
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
have to constantly dwell on the horrible past

1072
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,720
and I'm always kind of like back and forth between those two

1073
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,880
and like the only time I'm ever in the present

1074
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
is when I'm jacked off.

1075
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,960
That's the only time I wanna be in the present.

1076
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,240
I don't know, I think it's a fairly agreed upon fact

1077
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,400
that I seem like a fairly upbeat person overall,

1078
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,280
perhaps of the more upbeat among this group

1079
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,160
and it makes me think that like I think the reason for that

1080
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,120
and maybe it's literally that I'm,

1081
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,160
I guess the uncharitable it would be stupid

1082
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,440
that I just don't spend a lot of time

1083
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,520
concerned about the bad things

1084
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,040
and I'm just focused on the stuff I'm trying to do to,

1085
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,640
like right now my focus in life in general

1086
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,680
is to make enough money so I'm not losing money every month

1087
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,360
and we'll be able to grow and then buy the things I want

1088
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,640
which I know are like the things

1089
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,080
that lead generally to happiness.

1090
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,680
I don't know, owning a house would be nice.

1091
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,360
Like having enough money to have property,

1092
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,240
having money, you know.

1093
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,920
I definitely feel infinitely better in general

1094
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,720
when I am engaging with a plan of action

1095
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,920
or actively doing something or working

1096
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,120
or accomplishing something,

1097
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,200
which is why I was really happy

1098
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,480
for a few brief months there

1099
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,680
when I started going to the gym

1100
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,480
before the US government decided

1101
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,880
that I should be fat again

1102
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,000
and close down all the gyms everywhere forever.

1103
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,840
For a year.

1104
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,660
And I'll have an excuse

1105
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,960
because my gym is in my basement.

1106
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,160
I could be working out this whole time, but I'm not.

1107
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh boy.

1108
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,120
Jesse, it could be worse.

1109
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,200
You could have a spine injury

1110
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,720
that prevents you from doing any exercise whatsoever anymore.

1111
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,360
They're still on about that, Tom.

1112
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,200
Let's get over it.

1113
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,960
Oh, listen to this, we've heard about that.

1114
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,160
I'll get over it, pussy, wonk it off.

1115
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,080
I wish, man, I tried using the Bowflex

1116
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,400
in the house yesterday and it fucked me up pretty bad

1117
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,960
and I was like, well, I guess I'm not doing that

1118
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,800
at any time soon.

1119
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,200
I cannot exercise outside of a gym.

1120
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,080
My brain cannot do it.

1121
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,640
It's exponentially worse not exercising at a gym.

1122
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,120
Plus I hate body weight exercises.

1123
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,360
They're fucking pussy shit.

1124
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,600
I want to do fucking bench.

1125
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,280
I don't like going to the gym.

1126
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,160
I like my basement.

1127
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,000
But that's the whole point.

1128
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,840
The other thing is-

1129
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,960
I don't like going to the gym

1130
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,280
so I want to get in and get out as quickly as possible.

1131
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,120
That's not about motivation.

1132
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,480
When I'm at my house, I still don't like working out

1133
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,040
but my computer's right there.

1134
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,360
Well, the main thing is I've never been able

1135
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,440
to really live alone for any extended period of time.

1136
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,400
I'm always have other people in the house with me.

1137
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,160
Like I'm quarantined with other people in the house.

1138
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,240
I don't want people in the house hearing me

1139
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,440
or seeing me work out.

1140
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,800
It's fucking embarrassing.

1141
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,000
It's not embarrassing at the gym

1142
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,080
because everyone's doing it.

1143
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,640
But the idea that someone else around me

1144
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,240
knows that I am actively concerned about my health

1145
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,120
fills me with humiliation and rage.

1146
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,680
Are you simping for your own body?

1147
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,360
That's fucking gross, dude.

1148
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,000
What is this shit?

1149
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,160
It's imagined up.

1150
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,720
It's almost like a tesset admission that I'm fat.

1151
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,560
Yeah.

1152
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,400
Like, no, I'm not.

1153
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,560
I just wanna be a little bit healthy.

1154
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,360
I will not admit to being fat outside the gym.

1155
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,640
Even worse, it's that you care that you're fat.

1156
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,160
Just being fat can be cool.

1157
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,840
But if you care, ooh, cringe, big cringe.

1158
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,040
Since the gym closed, I have become a fucking planet.

1159
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,720
I am so grotesque.

1160
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,560
I look at myself and I feel like I lay in bed

1161
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,280
and I sit in a chair and I feel my fucking fat folds

1162
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
flopping over the edges of it.

1163
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,480
And I'm just filled with so much hate for all things.

1164
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,040
Hate for the government who created this conspiracy.

1165
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,840
You know, everyone has their own ideas

1166
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,640
and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus.

1167
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,920
You know, there's no truth anymore.

1168
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,640
No one really knows what's going on.

1169
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,200
My chosen personal conspiracy theory

1170
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,160
is that this whole thing was manufactured

1171
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,520
to get me fat again because they knew that me being

1172
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,280
in shape and me being happy with myself

1173
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,600
would be too powerful and I'd overthrow

1174
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,360
this whole stinking corrupt system.

1175
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,320
So they had to do something to close down the gym

1176
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,800
and keep me from it and this is what they thought of.

1177
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,320
This is their excuse and it's working so far

1178
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,880
and I just, I'm so sad.

1179
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,440
I'm so angry, I was so committed.

1180
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,360
Like when I finally started doing it, you know,

1181
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,080
it took me, it took me my whole life.

1182
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,800
When I finally started doing it, I'm like, oh my God,

1183
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,580
Islam is the way in the light.

1184
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,560
I finally see, I am enlightened.

1185
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,100
I will never stop coming here.

1186
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,680
I will come here every single day

1187
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,400
and fucking clang and bang and kick ass and I did.

1188
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,680
And I did great and I lost like 30 pounds or something.

1189
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,280
Like I was 240 when I started.

1190
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,280
And by the end of it, I was 210 in a span of like,

1191
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,000
I think three or four months and I'm like, oh my God,

1192
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,440
I look great, I feel great.

1193
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,160
This is so cool, I'll never stop doing this ever.

1194
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,000
And then like 2020 started and for the first few months

1195
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,480
of 2020, I was staying with family like in another state

1196
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,720
and I couldn't get into planet fitness

1197
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,480
because they're like, oh, you need your driver's license

1198
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,820
to get in here and I'm like, I don't have it.

1199
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,600
I took a train here so I couldn't get in the gym there.

1200
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,000
And so then after that, I went to Virginia with you guys

1201
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,320
and then we fucking binge ate and fucking drank

1202
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,960
and that was even worse.

1203
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,440
And so then as soon as I got back from that,

1204
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,800
it was like, oh, now everyone's quarantined.

1205
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,240
You can't even go outside.

1206
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,720
You're not even allowed to move.

1207
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,960
You're legally required to stay in bed

1208
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,040
and be a sack of shit.

1209
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,040
And so I'm already like, I went from 240 to 210

1210
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,900
and now I'm back at 233.

1211
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,240
And like, even though I'm not as fat as when I started,

1212
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,720
like it feels more fat because I now have been

1213
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,640
to the mountain top and now to even be back down here,

1214
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,800
feels even more grotesque than it used to.

1215
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,600
And I'm going fucking stir crazy with it.

1216
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,960
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna snap people.

1217
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,760
The worst thing about the quarantine,

1218
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,960
just for me personally, how my life has been affected

1219
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,000
is that I can, that's like the main way

1220
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,880
that my actual day-to-day life has been affected

1221
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,760
that I cannot go to the gym when I want to,

1222
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,680
which, I mean, yeah, I've got my fucking pull-up bar.

1223
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,640
I'll do push-ups.

1224
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,600
I fucking hate it.

1225
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,920
Pull-ups, I guess, are okay.

1226
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,040
But I fucking hate all this body weight exercise is stupid.

1227
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,520
I don't even believe in that body weight.

1228
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,800
I think they literally are fake.

1229
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,640
It's just, yeah.

1230
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,840
Just like, like standing on a treadmill

1231
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,120
and being able to like run in place

1232
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,240
or like walk up an incline in place

1233
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,520
and like listen to music while you're doing it

1234
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,160
or just like finding like sitting at the weight machines

1235
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,680
and doing the, you know, the rote activities

1236
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,480
that are like, you know, that are illustrated on the side

1237
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,320
that you can't possibly mess up.

1238
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,840
You know, just like turning your brain off

1239
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,000
and doing those things.

1240
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,520
That is the only correct way to work out.

1241
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,560
Any of these fucking like,

1242
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,240
any of these like workout without weight machines,

1243
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,920
fucking shit that people did in the caveman days,

1244
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,040
it's fucking barbaric and I refuse to do it.

1245
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,280
Oh, oh, do burpees.

1246
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,920
I don't want to do a burpee.

1247
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,600
No, I don't ever want to fucking touch it.

1248
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,520
I don't, a burpee is like what you do to a fucking baby.

1249
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,880
It doesn't sound like something that a grown man,

1250
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,600
a civilized person would ever do

1251
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,280
and I refuse to take part in it.

1252
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,560
I hate the word burpee.

1253
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,400
I just find it very, I mean, I don't want to do it.

1254
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,280
It is when you do like a squat jumping jack thing.

1255
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,240
It's like you, it's like you late, you get in a pushup

1256
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,920
and then you stand up and then you jump

1257
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,600
and then you get back in the pushup.

1258
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,160
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1259
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,800
It's dishonorable and it's shameful.

1260
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,160
You'll never catch me doing one.

1261
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,760
Why on earth is it called a burpee?

1262
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,280
I thought it was like a baby thing.

1263
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,120
I don't know.

1264
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,160
I don't know where it came from.

1265
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,000
Everything that's been named in the last 10 years

1266
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,320
has been terrible.

1267
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,760
For some reason we lost the ability

1268
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,600
to name things in a cool way.

1269
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,280
The name is the barrier for entry.

1270
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,480
I can't do anything called a burpee.

1271
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,120
I won't, ever.

1272
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,200
And you know, on the other point.

1273
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,040
What about a slurpee?

1274
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
A slurpee I will do.

1275
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,880
I prefer a slurpee.

1276
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,480
And that's part of the problem.

1277
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,600
I'd fucking, I like going to the gym

1278
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,640
because I like just having the ambiance.

1279
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,880
Nobody ever, I've never made contact

1280
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,800
with a single fucking person in the gym ever

1281
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,880
under any circumstances, no matter what basically.

1282
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,060
But I like having them there

1283
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,520
for the tacit, ominous feeling of oppression

1284
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,680
that if I do something embarrassing,

1285
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,280
if I even just sit there and don't do anything there,

1286
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,320
if from the side of their eye,

1287
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,120
from the corner of their perception,

1288
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,880
it will be noticed that I'm being that guy at the gym.

1289
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,520
And that little bit of motivation.

1290
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,760
Not to mention just the fact that I have to get my gear

1291
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,080
and go to the gym.

1292
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,440
It commits you to getting a workout done and getting done.

1293
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,640
Whereas I spent two hours working the other day

1294
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,080
because I was just watching some fucking

1295
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,680
Star Trek Voyager while I was exercising.

1296
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,880
Don't do, because it's in my fucking work room.

1297
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
It's in my room with my computer.

1298
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,840
What am I gonna not watch TV while I exercise?

1299
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,880
Well, that would be retarded.

1300
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,080
Of course I'm going to.

1301
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,680
And the workout took twice as long

1302
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,760
and I wasted tons of fucking time.

1303
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,600
It's a nightmare.

1304
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,440
It's horrible.

1305
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,280
I don't like it.

1306
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,120
Gyms are bad.

1307
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,280
I'm happy to pay money.

1308
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,200
I want the financial burden on my back

1309
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,720
forcing me to go workout more.

1310
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,920
And you're right about that.

1311
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,840
The constant looming threat of doing something wrong

1312
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,200
at the gym is what gets your ass and gear the most.

1313
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
Absolutely.

1314
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,360
I have the fucking, okay.

1315
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,240
I don't know if I've told this story before.

1316
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,720
This was like the dumbest thing that I ever did at the gym.

1317
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,040
And it's still, I still think about it.

1318
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,080
And I feel horrified at the thing that I did.

1319
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,840
I was like, so I was at the gym

1320
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,520
and I was on like one of the machines

1321
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,200
just like lifting the weights and fucking doing the thing.

1322
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,760
And you know, when you're done with it,

1323
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,040
you get up and you go and you get your little paper towel

1324
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,280
and you get your little spray

1325
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,000
and you just come back and spray it down.

1326
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,040
So I finish and I get up

1327
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,400
and I go to get the paper towel and the spray

1328
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,680
and I come back to wipe down my seat

1329
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,320
and there's this like guy standing there by the machine.

1330
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:13,120
And he's like a disability, like deformed guy,

1331
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,440
maybe like retarded or something, you know?

1332
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,080
He's he had, you know, yeah, retarded people with this.

1333
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,560
You can go to the gym, you can workout too.

1334
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,840
That's not, I'm not judging you, man.

1335
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,360
Even though you're creepy, even though you're shaped wrong

1336
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,120
and a person should not look like you.

1337
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,520
God did not grant you his favor, but that's all right.

1338
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,880
Yeah, and he's like this weird like,

1339
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,560
like he's like five foot tall

1340
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,640
and he's got like this huge, like misshapen,

1341
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,880
like bulbous head and like a sloped forehead

1342
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,480
and like this weird dummy look.

1343
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,600
And he's just oddly shaped in every way.

1344
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,680
And he's just kind of staring blankly,

1345
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,280
like in the way that a bad person does.

1346
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,760
Okay, yeah, right.

1347
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,720
So like I come back with my spray

1348
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,800
and my paper towel to wipe down my seat

1349
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,000
and he's just standing by the machine, staring at me,

1350
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,960
like staring into my soul, like right into my eyes

1351
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,440
and not saying anything.

1352
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,280
And I'm just like trying to ignore it.

1353
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,400
And I'm like awkwardly like just like silently like

1354
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,280
patting down my seat.

1355
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,440
Let's get this over with so I can get away from this guy.

1356
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,880
And he, and he's just standing there.

1357
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,320
And he's like really close to me now.

1358
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,080
And he's like looking right in my eyes and I'm like, hi.

1359
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,040
Like I just said like hi to like,

1360
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,440
to give him, to satisfy him somehow,

1361
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,240
give him the human acknowledgement

1362
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,720
that he clearly craved.

1363
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,160
And I'm like, hello.

1364
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,400
And he's like, hello, hello.

1365
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,080
And I'm like, oh my God, what does he want?

1366
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,400
What does he want?

1367
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,400
And I walk away and so I'm like, I'm walking.

1368
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,800
I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe that.

1369
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,640
What a weird guy.

1370
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,480
What a fucking, and I'm like,

1371
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,600
I thought for about like five to 10 minutes

1372
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,400
I was thinking that's stupid son of a bitch.

1373
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,440
That's fucking retard.

1374
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,080
Fucking standing there staring at me.

1375
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,920
Piece of shit.

1376
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,240
What an asshole, fucking cocksucking bastard, motherfucker.

1377
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,600
I hope he fucking dies.

1378
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,040
And I'm like, I'm thinking like that

1379
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,120
for like a good solid five to 10 minutes.

1380
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,380
And after a while, all at once it hits me, wait.

1381
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,400
I went and got the paper towel in the water

1382
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,800
and I went to a different wait machine.

1383
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,640
Oh!

1384
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,240
And I was wiping down his seat.

1385
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,120
That's why he was staring at me.

1386
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,400
I was the retard in the story.

1387
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,120
Wow.

1388
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,280
And I still think about that late at night

1389
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,480
when I can't sleep and I will for the rest of my life.

1390
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,760
Like in that guy's world, he has a story about a retard

1391
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,600
he met in the gym who just came up

1392
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,880
and wiped his seat for no reason.

1393
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,200
And the retard was me.

1394
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,320
And he'll be telling that story

1395
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,200
to all of his retard friends for the rest of time.

1396
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,720
He's like that guy from Midsommar,

1397
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,520
like the inbred guy who actually has the true wisdom

1398
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,860
who can like touch God and convey God's message.

1399
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,180
In this case, it's that,

1400
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,900
bro, you're on my fucking machine, bro.

1401
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,740
What are you doing?

1402
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,220
What are you doing here?

1403
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,740
I'm just thinking like how I would react,

1404
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,300
like how furious I would be

1405
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,100
if a stranger came up to my seat

1406
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,580
and started wiping it, you know?

1407
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,580
I mean, it would be a nightmare.

1408
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,540
But that reminds me of the no man's land,

1409
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
the nightmare scenario of there's two things.

1410
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,900
One, where you like step away from your fucking machine

1411
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,900
to go get a drink of water.

1412
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,860
But the worst one of all is when you're mid-set

1413
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,980
and you realize you have to poop.

1414
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,620
And you're like, oh God,

1415
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,940
this means I'm gonna be away from a machine

1416
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,260
for like five to 10 minutes.

1417
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,020
So you arrange like a full like barrier

1418
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,300
of like your water bottle, your backpack.

1419
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,540
I don't know, your fucking, your wrist wraps,

1420
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,140
your weight belt, if you got it,

1421
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,820
in like a semicircle around.

1422
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,900
So everyone knows this is your machine.

1423
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,060
And when you still walk, and still, despite that fact,

1424
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,980
there's a percentage of the time when you'll come back

1425
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,060
and there will be a guy who's like kicked it all aside

1426
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,660
and is on the machine

1427
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,820
and is now currently doing the exercise

1428
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,980
and you have to have the talk.

1429
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,220
Bunch of savages.

1430
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,580
Bro, I'm so sorry.

1431
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,180
I'm so sorry, I was away.

1432
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,460
You're the one apologizing,

1433
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,500
even though clearly he is in the wrong.

1434
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,140
There's a conflict of morals here.

1435
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,540
Yes, it is wrong to occupy a machine for too long,

1436
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,140
but what's a man to do when you realize,

1437
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,340
you can't work out when you have to poop or even pee.

1438
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,180
It can't be done.

1439
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,900
You have to step away.

1440
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,500
It's one of the nightmares of the gym.

1441
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,740
And then you have to have contact

1442
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,180
with another person at the gym,

1443
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,060
which is the ultimate worst situation possible.

1444
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:19,900
The ultimate sin.

1445
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,140
It can never be allowed.

1446
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,740
And it's a nightmare, it's a nightmare.

1447
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,020
I mean, when I was going to the gym,

1448
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,900
I would go and look up the Planet Fitness

1449
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,500
on the Google app and see the times it was least busy

1450
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,900
and try and make sure I could fit that time into my schedule,

1451
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,260
just optimize not having to see anybody.

1452
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,180
Sure, sure.

1453
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:39,940
Yeah.

1454
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,780
Just didn't want to interact with people.

1455
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,620
That's very wise.

1456
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,340
Is Planet Fitness a 24 hour?

1457
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,380
Yes.

1458
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,220
Yeah.

1459
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,300
Because I usually go like two in the morning.

1460
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,220
Dude, my gym has 24 hour posts on it.

1461
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,020
Do you know what that means?

1462
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,900
Do you know what they mean by 24 hour?

1463
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,940
They meant, in real fine print,

1464
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,140
on weekdays, starting at 5 a.m. on Monday.

1465
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,780
There have been, I think more times than not,

1466
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,580
I have gone to the gym and it has been like Sunday night

1467
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,260
at like 6 p.m. and the doors are fucking shuttered.

1468
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,060
Cause oh, it's only 24 hours on the weekdays,

1469
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,460
on Saturday and Sunday nights, we close early.

1470
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,100
And I think Friday too.

1471
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,700
These people, I'm gonna burn it down.

1472
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,300
Next time this motherfucker happens,

1473
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,020
I'm going to pour the bacon grease

1474
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,580
from the Arby's next door all along the lines

1475
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,060
and burn this motherfucker down,

1476
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,900
create an explosion with all the fucking,

1477
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,180
what is that stuff, the chalk,

1478
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,500
the weight chalk for the barbells or whatever,

1479
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,660
which obviously they don't have

1480
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,020
cause it's a pussy gym, but whatever.

1481
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,620
Fuck them, it's horrible.

1482
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,020
You know, all this talk about Planet Fitness,

1483
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,300
I'm realizing that I haven't been to the gym

1484
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,420
in like almost like a year and a half.

1485
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,500
My membership is still active

1486
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,460
and I bet that even though they're all closed,

1487
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,060
they're probably still charging me monthly,

1488
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,980
even though none of them are open right now.

1489
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,460
I got an email from Planet Fitness saying,

1490
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,820
don't worry, we're not charging your cards during this time.

1491
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,140
Okay, that's good.

1492
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,860
I should check if mine is doing the same.

1493
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,620
Thank God for that.

1494
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,860
You better go to the gym soon Tom,

1495
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,060
cause I've been waiting for the next Q and A.

1496
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,980
I know dude, it's a nightmare, it's a nightmare,

1497
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,500
but there's extraneous circumstances now.

1498
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,020
Cause there's a gym that's actually right near me

1499
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,020
because I used to live here years ago

1500
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,220
and then I left and then I moved back.

1501
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,420
But the gym right down the street is called Workout World

1502
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,260
and back in the day, I had it like a subscription

1503
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,540
or whatever, I was a member at Workout World

1504
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,540
and then I moved away and I couldn't cancel my subscription

1505
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,980
but I was like, hmm, I know

1506
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,780
and I canceled my debit card

1507
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,300
and I got a new one, so they stopped charging me.

1508
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,300
So like four years ago, I owe like a hundred dollars

1509
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,860
to Workout World and I never paid it back

1510
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,660
and like it's still there on my credit report

1511
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,300
but it did like nothing.

1512
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,140
So I just, I got away with it.

1513
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,100
I fucking got away with it, boy.

1514
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,380
Well, you know, it's just that those practices,

1515
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,860
okay, they've got their rules or whatever.

1516
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,940
The fucking gym rules about like when you are

1517
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,140
and are not allowed to cancel are so fucking draconian.

1518
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,220
You have to like pay for like an extra month

1519
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,260
before they'll let you leave or some shit.

1520
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,020
Why can it not just be?

1521
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,060
Hey, I'd like to cancel.

1522
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,980
At the end of this month, please take me off.

1523
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,860
Like every fucking time they make you pay

1524
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,180
for at least one extra month.

1525
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,020
Well, okay.

1526
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,820
And there's a cancellation fee sometimes.

1527
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,620
They locked me into a year contract.

1528
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,020
Like they wouldn't let me sign, I don't know.

1529
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,620
I guess I did sign up for a year contract

1530
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:31,660
but like whatever, I used every tool at my disposal.

1531
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,180
A gym's entire business model is subsidized

1532
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,860
by fat people who sign up in January

1533
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,060
and then never go again.

1534
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,380
Yeah, I mean, you're right.

1535
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,380
But they're not willing to cancel the subscription

1536
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,220
because that's giving up.

1537
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,060
That would feel bad.

1538
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:44,900
Yeah, right, right.

1539
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,740
No, it's true, it's true.

1540
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,900
I don't blame the gyms.

1541
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,740
That's a real thing.

1542
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,260
That's a...

1543
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,100
Sure.

1544
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,940
It's happening.

1545
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,180
But yeah, no, I don't want to be one of those guys.

1546
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,020
Of course not.

1547
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,860
Of course not.

1548
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,700
So I won't work out.

1549
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,060
I'll just cancel my subscription.

1550
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,020
Just cancel my fucking debit card.

1551
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,740
Better money, better idea.

1552
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,140
Man, no, I keep thinking, I keep thinking

1553
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,020
I should probably start lifting again.

1554
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,580
It'll be depressing because I'll have to do it by myself.

1555
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,020
But I'll probably feel better.

1556
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,980
You will 100% feel better.

1557
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,660
Everyone always feels better after the exercise.

1558
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,500
It's true.

1559
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,260
Yeah, yeah.

1560
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,900
I gotta get the demons out somehow.

1561
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,740
Exactly right.

1562
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,580
I guess so.

1563
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,820
I'm gonna do it, ladies and gentlemen.

1564
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,740
Yeah, I'm gonna work out today.

1565
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,580
I'm gonna get that.

1566
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,420
It's gonna happen.

1567
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,260
You're welcome.

1568
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,100
Feel free to hold me to it.

1569
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,380
You gotta call our mom today.

1570
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,220
Oh, true.

1571
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,180
But I've got, when was that, six we said?

1572
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,580
Okay, I've made about six, yeah.

1573
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,020
I think I'll have time beforehand.

1574
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,460
An hour and 44 minutes from right now.

1575
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,300
Tick, tick, tick.

1576
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,140
In case you're wondering.

1577
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,580
The doomsday clock marches ever onward.

1578
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,900
Has anyone used Zoom?

1579
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,140
Do I need to be scared or intimidated about setting up Zoom?

1580
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:47,980
I don't think so.

1581
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,820
I've never used it.

1582
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,660
I haven't used it.

1583
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,820
Both my parents are, and they're idiots.

1584
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,020
I'm at the age now.

1585
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:57,340
I'm not learning any new apps or social media things.

1586
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,180
I don't care.

1587
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,180
Discord would do this job.

1588
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,580
I wish they just had Discord, but I don't know.

1589
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:05,100
Whatever comes out past this point, I'm not interested.

1590
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,540
I'm not gonna be a part of it.

1591
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,700
This is what it means to truly become an adult,

1592
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,940
to give up on trying to follow trends.

1593
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,140
Say, this is it, I'm planting my flag, not moving.

1594
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:18,220
There's like two levels of getting old.

1595
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,220
There's one where you hear about the new thing

1596
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,420
and you reject it.

1597
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,900
And then it's when you get to a point where you're so old

1598
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,620
that you don't even know anything.

1599
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,460
And you say, yeah, sure, why not?

1600
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,860
And that's why all the really old,

1601
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,980
my parents are on Zoom doing talks with their friends.

1602
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,380
You know, up to the point.

1603
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,940
I've resented, yeah.

1604
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,940
What am I supposed to be excited about with Zoom?

1605
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,580
Like, we already got nothing.

1606
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,700
You can do video conferencing in Discord.

1607
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,140
You can do it through Google Hangouts.

1608
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,300
There's already things that do the same thing.

1609
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,380
I think it has some new features of,

1610
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,300
you can have tons of screens on screen at once

1611
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,620
or something that's different.

1612
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,060
Zoom didn't require login at the beginning.

1613
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,580
So if you didn't have an account,

1614
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,820
you can just still use it.

1615
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,740
You can still go join other sessions and stuff.

1616
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,540
So that's why it kind of rose above.

1617
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,100
But this is just lower barrier of entry.

1618
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,940
Yeah, that's nice.

1619
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,780
It's free.

1620
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,620
You don't have to sign up.

1621
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,460
Well, low barrier, you know what?

1622
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,540
I guess low barrier of entry really is a feature.

1623
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,380
It is.

1624
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,220
Like, I guess that's why.

1625
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,980
It's arguably the most important one for mass appeal.

1626
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:15,900
Yep, yep.

1627
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,740
Hey, on the getting old thing,

1628
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,220
up to this, I'll plant my flag.

1629
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,060
Up to this point, I have famously resisted the idea

1630
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,460
of a Gurren login sequel.

1631
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,220
But now, I suddenly realized that Gurren login

1632
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,380
only covered two of the important stages

1633
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,980
of development of a man.

1634
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,700
One is when you go from childhood to adulthood

1635
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,020
and you improve yourself and learn how you can affect

1636
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,340
the world and make positive change.

1637
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,260
Part two is when you, as an adult,

1638
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,220
have to recognize that the world is an imperfect place

1639
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,140
that your power will not be enough

1640
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,660
to just change the entire world all the time.

1641
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,100
You have to play within the system to a degree.

1642
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,940
But I need a sequel.

1643
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,340
Mate, that sounds like the worst fucking sequel

1644
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,180
to Gurren login.

1645
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,220
That's not the exact opposite of what it should be.

1646
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,140
Well, first of all, that's already the show bed.

1647
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,500
That's already the show.

1648
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,380
Yeah, that's part two.

1649
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,860
Yeah, like, Spiral Power itself is not enough.

1650
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,620
It would destroy the world.

1651
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,500
It would destroy the universe.

1652
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,980
But we need a true sequel.

1653
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,860
When is, in fact, when Cevote is an old man

1654
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,500
and you begin to resent those

1655
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,260
who are now trying to change the world

1656
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,620
and you hate that they're exerting any influence

1657
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,940
and it makes you mad.

1658
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,500
And does he become, what's his name?

1659
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,180
What's the fucking old guy's name?

1660
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,860
Sigmund Freud, a grandpa from the Simpsons.

1661
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,820
The guy who ends up as a head in a jar.

1662
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,620
Oh, Lord Genome, Lord Genome.

1663
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,020
Does he become the new Lord Genome?

1664
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,780
Well-bent, famously, I busted this wide open

1665
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,180
that really Lord Genome is just like Rossiu,

1666
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,060
that he's not like anti-change.

1667
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:42,500
He's just protectionist and he views his rigid control

1668
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,580
of the world simply as a means of protection.

1669
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,980
But now it's not about protection.

1670
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,980
It's about hating people who are just making things new

1671
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,380
and complicated and that makes you mad.

1672
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,340
And that's what I want.

1673
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,340
I can't wait for Nate to last Jedi Gurren Lagan

1674
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,380
and take a beloved protagonist

1675
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,420
and turn his ideals on its head.

1676
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,260
That's again, that's what I want.

1677
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,860
On her agenda, sounds great.

1678
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,500
That's great, that's called maturity.

1679
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,980
Look it up sometime.

1680
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,140
UrbanDictionary.com defines maturity

1681
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,620
as whatever Nate just said and it feels good.

1682
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,020
Okay, sick.

1683
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,260
Actually, I'm curious.

1684
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,060
Maturity is defined as what Urban Dictionary doesn't have.

1685
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,860
It's nice, cool.

1686
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,660
That's a great, that's really funny Urban Dictionary.

1687
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,180
That's a real dad joke in our show.

1688
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,820
Hey, you know what I did today?

1689
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,940
What's that?

1690
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:34,940
I bought 500,000 bells worth of turnips.

1691
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,780
Okay.

1692
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,020
My entire attic is filled with turnips.

1693
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,540
And God, please don't make me lose my investment.

1694
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,900
Somebody last week commented,

1695
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,860
Animal Crossing is the new politics of this show.

1696
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,380
Hey, that's an improvement.

1697
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,100
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

1698
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,380
Market spike.

1699
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,700
Market spike.

1700
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,020
Market spike.

1701
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,940
I have yet to purchase my first turnip,

1702
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:03,220
but this Sunday, I'm gonna keep my eyes peeled.

1703
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,220
I've got like 200K in the bank.

1704
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,060
I'm a risk at all.

1705
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,180
Today is, Nate, today is Sunday.

1706
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,020
Oh my God.

1707
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,500
Oh, she's already gone, isn't she?

1708
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,100
She already left, God damn it.

1709
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,940
You fucking idiot.

1710
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,940
Shit.

1711
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,020
She left at noon.

1712
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,140
Next Sunday then.

1713
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,180
Hey, speaking of it being Sunday

1714
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,620
and having something in the bank,

1715
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,500
guess what tonight is?

1716
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,260
It's money in the bank.

1717
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,620
It's a wrestling topic.

1718
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,940
Oh yeah.

1719
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,340
Is this the one with the suitcase talking about?

1720
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:36,340
It's the annual WWE Money in the Bank pay-per-view.

1721
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,940
And it's cool.

1722
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,260
I love wrestling and fucking wrestling

1723
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,620
because of the coronavirus and the quarantine

1724
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:48,140
is going insane, like all of it, everywhere.

1725
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,980
Yeah, it's just empty rooms, right?

1726
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,060
Yeah, it's mostly empty arenas.

1727
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,780
The other day, they did like a,

1728
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,060
Matt Hardy made his debut for AEW

1729
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,700
and he ended up running over Sammy Guevara in a golf cart.

1730
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,460
Look at this fucking sick picture I'm uploading here

1731
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,300
in a minute.

1732
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,380
Yeah, right.

1733
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,820
And you fucking suck it now.

1734
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,460
Come on, piece of shit.

1735
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,060
First of all, I've gotta react to this.

1736
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,700
Sephiroth, Happy Mother's Day.

1737
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,020
Out of my way, I'm gonna post that to my mom

1738
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,060
and hope she gets it.

1739
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,660
I see this image still loading.

1740
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:24,500
What a piece of shit.

1741
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,060
It doesn't sound like, I can't see the large image,

1742
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,740
but I see a boy as a young lad

1743
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,700
being running away from crazy Matt Hardy

1744
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,540
in a golf cart.

1745
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,260
Yes, that's what I'm trying to post.

1746
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,820
Who else is there in the cart?

1747
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,020
Okay, so that's Kenny Omega riding shotgun,

1748
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,500
hanging out the cart, saying to Sammy Guevara

1749
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,220
who's running away in a straight line

1750
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,780
like in that movie that everyone hates, Prometheus.

1751
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,660
Prometheus, whatever, yeah.

1752
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,100
He could just run to the left or the right

1753
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,860
to get away from the golf cart.

1754
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,580
Kenny is hanging out shotgun, pointing at him,

1755
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:58,180
saying, we're gonna fucking kill you.

1756
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,140
Matt Hardy, of course, is laughing like a maniac as he does.

1757
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,540
Like, right before he did it,

1758
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,660
Matt Hardy got in the golf cart

1759
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,700
and he looked to the cameras

1760
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,980
because this was all happening live.

1761
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,260
It wasn't like a pre-taped thing, like usual.

1762
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,820
So there was no way to fake this.

1763
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,780
Like, he really got hit with this golf cart

1764
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,240
and it looked fucking brutal.

1765
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,660
Yeah, that's a serious blow.

1766
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:23,060
So when Matt Hardy was getting in the golf cart,

1767
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,580
he looked at the camera and he said,

1768
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,780
I need you to document these events.

1769
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,380
And the commentators were like,

1770
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:35,140
we are Matt, it's on TV, this is live TV.

1771
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,660
We are documenting it.

1772
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,100
So that's fucking great.

1773
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,060
You've got people on that show

1774
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,980
running each other over with golf carts

1775
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,740
and the money in the bank pay-per-view, that's tonight.

1776
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,700
So normally what the money in the bank pay-per-view is,

1777
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,780
is that there's, it's a ladder match

1778
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,660
with like six to eight guys, you know,

1779
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,340
however many they can cram in there.

1780
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,260
And they're all scrambling to get up the ladder

1781
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,420
and grab the briefcase,

1782
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,260
because the briefcase has a contract for a title match.

1783
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,340
So that's what they do every year at around this time.

1784
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:06,260
But this year, because everyone is losing

1785
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:09,140
their fucking minds with cabin fever

1786
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,380
and we have to keep coming up with waste to entertain ourselves

1787
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,300
or else we'll all commit fucking suicide.

1788
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,980
Instead of doing just a ladder match for an empty arena,

1789
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,460
which would be like totally pointless and stupid,

1790
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,540
they're doing the money in the bank entire pay-per-view

1791
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:29,540
from the WWE corporate offices in Stamford, Connecticut,

1792
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,860
which is just like a big corporate office building.

1793
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,180
And they're starting at the first floor of the building

1794
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,780
and they're gonna fight their way to the roof.

1795
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,480
And I guess the briefcase will be on the roof.

1796
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,480
And I am like, I'm 99% certain somebody's going off

1797
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:50,660
of the fucking roof and somebody's going to die.

1798
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,500
Did you say how many floors it was?

1799
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,220
It's a tower, it's like a skyscraper.

1800
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,820
It's a tower, okay, okay.

1801
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,460
Yeah.

1802
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,700
Oh my God, the image finally load.

1803
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,500
Matt Hardy's manic fucking grin on his face is,

1804
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,100
that's good shit, that's good shit.

1805
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,140
Who's this boy running from him again?

1806
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,740
That's Sammy Guevara, the Spanish God.

1807
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,660
Oh, does he have a gun?

1808
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:13,900
No, it's just hand pointing.

1809
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,500
I thought it was a gun too.

1810
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,340
Okay, I was just looking at a gun.

1811
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,180
Well look, just shoot him.

1812
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,060
He does point like a gun, like that is his thing, so.

1813
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,140
Okay, it looks like he's holding a gun.

1814
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,500
So in Canon, it's a gun, yeah, sure.

1815
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,060
It's like an invisible fucking gun that he has.

1816
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:31,900
Oh, okay.

1817
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,100
Points at people before he runs them over.

1818
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,220
Yeah.

1819
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,060
Fantastic.

1820
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,900
Wrestling's cool.

1821
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,940
Well, keep me posted.

1822
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:43,020
I wanna know what the fuck happens in that.

1823
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,180
Does someone go over the roof?

1824
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,180
I'm 90% certain someone will go over

1825
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,300
and I'm 99% certain that if someone does,

1826
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,820
it'll be AJ Styles.

1827
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,820
Because he was the one who got buried by the undertaker

1828
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,100
at Wrestlemania, he got buried alive.

1829
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,980
And then he just recently showed up again,

1830
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,180
not mentioning it.

1831
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,060
So like totally like, yeah, whatever, I'm still here.

1832
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,900
I got buried alive and murdered, but I'm still fine.

1833
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,060
And also the other two guys in the match,

1834
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,740
Gals and Anderson, who the undertaker also murdered

1835
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,420
in that match, they were shortly after they were let go

1836
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,700
of the company because of like Corona layoffs.

1837
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,660
So they were fired, so they didn't show up again.

1838
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,420
So in Canon, they are just dead.

1839
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,060
Like they were never seen again.

1840
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,940
Undertaker murdered them.

1841
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:29,660
So AJ Styles was buried alive and killed

1842
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:30,940
and both of his best friends are killed

1843
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,380
and he just shows up and he's like, yeah, I'm better now.

1844
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,140
And now we're gonna climb to the tower

1845
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,900
and he's probably gonna fall off again.

1846
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,980
And like I'm hoping that AJ Styles' new gimmick

1847
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,420
is just that he's like immortal now

1848
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,340
and he falls off towers and yeah,

1849
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,580
it's gonna be fucking dope.

1850
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,340
Wrestling's fucking rad.

1851
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,820
Hey, by the way, I was just gonna say

1852
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,940
about the Animal Crossing thing before.

1853
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,660
Ben, Munchie, I and Kazzy,

1854
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:57,500
we all visited each other's islands the other day

1855
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,860
in Animal Crossing and it was a great time.

1856
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:05,340
And it was fucking sick as hell and I loved doing it.

1857
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,940
And we all hung out on various places

1858
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,340
and we all went to each other's islands.

1859
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,780
We went to each other's islands.

1860
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,100
We traded fruit. We exchanged fruit.

1861
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,460
I now have all the fruits, it feels great.

1862
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,140
Here's me, Munchie and Ben all gathered in front of my island

1863
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,660
or my flag on the island of Prophesia.

1864
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,180
I kept trying to give you pears

1865
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,300
but eating them by accident.

1866
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,940
Oh yeah, he kept eating the, he had three pears.

1867
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,460
He put one down on the ground and said,

1868
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,660
okay, Kazzy, he was giving me the Kazzy.

1869
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,860
I'm gonna now give you one.

1870
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,620
Proceeds to eat the fucking bear.

1871
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,100
Okay, I will now do it again.

1872
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,180
Eats the other one.

1873
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,020
Well.

1874
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:39,420
I found some extras though.

1875
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,300
I now have them all planted.

1876
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,300
I cannot wait for them to bloom.

1877
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,380
I'm gonna make orchards.

1878
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,580
It's gonna be sick.

1879
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,420
It's gonna be great.

1880
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:48,980
Don't you have to like pay for online?

1881
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:49,820
Yeah, I do.

1882
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:50,660
You did it.

1883
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,500
I fucking did it.

1884
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:56,500
I paid Nintendo 20 of my American dollars for one year.

1885
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,620
Ben is simping hard for Nintendo right now.

1886
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,700
I went for the full year.

1887
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,420
I forget who it is.

1888
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,020
It's like $9 for a month

1889
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,340
or you can just do like 20 bucks for the whole year.

1890
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,180
That's not bad.

1891
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,340
That's not bad.

1892
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,180
It's pretty fun.

1893
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,020
It's fun.

1894
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,140
Like years ago or like a year ago.

1895
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,700
I spent like, I spent $300 on the,

1896
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,460
like contributing to the RFCK Kickstarter.

1897
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,540
So like whatever, doesn't matter.

1898
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,660
I mean, I just got a deal.

1899
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,500
I forget when.

1900
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,380
We were talking about Switch stuff years ago

1901
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,700
and I think someone in the PCP comments just said,

1902
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,220
like, hey Nate, I'm on a family plan.

1903
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,580
I have an extra slot.

1904
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:34,540
I can just add you for free and you get Nintendo online.

1905
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,420
I was like, okay, let's do it.

1906
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,260
Let's do it.

1907
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,220
So I just have, comment on this video.

1908
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,940
I forget who it is, who is doing it, but you are.

1909
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,940
Yeah, someone did that for me as well, which is pretty based.

1910
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,020
It is thoroughly based.

1911
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:45,860
No doubt about it.

1912
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,680
So thank you.

1913
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,520
Thank you.

1914
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,220
It's helping me hang out with my boys on the internet

1915
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,140
and it feels good.

1916
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,260
But has no one got a comment on my flag?

1917
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,900
My flag that I'm so proud of for proficient?

1918
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,740
Oh, I already did.

1919
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,220
I still have this amazing wrestling image full screen.

1920
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,500
So I didn't even see the next one.

1921
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,340
Scroll down and look at my flag.

1922
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,340
Haha, it says gay epic.

1923
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,180
The R street is stunning.

1924
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,300
Thank you.

1925
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,140
That's all I wanted.

1926
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,260
That's all I, just an acknowledgement.

1927
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,780
Thank you, thank you.

1928
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,380
And I don't know why the image is sideways.

1929
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:19,340
I will fix that for the leg of the show notes.

1930
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,460
All right, well, that's all I had to say

1931
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,300
about Animal Crossing.

1932
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,620
It's a great time and I can't wait to develop my land more.

1933
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,140
Oh, I've got chrysanthemums.

1934
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,460
I'm gonna breed more chrysanthemums.

1935
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,100
Hazy and Munchies land is like a barren wasteland.

1936
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,020
It's like an undeveloped third world country.

1937
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,060
It is embarrassing.

1938
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,620
It's a disaster zone.

1939
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:38,900
Didn't they just start playing?

1940
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,340
Yeah, I know.

1941
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,900
No excuses, no excuse.

1942
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,080
But it's funny to say it.

1943
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,820
Here's the punchline to my wrestling anecdote.

1944
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,820
Someone already made a meme of the image

1945
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:51,460
of Sammy running from the golf cart.

1946
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,260
There it is, there it is, everybody.

1947
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,820
This is just such a boomer meme.

1948
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:56,940
But what can you say?

1949
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,660
What more could you expect from R slash memes

1950
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:03,140
by you slash glorious Gilmore?

1951
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:04,460
Thank you, sir.

1952
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,300
For your contribution.

1953
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,580
William Gilmore, he's a critical role fan.

1954
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,420
God damn it.

1955
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,540
The fact that the meme maker's name is on it

1956
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,340
makes it better and I hope no one would cut that off.

1957
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,180
I think he's so proud of this meme.

1958
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,260
I hope he forever gets credit for it.

1959
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,700
Wait, did you think he manually added that

1960
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,660
or is that just like something

1961
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:26,020
that's automatically generated via R memes?

1962
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,900
I hope he manually added it.

1963
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,620
That would, I mean, he really should have watermarked this.

1964
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:30,460
He doesn't.

1965
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,980
No, that's gotta be an auto gen thing.

1966
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,460
Well, for sure.

1967
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,900
They're doing God's work either way.

1968
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,900
Meme attribution is just cringe in general.

1969
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,460
Just like memes are meant to be,

1970
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,700
memes are in the public domain by default.

1971
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,300
Memes are the new currency though, Tom.

1972
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,500
They're the new social credit score.

1973
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,100
This is what we'll be using when the lockdown ends.

1974
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,140
We're transitioned to a new government style

1975
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,900
where it's based on your gamer score, basically.

1976
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,740
And that's what I want.

1977
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,860
You're telling me that we're,

1978
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,220
out of all the possible systems we could implement,

1979
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:01,060
we found the one thing that was worse

1980
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,820
than capitalism and went with it?

1981
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:03,780
I sure hope so.

1982
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,060
It sounds great to me. God damn it.

1983
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,100
You know what?

1984
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,260
Sometimes there's threads on V on 4chan

1985
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,380
about like how many platinum trophies you've gotten

1986
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,740
speaking of gamer scores.

1987
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,500
It dawns on me.

1988
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,220
I don't think I've ever gotten a platinum trophy

1989
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:19,060
on any of like my PS4 games and, you know, it should-

1990
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,460
Because you do things with your life, Nate.

1991
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,540
It bothers me a little bit

1992
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,700
that I've never gotten a platinum trophy.

1993
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,500
Just a, not even one.

1994
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,620
I know I shouldn't care, but I kind of do-

1995
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,780
Time for the new saga of Nate

1996
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,140
trying to get one platinum trophy.

1997
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:33,980
Okay, I've committed-

1998
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,620
I mean, you'd platinum Kingdom Hearts too, of course.

1999
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,220
That would be the game to platinum for you.

2000
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,220
There are games that I have definitely done everything in.

2001
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,180
The first one I ever did was Super Mario Bros.

2002
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,140
2 Advance for GBA.

2003
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,700
I did literally everything in that game

2004
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,260
and I got all the check marks on the thing.

2005
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,220
God, that felt good.

2006
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,500
You know, I feel so like ripped off by the world.

2007
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,100
Like, I used to 100% games all the time.

2008
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,260
Back in the day, before there were no trophies,

2009
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,820
before there was proof that you could fucking show people.

2010
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,420
Now all these kids, you know,

2011
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:08,380
they get these fucking participation trophies

2012
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,860
that they get for everything

2013
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,260
and they just go, oh, look what I got.

2014
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,100
I got a nice little thing on Icon on my PS4

2015
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,800
for doing a thing in a game

2016
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,980
that any fucking baby shit could do.

2017
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,060
You know, you get a damn trophy nowadays

2018
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,340
when you're just watching a cutscene.

2019
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,180
Back in my days, I fucking 100%

2020
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:26,020
a goddamn Donkey Kong 54 and I didn't get shit for it.

2021
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,860
Oh, and that's a grind to fucking 100% that shit.

2022
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:29,980
Jesus Christ.

2023
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,260
I believe I, no, I didn't 100% it,

2024
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,620
but I was replaying Banjo.

2025
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,940
I didn't even beat Banjo 2e

2026
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,980
because I got a little bit bored, like halfway through.

2027
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,500
Banjo Kazooie, I loved

2028
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,740
and was happy to like basically 100% that.

2029
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,060
I got the fucking ice key, man.

2030
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,980
I got the fucking eggs and shit,

2031
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,700
as many as you can get by entering those fucking passwords

2032
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,060
in the horrible ass fucking password

2033
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,860
entry thing in the sandcastle.

2034
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,260
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2035
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,460
That's a fucking Vietnam flashback.

2036
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,540
Just take the 10 minutes to enter those.

2037
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,580
Yeah, that sucked.

2038
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,460
But I did it, man.

2039
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,860
I needed to complete it.

2040
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,100
So yeah, I guess that's 100% completion.

2041
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:10,980
They should like, if you get like a platinum trophy,

2042
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:14,020
they should send you a physical trophy.

2043
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,020
It should be like getting a plaque on YouTube.

2044
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,220
You should get some certificate of achievement.

2045
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,100
Maybe they could print out or something.

2046
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,220
No, because that could be faked.

2047
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,420
That shit can be faked.

2048
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,460
You need an actual signed,

2049
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:28,260
but like the Dean of Video Games at Video Game College

2050
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,260
should give you an award.

2051
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:31,620
Yeah, I agree.

2052
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,660
So that when I apply.

2053
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:36,260
Melt down the disc and turn it into a trophy.

2054
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,860
There's no reason to play anymore.

2055
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,380
Yeah, it makes sense.

2056
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,100
When you 100% the game, you have no need for it anymore.

2057
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,300
The PS4 just starts spinning really fast

2058
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,260
and it just melts your disc into a trophy

2059
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,100
and spits it back out.

2060
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,420
I mean, we talked about enlightenment.

2061
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,900
The video game exists, right?

2062
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:53,180
To just feed you visual and auditory and input,

2063
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,820
tactile feedback.

2064
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,460
Once you've absorbed all that information,

2065
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:00,340
you're just that step closer to enlightenment.

2066
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,820
And yeah, there is no need for it to exist anymore.

2067
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:04,480
You could just give it away or whatever.

2068
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,580
But I was thinking about this because

2069
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,660
I was looking at the trophy selection for the FF7 remake

2070
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,580
since I beat like the super boss.

2071
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:16,380
And I feel in myself, I have done the biggest

2072
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,340
and most important things in the game,

2073
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,180
but then they're like,

2074
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,740
well, why don't you play every chapter on hard mode?

2075
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:24,620
I'm like, hard mode isn't even hard in this game.

2076
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:28,220
It's just annoying with the like MP conservation thing.

2077
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,920
And I already found a way to exploit the system,

2078
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,140
which is just when you find one of those boxes

2079
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,300
that you break to get MP back,

2080
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:39,500
you just break it, get the MP, save and reload the game.

2081
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,240
And the box just reappears.

2082
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,660
So you can just do that as much as you want.

2083
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,300
Cause it's terrible game design in my opinion.

2084
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,140
It's not challenging.

2085
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,260
It's just annoying.

2086
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,300
So I don't know, I don't feel bad about it at all.

2087
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,580
Point is, point is,

2088
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,380
there's a bunch of these fucking challenges

2089
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,740
that aren't even fun.

2090
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:57,140
Like when I first did the like the Don Corneo raid,

2091
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,020
yeah, I got everyone's worst dress.

2092
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:01,900
I got Tifa's worst dress and heiresses and clouds.

2093
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,980
But then I did it again and I got their best dresses.

2094
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,540
And now the game wants me to go through it again

2095
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,660
and get the middle dresses.

2096
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,980
No, no, I don't have time for that.

2097
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,220
That's fucking annoying.

2098
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,900
I had to go back stupid.

2099
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,900
And do like, because I missed one of the Colosseum battles

2100
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:23,240
in Corneo, like the, one of the extra heiress battles.

2101
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,740
So I had to like, I had to, first I went back

2102
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,540
to like the chapter before you saw him the tower,

2103
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,260
thinking like, okay, I'll go back here

2104
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,940
and I'll do all the Colosseum battles.

2105
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,300
Well, you can't select heiress

2106
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,180
cause she's not in your party at that chapter.

2107
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,020
So I had to go back to the chapter

2108
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,760
where you're in wall market with her.

2109
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,500
So I go back to that chapter thinking,

2110
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,740
okay, I gotta do her two stupid battles in this thing.

2111
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,740
Well, it starts you out at the beginning of the chapter.

2112
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,220
The Colosseum battle is at the end of the fucking chapter.

2113
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,640
I had to do the whole stupid shit all over again,

2114
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,900
going around talking to people and putting on dresses.

2115
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:58,340
Not good, make me mad, make me mad, make me sad.

2116
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,940
One of these things doesn't make the,

2117
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,580
like this doesn't make the game like awful,

2118
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:04,580
but because the game is structured this way in chapters,

2119
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,060
that's been the story of my fucking life.

2120
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,660
Like replaying sections of the chapter

2121
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,220
in order to get to the place where I can now do things.

2122
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,420
We used to just call this end game content

2123
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,080
and you could just do it all at the end.

2124
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,020
But because we got chapters here,

2125
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,620
that's just like a unique annoyance

2126
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,640
of this particular style of game.

2127
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,580
I mean, it's not the end of the world,

2128
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,780
but it was fucking annoying.

2129
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:24,480
And now that I beat the secret boss,

2130
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,940
I think I clocked in 75 hours to beat all this shit,

2131
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,820
to finish like everything of note in the game

2132
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:32,160
as far as I'm concerned.

2133
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,500
And I don't know, Superboss was pretty fun.

2134
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:38,060
I enjoyed it, but that chapter shit

2135
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,540
was full of the fucking birds.

2136
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:40,380
I don't even want to complain anymore.

2137
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,380
It's just gonna give me more shitty comments

2138
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,420
I have to fucking respond to.

2139
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,260
Yeah.

2140
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,300
See, I don't know, all things like that,

2141
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,540
I mean, when I make my video, I'm gonna mention that,

2142
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,500
but none of that is like a big deal.

2143
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,020
Like any fucking game has imperfections, you know?

2144
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,740
Like you ever like, you see a comment of someone

2145
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:01,780
who's like so wrong and like so aggressively hostile

2146
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:05,020
with their wrongness, like you have to respond to it.

2147
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:09,460
So like, you do that thing where you're so fucking mad

2148
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,860
that you take each fucking line

2149
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:13,220
and you respond to every line with a fucking paragraph

2150
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,940
explaining exactly why the person's fucking wrong.

2151
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,780
And then I got it and I got this like massive retort

2152
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,660
and I'm looking at it, it's like after,

2153
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,220
like by the time I'm finished writing it,

2154
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,900
I don't even want to post it anymore.

2155
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,540
And it just sits there and I'm like,

2156
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,380
well, what the fuck do I do with this now?

2157
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:30,580
I don't know, save it for a fucking script later, I guess.

2158
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,140
So like, it's like, I don't want to click post

2159
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:33,980
because like there's no point

2160
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,300
because then he'll just respond to it

2161
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,340
and I'll be caught in the loop forever.

2162
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,540
So like I tab over and then I'd like go about my day,

2163
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,940
I don't have the spirit to,

2164
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,380
I don't have the strength of will

2165
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:46,540
to just close that tab and just forget about it.

2166
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:49,380
So the comment stays up, unposted in that tab.

2167
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,940
And then it happens again later in the week

2168
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,900
with a different comment.

2169
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:56,100
And then I just got multiple tabs up of like comment wars

2170
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,220
that only I know about that even the other person

2171
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,900
in the comment thread doesn't know is happening

2172
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,140
that only I have to bear the weight of and live with.

2173
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:04,980
I have done that.

2174
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,940
This is why every site has to adopt

2175
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,820
the way Newgrounds does comments.

2176
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,660
It's perfect.

2177
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,500
Which is what?

2178
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,940
Because on Newgrounds, someone leaves a comment

2179
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:18,020
and then the artist, only the artist,

2180
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,020
the person uploading the content can respond once.

2181
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:24,060
Oh my God, you're describing a perfect world time.

2182
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,500
You're describing everything I've ever wanted yet.

2183
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,660
It exists on Newgrounds.com.

2184
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:30,940
I would sell my fucking soul to have that on YouTube.

2185
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,020
You know, the only thing is I,

2186
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:36,980
when I see a comment like that, there are some comments

2187
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,500
that they say a certain thing.

2188
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:42,180
And I know for them to have reached this conclusion,

2189
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,940
there has to be so many things,

2190
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:47,540
like I can see their whole history arcing backward

2191
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,980
to know like all the things that have happened in their life

2192
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,300
that have led them to this point.

2193
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,300
And all the like skewed perspectives

2194
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,700
they have to have brought to the table

2195
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,140
to have interpreted what I was saying

2196
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,460
in this particular way.

2197
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:00,180
And luckily I'm able most of the time

2198
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,980
to quickly do the calculus in my head of,

2199
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,660
okay, I know in order to express my point

2200
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,740
and correct this person,

2201
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,100
it would take me way too much time.

2202
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,900
Because like you can't even just tell them

2203
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:13,700
the thing they got wrong and expect them to understand it.

2204
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,540
That's not enough.

2205
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:15,620
You have to like do the detective work

2206
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:19,060
of like telling them what happened in their life

2207
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,580
and why their entire perspective on the world

2208
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:25,340
has been wrong from day one in excruciating detail.

2209
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,900
I feel that a lot, I feel that a lot.

2210
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:31,700
Well, hey, we've been talking for a while.

2211
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,100
If you want, we got voicemails.

2212
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,140
We can go to them unless anybody else wants to, you know.

2213
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,260
Let's fucking do it, dawg.

2214
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,580
Yeah, let's make it happen.

2215
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,900
Okay, just a moment, I'll bring them up.

2216
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,020
Speak pipe, link, ladies and gentlemen,

2217
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,060
down in the description.

2218
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:47,340
Let me just mention about the RFC kick starter.

2219
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,260
We won, we won the game.

2220
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,100
We did it.

2221
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,620
Day one, you guys made like 7,000, 5,000, right?

2222
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,100
7, 20, 7, 250?

2223
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:56,940
Right.

2224
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,860
It's like 7,000 change.

2225
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,580
I donated a bunch at the end to meet that last goal.

2226
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,420
And we're gonna make like a million fucking,

2227
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,380
I'm going to, have I talked about talking

2228
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,180
to the fucking Chinese people on alibaba.com?

2229
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:10,580
Not here, so yeah, clarify.

2230
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,340
I have like talking to a bunch of people

2231
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,460
and like I have to haggle with them.

2232
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,620
I have to like, I've been talking to one,

2233
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,460
been like, shipping is like that much?

2234
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,900
Like, ah, you could get me a better shipping rate, right?

2235
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,420
And she's like, oh, it's kind of high right now

2236
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,500
because of COVID, but like maybe if we like

2237
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,540
order in like a month, then maybe it'll be lower.

2238
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,780
Like, okay, just give me the sample.

2239
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,460
And talk to this other guy who's like, okay,

2240
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,860
we can make you these, but they'll be cheaper,

2241
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:38,020
but they'll be iron, but that's okay.

2242
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,660
But because they're iron, we can only cut certain shapes.

2243
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,260
Like, we can't cut all these shapes.

2244
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,860
You can only cut like most of these shapes.

2245
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,540
It's like, ah, okay.

2246
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,340
So it's like, okay, maybe we'll go with those

2247
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,740
for like some of them.

2248
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,820
And these, this other guy for some others.

2249
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,660
I don't know.

2250
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,500
It's very complicated.

2251
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,460
I've been like going back and forth

2252
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,460
with a whole bunch of fucking people.

2253
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:57,300
The struggle is real.

2254
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,660
This will be a sad one.

2255
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,940
The struggle is real, but we're gonna make like,

2256
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,300
when I've make the order, and like a couple of weeks

2257
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,780
or a month from now, I'm going to be receiving like,

2258
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,860
like dozens of pounds of like huge bags of like

2259
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:12,220
thousands of items, and I'm going to hold them

2260
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:15,660
and dive into them like Scrooge McDuck.

2261
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:20,060
I personally put down $60 for like seven pins or something.

2262
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,660
He jumped into a bunch of pins.

2263
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,260
So they're gonna have like the things.

2264
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,220
No, I'm gonna take those off.

2265
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,660
I'm gonna take those off first.

2266
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:30,660
You want the real shit, the raw experience.

2267
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,700
And that's what I'm gonna do with my seven pins

2268
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,100
added to my pin pile.

2269
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,940
I'm definitely getting the slime corp pin,

2270
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,380
which is the only canonical pin that already exists

2271
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,220
in Canon.

2272
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,260
So that's the good one, obviously.

2273
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,100
I guess so, yeah.

2274
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,940
And I gotta get the big coin.

2275
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,580
I want a big old fucking slime.

2276
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,420
You get the big coin.

2277
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,620
Is the final vote up?

2278
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:51,140
Is it counted?

2279
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:54,700
I wanna know if that gun girl pin is actually gonna be

2280
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,300
made or not.

2281
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,420
Okay.

2282
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:00,060
Well, this might be the final vote.

2283
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,500
And let me, let me, let me, let me, let me,

2284
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,460
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2285
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:04,300
The final,

2286
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,780
I mean, if you have to look things up.

2287
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,180
No, I don't have to, I'll just need to look at the fricking,

2288
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:12,260
just look at the vote and see what's going on there.

2289
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:14,660
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2290
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,060
The voting booth.

2291
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:20,340
Okay, I said in the chat that it was like the vote for four.

2292
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,540
I think it's actually gonna be at least,

2293
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:26,940
if there's no new designs,

2294
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:29,220
then I think it'll be for at least seven,

2295
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,260
possibly more.

2296
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:35,260
So like, it looks like probably gun girl will get made.

2297
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,580
She has 15 votes.

2298
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,780
And there are a bunch with more than that right now,

2299
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:40,620
it looks like.

2300
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,940
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2301
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,020
Like seven more pins will get added.

2302
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:49,860
I think we funded, we needed to vote for four

2303
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,060
when the poll went up,

2304
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,060
but then we hit three more during the stream,

2305
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,220
I think, unless I have that wrong.

2306
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:58,100
So yeah, I think seven.

2307
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:58,940
So what is this?

2308
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,220
It looks like the top votes now are four.

2309
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,460
Gun girl is number four.

2310
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,940
Number 10 is the top one, I think.

2311
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:08,940
The slime heart, the levy, jevy, stay dead.

2312
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,100
The mega slime.

2313
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,940
The mega slime, gun girl, and then.

2314
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:18,140
Six, which means.

2315
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,180
Investor.

2316
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,940
Right, right.

2317
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,500
Kola already picked can man.

2318
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,100
I think Kola already picked can man as her choice,

2319
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,060
so I'm gonna skip that one.

2320
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:31,020
And then, wait, E is mega slime.

2321
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,700
Looks like you're in the clear with gun girl though.

2322
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,660
It looks, yeah, probably.

2323
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,500
More or less.

2324
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,060
By the way, can I, is there a number of times

2325
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,060
I'm allowed to vote?

2326
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,580
Cause there's a couple I just wanna throw a vote on,

2327
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,420
just for fun.

2328
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:42,260
No, you freaking ding dong.

2329
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,580
You vote for any, vote for as many as you want.

2330
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,420
Okay, just check.

2331
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:48,180
Like the point is that if everyone just votes yes

2332
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,820
on the ones that they would want.

2333
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,140
They all evens out anyway, right?

2334
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:51,980
Yeah.

2335
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,180
Then the ones that will get made will be the ones

2336
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,020
that the most people want.

2337
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,860
Right, I thought so.

2338
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,700
Okay, okay, cool.

2339
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,660
So yeah, vote for as many as you want.

2340
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,500
Sick.

2341
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,340
Well, there you go.

2342
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,140
I mean, so if you pledged, did you,

2343
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,260
I assume you pledged, Gib.

2344
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,420
How much did you, how many pins did you spring for?

2345
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,380
Gib pledged, Gib was like the first one to pledge.

2346
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:06,220
Yeah.

2347
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,300
Yeah.

2348
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,580
I was excited.

2349
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,060
Cause I knew, cause it's like, they're cool.

2350
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:11,900
How many pins did you get though?

2351
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,220
I have a place for pins.

2352
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,340
I think I'm getting 13,

2353
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,860
but like two of those count for the challenge coin.

2354
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,660
Oh yeah, right, right.

2355
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:20,500
Yeah.

2356
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,320
Sick.

2357
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,900
So yeah, a bunch.

2358
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,740
Nice.

2359
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,500
Well, congratulations on a successful Kickstarter, Ben.

2360
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,340
Yay.

2361
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,180
It is very nice.

2362
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:31,020
I just had to update you.

2363
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:31,860
Another one I've supported.

2364
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,700
By the way, I just want to say,

2365
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,860
I really think that this like Kickstarter

2366
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:38,900
for specific projects thing is a smart way to go business-wise.

2367
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,380
That's what Kickstarter is for.

2368
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,220
I mean, no, you're right,

2369
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,740
but I plan on doing like more small Kickstarter.

2370
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:45,060
I just think it makes sense.

2371
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,140
And like as long as you deliver successfully,

2372
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,780
cause like it, cause the reason it is good

2373
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:52,780
is because you basically can get the,

2374
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,060
you basically get paid for it.

2375
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:58,380
Instead of like investing the money to spend,

2376
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,620
it might theoretically be cheaper to do it yourself

2377
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:03,940
because you don't have to like pay any Kickstarter fees.

2378
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,540
But, you know, aside from that,

2379
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,780
it's safer because if you run the Kickstarter,

2380
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,340
then people pay for it ahead of time

2381
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,780
and you don't assume the risk of like investing in product

2382
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,380
that you then must hope will sell.

2383
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,220
Right, right.

2384
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:15,060
That's very true.

2385
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:15,900
You know if there's market interest.

2386
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,740
Yeah.

2387
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,580
Exactly right.

2388
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:18,420
And I don't know, like Mia,

2389
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,820
I mean, yeah, that is a big one right there.

2390
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,660
And then you have the additional benefit of like,

2391
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,260
as opposed to, I mean, I don't know,

2392
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,860
I plan on personally like having a Patreon model

2393
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,460
going forward for a long time.

2394
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,660
And then also when there are specific projects

2395
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:32,620
trying to get people to fund those, you know, in addition,

2396
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:35,060
like me and Digi will eventually do our thing probably

2397
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,060
and do like a Kickstarter for like, I don't know,

2398
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,940
like some amount of money for some product

2399
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,300
on the other side or whatever.

2400
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,180
I don't know, just an idea,

2401
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,500
but I don't just seems like a good idea.

2402
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,380
All right, anyway, that's all done.

2403
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:48,620
So if you didn't get any pins too fucking bad,

2404
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,460
you missed your window.

2405
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,500
You'll have to wait for,

2406
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,500
I think we might do these once in a while,

2407
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,020
like maybe six months from now or a year from now,

2408
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,140
maybe we'll do this again and we will,

2409
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,540
and again, you will be able to,

2410
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,820
people will can submit their own vote and like,

2411
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:04,660
but like all the ones that got made this time

2412
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,540
will be available to be made next time too,

2413
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,540
because the manufacturers will keep the molds.

2414
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:11,100
So we won't have to pay for them to like, yeah.

2415
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,460
So we'll be able to order like another hundred

2416
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,940
of like an old design at like, you know,

2417
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:18,540
just for the manufacturer costs, which is pretty low.

2418
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,380
Yeah, that's sick.

2419
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,220
That's sick.

2420
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:21,460
So I think that's the plan.

2421
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:23,380
I think that's, yeah, they're not gonna be available

2422
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,820
just to buy any time you want,

2423
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,300
but they will be available through like,

2424
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,060
future events like this.

2425
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,180
Cool.

2426
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,860
Well, voice mail time, ladies and gentlemen,

2427
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,780
leave, click the link down below

2428
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,820
if you wanna leave voice mails at the speak pipe link

2429
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,700
and with their good, we'll plan.

2430
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,580
So let's get to them.

2431
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:43,900
Oh, this is a public service announcement from beloved,

2432
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,780
so this is like of the pre voice mail one.

2433
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,460
It's Marinpan, one of our admins

2434
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:50,100
from the PCB Minecraft server.

2435
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,980
It's something he wants everybody to know.

2436
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,580
Let's hear he has to say, go.

2437
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:58,900
Hey, remember that Pokemon MMORPG game freak

2438
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,700
is never gonna make because of their bad idea only policy.

2439
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:04,140
Well, it's been under your nose this whole time.

2440
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,940
Pixelmon is a sexy little mod that turns Minecraft

2441
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,900
into a fully functional Pokemon game

2442
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,700
with mechanics up to date with ultra sun and moon.

2443
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,820
And this May 20th, you, that's right you.

2444
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,740
Look at me when I'm fucking talking to you.

2445
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:20,580
You have the chance to become the coolest guy.

2446
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:23,260
Come join the procrastinators, Minecraft servers,

2447
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:26,540
first Pokemon championship tournament for your chance

2448
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:28,380
at the highest title in the land,

2449
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:31,420
in video games and in IRL.

2450
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,220
For the next few days until the tournament

2451
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,180
we'll be disabling the wireless, so you can come in,

2452
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,780
build a team and show the world you know about Pokemons

2453
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,500
live on Shekels for Hekels.

2454
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,060
Stay tuned for monthly free days,

2455
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:48,220
be there or be square.

2456
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,500
There you go.

2457
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,420
Okay.

2458
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,740
I could tell he was trying to think of something else

2459
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:55,580
to say.

2460
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:59,340
So when this episode goes up, it'll be Friday the 15th

2461
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:00,780
and the tournament is on the 20th.

2462
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,820
That's right, that's right.

2463
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,660
So definitely as of today.

2464
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,980
So you will have five days to get into Pixelmon,

2465
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:09,900
the PCB Minecraft server and get a team together.

2466
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,540
We will presumably there will be future tournaments

2467
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:16,380
in case five days to do that is kind of a compressed frame.

2468
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,020
Well, you know, I talked to MarinPan about that specifically.

2469
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,900
So it turns out there is,

2470
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,580
I mean, the people who are already in there

2471
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,900
have been planning for this for a while.

2472
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,820
Yes, that's right.

2473
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:27,820
So just to be clear, on the 20th, on this channel,

2474
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,660
the P ProCrastinators podcast,

2475
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,220
we are streaming on the Shekels for Hekels,

2476
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,660
a Pokemon tournament in the Pokemon,

2477
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,140
the PCB Minecraft server.

2478
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,460
It's gonna be great.

2479
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:38,500
And yes, the MarinPan, the guys are organizing it.

2480
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,020
There will be prizes and all that good stuff.

2481
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:43,420
If you just want to be in the tournament

2482
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,940
and just get humiliated,

2483
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,740
they just go in there, catch a bunch of shitmonds,

2484
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,660
enter the tournament, lose in the first round,

2485
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,140
but we will have to acknowledge that.

2486
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:50,980
That's fine.

2487
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:53,220
But even beyond that, there's another thing going on,

2488
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,300
which I mean, Ben was getting at,

2489
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,020
which is that we are opening up the PCP Minecraft server

2490
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:01,100
for everyone for several days until the tournament.

2491
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,500
So we wanna see people just hanging out in the server,

2492
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,260
watching the tournament with us.

2493
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:09,420
It's an event we're doing just to get people to come hang out

2494
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,540
for a couple of days and shit.

2495
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:11,380
I get it.

2496
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,460
Yeah, yeah.

2497
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,060
Now I fucking get it.

2498
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,340
It's all the pieces are coming together.

2499
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,860
So we'll have in the description.

2500
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,220
I don't know exactly how it'll work,

2501
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:20,980
but we will have a write-up,

2502
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,620
I think MarinPan was putting together one,

2503
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,740
of links to everything you need to join the server.

2504
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,820
And again, it's gonna be open to everybody

2505
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,900
for a span of five or six days or whatever,

2506
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,900
so you can come in, you can just spend a few minutes

2507
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,500
and look around the world if you want.

2508
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,180
You can join the PCP Minecraft server

2509
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:38,020
for free, temporarily.

2510
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,780
That's right, for about a week or so.

2511
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,020
And after that.

2512
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,860
Until the tournament.

2513
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:44,060
And we're thinking of doing future events like this.

2514
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,020
How cool would it be?

2515
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,780
How cool would it be to have the stands packed?

2516
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:48,620
It would be odd.

2517
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:50,180
With little Minecraft CDs.

2518
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:52,420
Your little Minecraft boy will be visible

2519
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:54,460
on this channel during the stream

2520
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,300
as we are watching the tournament live.

2521
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,140
You could be in the stadium.

2522
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,980
That sounds really fun.

2523
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,820
That sounds really cool.

2524
01:32:58,820 --> 01:32:59,780
It's a fucking great idea

2525
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,860
that MarinPan and Lumia came up with.

2526
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:04,100
I had talked about competing in the tournament,

2527
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,540
but even back then I was like,

2528
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:09,620
boy, I feel like I'm so far behind on catching mods,

2529
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:12,100
and now I must be so far behind.

2530
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:12,940
Well, let me tell you,

2531
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,740
because I was curious about this too.

2532
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:18,740
So by far the hardest part is catching the Pokemon.

2533
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,140
And by the way, there is a write-up,

2534
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,220
I'm sure it'll be in the show notes,

2535
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,820
about the specific rules for the tournament.

2536
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,620
Catching the Pokemon is the hard part,

2537
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:29,580
but leveling them up and EV training them

2538
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,420
is actually super easy,

2539
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:33,100
and it takes a little bit of time,

2540
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:36,300
but the old, the horseshoe crew house

2541
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,700
that exists in the spawn point,

2542
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,180
like Mage set that up when she was admin,

2543
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,860
to just make it really easy to grind all your Pokemon

2544
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,940
to like level 100 in like a few minutes

2545
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,460
against these like level 100 Blizzies.

2546
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:48,300
With the Blizzies, right?

2547
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,060
That's right, and EV train them too.

2548
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,820
So it's the other stuff that's harder to do,

2549
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:55,980
but actually getting level 100 Pokemon pretty damn easy,

2550
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,940
and the boys on the server will tell you all about it

2551
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:58,780
if you want to stop by.

2552
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,220
I don't know how to EV train,

2553
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:03,900
but I do, I got all my guys to level 100 with the Blizzies,

2554
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:08,060
but it takes like 10 minutes of Pokemon if it's bad.

2555
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,780
So I don't even fucking know how EVs work, frankly.

2556
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:11,740
I don't know how to reset them.

2557
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,100
I don't know anything, but I've been told

2558
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,940
that it's easy to do.

2559
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:14,860
Oh, if you give them a Thunderstone,

2560
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,500
it turns into a Jolteon.

2561
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,200
Yes, shit then.

2562
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,580
Besinga, indeed my good man.

2563
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:22,980
So there you go.

2564
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,480
So I mean, even if you don't want to participate

2565
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,780
in the tournament, it would just be really fun

2566
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,700
to just be on the stream with us.

2567
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,140
On the 20th, which is by the way,

2568
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,780
at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, is when we're starting.

2569
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:34,860
Just come hang out and spawn.

2570
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,100
Let's have a big fucking party on the server.

2571
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,260
You don't have to pay anything to stop by

2572
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:40,180
for the couple of days.

2573
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,740
So fuck it, man.

2574
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,580
Do what you want.

2575
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:43,420
It's gonna be a good time.

2576
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:45,260
That is pretty hype, I gotta say.

2577
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:48,100
It's gonna be sick, it's gonna be sick.

2578
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,940
And our boys, our admins,

2579
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:51,500
have more plans coming in the future.

2580
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,200
So hey, do you like Minecraft?

2581
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,100
We're, you know, we've been hearing these thoughts

2582
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,820
of like, oh, you know, I like Minecraft,

2583
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,280
like PCP, blah, blah, blah,

2584
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,980
but not to Pixelmon.

2585
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,460
We are working on some ideas

2586
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,540
to address those concerns as well

2587
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:06,140
in ways that give everybody what they want.

2588
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,380
But we'll get back to you on that.

2589
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:09,940
We got, we're cooking up some ideas.

2590
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:10,780
Anyway.

2591
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:13,660
Maybe I'll hop back in the server

2592
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:16,700
so that this week in a fuck around with my team

2593
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,540
a little bit.

2594
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,380
That's a good idea, that's a good idea.

2595
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,200
Everyone's welcome.

2596
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,040
We can have, I don't know,

2597
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,420
a big old fucking tournament as long as we want.

2598
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,420
Okay, onto the next one.

2599
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,620
So, okay, here's our first big boy one.

2600
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,460
How many more, how many more?

2601
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,460
I think we have a total of nine.

2602
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,300
Oh, God.

2603
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:32,140
Okay, we'll go through that.

2604
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:33,900
We'll strap in for another hour.

2605
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:34,940
Holy shit.

2606
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,180
It will go through him fast.

2607
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:38,400
I promise, guys.

2608
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,500
All right, this is a good one.

2609
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,740
Here is a Discord at everyone rant.

2610
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,780
Go.

2611
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:47,220
Why does everyone get so fucking angry

2612
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,940
when you add everyone on Discord?

2613
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,300
Like, what the fuck?

2614
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,820
It's just a notification.

2615
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:54,860
Why are you so pissed?

2616
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,820
I didn't like kill your dog or anything.

2617
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:58,280
Jesus Christ.

2618
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:59,120
Everyone.

2619
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,940
I have like never seen anyone where I add everyone.

2620
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:04,340
And then it's like, they're fine with it.

2621
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:07,500
Everyone is fucking mad for some stupid reason.

2622
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,380
It's retarded.

2623
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,900
It's a notification.

2624
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:13,300
If you don't want it so much, turn it the fuck off.

2625
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,180
There you go.

2626
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:19,020
Thoughts, agreement, disagreement, valid.

2627
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,700
But also it's valid that everyone's mad.

2628
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,060
They're both right.

2629
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,700
Yeah, yeah.

2630
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:28,100
I feel like, you say turn it off,

2631
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,100
but I don't know why that it always,

2632
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:34,940
like at everyone's always give me notifications anyway.

2633
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:37,300
Even if I mute and like suppress them,

2634
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,140
it just doesn't work.

2635
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,460
I feel like it just doesn't work too.

2636
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,620
Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I don't know.

2637
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:43,940
Like I mute the entire server.

2638
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,780
I mute the chat.

2639
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,300
I mute every chat just because I don't like notifications

2640
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,380
and I check them periodically.

2641
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,820
But at everyone's and at here's,

2642
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,380
they still, they just seep through.

2643
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,500
I don't know how it works.

2644
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,260
I feel like I'm missing something.

2645
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,740
But hey, I did want to say on a larger point here.

2646
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,500
So recently I realized what I should have been doing

2647
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,580
all along was I think I saw you doing this Gib.

2648
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,420
When I've been streaming, I'm like, oh, you know,

2649
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,620
I should just like let people know I'm doing this

2650
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,140
in more places than Twitter.

2651
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:12,020
So I've just like added people on like my patron server.

2652
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,180
And then also, I think in the PCP one.

2653
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,540
And I've got a couple of people being like,

2654
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,340
oh, I got two notifications.

2655
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:20,100
I'm seething with rage about that.

2656
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,580
And they're not wrong.

2657
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,660
I get it.

2658
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:25,180
But I'm wondering how much I should care

2659
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,980
that one or two people are mildly annoyed

2660
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:30,900
by an at like that, you know, at that time.

2661
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,140
Doesn't matter.

2662
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:35,860
Like the worst that could happen

2663
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,580
is that they leave your Discord.

2664
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,420
That's true.

2665
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,700
Reverse Spectrum, fuck you.

2666
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,940
I think it was Reverse Spectrum.

2667
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:42,780
Keep seething, bro.

2668
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,580
But like, you know, I posted my Discord at everyone

2669
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:49,140
whenever I have like a...

2670
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:52,020
I mean, I add everyone into the Discord.

2671
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,500
I add everyone into the ones that I run.

2672
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,140
Yeah, I mean, the PCP one, I was thinking like,

2673
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:58,740
I mean, you know, I know it's not my Discord,

2674
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,340
but I figure there's probably people here

2675
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,060
who might be interested in seeing it.

2676
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,860
So is it, is it a, you know.

2677
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:05,340
It's not a problem when we do it.

2678
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,860
It's if you're in someone else's server

2679
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:10,660
and you add everyone, that's when people like do like stop.

2680
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:11,500
Yeah.

2681
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,500
Like that's what people get mad about.

2682
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,020
That's the run of the mill annoying shit.

2683
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,220
I mean, what you should do is you should just go

2684
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,500
into your server settings and disable

2685
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,340
at everyone function for anyone but you.

2686
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:24,060
Before the Iowa caucuses and before Super Tuesday,

2687
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,900
I went into like a bunch of different servers

2688
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,060
and I didn't care.

2689
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,020
I just added everyone.

2690
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:28,980
I was like, remember to vote.

2691
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,300
Remember to vote for Bernie Sanders.

2692
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,660
Right, of course.

2693
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,460
I knew I would get banned.

2694
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,300
I didn't care.

2695
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:35,140
Did you get banned?

2696
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:38,420
I only got banned from one server.

2697
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:39,700
And I don't even think I got banned.

2698
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,540
I just got kicked.

2699
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,460
Was it the Ted Cruz fan server?

2700
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:46,420
It was in a server that I absolutely did not care

2701
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,620
about being in at all.

2702
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:51,620
It was from the Amy T Falcone fan server.

2703
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:52,660
Do you know who that is?

2704
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:53,980
No, I'm gonna Google it though.

2705
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,740
She was one of the contestants on strip search

2706
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,020
and she is a Penny Arcade.

2707
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:01,140
She's a Penny Arcade orbiter now

2708
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:04,980
and now she's on the Acquisitions Incorporated C team.

2709
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,100
Well, that's cool.

2710
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:06,940
Oh yeah, I remember.

2711
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:07,780
It was fine.

2712
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,100
But yeah, that was the only server I got banned from

2713
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:11,940
for relentlessly adding everyone

2714
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,780
telling them to vote for Bernie Sanders.

2715
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,220
Ben, please have mercy on them.

2716
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,740
They can only handle so much.

2717
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:19,700
Well, they fucking, they executed me.

2718
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,060
Well, fair enough, fair enough.

2719
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,180
It's out of my hands now.

2720
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:25,220
Amy Falcone fan server, just where I would wanna be.

2721
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,860
All right, well, all right, there it is.

2722
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,180
There's your info on that.

2723
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:29,580
All right, next one.

2724
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:33,740
This is a voicemail god, PCPPSA.

2725
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:34,700
Okay, I forget what this was.

2726
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:35,740
Let's find out.

2727
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:41,060
Yeah, I play Final Fantasy VII.

2728
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:43,620
I like using, you know, the spells,

2729
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:48,620
such as fire one, fire two, and fire three.

2730
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,020
Oh yeah, that's right.

2731
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:52,460
Okay, I'll play this game.

2732
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,660
What the fuck is this spells?

2733
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:58,500
What?

2734
01:39:58,500 --> 01:39:59,780
They spelled fire wrong.

2735
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,340
Kingdom Hearts is a bad video game.

2736
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:13,900
That's it.

2737
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,380
Go watch my live streams and watch the VODs.

2738
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:17,820
I have, all right.

2739
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,660
You still haven't beat Clary yet?

2740
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:20,900
I'm right there.

2741
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,460
I'm just training for her right now.

2742
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:23,420
We're making a plan.

2743
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:27,140
I have never watched a BGE Nuzlocke

2744
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,540
and I feel like it's mostly because

2745
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:31,860
of a large time investment.

2746
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,740
Like how many episodes is that?

2747
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:35,500
How many hours of my time is that?

2748
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,660
You should watch, it's called Value for Money.

2749
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:40,180
That's totally understandable.

2750
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:41,620
I don't blame anybody who doesn't like,

2751
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:42,460
who isn't like doing a task.

2752
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:45,780
Zero money and how many countless hours of content.

2753
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,900
How many people have watched like my eight,

2754
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:50,660
my six hour Ratchet and Clank two stream?

2755
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:53,180
It's a lot of value for no money.

2756
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,220
And it was fun, but like,

2757
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:57,100
I don't expect any of you to watch that.

2758
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,420
Well, sure, sure.

2759
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,260
How many people have watched the legend

2760
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,780
the entirety of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers,

2761
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,740
Pokemon, XD, Gale of Darkness things?

2762
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,580
I think not all of those.

2763
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,420
It's billions, not all of those.

2764
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,740
Billions.

2765
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:08,580
With a B.

2766
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,500
It's just a matter of like putting in the tedious work

2767
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:14,700
of like cutting it down to highlights.

2768
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:16,100
True, true.

2769
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,620
But what you know, for my first Nuzlocke,

2770
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:20,740
no Needra did that, I believe.

2771
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,660
I think he's the one who made a full,

2772
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:25,700
like the entire Nuzlocke for Diamond up to,

2773
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:29,140
like he made it like in a couple days before the Elite Four.

2774
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,820
And he really killed it with that.

2775
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:32,140
It was fucking sick.

2776
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:34,620
Yeah, I think I may have looked at that.

2777
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:35,660
I don't know, what was it?

2778
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,140
Like, how long was that?

2779
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,260
It was probably still like 20 minute video highlights.

2780
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,380
Yeah, yeah.

2781
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,100
I mean, a lot of fun stuff does happen.

2782
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,500
So I think that was a pretty great video personally.

2783
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,620
I mean, it like condenses like the,

2784
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,220
I had to grind friendship.

2785
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,500
So there were like several episodes

2786
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,940
of me just walking back and forth

2787
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:56,500
while we just talked about whatever on the stream.

2788
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:59,700
See, that's kind of more of what I would like

2789
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,420
is like the stories you can tell,

2790
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:04,460
like D&D-esque stories of you doing strange,

2791
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,260
funny things on your Nuzlocke,

2792
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:09,060
rather than watching like a really long video highlighting it.

2793
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,620
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2794
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:11,460
Like a lecture.

2795
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:14,460
Someone do a lecture on the fucking Nuzlocke.

2796
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:18,380
Like the grinding story I've heard you tell before.

2797
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:21,100
And I was like, yeah, like I can appreciate the,

2798
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:23,380
I can get the gist of why that's cool

2799
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,780
without having to experience all of it.

2800
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:26,700
Yeah, yeah.

2801
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,860
Oh my God, I was playing Pokemon Flip,

2802
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:32,580
or sorry, the Voltorb Flip in the gold,

2803
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:35,460
what is it like, the Goldenrod Casino yesterday.

2804
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:38,580
And when I realized that like, when you went around,

2805
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:43,260
I had to get 14,000 like Pokécoins or whatever it is in there

2806
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,980
in order to buy the TMs I needed of Swords Dance

2807
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:50,300
for Heracross and Thunderbolt for my based electrode,

2808
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:51,380
Lubshorne.

2809
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:55,100
And so I could one-shot that fucking Gyarados piece of shit

2810
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,060
with the electrode.

2811
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:58,420
After using a light screen turn one, baby.

2812
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,380
Fuckin', I, when I was realizing

2813
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:05,900
how ineffectual and pathetic I was at that game

2814
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,140
and how if you make a mistake,

2815
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:10,460
you can be kicked down from like the higher level

2816
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,300
of fighting tiers all the way back down to level one.

2817
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,220
It was then my third eye open, I realized,

2818
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:18,260
wait, I'll just use save states and cheat.

2819
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:20,300
It's the greatest idea I've ever had.

2820
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,060
And then I did it and it was great

2821
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,740
because you can't even lose money.

2822
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:26,540
You can only lose time in that game

2823
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,820
because there's no monetary investment.

2824
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:30,500
The house literally cannot win.

2825
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,100
You can only lose.

2826
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,820
So I allowed myself to do it.

2827
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:36,460
That's a funny story in context,

2828
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,540
but it's not that funny to watch for like three hours

2829
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,980
of me grinding it to have that realization later.

2830
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,180
I mean, I don't know, me and the people,

2831
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:46,300
we talk about fun stuff while we're doing it or whatever,

2832
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,540
gushing about rage and seething about the remade,

2833
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:50,660
et cetera, et cetera.

2834
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,500
Every now and, you know, that's,

2835
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:53,500
it's been like a highlight reel,

2836
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,340
like the YouTube nuzzle locks,

2837
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:56,860
like my nuzzle locks are basically,

2838
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:58,420
they're basically a highlight reel.

2839
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:01,220
But like, there was no original or there was.

2840
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:04,180
I only talk during certain parts.

2841
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:06,260
But I still get comments.

2842
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,820
Every now and then, a little YouTube notification

2843
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:12,620
with someone that's like, dude, I watched this again.

2844
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:14,740
Like I watched this back in the day,

2845
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,900
please do another one.

2846
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:18,340
And I'm like, I want another Ben nuzzle lock too.

2847
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,180
I mean.

2848
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:20,020
I know.

2849
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,980
Have I already said what I'm thinking?

2850
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:23,380
Yeah, you said of a, not Yo-Kai watch,

2851
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:24,700
but the other one, the Temtem.

2852
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:27,500
I was considering, and I don't know if it's a good idea yet.

2853
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,340
I have to look into it,

2854
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,180
but I was considering that maybe

2855
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:32,900
when I get back to streaming, whenever that is,

2856
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,020
whenever I'm ready to do that,

2857
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:36,060
I will start a new nuzzle lock

2858
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:38,460
and it would be a Temtem nuzzle lock.

2859
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,500
And then I would probably cut it down

2860
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,140
and make like a highlight YouTube show.

2861
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:44,980
I think probably.

2862
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:47,540
As the number one fan of your nuzzle locks,

2863
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,020
I want that to exist.

2864
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:53,020
The only, I don't know how nuzzle lockable Temtem is.

2865
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:56,460
Like it seems like it is, but it seems like it's,

2866
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,300
I don't know.

2867
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,140
You might need to really say how it looks.

2868
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:58,980
I was making Temtem.

2869
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:01,580
I would absolutely make sure it's compliant with nuzzle locks.

2870
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:04,100
I think there is like a nuzzle lock mode.

2871
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,420
Oh, well that'd be sick.

2872
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,420
Or maybe it's like,

2873
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:07,580
oh, well that'd be sick.

2874
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:12,020
Or maybe there might actually just be a nuzzle lock mode.

2875
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,540
That would sure take the fucking pain out of me.

2876
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:16,860
But you know, Pokemon Uranium had a nuzzle lock mode

2877
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:21,860
and it made me really mad because there was a, okay.

2878
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:26,700
It seems one of the rules that it imposed on you

2879
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:29,660
was that it would not let you catch duplicates, right?

2880
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:31,820
But it did not count different Pokemon

2881
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:34,980
from the same evolutionary line as duplicates.

2882
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:37,580
So if you had a tentacruel,

2883
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:41,420
if you had a tentacool and you found a wild tentacool

2884
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,540
and you didn't catch it, right?

2885
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:46,460
It would consider that to be the one you're allowed to catch.

2886
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,620
And it would be like, no, you can't catch anymore.

2887
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,460
Like that was your chance.

2888
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:52,820
Even though obviously, obviously the spirit

2889
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:55,940
of the dupes clause is that, no, that would be a dupe.

2890
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,420
Like that's effectively a duplicate.

2891
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:58,540
Fuck you, okay?

2892
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,540
Yeah, that sucks.

2893
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:02,420
That the Uranium nuzzle lock mode

2894
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,500
had that one glaring flaw that made me so mad.

2895
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:07,660
And that might be why I didn't end up playing that game.

2896
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,500
Lamar.

2897
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,340
Fair enough, fair enough.

2898
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:13,820
But, you know, maybe I could go back and do that.

2899
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:16,340
Maybe we could go back and do that for like RFCK

2900
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:17,580
because it's like toxic waste mutation.

2901
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,380
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

2902
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:21,700
Ooh, my brain.

2903
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:24,100
I mean, that would be a long-term commitment

2904
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,500
doing a full nuzzle lock one of those.

2905
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,340
But I mean, I would love it.

2906
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:28,380
Oh dude, it'll be just like Pokemon XT Gale of Darkness.

2907
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:29,380
It'll be the greatest time ever.

2908
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,500
No, it's such a great game.

2909
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,340
No, no, no.

2910
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,180
It won't be miserable at all.

2911
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,020
It won't be the worst thing you ever,

2912
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,340
just for like a year of your entire fucking life.

2913
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:36,180
Do it.

2914
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:37,020
I love nuzzle locks.

2915
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:37,860
I would watch that.

2916
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:38,860
I want to see that.

2917
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:40,580
Oh, oh my God.

2918
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,420
That's a great idea.

2919
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:42,420
That's a great idea.

2920
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,940
Briefly on the subject of highlights,

2921
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:49,620
I really feel like I might at one time

2922
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:52,820
want to go back to my given gaming streams

2923
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:55,340
and like sift through them to find like the good moments

2924
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:58,140
because there are a lot of like really, really funny

2925
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:01,260
like Game Grumps-esque like laughing moments.

2926
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:02,340
But they're so buried.

2927
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,180
Like nobody knows about it.

2928
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:04,020
You need like an editor, man.

2929
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:04,860
Like me and three other people.

2930
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,780
Someone who catalogs this shit to do that kind of stuff.

2931
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,180
The day is getting closer all the time.

2932
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:10,620
It is approaching.

2933
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,780
When I can, when I have,

2934
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:16,780
when I will have enough like saved up inventory

2935
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:20,260
of Let's Plays and highlights to relaunch,

2936
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:21,940
it's a blue glow channel.

2937
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,660
And that day will be glorious.

2938
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:26,980
There will be some, just a never ending stream.

2939
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:29,460
It'll be like you've entered the land of milk and honey.

2940
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:32,380
You found the promised land of funny Let's Plays

2941
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:36,740
where Mako energy flows from the ground.

2942
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:39,340
It's just gonna be, I think about all the time.

2943
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:42,140
I fantasize about this far off day in the future

2944
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,380
and it gets closer every day.

2945
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:46,780
Cause every day I accumulate more footage

2946
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:50,780
and I sit here and I tediously make my little highlight reels

2947
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,180
and I make the thumbnails.

2948
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:54,860
The other day I sat here for fucking three hours

2949
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:58,180
making thumbnails for all these like backed up clips

2950
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,540
of footage and I'm just, I'm like a mad man.

2951
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,740
I'm just sitting here plotting the day

2952
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:04,700
when I can be like, Hey, everybody, guess what?

2953
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,740
There's a schedule now.

2954
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,020
There's gonna be a funny Let's Play

2955
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,580
every day for the rest of your fucking lives.

2956
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,580
And they'll be like, Oh my God, we love this guy.

2957
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:13,660
And I'll be like, yes, money, all the beautiful money

2958
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,140
for all the entertainment for you

2959
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:16,820
and all the money for me.

2960
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,780
I want that man.

2961
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:19,860
I'm waiting for it.

2962
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:23,540
Hey, Jesse, where is, where is the like the,

2963
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:25,940
the Dark Souls thing that I was,

2964
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,140
Oh, Poise Boys.

2965
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:29,460
Like you were playing a Poise Boy

2966
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,740
and then S.H.I.E.L.D. O'Neill, my character.

2967
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:39,140
Me and Gibbon did like a multiplayer Dark Souls run together

2968
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:41,860
where the, where the conceit was we would try to,

2969
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,300
we would both make characters specifically maxed out

2970
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:47,460
in Poise just to kind of explore this forgotten stat

2971
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:50,060
in the series and it was called Poise Boys.

2972
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:52,340
And my character was called Tank McSpank

2973
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:54,500
and his character was called S.H.I.E.L.D. O'Neill

2974
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:56,940
and it was awesome and I have all the footage

2975
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:59,620
and I was looking for it the other day

2976
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:00,820
and I couldn't find it.

2977
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,740
And like I had this moment of like, oh my God,

2978
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:05,980
did I delete the Poise Boys footage at some point

2979
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:07,420
to like save on space?

2980
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:09,220
Oh no, I can't find it anywhere.

2981
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:10,140
I must have deleted it.

2982
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:10,980
What a fool.

2983
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,540
I could have, I could have finally used it.

2984
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,700
What a foolish, foolish man I am.

2985
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,340
But then miraculously I was going through

2986
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:21,060
like the, my little dashboard page on YouTube for the channel

2987
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:24,160
and like turns out I did delete them for space.

2988
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,600
But first I made sure to upload the raw footage

2989
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,720
as private videos so I still have it.

2990
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,400
I still have the Poise Boys footage.

2991
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,240
Thank God.

2992
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,880
It will be seen someday come hell or high water.

2993
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,160
Hmm, hmm.

2994
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,840
Excellent.

2995
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,680
Hell yeah.

2996
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,720
All right, let's move on to our next voicemail.

2997
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,080
We got plenty more to get through.

2998
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,720
All right, so this one is Shaggy

2999
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,840
gives us the good news by Jelly Beaner.

3000
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,000
All right, take it away.

3001
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Little brothers and sisters today.

3002
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,600
You'll be listening to a PCP passage

3003
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,200
from the patron saint of wrestling, Jesse.

3004
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:06,320
Please turn to chapter 69, page 420 man

3005
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,520
in your PCP branded Bibles.

3006
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:13,680
Let's hear the wise words of Jesse.

3007
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,200
Fucking Jews, mutilating our babies

3008
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,640
and selling their balls in a cold bag

3009
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,680
next to the ice cream.

3010
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,480
I hate Jews.

3011
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:24,680
Here, Jesse is clearly telling us

3012
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:28,000
exclamation point dab on the Jews.

3013
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,280
Now, where are those who pose the dabbing of Jews?

3014
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:38,120
They're like Jews in sheep's clothing, man.

3015
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:43,400
To them, I say exclamation point dab.

3016
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,440
Will the congregation please stand

3017
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:52,160
in all dabbing unison on the Jews?

3018
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,480
I'm up, I'm up.

3019
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,760
Everyone stand up.

3020
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,240
I'm standing. Absolutely.

3021
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,760
That is so fucking weird.

3022
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,080
That clip is- What's that from?

3023
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:00,920
I can't remember.

3024
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:01,760
Why did it end?

3025
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,400
That's it, that's the end of the sermon.

3026
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,080
I know, it's sad, I know, I know.

3027
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:06,840
Dab, isn't that from like fuck cars or something?

3028
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,960
It's from fuck pizza.

3029
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,600
And like- You're right.

3030
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,000
It's like someone just asked me about it the other day.

3031
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,680
Someone like messaged me like, where's fuck pizza?

3032
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:17,640
What did you delete fuck pizza?

3033
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:20,320
Like I didn't delete fuck pizza.

3034
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,320
It got fucking taken down for hate speech

3035
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:24,960
because of that Jew joke.

3036
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,800
Right, right.

3037
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,400
And it's like, you know, and like obviously,

3038
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:31,360
I don't remember the context, but the video's about pizza.

3039
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,600
I was fucking, you know.

3040
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,680
I think I remember, like you said something like

3041
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,520
how we cost at some point.

3042
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,360
That's right, that's right.

3043
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,800
Yeah, the punchline was how we cost.

3044
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,760
Cause that's why I was talking about,

3045
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:47,160
I was talking about how oven pizza is not real pizza.

3046
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:49,680
And it's not, it doesn't taste good.

3047
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,160
DeGiorno sucks, the commercials are lies.

3048
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:55,400
The oven sucks and from the oven became, you know,

3049
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:57,480
and became like a Jew joke.

3050
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:01,240
And because the Jew joke then went into the punchline,

3051
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:05,360
which was the fucking how we cost as in hungry howies.

3052
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:08,160
It was not, it was a fucking pizza joke.

3053
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:10,640
And they took down the video for hate speech.

3054
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,560
I mean, you know, obviously retarded,

3055
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,480
but I don't know, yeah, what can you do?

3056
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:15,320
That's YouTube for you.

3057
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:16,160
That's YouTube.

3058
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:19,160
Michelle got her Twitter taken down for,

3059
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:22,480
it was like a black guy pointing a gun at the screen

3060
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,960
and it was something about like a begun thought

3061
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,920
is was like her text and like that was considered

3062
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,480
like a violent threat or something,

3063
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,200
which I mean, it was a man with a gun.

3064
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,560
Okay, sure.

3065
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,600
But you know, it was a joke.

3066
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,480
You just can't, you know, when you're in charge,

3067
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,320
you just can't-

3068
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,560
No, it was big, it was big champ.

3069
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,400
It was big champ.

3070
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,240
Oh, that's right, yeah.

3071
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,080
A silent thing.

3072
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,680
Big champ is onto Michelle trying to, you know,

3073
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,520
subvert their-

3074
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,360
They wanted her oil.

3075
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,200
God.

3076
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:47,200
She was getting the word.

3077
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,680
I'm mad thinking about it.

3078
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,720
I'm mad all over again.

3079
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:53,000
How he cost is like the best joke I've ever fucking written.

3080
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,320
They took it from me.

3081
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,160
What can you do, man?

3082
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:59,600
Hey, let's move on to, what do we got here?

3083
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:03,440
Blasphemous Nats, Gold Dig Grotto.

3084
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,280
Jesse saves the PCP?

3085
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,680
Okay, apparently I think that's the full title.

3086
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,600
All right, let's take it away, go.

3087
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:12,200
Hey boy, what you doing down by the river?

3088
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,160
I'm searching for gold, mister.

3089
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:15,600
We ain't gonna find none.

3090
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,800
Ain't much of nothing around here no more.

3091
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,320
Why is that, mister?

3092
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,080
Well, once in the topics done dried up,

3093
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:22,960
well, saying the horse cock nostalgia

3094
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,320
is the only glue keeping them together

3095
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,160
is it's putting it nicely.

3096
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,960
Chatsky's gone and unshatsky.

3097
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:29,320
If the brothers make one more

3098
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:30,880
unfact check political statement,

3099
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,120
the dam's gonna burst.

3100
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:34,240
Mages dead, digital brother up

3101
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:37,160
and went on some kind of grid-based system of rule.

3102
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,480
All of ours are furry

3103
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,280
and hippos selling nudie mags of his juice starter.

3104
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,360
Say, ain't you seen the wanted posters?

3105
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,640
No, mister.

3106
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:47,040
Well, then PCB boys trying to skip town

3107
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,600
with that their OVA money.

3108
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,440
Sheriff, big news on the front.

3109
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,400
We found the boys camped out near the kick starters.

3110
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,080
Shit, let's go.

3111
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:01,720
All right, PCB boys, here's the fact.

3112
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,320
We enjoy careers now

3113
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,520
while you still got a little something left in ya.

3114
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,560
Hey, hey, god!

3115
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,040
Sir, I don't think they'll listen to no reason.

3116
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,520
Damn it, we're going in.

3117
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:12,280
Ah!

3118
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,200
They got me good.

3119
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:19,480
Oh, no, mister.

3120
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,560
Boy, look at me real.

3121
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,400
Get the fuck out of here.

3122
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,560
Them PCB boys might be high and dry,

3123
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,800
but like the whiskey from my pappy stash,

3124
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,920
they'll still give you that good kick when you meet me.

3125
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,040
Don't let them hook ya.

3126
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,600
Bad Con 5 isn't real, it's not coming.

3127
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,680
She sure fits the ass one.

3128
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:37,680
He's back!

3129
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,440
That's it.

3130
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,040
That's the end.

3131
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,360
I feel so comfortable with the whistle.

3132
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:47,720
How did Jesse save us?

3133
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,760
I don't understand.

3134
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:49,880
That was fucking amazing.

3135
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,000
I mean, that was nuts.

3136
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,160
I mean, the density of memory going on.

3137
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:54,520
Voice grail.

3138
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,440
Voice grail, I think Blasphemous Nat.

3139
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:58,920
Well, just put, yeah, I mean, I'm at, yeah, fuck it.

3140
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,840
Oh, that was Nat Blasphemous?

3141
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,920
Blasphemous Nat, Nat Blasphemous.

3142
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,120
I'll put Nat Blasphemous in there.

3143
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:08,600
Well, I mean, I'm going to nominate it for Voice Grail

3144
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:11,960
to basically, like, as like a smoke screen

3145
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,960
against what it's saying is absolutely true,

3146
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:16,680
we are running away with the Ovi money.

3147
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:19,240
Radcon 5 is all a smoke screen.

3148
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:20,840
We are moving to South America.

3149
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,840
There is no more content coming.

3150
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,480
This is the end.

3151
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:27,080
We will one day up and disappear into the wild west

3152
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,040
and right into the sunset.

3153
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:30,760
Oh, God, I just had a great idea.

3154
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,720
That whistle.

3155
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:32,840
That whistle was nuts.

3156
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:35,400
The little bit was the bomb.

3157
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,320
This is actually maybe too good an idea,

3158
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,160
and I shouldn't say it here because we might use it.

3159
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,240
Sensor this, Eleazar, please.

3160
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:41,800
But what if we...

3161
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,800
Yeah, never mind.

3162
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,240
Okay, good idea.

3163
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,640
Okay, on to the next one.

3164
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,960
That reminds me, go to onlyfans.com slash pump911.

3165
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:52,600
Oh, Christ.

3166
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:54,200
There's a whole new image on there.

3167
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:55,880
I'm going to take that voice.

3168
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:58,120
Every time I talk about it, I get a new person.

3169
01:55:58,120 --> 01:55:59,480
It's free money.

3170
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:04,600
Yeah, I'm saying that voicemail is in Voice Grail now.

3171
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:09,240
I'm going to canonize it in order to disguise its message,

3172
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,360
in order to recuperate its messaging,

3173
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,920
in the same way that Labor Day is about

3174
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,720
socialist protesters getting murdered by the cops,

3175
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:20,600
but it's okay.

3176
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,520
We made Labor Day a national holiday,

3177
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,360
so now it's actually about working hard.

3178
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,960
The government condones this, right?

3179
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:27,240
We've recuperated the messaging.

3180
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,040
That's what we're doing.

3181
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,800
Don't worry about the man behind the curtain.

3182
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,320
I'm also putting it in here so that he'll...

3183
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,160
Was that really the end of the story?

3184
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:35,960
I didn't quite understand.

3185
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,880
Did Jesse save the PCP?

3186
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:38,200
Did he?

3187
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:39,480
Is he the one who chased off the...

3188
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,200
I think he was coming back to finish the job.

3189
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:43,400
Oh, okay.

3190
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:48,200
I was dreading that it would just be another out-of-context Jew joke.

3191
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:53,160
We would then be inundated by dozens of the same fucking...

3192
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:57,720
Like some mad man out there is just flooding our inbox

3193
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:03,240
with us saying bad things about people by accident.

3194
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:06,520
I love a good out-of-context clip.

3195
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,880
It's my favorite.

3196
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:10,040
All right, next voicemail is...

3197
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:10,840
Don't do that.

3198
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:12,600
Let me see.

3199
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:16,200
Ranting Raoul, perpetually blue-balled.

3200
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:17,240
Okay, thanks, Raoul.

3201
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:17,480
Go.

3202
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,280
What are you guys' thoughts on Patreon and Sentence

3203
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:22,600
stuck in with the development cycle of video games?

3204
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,600
Like, I'm tired of seeing these shitty porn games

3205
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:26,280
perpetually stuck in early alpha

3206
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:30,280
because every fucker feels the need to cram their niche fetish into the game.

3207
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:32,520
To me, it just comes off as people giving up

3208
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,840
the integrity of the art just for a quick butt.

3209
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,760
Maybe it's a cynical take on games development,

3210
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,600
but god damn it, I just want a good set.

3211
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,440
Well, I see.

3212
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:43,960
He's getting blue-balled by these porn games not releasing

3213
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,320
because they're in development hell.

3214
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:48,760
I mean, games being in development hell in general is cringe.

3215
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,280
And stupid.

3216
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:55,800
And a big problem with the crowdfunding model, for sure.

3217
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,280
These porn games have no incentive to be finished.

3218
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:00,760
The longer the development takes, the more money they make.

3219
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,920
I can't blame, you know, somebody wants to do it, whatever.

3220
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:03,400
I get it.

3221
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,960
But like, a better model, I think, for a game,

3222
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:08,280
I mean, it depends on the size and scale of the project, obviously.

3223
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,920
But it seems to me that Kickstarter is a way, like,

3224
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:14,520
more manageable thing for, like, for the investor, for, like, the...

3225
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,840
Well, I mean, the danger of that is that

3226
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:19,000
you might get the funding you asked for,

3227
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,200
and then you might discover that you didn't ask for enough

3228
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:25,000
and you can't finish the project and you can't deliver on it.

3229
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,280
Like what happened with Charles Barkley, too.

3230
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:29,880
That's true.

3231
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:32,200
I mean, I'd like to think that they could,

3232
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,280
if in a situation like that, maybe,

3233
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,200
I mean, maybe it's overly optimistic,

3234
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,040
but you could just be honest with your audience and say,

3235
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,560
like, guys, we realized that this was beyond what we thought,

3236
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:44,920
so we're going to, like, open a second round of funding to do this,

3237
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,920
and maybe we'll offer some additional benefits.

3238
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,480
Yeah, I mean, that is the danger, too, I guess.

3239
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,600
Neither is perfect.

3240
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,360
But I mean, I would never fucking...

3241
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:59,640
I would never fucking a Patreon, a porn game, dev, so...

3242
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:03,160
Yeah, I would never pay for porn, but, you know,

3243
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,240
I could theoretically see myself supporting,

3244
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,600
probably via Kickstarter, a game that I thought was amazing,

3245
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,920
even, you know, I like porn games, so maybe that would happen.

3246
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,720
But a Patreon model, I...

3247
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:16,840
There's so many bad incentives with the Patreon model.

3248
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,960
You know, look at your boy, Yandere Dev, it's, you know...

3249
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:20,360
Yeah.

3250
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,120
There's some issues with that timeline.

3251
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:23,320
You know...

3252
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:25,480
Never pay for anything.

3253
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:29,640
If something was, like, very much in my wheelhouse,

3254
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:31,880
and I was like, this is exactly what I want.

3255
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:35,160
I might buy it, like, I might buy it,

3256
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,440
but I don't think I would...

3257
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:40,680
I can't see myself crowdfunding, like, a porn,

3258
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:42,600
like a porn game or something, because, yeah,

3259
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,920
because this is what happens, they end up in...

3260
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:45,880
I don't...

3261
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,360
The only time you should spend money on porn

3262
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:51,240
is a commission of, like, you getting...

3263
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:52,360
A very specific thing.

3264
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:56,040
Like, a very specific new, like, you know,

3265
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,960
the exact character you want in the exact way

3266
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:01,560
that they can do it, that otherwise would not exist.

3267
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,080
Yeah.

3268
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:04,840
If you really care about that sort of thing,

3269
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:06,920
I've always thought that, like, I mean,

3270
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:09,240
once you get that post-nut clarity, I mean,

3271
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:12,520
I often find, like, I've never spent money on porn,

3272
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,920
but I regret the time that I invested.

3273
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,200
I'm like, why was I concerned?

3274
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,800
I should have just rushed to the nut,

3275
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:20,920
and then I'd be free to go about my day doing other things.

3276
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:24,040
So I've always thought that it's not a particularly valuable

3277
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:25,640
commodity when...

3278
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:25,960
I don't know.

3279
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:28,840
I mean, I've never done it,

3280
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:31,080
but, like, I guess I get the idea.

3281
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,080
Like, if it's fine, I don't think it's down or anything.

3282
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:33,640
Yeah, whatever.

3283
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,080
If you want to do it, that's fine.

3284
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,320
But, yeah, I mean, I would always...

3285
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,480
The only times I've backed a campaign,

3286
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,360
I've literally backed two.

3287
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:44,120
Yours, Ben, for Vapors 2 or whatever,

3288
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:46,600
and this new one for the RFCK pins,

3289
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:49,720
because they're the only way I can get those things that I want.

3290
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:49,960
Those?

3291
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,280
Those are very small.

3292
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:55,080
Those are small, like, achievable projects.

3293
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:58,280
They are to be done within a specific, you know, frame,

3294
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:03,480
speaking of which, still waiting on the last four,

3295
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:05,240
but they keep telling me they're almost done.

3296
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:06,760
My guest artists...

3297
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,280
We thought dates are gonna open.

3298
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,200
Jade and Nexus have both told me,

3299
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,120
reassured me, again, of late,

3300
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:17,320
that their guest vaperettes are nearing completion.

3301
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:18,600
Okay.

3302
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:19,800
I'm sure.

3303
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:23,800
I believe that Munchie and Kazi will not be far behind with theirs.

3304
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:24,840
I have faith.

3305
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:26,760
Shane, maybe spend a little less time

3306
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,920
on the Animal Crossing Munchie and Kazi

3307
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:31,800
and a little bit more on finishing the vaperettes.

3308
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,520
Yeah, maybe get off of Snack Time Island,

3309
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:35,720
you fucking degenerates.

3310
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:38,920
Log back into reality once in a while,

3311
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:41,480
why don't ya, and wake up to your responsibility.

3312
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:45,080
Maybe if you looked up from your fucking smartphones.

3313
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,080
From your damn Pokemon Go machine.

3314
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:49,400
I fucking finished mine in 2019.

3315
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:53,080
Yeah, I've had yours and Cheesy Manfredo's

3316
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:54,680
for a fucking eternity.

3317
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:58,680
I'm sure they'll be worth the wait.

3318
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,120
I'm sure they'll be worth the wait.

3319
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:02,280
Well, it'll be pretty good, and I'm pretty sure,

3320
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:04,200
I'm pretty sure that at this point,

3321
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,600
probably there are people who have pledged to it

3322
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,360
and have just forgotten about it,

3323
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:11,080
and those people have already given up

3324
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,760
and probably have no expectations

3325
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,840
and will probably be floored and stunned

3326
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:16,360
and their jaw will be...

3327
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:18,280
Those socks will be rocked

3328
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:21,560
when they receive a package in the mail from yours truly.

3329
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:25,480
Ben, we call that the Ghost in the Shell Best Anime Ever Model.

3330
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:26,520
That's the way to go.

3331
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:31,720
Yeah.

3332
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:34,440
Keep them waiting so long it feels like a gift.

3333
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:39,160
It feels like there was never any hope or expectation.

3334
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,760
All right, next voicemail.

3335
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,400
How many more?

3336
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,520
Please end it.

3337
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,280
There's a total of four, and we can go quick.

3338
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,560
Christ.

3339
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:47,800
Zach C.G., I believe is the name.

3340
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,160
Okay, Zach, go.

3341
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:49,960
Did you, bro?

3342
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:50,840
Did you, bro?

3343
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:52,520
Where is rode the rack on four?

3344
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,240
Chapter five.

3345
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:56,280
You said that we'd get a fifth.

3346
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,520
Chapter, you know I'm not satisfied.

3347
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,600
Did you, bro?

3348
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:01,640
Did you, bro?

3349
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:03,320
Where is rode the rack on four?

3350
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,040
Chapter five.

3351
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,240
You said that we'd get a fifth.

3352
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:09,480
Chapter, you know I'm not satisfied.

3353
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:10,680
Oh!

3354
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:11,560
Did you, bro?

3355
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:12,200
Did you, bro?

3356
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:13,560
Give me that!

3357
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:14,520
Ride the rack on four!

3358
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,960
Chapter five, motherfucker!

3359
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:17,400
Chapter five.

3360
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:20,680
Yeah, you're right.

3361
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:27,720
Well, look, clearly nobody has time to be both an author and a psychologist, so he had to pick a lane.

3362
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:30,920
God, no, we need that constant.

3363
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:33,240
I don't know if I could say he chose wisely, but he chose.

3364
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:39,080
We need that content so that we can get, so we can have, I think it ties into the,

3365
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,960
the, the, the, not the OVA.

3366
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:44,440
All the Brad stuff, the lecture.

3367
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:46,840
No, no, no, this is the other fucking stretch goal we did.

3368
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:48,440
Music.

3369
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:49,640
The dojin, the dojin.

3370
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:50,680
Oh, yeah, the dojin.

3371
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:53,560
I, I think it might tie into the dojin.

3372
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:54,840
Maybe?

3373
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:57,640
That's maybe, I mean, it certainly could.

3374
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,120
Maybe.

3375
02:03:58,120 --> 02:03:58,920
Okay, whatever.

3376
02:03:58,920 --> 02:03:59,720
Whatever, I don't know.

3377
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,400
Still all very ambiguous.

3378
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:03,480
We must have the dramatic conclusion.

3379
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:05,480
Yep, yep, we need to know.

3380
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,160
Did they get to radcon four?

3381
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,760
Did radcon four happen?

3382
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:09,880
We'll just never know.

3383
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:10,280
I don't even know.

3384
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:11,000
We'll just never know.

3385
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:12,520
I don't know.

3386
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:14,040
Feels like it never happened.

3387
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:14,680
All right.

3388
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,880
You've been shamed, Iggy.

3389
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:18,760
Next one is, oh, okay.

3390
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:22,840
This is Final Fantasy VII Spells Such As.

3391
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,440
All right, sounds good.

3392
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,400
Let's go.

3393
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:29,000
This is a PCP PSA.

3394
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,080
I have an announcement for you all.

3395
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:38,520
I think, in my opinion, now is the time to get into BGE's Nuzla.

3396
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,320
Hmm, yes.

3397
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:44,120
He is hitting a point now where he is going to be grinding for a while

3398
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:48,120
for the final gym in HeartGold.

3399
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:51,880
I recommend catching up on all the episodes

3400
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:57,000
uploaded to his livestream channel and trust me, his rival,

3401
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,240
that they are all very action-packed.

3402
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:01,000
VMG, sign it out.

3403
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,680
You know, I forgot about this, but it's true.

3404
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:07,880
Final Fantasy VII originally just called him like Fire 1, 2, and 3.

3405
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:08,200
I could really forgot.

3406
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:08,920
Really?

3407
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,480
And this reminded me.

3408
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:10,280
Yeah, yeah.

3409
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:14,760
Wasn't it like a Fire Raga and Fire Rurara?

3410
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:17,480
Wasn't that already in other Final Fantasy games?

3411
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:19,080
Well, it was in.

3412
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:21,000
I know it was in eight onward.

3413
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,280
I thought it was in seven.

3414
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:28,840
You know, going back, in Final Fantasy, the only Final Fantasy games that came to the west

3415
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:35,240
were Final Fantasy I, I, IV, and VI, and I'm pretty, you know what?

3416
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:38,760
I really don't know historically if when Final Fantasy VII came out,

3417
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:43,560
they had adopted the like, like for the Fire, it's Fire, Fira, and Fire Raga are like the

3418
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,600
three main ones.

3419
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:45,800
I don't believe this.

3420
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:48,120
I think this is false.

3421
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:48,920
Dude, I checked it.

3422
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:49,640
I checked it out.

3423
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:51,240
FF7 had the one.

3424
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,920
I did not remember that it was the numbers, but yeah, they do it.

3425
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:55,720
No.

3426
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:56,680
I'm about to replay it.

3427
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:57,720
You're lying to me.

3428
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:58,520
I shall confirm.

3429
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,600
Oh, I'm going to play the PC one.

3430
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,400
I wonder if it maintains.

3431
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:06,920
Well, geez, I fucking googled Final Fantasy VII Materia, and why don't I have the answer yet?

3432
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,480
Because of the remake, Ben, that's why.

3433
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:13,400
Because the remake's clouding our cultural consciousness with this deluded,

3434
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,640
next voicemail, next voicemail.

3435
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:16,680
All right.

3436
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:16,920
Okay.

3437
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,400
Fair point.

3438
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:19,000
Oh, okay.

3439
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,480
We've got 15-year-old Sam and any, any success there, Ben?

3440
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:24,120
Here, I'll look at.

3441
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:28,760
No, I found, I found something that said Fire, Fira, Fira Raga, but no, but no,

3442
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:29,640
it's about the remake.

3443
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:30,680
It's about the fucking remake.

3444
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:32,440
I don't want to know about the remake.

3445
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:32,760
Die.

3446
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,400
I'll find it.

3447
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,760
All right, Sam, take it away.

3448
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:35,080
Go.

3449
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:38,440
Hey, PCP, long-time listener, first-time caller.

3450
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:39,400
I'm an A-head.

3451
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:40,760
That's besides the point.

3452
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:44,920
So now it's May 9th, and I started the One Punch Man Regiment May 1st.

3453
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:50,760
But by this time, I've doubled what I've usually been doing.

3454
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:58,680
And so what I want to say is progress is the best feeling a human can feel.

3455
02:06:58,680 --> 02:06:59,800
It's not the results.

3456
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:02,120
It's the knowing that you are getting better.

3457
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:03,000
Thoughts and opinions?

3458
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:06,280
Wait, what?

3459
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,760
He just said that progress is the best feeling.

3460
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,760
It's about the journey, not the destination.

3461
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:11,960
That's the meme.

3462
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,320
What's about the journey?

3463
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,480
Is this about just life advice?

3464
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:18,920
He was doing the One Punch Man Fitness routine for the last week or two,

3465
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,400
and we were saying it feels great.

3466
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:26,600
Yeah, if you imagine yourself as you are now, like, yeah, I feel all right.

3467
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:29,880
But imagine if you were way worse off, you know?

3468
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:33,240
Then it would be like, gosh, getting closer to this would be like,

3469
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:39,080
like, you don't feel constant elation that you are currently the way you are.

3470
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:42,360
It is always the feeling of getting better that gets you going.

3471
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:42,920
Right.

3472
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,680
It's about achieving that purpose.

3473
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,440
It's why purpose is better than happiness.

3474
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,680
Well, I mean, I certainly agree.

3475
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:55,960
But I think that happiness is a state of mind that is achieved sporadically

3476
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,240
through having lots of positive things in your life,

3477
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:01,960
one of them being purpose, and another one being, I don't know,

3478
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:04,520
whatever, health and things like that.

3479
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,320
I don't know.

3480
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,880
By the way, Ben, I did pull up.

3481
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:09,320
I just went to the wiki real quick.

3482
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:11,000
I found it on Cades of Gnarsh.

3483
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,280
Yeah, OK.

3484
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:13,160
So you see.

3485
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:14,280
I found it on Cades of Gnarsh.

3486
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:14,920
Yeah, it's true.

3487
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,120
They are numbered.

3488
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:20,280
They are like Cure 1, Cure 2, Cure 3, Ice 2, Ice 3.

3489
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:25,800
There is, on the heel materia, there are spells which are called Poisona and Isuna,

3490
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:27,320
but those are like Poisona.

3491
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:28,280
That's like a specific cure version.

3492
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:29,800
That's the spell to cure poison.

3493
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,000
So it's not, yeah, no.

3494
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:32,680
Right.

3495
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,000
Weird.

3496
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,240
Well, there it is, ladies and gentlemen.

3497
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:40,840
Anyway, by the way, let's not forget, this guy was 15-year-old Sam.

3498
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:46,200
Ooh, Sam, starting working out at 15 prime, primo time to start lifting.

3499
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:49,880
You're about to, I mean, you're about to fucking have a growth spurt if you haven't already.

3500
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:51,240
It's the best time.

3501
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:51,720
It's perfect.

3502
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:53,480
Right at the beginning of high school or whatever.

3503
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:55,080
You're going to be swole as hell.

3504
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:59,320
And by the way, it is a real thing, noob gains.

3505
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:05,000
Right when you start working out, the going from no exercise to some exercise is by far

3506
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,120
the biggest single jump in your fitness growth or whatever.

3507
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:12,440
So he just said he doubled his push-ups.

3508
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:13,720
What's the 80-20 rule?

3509
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:17,080
You get 80% of the results out of 20% of the effort.

3510
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,480
We absolutely applies to fitness, no doubt about it.

3511
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:22,040
So yeah, and then make it a habit, keep doing it, dog.

3512
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:26,200
All right, we've got one final voicemail in a similar vein.

3513
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:31,560
This one is, my fitness pal is the most flaccid app on the earth.

3514
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,000
All right, go.

3515
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:37,960
Nate, you bitch, mother, cock, suck, fucker, poof.

3516
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:42,840
Listen, you go around recommending my shitness pal.

3517
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,840
Listen up, bitch.

3518
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:48,840
Does my fitness pal track micronutrients?

3519
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:50,920
Oh, it tracks vitamin A.

3520
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,040
It tracks iron.

3521
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:55,240
Are you going to get your potassium requirements for the day from it?

3522
02:09:55,240 --> 02:10:00,200
Like, listen, listen, listen, listen.

3523
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:04,840
When you use chronometer or whatever else app you want to use to track your vitamins,

3524
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:07,400
you actually start to min-max your diet.

3525
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,920
You actually start to eat healthy.

3526
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:10,360
You actually start to eat spinach.

3527
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:13,320
Rather than it being like, spinach is this sort of gross food

3528
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:15,720
and I don't really know how much of it to eat, but it's healthy.

3529
02:10:15,720 --> 02:10:17,160
So I feel like I should eat one.

3530
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:21,320
You're like, no bitch, I need exactly 25 grams of spinach.

3531
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:24,440
So I can fulfill my vitamin A and vitamin K for the day.

3532
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:26,040
And you can go fuck off and die.

3533
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:28,200
And you don't even need to use these apps very much.

3534
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:32,920
It just gives you an understanding of like, oh my god, broccoli is so high in folate.

3535
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:37,880
This will help me min-max my stats and become a god so easily.

3536
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:41,400
Like, you don't even need to use it for long to get an intuitive understanding

3537
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:44,280
of which vegetables are useful and why you should eat them.

3538
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:47,240
Stop using my fitness pal and go fuck yourself.

3539
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:49,800
Also, love the show.

3540
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:53,240
All right, so that was pretty good.

3541
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:54,280
Sounds like good advice.

3542
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:55,880
What do you say, chronometer?

3543
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:56,840
I think that's what he said, yeah.

3544
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,520
I think my roommate uses chronometer.

3545
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:00,760
You know, I hadn't heard of it until I heard that.

3546
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:04,280
He showed it to me and I was like, it looks like that looks complicated.

3547
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:06,520
All you need to know is my fucking macronutrients.

3548
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:09,160
The protein, fiber, carbs, the...

3549
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:14,280
All you need to know is the more green stuff you eat, the bigger you become.

3550
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,320
Okay, well first of all, first of all, my fitness battle does track your nutrient.

3551
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:24,360
It does track your micronutrients, not just your macronutrients.

3552
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:25,720
I don't know, maybe not a ton of them.

3553
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:28,600
But I mean, potassium, one of the things he raised, it is tracked.

3554
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:29,240
It is in there.

3555
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:33,000
You just have to go to your nutrition tab in your calorie counting thing.

3556
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,480
So it is there and I have used it in the past before, but it is true.

3557
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:43,240
I definitely am an if-it-fits-your-macro shitter and I always was.

3558
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:47,400
But for the record, I was that at like my fitness peak.

3559
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:50,920
So I'll just, I think that Ben's 80-20 thing is true.

3560
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:53,320
Maybe chronometer is just better and I should switch to it.

3561
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:54,600
Maybe this one's a baby version.

3562
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:55,400
That's fair.

3563
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:02,440
But you can obtain incredible results by just counting your macronutrients and not

3564
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,600
worrying too much about your micronutrients.

3565
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:10,200
Because if you get your macros right, you will be eating good amounts of vegetable and,

3566
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:10,840
I don't know, stuff.

3567
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,120
I mean, sure, it's possible that you won't, but you should.

3568
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,720
And that should be part of what you do.

3569
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:16,760
It's kind of inevitable.

3570
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:19,960
So my thinking is that if you're getting your macronutrients right,

3571
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:23,720
that already commits you to a pretty significant commitment to just getting

3572
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,320
shit right overall in your diet.

3573
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:28,440
You probably will be getting your micronutrients pretty good as well.

3574
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:30,360
So you don't have to really worry about it that much.

3575
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:32,200
But his point is also valid.

3576
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:33,080
So I don't know.

3577
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:33,800
Try chronometer.

3578
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,320
See what works better for you.

3579
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,640
Just as long as you're putting some energy into it,

3580
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:40,040
you're probably getting a ton of benefit.

3581
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:42,680
As we said, newbie gains are the biggest single jump.

3582
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:44,840
So just be doing it at all and you're in pretty good shape.

3583
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:47,720
Next one.

3584
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:48,520
Next one.

3585
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:48,760
That's it.

3586
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:49,160
We're done.

3587
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:51,000
That was our last voicemail for all time.

3588
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,360
Now that they're over, I miss them.

3589
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:53,960
I feel the same way.

3590
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,880
Thank you, everybody, for leaving them.

3591
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:58,440
You can leave more at the speak pipe link in the description.

3592
02:12:59,240 --> 02:12:59,720
Keep coming.

3593
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:00,600
It was good batch.

3594
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,800
Good batch this month.

3595
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:02,680
Oh, you know what?

3596
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:06,760
We actually had one from Psy, where the gist was that the voicemails are bad

3597
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:09,240
and he hates them because they don't have continuity.

3598
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:10,840
And I didn't want to play little things.

3599
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:11,720
It was a bit long.

3600
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:14,600
Psy of YouTube or Psy of Relief.

3601
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:16,760
Oh, Psy of YouTube.

3602
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:18,200
Yeah, that guy.

3603
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:18,520
Really?

3604
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,800
The water park enthusiast.

3605
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,000
Yeah, he left a voicemail.

3606
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,040
And we didn't play it?

3607
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:23,640
It was kind of long.

3608
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:24,920
And it was just was.

3609
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:31,800
And I mean, he was saying that the voicemails are bad because the dick show does voicemails

3610
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:35,240
and there's a topic of discussion and there's continuity.

3611
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:36,760
Whereas with us, it's all random.

3612
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:40,600
So there's nothing for them to specifically talk about.

3613
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:44,040
And while I agree that could make it better and it might be good to be here.

3614
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:45,000
That's stupid.

3615
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,880
That sucks.

3616
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:48,040
That's just not the standard we're looking for.

3617
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:52,840
This show had topics for years and everyone did nothing but fucking complain about it.

3618
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:57,400
Well, to be fair, we never, I mean, we never like would tell people next week is a voicemail

3619
02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:00,520
calling with like a relevant voicemail or whatever.

3620
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:01,480
Maybe that, I don't know, maybe that.

3621
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:04,280
Did voicemail and topics even overlap?

3622
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:05,000
Okay, guys.

3623
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:05,800
Okay, guys.

3624
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:08,360
What's next week episode going to be about?

3625
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:09,960
Hey, that actually reminds me.

3626
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:13,000
We don't know what it's going to be about, but you know who will be there?

3627
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,240
FitMC is going to be here next time.

3628
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:16,120
And he's going to, yeah.

3629
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:16,520
Why?

3630
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:19,640
FitMC, we just talked to him and, I mean, me and Gabe were talking.

3631
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:20,920
We were like, we should get a guest.

3632
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,360
And then we said, let's get Fit.

3633
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:23,560
So he's going to stop by.

3634
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:24,520
Okay.

3635
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:25,400
I guess so.

3636
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,600
Yeah, why not?

3637
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,720
He's a good man.

3638
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,480
We've been saying we should have more guests.

3639
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:30,440
We say all the time.

3640
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:33,560
If you got a voicemail for FitMC, you should send that in.

3641
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:34,680
We should have FitMC.

3642
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,360
The same thing you want him to respond to.

3643
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:37,880
That's, you see, I'm glad we brought this up.

3644
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:38,760
That's a good idea.

3645
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:43,320
We should have FitMC on the Minecraft thing when we do the fucking battle.

3646
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:43,880
Yeah.

3647
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,080
Oh, is he going to be there?

3648
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:45,560
He should.

3649
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:46,760
He should.

3650
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:48,600
He should be a guest commentator.

3651
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:49,320
Yeah.

3652
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:51,320
I don't know if he cares about Pokemon at all.

3653
02:14:51,320 --> 02:14:51,880
Probably not.

3654
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:54,280
But it'd be funny just having that regardless.

3655
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:55,640
I'll ask him if he wants to.

3656
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:57,480
I mean, he, you know, it is, it is sweet.

3657
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:59,800
He was like, dude, I'm like, he was like stoked.

3658
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,640
Like now that he's had like a million subs,

3659
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:03,480
there's that thing that happens where he'd be like,

3660
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,000
Oh, do I want to like waste his time?

3661
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
But like, we have such like a little baby thing here.

3662
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,840
Do I want to bore him with an offer?

3663
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:10,360
But that probably, you know,

3664
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:11,800
they probably still like to get invited to things.

3665
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:14,040
What about, you know, who is that fucking guy?

3666
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:15,640
You're going to know him.

3667
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:19,400
The guy who on Twitter said that he would be on any podcast

3668
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,240
that has over like 5,000 viewers.

3669
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:22,280
Oh, McAfee, McAfee.

3670
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:22,760
McAfee.

3671
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:25,480
We should get fucking McAfee the week after that.

3672
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:26,440
We probably should.

3673
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:28,120
I mean, literally why not?

3674
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:28,680
He'll do it.

3675
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:31,480
You know, you say that and I understand the impulse,

3676
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:32,280
but like why?

3677
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:34,280
What are we going to talk to fucking McAfee about?

3678
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,400
Probably should spend a little time thinking.

3679
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:38,840
Like, okay, we could reach out to him.

3680
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:39,720
What will we discuss?

3681
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:41,160
Did you make the subject matter?

3682
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:42,280
The thing.

3683
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:43,000
The virus?

3684
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:43,640
The virus?

3685
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:43,720
The virus?

3686
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:44,520
Computer?

3687
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:44,840
Thing.

3688
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:47,480
Thank you for protecting my computer.

3689
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:49,320
Hey, thanks for fucking up my computer.

3690
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,240
Your software fucking sucks, asshole.

3691
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:53,240
I have a virus.

3692
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:54,200
Why did you do that?

3693
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:56,280
Why did you do that, mister?

3694
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:59,800
Did you really kill that guy in that woods or whatever,

3695
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:03,000
in Bangladesh or Bolivia or whatever it was?

3696
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:08,280
So I guess what I'm saying is I don't care about talking to McAfee,

3697
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:11,000
but if anyone else does, whatever.

3698
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:15,400
It sounds fun, but like we should think of what we would discuss with him.

3699
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:17,400
At least a little bit, I think, probably.

3700
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:18,120
I feel like did you?

3701
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:20,680
No, I think it'd be funny if it was like terrible and cringe.

3702
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,200
Yeah, we get him on and we're like, okay,

3703
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:24,280
so thanks for agreeing to be on the podcast.

3704
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:26,120
Who are you again?

3705
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:28,600
Oh, that's, see, you know, so like with Fit.

3706
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,440
That would be way funnier.

3707
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:32,840
I like, I haven't really been following every detail,

3708
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:34,200
like what Fit's been up to recently,

3709
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,200
but I know he's been doing like a bunch of,

3710
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:38,600
like these more like big community Minecraft things.

3711
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:39,640
I don't want to just say,

3712
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:41,240
hey, I haven't looked into this at all.

3713
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:42,440
I don't know what you're up to.

3714
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:44,040
Like, can you just like say it, please?

3715
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:44,840
Can you just like explain to me?

3716
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:48,200
Tell us what is, why you're here and who you are.

3717
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:54,040
We could start it with the classic justify your existence

3718
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:56,040
and just let them take it from there.

3719
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:59,000
Yeah, okay, so call in for Fit.

3720
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:01,640
Hey, Nate, we gotta fucking get out of here,

3721
02:17:01,640 --> 02:17:03,800
so we can call our freaking mom on Mother's Day.

3722
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:05,240
That's a half an hour, you're absolutely right,

3723
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:05,960
you're absolutely right.

3724
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:09,320
I just got a call from them on my phone and I didn't answer it.

3725
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:13,080
Bro, epic, suck a fuck, mom and dad.

3726
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,040
Yeah, all right, well, let's go do that.

3727
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:18,440
I gotta go fucking install Zoom and shit.

3728
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:20,440
Luckily, we're at the end of the episode anyway,

3729
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:24,600
so support us and show us your love at patreon.com

3730
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:26,360
slash the procrastinators.

3731
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:29,480
There are 27 bonus episodes that you can get access to

3732
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:33,400
for a measly $5 reduce, so go do that

3733
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:36,200
and have fun listening to them and support the show.

3734
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:39,000
And if you only want to do $1, hey, Patreon Discord,

3735
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,800
there's that, or give us more, always an option.

3736
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:44,200
Happy to take that money and put it to good use.

3737
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:46,840
You can, of course, play Minecraft with us.

3738
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:50,520
As we said before, it'll be free for like five or six days

3739
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:51,480
when you listen to this.

3740
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:53,240
I'm sure in the show notes we'll have links

3741
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:55,160
to appropriate guides on how to play

3742
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,520
because you have to put some fucking files

3743
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:59,160
in the right place, another right version, blah, blah, blah.

3744
02:17:59,160 --> 02:17:59,960
We'll help you out with that.

3745
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:03,160
And the tournament will be on the 20th,

3746
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,080
which is five days from now, or six days,

3747
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,280
or four days, whatever it is.

3748
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:07,640
So won't that be fun?

3749
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:09,640
Come join us in the Minecraft server

3750
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,640
and hang out with us while the tournament's going on.

3751
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:13,000
And it'll also be streamed here.

3752
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,920
And your friends can look on the screen and say,

3753
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,920
whoa, it's your fucking avatar.

3754
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:19,800
That's so cool that he's in Minecraft on YouTube.

3755
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:21,240
And you'll feel very special about that.

3756
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:23,320
And what else we got?

3757
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:23,800
That's it.

3758
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:25,560
Speakpipe, more voicemails, et cetera, et cetera.

3759
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:27,640
Twitter, at TPCrastinators.

3760
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:29,880
We'll be doing more announcements and all kind of stuff there.

3761
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:32,520
More rad content is being worked on.

3762
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:33,000
Take a while.

3763
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,440
We're kind of with some junctures,

3764
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,720
so we got to work on it for a while,

3765
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,320
but you'll see it before too long.

3766
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:39,160
So just hang in there, lads.

3767
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:39,960
And that's it.

3768
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:42,040
So thanks for being here this week, everybody.

3769
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:44,760
We'll be back next week with another one of these

3770
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:46,600
fit emcee hanging out with us.

3771
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:48,200
And maybe more guests to come in the future.

3772
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:49,160
We'll see you.

3773
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:49,720
See you.

3774
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:51,000
Past.

3775
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:51,800
Bye.

3776
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:52,120
Bye.

3777
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:52,600
Bye.

3778
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,160
Fuck.

3779
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:53,640
Fuck.

3780
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:54,040
Fuck.

3781
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:54,760
Sayonara.
