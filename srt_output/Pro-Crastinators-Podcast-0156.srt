Hello everyone, welcome to The Prolapsinators. I'm your host, Benjamin Saint of theprolapsinators.com

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,040
slash email. Who else is here? Question? Really fast. This is boring. Let's skip introduction

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,200
and get right to the meat of it, shall we? They call me Nate, and they call me Rosebud,

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,800
speaking of prolapsinators for a reason. If you know what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,560
You know guys, I think that we aren't giving ourselves enough credit. I think that we need

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,600
to, when people ask us what we do, we don't have to shy away from it. We can say that

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,080
we are professional lapsers. I mean, we prolapse. We shouldn't be so coy about it anymore. I

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,800
think it's bad for the perception of us in the greater world. We let things... We lapse

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,480
in a lack of judgment. We lapse in a lack of skill, you know? We just lapse and we lapse

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,320
and it just keeps... I'm gonna lap at your fucking blood if you come at me with that

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,200
big old knife. Oh, you stabbed me before I could do it. Man, I should make threats I

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,000
can't keep. We professionally blundered over and over into this situation we find ourselves

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,480
in today. I would like to demonstrate something for you. Please. Because I am home alone. There

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,960
is absolutely no one in my apartment right now. My family is gone and they have left

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,640
to go see Michelle's girlfriend, Michelle's mother in Hawaii. Oh, wait. How much of that

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
is accurate? Did they go to Hawaii? Yeah, they went to Hawaii. So you're home alone, huh?

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:56,160
I've been home alone for the past week. So what are you wearing? I'm wearing briefs and

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,880
that's it. Yeah. All right, that's all. That did it for me. We can go to Hawaii. Munchy,

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,720
munchy. Yes. Why wouldn't you go to Hawaii with the rest of them? I pine for Hawaii. I've been

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,000
wearing my Waikiki pink and white wristband to remind me of those Halcyon days, long past,

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
and to look forward to my next trip. You can't live in the past, Nate. You've got to throw that

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,880
shit aside. That's fair. That's fair. Well, well, Nate, there's a very good reason for that.

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,040
Because they did in fact offer me to go. They were like, you know, we're going to Hawaii. This

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:35,880
was like many months ago. You want to come along, right? I was like, you know, Hawaii's sure cool,

25
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,200
but and then I take off my heart-shaped necklace trinket and I open it up the inside and I see

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,080
a picture of the URL to apsadventures.com. I say, there's someone else I would like to see more.

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,600
And so that's that's why I'm that's why I'm going to London in July instead of going to Hawaii.

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh, okay. So is this like, I got it. I got it. Yes. So they they offered to pay what they would

29
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,160
have paid for Hawaii trip. Oh, that's very nice, which it was accounted to like to like one fourth

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,280
of the cost because going to London is really expensive. I would I would I would love to go. I

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,120
would love to go to London. But like you said, it's really expensive. And I just don't think I can

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,160
justify the cost. Okay, okay. Well, that's fine. There's okay, there's really fucked up. I don't

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,680
want to talk about this on the show. So is this is the hotel thing? Yes, it is the hotel thing.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,440
It doesn't it doesn't change the fact that it's still like prohibitive. I want to hear it,

35
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,560
what's the deal? Okay, so this is just crazy. So I calculate the plane ticket. And it's like,

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,800
it's like over like $1,000, like it's really expensive. And so I just I just say out loud

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,200
a mile, I'm like, man, this this thing is fucking expensive. This sucks. And she's like, well,

38
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,320
let me let me let me let me try and like, let me see if I can find a good price. I'm like,

39
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,120
okay, mom. Yeah, okay, all right. And then she does it and she finds a plane ticket that has a

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,720
bundled hotel room inside. So you buy, you know, it's a plane ticket and combination hotel room. So

41
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,800
you get a room in a place in London. It is less with the hotel room. That's what how is that possible?

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:27,400
I have no clue. So just to reiterate viewers, the plane ticket is more than if I got a plane ticket

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,920
and a hotel room for the entire stay. There's got to be a racket here. Something's going on behind

44
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,080
the scenes. Back alley corruption hotel deal. I have no clue. But so obviously, I just did that,

45
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,680
obviously, because like, right, why not? And so I just have a hotel room that will be mine in London

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,320
that I we can just retreat to when we want to. Are you staying with Gib? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

47
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,160
And you've got a fucking hotel. Yeah, shit. It's gonna be it's gonna be great. It's gonna be like

48
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,040
Munchy can come see all of the stuff and then he can go back to the hotel at his leisure

49
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,480
when he's sick of my of me and my family. Oh, that's great. I'll never get sick. But I'm getting

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,080
jealous. I'm getting jealous. I've never been to England. And I can't wait. You're a good example

51
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,400
Munchy. You're setting a good example. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be way more patriotic than you are. Give

52
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,240
the entire time. It's gonna be super obnoxious. Gonna be I'm gonna be the the stereotypical American

53
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,120
tourist and it's gonna be incredible and just fawning over everything. It will be. I

54
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,080
expect and hope and pray that you are as loud as possible and scream constantly in the streets

55
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,240
drawing everyone's attention. Have you uh have you talked to Mage? Are you gonna see Mage?

56
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,080
Fucking we could easily see Mage, I think. Are you sure she won't be back in her homeland?

57
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,560
She might she might actually be back in the old Lithuania at the time because she does that for

58
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,560
summer. Oh, she does that for summer. She's going back to that desolate wasteland. Well, you should

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,400
ask her. You should ask her when she's going back. Yeah, definitely lock that down because that's

60
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,160
once in a lifetime opportunity right there. But wait a minute. All that to say is I'm alone right

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,520
now and I've I've I've obviously been I've experienced a lot of time away from my parents

62
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,040
living in Boston. But I've always had like another like human being like around you know. So it's

63
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,960
never been like I've been like like on my own. And it's really cool. Obviously, this isn't the

64
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,880
first time I've ever been like alone for like a day or anything like that. But you know, yeah,

65
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,320
there's seriously no one here like not a joke. It wasn't like a lie. It wasn't like a surprise.

66
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,040
They were going to come back, which is what I initially thought. Like, you know, there's no

67
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,520
way I'm gonna be actually alone in the house. But I am and I have to feed the dogs and I have to

68
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,240
clean up everything. And you know what, I love it. I love this is so I am so I don't I don't know

69
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,760
what to make of the fact that you find being alone in your house to be like a novel experience.

70
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,240
It's it's not a big deal, man. It's okay. Well, hold on. Let me clarify. Again, I've been alone in

71
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,800
my house before, but not like multiple consecutive days in a row. I mean, this is probably the first

72
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,600
time, at least that I can recall, I've been alone for maybe like three, four days. But this has been

73
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,840
like for the entire past week, and then like a little bit more, you know, that's very cool. That

74
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,480
reminds me of Ben. Remember how our dad, our dad got into a thing when he started sailing,

75
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,960
which he's been doing for a long time now, when he would go away for like a full week,

76
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,120
and he would go sailing with his buddy and they'd sail around like Martha's Vineyard and you know,

77
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,000
like the the Cape of Massachusetts and whatnot. Like my our mom was still there. But like our

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,600
house was a totally different thing without dad around. It was like fucking stay up late,

79
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,280
play video games and shit, go have pizza pies for breakfast. Holy shit. Yeah, you know, yeah.

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,640
And he was thoroughly lashed when he came back and found. Yeah, I mean, you got to pay the piper

81
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,280
at some point. But okay, but here's the thing. Here's the great tease of it all was that because

82
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,240
here's because he was sailing. Everything was totally dependent on the weather staying good

83
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,360
and making for good sailing conditions. That cruel moment. Again, I love my dad, but that cruel

84
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,480
moment when the when the weather is turning south and you the phone rings and here's dad,

85
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:24,760
son, I'm coming home, as he would say. And you know, I'll never remember his his deep baritone.

86
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,920
I'll never forget rather lost at sea one day. We'll find him again. Perhaps he should have

87
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,560
come home that one time. What a pathetic fallacy that is for the weather to to to to to punctuate

88
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,280
the dad. You know, you know, dads, they go out for they go out for a pack of sailboats and they

89
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,920
never come home. Except when you don't want them to, except when it starts to rain and then they're

90
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,600
like, ah, fuck it. Yeah. Dad always have another sexy sleepover with your friends trying to max

91
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,560
out your DDR and guitar hero scores. And in Walt is your father to call you gay and smack your ass

92
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,200
and do everything that you were praying he wouldn't in public. Honestly, I don't think a single one of

93
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,200
those like extended sailing trips lasted as long as it was scheduled to like every every single one

94
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,240
ended at least a little early. I mean, I can't even blame him. But it seemed like it was weather

95
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,760
every single time. But yeah, I mean, you know, he didn't get to do his like he was his goal was to

96
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,600
sail out to X point and then make it back. And he not once I believe did he do it. But I mean,

97
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,760
you know, you want to just do to the weather and stuff. But anyway, that was that was a liberating

98
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:41,240
time in life. Just this is when the when when parents are away. The kids will play. Oh, that's

99
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,600
that's correct. That's correct. The way the way my life has worked proceeding. Yes, I hope you're

100
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,640
I hope you're having a like teen boner comedy style, like invite the whole neighborhood over for a

101
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,520
big rager and you surely have it all cleaned up by the time your parents get home. But then uh oh,

102
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,640
we're coming home early because the big the big deal fell through and we're coming home and we're

103
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,720
really poor now and we're really fucking mad. Anything, even our own blood, for example. All

104
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,000
right, love you. See you soon, son. The way my life has worked. This isn't like a new found sense of

105
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,440
like responsibility or like independence in a way since I more or less live a like a life away

106
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,640
from my parents in a way where I'm always upstairs and if I'm not upstairs, then I leave the house

107
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,560
that I'm not there and they don't really have really any influence over me directly. However,

108
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,920
it is nice to have to do like a menial labor for once because I don't interact with anything

109
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,800
outside my room. And so I don't clean it because I don't interact with it literally at all. If I

110
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,760
cook something, then I clean up the kitchen. But other than that, I don't do anything. Uh and so

111
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,760
it's it's it's sort of I don't know the word's not refreshing. It's not like I'm like super psyched

112
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:06,440
about invigorating. Yeah, I would say so. It's like I'm taking care of my space, you know, I'm

113
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,560
taking care. I'm a real human. This is my house currently in a way that I interact with it more

114
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,960
than I have previously. And I have to feed all the animals to clean up after all the animals and

115
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,240
take them on walks and stuff. And you know, and now you'll learn to hate them as I do. Oh no,

116
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,360
I already hate them been good. There's not a I like my dogs out, you know, on the street to the

117
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,680
moon if I had my way. You know, living on my own as I have for the past many years now, it uh I

118
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,840
think that what you're describing is something I'm a big fan of. And it's it's like when you're

119
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,520
when you're a millennial youth, you're growing up in your room and like, you know, generally

120
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,760
everything's taken care of for you. You know, you got your occasional chores you got to do. But I

121
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,680
mean, at least my experience is like, my dad took care of all like the big work and he would have

122
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,800
us help sometimes. And whenever we did it, like I resented it like I didn't want to do it. It sucked.

123
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Hey, let's time to time to mulch the fucking yard again. Yeah, we gotta have new mulch because

124
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,560
that old mulch just isn't cutting it. You know, gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta hold the ladder

125
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,880
while I cut down a branch of a tree that I think is that I think is kind of ugly.

126
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,000
It's the dynamics that are interesting about that because I think once you like if parents go away

127
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,080
suddenly you have to fend for yourself and like everything like you're saying, it's a total

128
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,520
different way to look at the world. It's not that like all the clockwork machinery is just keeping

129
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,920
things going, which are your parents and society and whatnot. When it's up to you, suddenly you're

130
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,480
a man in a jungle, and you've got to intimately become acquainted with that jungle and know how

131
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,640
to get food and what to do. Yeah, and it gives you kind of a native of it. Elevate it reduces you

132
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,520
from a higher level like intellectual electronically based consciousness down to an

133
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,320
earthy like Native American style in tune with nature, groundedness, you know. In the suburban

134
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,080
household. That's correct, but there's definitely a pleasure in that. Using it as a part of it.

135
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,920
It's responsibility. You feel it feels more fun to clean up the mess that you made rather than the

136
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,040
mess that you know would be cleaned up anyway. Because there's a story behind this mess. You

137
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,000
can relive all this. It's not abstract like the reason to mulch those trees was completely

138
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,160
abstract. Completely I have no idea. Completely mystifying, completely resented having to do,

139
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,600
man. Yeah. Let me just go off on a rant about this. I would always be like, I'm like, I can't

140
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,240
fucking believe I hate having to mulch these trees every fucking year with this giant pile of mulch.

141
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,280
You got to put mulch around every tree. And then it's like, and I'm like, I'm grumbling about it.

142
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:51,240
And dad's like, hey, hey, you got a fucking, you know, you, hey, he's like, no, you don't want to

143
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,520
smile, please. Smile, smile about this, please. Yeah, I know you don't want to do it, but you're

144
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,440
going to see, you know, you're like, once it's done, you're going to appreciate, you know, the job

145
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,720
well done. And I'm like, of course I'm not going to. I don't understand how I don't understand,

146
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,920
I don't understand how you don't understand how I don't see the same value in fresh mulch.

147
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,760
You know, I love dear old dad, but I got to say, I think it was a, it was a,

148
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,880
not to criticize his parenting, but I think it was a tactical error to not, to not be, quote,

149
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:31,400
a good enough father to like, to just, to simply explain to us why this activity was important

150
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,880
to him, which I mean, you know, maybe he tried and just like got frustrated and gave up, but I

151
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,200
still don't understand. Yeah, there was like a, there was sort of a thing where like, he really

152
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,320
seemed not to grasp that we did not see the value in this, in this activity. Like if I, if I was,

153
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,720
when you, when like, my son turns like 18 or whatever, like I understand and I kind of enjoy,

154
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,960
like, you know, when I do the PCP pay every month or whatever, you know, generally try to get it

155
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,320
out on time, but like, there's a certain pleasure I take in it, but I could absolutely see, let alone,

156
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,040
like my children, when they turn 18, like dealing with their taxes, but like any of you trying to

157
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,440
like, you know, go over the facts and figures, you know, some of you can enjoy it. We have talked

158
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,640
about it on occasion, but like, I totally get how it's uninteresting busy work for a lot of people,

159
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,120
but I, I obtain some joy from doing it. So, you know, it seemed, it strikes me as something similar.

160
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,440
You got to, you got to touch like the foundational idea behind the activity itself. You can't just

161
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,120
say, throw these numbers together in this way or throw this fucking ground up wood under these

162
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,680
trees because there's some nebulous benefit to be obtained. You have to understand the motivation

163
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,240
behind it. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, after you applied the mulch bin, did you pound

164
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,400
the pavement? Oh, I pounded that pavement. Oh, I was out there. Oh, I was walking the streets.

165
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,160
Okay. You may have pounded the pavement, but did you control your anger? Hardly. You mean my rage?

166
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,680
Oh, your rage. Yeah. Sorry. Did I control my rage? Occasionally.

167
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,280
Yeah. I threw a little bit. There were, there were, there were successes and failures in

168
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,200
the battering. Did you guys ever get into, okay, you guys, you, you whiteies have lived a life

169
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:21,960
completely alien to me in like a completely, completely free of all your post scarcity star

170
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,440
track in the future. Yeah. We've been living up in the Holy Land of Marizioa in our fucking

171
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,720
sap bubbles, breathing our pure holy air. Munchy doesn't get this reference, but these people

172
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,480
will. No, I have no idea. Yeah, I'm not white. I didn't watch the room then. Sorry. Okay. Anyway,

173
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,200
so, so you guys, how do we see that episode of Doug? Real quick. That just reminds me. Doug.

174
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Sorry. That just reminds the real, I saw someone shitting on anime and being like,

175
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,440
look at all these white people. Like, why aren't we, why are we paying more attention to the black

176
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,760
characters in anime? And I'm like, these are like from Japan, dude. I don't know what's going on here.

177
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,200
Okay, anyway. That's the thing about it can't stand about anime. It's just too many white people.

178
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,880
Too many white folks in there. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Okay, anyway, so I assume you guys

179
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,600
have lived like a, like a, like a stereotypical, like 90s household experience. I imagine you

180
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,480
guys are just melting in the middle, but there are three mountains. You ever want to say it by the bell?

181
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,400
Yeah. That was me. Okay. That was us. I literally believe that. Did you guys start getting like

182
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,840
fights with your parents? Like altercations that like you scream at them? You mean physically?

183
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,240
Not physically, but just as in like, you got really mad at them and said like, I don't know,

184
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,920
like, I'm going to my room because I fucking hate you. Rarely, but sometimes. Yeah, I did a bunch.

185
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,960
I think Ben more than the rest of us, but I'm a bit more of a mediator. So

186
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,440
I found, I found a lot of dad's mannerisms to be completely infuriating. And yeah,

187
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,600
I flew off the handle a couple of times. One time once or twice, I like kicked a hole in the wall

188
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:00,680
and my punishment was that I had to like do all the labor and stuff associated with repairing

189
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,560
a hole in the wall, which was quite intense and definitely taught me a lesson about not doing

190
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,640
that. That seems like the perfect punishment for some of like. It was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You ever

191
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,640
try to fucking plaster a hole in the wall? It's, it's an all day, it's an all day process. And

192
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,520
that's if you do it right the first time. Indeed, which I think you did not if I remember correctly.

193
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,880
No. Yeah. But the reason I ask is I've always had a pretty like independent

194
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,080
and like attitude for my mom, but like in a way that like not like as in like,

195
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm not going to do what you say mom, but as in like basically since I've been like 10,

196
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,720
she hasn't really like told me to like, let me rephrase that. I don't have to fight with my mom

197
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,520
because she'll always like, she asks very little and like, you know, she's my mom. I'll just fucking

198
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,160
do it. You know, not really a big deal. I don't really mind. I've never had like a single like

199
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,880
fight. I've never screamed at my mom or like ever done anything to the effect of like, you know,

200
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,840
when I was like a real little kid, like sub 10, then I like pouted and stuff. Sure. But I've never

201
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,400
had the experience of like, I fucking hate my mom go like, you know, stomp up to my room and slam

202
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,600
the door. Well, you know, I think that that speaks to a lot. I think both your personality and your

203
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,360
mom's personality are probably an important factor in that. Like, I think Ben and I were a bit,

204
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,400
we were a bit of lay about children. We wanted just to hang out, watch TV and play video games.

205
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,600
I mean, if I, yes, please indeed, if I was growing up, I mean, I think about this. If I have like

206
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,440
lazy children, like I'm going to want to motivate them to do things and you know, get engaged and

207
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,760
I don't know, go socialize and whatnot, because it's good for them, whether they know it or not.

208
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,800
So like, you kind of got to be more on their ass. But then again, I mean, if you're just like,

209
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,520
I don't know if you can like make a person. I mean, I don't know if it'll be successful.

210
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,720
You can't really make someone do stuff that they don't want to do, at least not like consistently.

211
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,480
You know what I mean? Like, I do for them to like consist. If you want your kid to be such in such a

212
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,560
way, they're not going to, unless it's what they want. Like you can incentivize them as much as

213
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,880
you want, but you can't enforce that kind of thing forever. Well, tell me what you think about

214
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,040
this, because I've meditated on this issue about when it comes to rearing children and whatnot,

215
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,200
but it's like waterfall. Yes, indeed, indeed. Like, I don't think that a lot of the seeds that

216
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,640
specifically dad, like all the fucking lawn work and like the little tasks and I don't know,

217
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,960
like becoming Eagle Scout was very much like guided by my dad and he did a lot of the work

218
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,480
for me, basically, at least on my Eagle project at the end. And not even that, but like all the

219
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,440
tasks he had me do, all the chores and all the stuff we had to do over the years, which is,

220
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,720
again, I'm not complaining, totally fair. I feel like I was very much a lazy layabout kind of guy.

221
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,240
The chore, it was fair that we had to do stuff. I just couldn't stand his attitude. Well, the

222
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,560
attitude of like, we should want to do these things. I mean, I get that. I understand where it

223
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,760
comes from, because to him, these are things that have to be done. And like, you live here too.

224
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,120
Why don't you have the same, you know, get up and go attitude about accomplishing these tasks that I

225
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:23,160
do? That's disgusting. Like, it's not that I think it was wrong to ask us to do stuff. It's that he

226
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,200
was like annoyed and like angered sometimes by the fact that we didn't just want to fucking mulch

227
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,200
the trees on our own. I don't care if the trees get mulched. Well, okay, I mean, I understand your

228
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,000
point. But so that's the reason why I can I can discuss that. But like, but my point before I was

229
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,120
just making was just like, these fucking trees have dreams have nightmares or a mulching trees pound

230
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,080
in those weird pound in that pavement stakes and the weird stakes into like below the trees,

231
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,240
fertilizer stakes. You know, I've never even touched fertilizer in my life. But I can't imagine

232
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,480
you know, have you touched have you not touched poop, munchie? You know, and you have well, okay,

233
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,400
I mean, it's just like a disconnect like our dad, our dad really likes like grass, trees. Yeah,

234
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,880
you know, that's all the human core. You're in an urban jungle out there. So you would know about

235
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,760
this thing. You know, he loves all that he loves all that shit. I don't give a shit about it. Obviously,

236
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,680
our priorities there are different, you know, it's I guess it's unavoidable.

237
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,480
Nate, on one of the most recent rfck is that the last one, but the one before that I think

238
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,200
Ben describes how there were like contracts for chores in the house. And things like did the place

239
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:42,680
so hard. Like another another piece of the Nate jigsaw. Because you know, the point I was gonna

240
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,600
make about that was that I feel that when I was young, like until the time I was like

241
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,680
2021, up until that point, all the chores that my dad had me do enough stuff, I felt like it was

242
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:59,000
planting seeds. But it was when I finally moved out on my own. And like I was responsible for myself.

243
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,240
I kind of feel like all that like teaching from my dad blossomed. And it all like that's when it was

244
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,320
like, like I was prepared to like, you know, take out the trash, do the dishes, do my chores, pay my

245
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,040
taxes, be on top of my financial game, you know, make sure I was at work on time every day. And

246
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,600
like, I feel like I just kind of rapidly became an adult. And all the lessons that my dad had

247
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,840
been indirectly teaching by making me do these things and my mom too, but most of my dad,

248
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:34,120
like I felt like it paid off. And like I became that person, like as an adult only. And you know,

249
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,640
that that's I kind of think that's what happened to me. You know, in a weird way, I almost think the

250
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,600
opposite achieved the same result for me, where I would never like like doing the things that I

251
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,480
had to do, you know, when I did have to do chores. I did I did not have the, you know, the the immense

252
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,080
hatred that that Ben might have felt. But you know, what do you mean me? Why are you singling me out?

253
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,120
Well, neither of us liked mulching the trees. I mean, I guess you're more vociferous and you're

254
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,640
hatred, but hey, I'm just responding to you. Yeah, yeah. I think I kind of look back at all

255
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,560
these chores with a fairly rosy lens, because I like I think about them as like, helping me become

256
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:24,600
a more disciplined person. So even though I hated them at the time, I look back. I just remember

257
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,520
how annoyed I was by the attitude behind it all that fucking. It's like a such a boomer attitude,

258
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:38,600
honestly. I agree with you, Ben. But anyway, I I I always didn't want to do it. And so now that

259
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm on my own, I don't think like it's not like as in like, I'm so unprepared for what life entails,

260
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,360
because like, it's not like, you know, this is not this is not rocket science here. You know,

261
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,920
I know it's really not that hard. It's really not. And so instead of it just being like,

262
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,200
what I think you might feel where it's like, you know, you just feel like you have experience doing

263
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,960
them and they sort of just turn into, you know, busy work that it's not really an issue. To me,

264
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,760
it's just like, well, how do I minimize suffering? Well, and then I think of ways to like, like,

265
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,560
what's the word like, I consolidate power and I make things more efficient for myself. And so for

266
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,280
instance, you know, I have like scheduled times to do things and I have specific ways I can do it

267
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:25,800
to maximize efficiency. And I just I just completely like locked down all the chores I have to do,

268
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,920
so that I can spend the least amount of time on them as possible. So my dislike for doing them,

269
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:39,000
it's not like I got mind break dosioned into liking doing dishes and stuff like that. But like,

270
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,800
I understand they have to be done. So I might as well do them for as little time as possible.

271
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,080
I mean, that's that's good as well. So I mean, are you basically saying that like your the approach

272
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,880
that like you were raised with was like, you were just given the freedom by your mom and your

273
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
instincts to just, you know, want to, you know, get things done so you can just be happy and,

274
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,160
you know, not worried about stuff. That's kind of what motivates you to do your shit. Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,480
Oftentimes, parenting can be like, you know, you can have like a desire and it won't have the

276
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,560
same way that you would want it to. It's sort of weird that stuff like this can be like, you can't

277
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:23,400
like both like, okay, your dad obviously instilled in you this sort of belief, probably intentionally

278
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,960
to give you this outcome. My mom didn't and yet I still got that sort of lesson probably not in

279
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,440
the same way or the exact specifics. It's hard to know how much of that was just you. And I mean,

280
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,440
again, it might have been nothing. It might have just been in me all along that just came out when

281
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,240
I got older or something. What do you mean by in you? You mean like, like, I mean, like, I notice

282
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,600
now that I approach like tasks and accomplishing things like very similar to how my dad did.

283
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,680
And like, we never we did talk about doing things that way. But I don't feel like that's

284
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,480
anything I learned from him. I feel like it's a kind of an innate way of approaching issues.

285
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,640
I feel I feel like a lot of the time it's it's not down to like a literal lesson, but you just you

286
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:13,320
just can't help but copy the adults in around you in your life. Yeah, that's why I do things.

287
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,680
Okay, I think it's probably a combination, but like you are his son. There's probably some sort

288
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,920
of like some what similar brain chemicals in there. And you know, he's your fucking dad,

289
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,240
you are random a lot. Obviously, some of that, you know, I would never say that like my dad's

290
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,200
teachings are obviously always going to be effective case in point, Ben. But you know,

291
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm I'm much more like mom. I think so. Yeah, much more relaxed about life. You know what,

292
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:46,120
I'm happy with that. Well, that's good. I remember on one of the draw casts for monsters.

293
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,680
Unfortunately for you, Ben, a mom's penchant for shit. Wait, what's that thing when women

294
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,280
marry up? Mom's pension for hypergamy won't save you, Ben. You're in the rut. You got no way to go.

295
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,360
Well, I don't know. What the fuck does that mean? I mean, I was making a joke because mom isn't

296
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,840
actually hypergamous, but I don't know. Well, then marry Alexa. What a bizarre thing to say.

297
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,600
I mean, it is in fact simply inaccurate, but I thought it'd be funny. Anyway,

298
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,560
I mean, also, our dad is dead. I said the dad was dead before. Why aren't you on my ass about that

299
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,400
too, Ben? Okay, Nate, you're very consistent. I'll send you. Was that like an insult against mom or

300
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,760
something? What me? No, no, like saying, okay, you never mind. I just I just it's like such a like

301
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,200
esoteric joke to make. You know, I think so. Well, what a classic Nate's dad thing to say.

302
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:46,120
Oh, oh, God. Oh, and like Ben's like his mom's that that tendency would save me. I don't know,

303
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,400
but it won't save you because you're a man, not a woman. Okay. Yeah, that was that idea. Nate's

304
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,080
more like his dad. Ben's more like his mom. You guys are gonna have to pop out a baby real soon.

305
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,280
Oh, oh, Ben already had kiddie stone. He already went into labor once. We got ectobiology as hard

306
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:09,000
at work as we speak. Yeah, finally, you know, finally. What are we talking about? I would imagine

307
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,520
that I'm very uncomfortable. I imagine a baby between Nate and Ben would be like a lump of

308
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,360
coal or possibly some sort of like raw material that would be like use just fuel fuel and then

309
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,560
burn up. What the fuck? In what way would that be the result of our well, I mean, there's human

310
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,560
offspring. Well, okay, like it's like you didn't yank, right? If you didn't yank headed, baby,

311
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,520
probably just be some sort of like inert mass. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just some sort of like like

312
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,600
being that was not made to be sentient in any way. I mean, look at it me and Ben, I suppose,

313
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,360
as our mother and father's children, I guess they just either go one way or the other. I don't know.

314
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,960
Yeah. I feel like grace is more like you, Ben, and more like mom. But again, I don't know. Yeah.

315
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,600
Yeah. Not 100% if you had children. There would be basically your mother and father,

316
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:07,560
but as children. Yeah. I think we've got two moms and one dad out of this particular relationship.

317
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,360
You and me, Nate, we'll just have two babies and like one of them will have like a beard and be dad

318
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,520
and the other will be mom. It'll be like, you're gonna let a beard be dead. You know, in Lady in

319
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,320
the Tramp at the end when they have like a litter and like all the girl puppies look exactly like

320
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,520
Lady and all the boy puppies look exactly like Tramp. They're not a mix of the two.

321
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:34,360
No, no, no, no. Everything in its right place. Yeah, yeah. Separate but equal. That's my policy.

322
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,480
We keep the genes separate even when we interbreed. We just make sure the ones that aren't entirely

323
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,400
one or the other. We just we just dump them off a little bit. Really speaks to the myth of race

324
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,160
mixing, you know. But now I'm thinking of like your children being just tiny versions of you,

325
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,720
like a tiny Nate, like heat miser and snow miser. They're little puppets during the scene.

326
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,960
Real quick, am I remembering correctly? Did they ectobiologize at the end, like in the Homestuck

327
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,880
epilogue, just like a million combinations? Not in the epilogue. I meant the Snapchat thing. No,

328
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,880
no, no, not the epilogue. Like I remember seeing pictures of just like a million mixed up genes.

329
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,960
They use that to make the human race. Right. Based off of four template humans. Did they

330
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,760
use all eight or did they use just the four original ones? Probably all eight, right? I don't

331
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,440
know. Man, that's so fucking weird and kind of gross in a weird way. They're all like related.

332
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,160
They're all clones anyway. It's a fucking no, dude. I will say, by the way, just before we

333
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,920
transition off the being alone thing, I will say the worst thing about being alone is the fact that

334
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:45,160
my kitchen is still fucked. I think I talked about this on the PCP, but for like like a month, if not

335
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,960
more at this point, my action. No, yeah, more than like two months probably in what way? My

336
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,080
kitchen. Okay. Well, like, okay, there was something wrong with the dishwasher. I don't even fucking

337
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,800
know what, but we were having a perfectly fun functioning kitchen. They some repairman came

338
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,960
over to fix the dishwasher. And then there was sort of there's mold behind the dishwasher.

339
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,960
And so like smash fucking cut two weeks later, the entire kitchen ripped out cabinets,

340
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,680
dishwasher sink and fridge and like Island is gone. And there's an alien like quarantine ET

341
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,560
like like like hospital blinds around my kitchen. What does that have to do with being alone,

342
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,440
though? Wouldn't it be that way anyway? No, that's what I'm saying is that even though I'm alone,

343
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,000
I wanted I would like to like have cooked for myself. But now I like I have to like just order

344
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,960
out no matter what I would really just love during at this point to be home alone, you know,

345
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,800
I have to worry about anything. I can just go on downstairs and I have anyone, you know,

346
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,400
mess with me or try and talk to me or fuck with me and cook. But no, I'm robbed of that.

347
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,360
I've been I've been cooking. Actually, I know that cauliflower, that cauliflower pizza,

348
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,440
it sounds delicious. There was that. I made that maybe a week ago. And then I've been,

349
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,960
I went on sort of a spree, like I bought a bunch of like bulk shit from like Costco and I ordered

350
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,760
some stuff on Amazon that I couldn't find, just a bunch of like general like keto safe

351
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,000
ingredients. And I want to try the keto coffee, the bang keto coffee. No, no, no, not that,

352
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,240
unfortunately. I got I got a pound of raw cocoa butter, which is just like blocks of stuff.

353
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,960
Sick. I ordered a giant bag of like of desiccated coconut power desiccated coconut desiccated

354
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,640
unholy coconut. Imagine if you will a dark coconut. All right, here's what you have to do.

355
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,960
Here's the picture I want next week. PCP show notes. I want you sprawled out, you know,

356
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,600
on your bed. Just watch YouTube. Watch watching an Arlo video on your YouTube. You're drinking

357
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,960
bang. You're drinking bang keto coffee. Did I mention cooking Arlo's pizza recipe? Did I mention

358
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,680
that last episode? You're watching Arlo. You're kicking back a keto coffee and you're eating a

359
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:59,720
cauliflower banana pudding pizza. And that's your keto. It's your keto day. I'll mix it with

360
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,120
like sugar free banana like yeah, yeah, something. Okay. Yeah, I think I mentioned this last week,

361
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,240
but in case I didn't. Yeah, Arlo like was tweeting about like making low carb pizza. And I used

362
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:20,200
his recipe for a pizza crust and it was great. And I'm gonna do it again. The Arlo. I got I got

363
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,360
the bunch of coconut. Arlo would be great if he was a cooking show. If he had if he had like holds

364
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,400
a spoon and he goes through the little chef hat. Yeah, good. There's still time Arlo. We've got

365
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,880
notes to save you from your he's got nowhere to go but up. He's got room to expand. That's true.

366
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,800
Anyway, so this very morning. Okay, see, I realized something. I've realized that even

367
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,560
though I'm still doing keto, I haven't really been losing any more weight. I've only lost like

368
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,280
maybe three or four more pounds and maybe five pounds. Do you want to lose more? Are you are

369
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,880
you still I could I could use I could lose a little more, not too much more, but just a little

370
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,640
bit more. But I haven't lost any. So I decided that maybe I should actually start counting

371
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,400
my calories again. So I'm gonna do that. So this morning I woke up and I'm kind of hungry,

372
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,760
but I don't want to eat. I want to go back to the one meal a day thing because I was working out

373
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,000
pretty good. So instead of eating, I satisfied my lust for food by cooking food and not eating it.

374
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,760
So I made a so I made a I made fat bombs, which are basically just like fudge balls

375
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,840
that you put in the fridge. And I made a coconut flour.

376
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,360
Well, the recipe was for cupcakes, but I just cooked it into a whole cake.

377
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,160
I had to substitute heavy cream for coconut cream. That's unfortunate, but I had no choice.

378
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,360
I'll fix that. Do you plan to eat these later or this for fun? I will. I will. Yeah, I'll eat these.

379
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Yeah, this is keto shit. This is keto shit, man. Now I'm set. You've heard of Kino shit time for the

380
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,040
keto shit. So so I've been, I don't know, I've been cooking more. I've been experimenting in the

381
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,760
kitchen and it's pretty it's pretty fun, I guess. It's because it's because the results are useful.

382
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,280
You see, I was very gratified, extremely gratified to buy all this shit. I spent like like more than

383
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,400
100 like 120 bucks buying these like big bags of shit. But I did it with like, this is going to

384
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,360
save me in the long run so much. If it's like if I'm buying like five pounds, I bought five

385
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,960
pounds of shredded mozzarella and I'm like, yeah, it's really expensive, but I'm going to eat it all

386
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,280
and it's going to save me in the long term because it's cheaper to buy in bulk. And I rub my hands

387
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,080
together and I was like, Oh God, I can't afford not to buy it. All the savings. I'm playing the long

388
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,480
game and it feels good. Well, that's good. We have been ordering far more groceries and eating

389
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,080
out far less than we used to. It's fairly rare. So I'm very happy about that. I don't know. We're

390
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,840
just getting groceries instead of eating out. So just a life upgrade, just a life upgrade.

391
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:51,160
Similar, similar. I started a, I signed up on Jewel.com to get my Jewel pods directly delivered,

392
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,280
which is actually much cheaper. Well, that's good. Significantly cheaper than buying them at the

393
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,880
fucking convenience store. And the best thing about it is that I can actually buy the good flavors.

394
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,720
So I got creme brulee. I got mango. I got cool cucumber. You know, I got everything a boy could

395
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,320
want. Well, that's great. But I'm a happy camper. I have not been cooking much. And I got to say,

396
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:19,000
if only I had the wisdom to get blue apron when I had the chance or whatever the fuck it was.

397
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,840
I could have been a God by now, Ben. You've divided your meat. Because I'm too dumb to look

398
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,680
blue apron. That's pussy shit. Hello, fresh is the fucking

399
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,640
blue apron is like the lift of fucking of cooking delivery.

400
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,080
I don't understand. What do you need it for? You just, okay, I'll tell you, I'll tell you exactly

401
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,680
why something in my head. And it's the same thing. You don't have to pay for it. I'm because I am not

402
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,880
a cook and I don't think about cooking. I need someone to force cooking on me on a day to day

403
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:59,880
basis that I will transition into a little baby. How about the fact that you don't have food?

404
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,280
It's called baby steps. What? I'm sorry, say again. I said, how I said, how about the fact that you

405
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,840
don't have food to force you to cook? Well, but we do. We've got some ingredients. We got some,

406
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,960
we got eggs, we got bread, we got exactly, exactly. So cook something with them. Yeah.

407
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:24,040
What do you mean? Yeah, I could do that, I guess. Yes, you could. Exactly. What about the thing

408
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:31,000
that you said you really liked that I could, like the eggs with the bacon and eggs combined?

409
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,760
I want that. It's so easy. You just fry bacon, you put eggs on top. I don't have that kind of

410
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,680
English bacon. I don't know where to get it. I assume the grocery store, but I don't know.

411
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,760
You just use the regular old American kind. I think it's just thick cut, isn't it?

412
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,760
Could I just, could one use normal American bacon in the same way and just cook the

413
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,240
grease into it and just keep it in there? Yeah. Okay, okay. I gotta give that a try.

414
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Nate. That's keto, right? More fat, the healthier you are, as I understand it.

415
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,800
Keto gives you kidney stones, as well as energy drinks. Well, I'm down for some of those.

416
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,960
Okay, all right. Ben has gotten a kidney stone, right? Since this started?

417
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,920
But my whole thing is that everyone's like, oh, it's because of keto. Oh, it's because of energy

418
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,800
drinks. And nobody fucking knows. It could have been nothing. It's one data point that I'm taking

419
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,160
go to, but okay. It is one data point. Actually, there's a couple, but yeah. A couple contradictory

420
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:30,040
ones. If you're anything like me, Nate, you will go to your kitchen and think, okay, I got some

421
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,800
ingredients. I guess I could make something. I'm just going to make an egg. I'm just going to crack an

422
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,200
egg and that's it. There's no food here. It's all this worthless ingredients. What's a man to do?

423
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,680
Ingredients, ingredients everywhere and not a meal to eat. Having all of your ingredients just in

424
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:55,160
one place and having a specific recipe like mandated on to you means that you will want to make that

425
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,000
and it will be so often of a completely higher level than you would initially want to do. You

426
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,600
could make anything. You could make anything. Okay. I got the, I know the, here's the issue, Ben.

427
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:13,560
What's more fun? Tell me what's more fun, Ben, starting with a blank C plus plus file and saying,

428
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,880
I'm going to make a game and it could be anything or like firing up Minecraft and being like, let's

429
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,200
tool around here and like, you know, build a fortress. It's that disparity in my mind. I want,

430
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,400
but which one gives you the greater sense of life accomplishment? Well, I totally agree

431
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,040
that it's, but I got, I got other things to give me. As always, I work up to that. Ben, your

432
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,120
version, your version of these on such a visual level makes me so mad and I'm going to kill you.

433
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,840
I am. I really am just averse on a visceral. I really just see it as spending money on something.

434
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,760
You know, Ben, you are a cooking elitist is what you are, Ben. I'm a baby. I need baby steps.

435
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm cooking elitist because I advocate that you should do it. That's correct, Ben. That's right.

436
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello, fresh and stuff like this is always a stepping stone. As I've mentioned,

437
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,720
I don't get it anymore. I don't have a use for me. Well, you've evolved parts. Part of that.

438
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,680
But it's like, yeah, it's a stepping stone in, in, you pick, yeah, you get the stepping stone,

439
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,920
but meanwhile you're surrounded by like other perfectly good stones. No, you're not. It serves a

440
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,000
purpose. We've explained it to a thousand times. Google anything. Google. It has. Listen,

441
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,080
how would he know? How would he know any name of any food you can think of followed by recipe?

442
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,520
Hit enter. Done. You don't need blue apron. It's a matter of convenience. It's so convenient. Have

443
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,320
you ever heard of paying money to save time? That's what this is doing. Then you might as well just

444
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,360
fucking go out to a restaurant. You seriously might as well just do it the same shit. You can learn

445
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,640
the skill to apply later in the ways that you're advocating. It's just a stepping stone so that

446
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,800
you can learn how to cook better and then you won't have to rely on it anymore. This is such like

447
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,640
a weird, like false trichotomy. No. Okay. Yeah. You, you could cook to learn the skill, but you could

448
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,080
cook for free. So you're paying money to learn, you're paying. Listen, listen, shut up. You're

449
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:11,960
paying more money to learn a skill that you could learn for free. What's the fucking, like, I don't

450
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,320
get it. It's easier and I really think I really think what the money, the money that you are paying

451
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,320
is specifically so you don't have to do any thought work about what to buy, what recipes to

452
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,520
make. It's so easy though. And look, I know you might think that's dumb and like a waste of money

453
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,000
and I'm sure to many people it is, but you know, it's a convenience. That's all, that's all.

454
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,240
I see some value in that. I just, I just, you might as well listen. And you know what, maybe a

455
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,600
recipe comes up. No, no, no, here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Okay. Listen,

456
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:49,560
I got, not Blue Apron, I got, I was treated to the ingredients in a, what's the Hello Fresh,

457
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:58,280
in a Hello Fresh package. And like, I don't know about you, Nate, Munchy, but I don't think that

458
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,600
I'm ever going to cook, I don't think that I'm ever again in my life going to have the cause to

459
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,600
cook Frisco burgers with mango chutney ever again in my life. So I don't know if I did, I don't know

460
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,280
that I did learn about you. I don't think I, it's a game. Listen, it's, it's not that it wasn't cool,

461
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,640
it tasted good, but I'm never going to make it again. But you learn about that. Okay, okay, listen.

462
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,320
I learned to do a thing I'm never going to do again. Okay, okay, hold on, wait, okay. If you,

463
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,200
if you look up the ingredient, if you look up how to make something that you actually will make in

464
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,960
the future, then you've learned something. There's so much different that the experience is actually

465
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,040
making it. But you might as well just go to a restaurant for it. That's, that's the level that

466
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,760
you're dealing with. First of all, just having the experience to make a fancy thing if you want to

467
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,360
is inherently valuable. Also, I understand there are some Hello Freshers that are above like, you

468
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,600
know, I'm not going to do this every day. But there are vast swaths of like, okay, if I simplify

469
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,440
this even just a small bit, then I could easily see doing this often. For instance, there's a,

470
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,280
there's a lot of recipes that I would love to do. How fucking hard is it to learn to cook a hamburger?

471
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,600
You got to fucking subscribe to some mail-in order service for like $40 a month to learn that

472
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:14,440
shit? Are you kidding me? This is literally bullying. This is not bullying. It's retardation.

473
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,880
I feel bully. Ben, this is, it's, it's, how fucking, why do you need Hello Fresh to teach you how to

474
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:26,440
cook a fucking hamburger? I'm literally mad. I'm literally shaking right now. Yeah, that's hard.

475
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,720
We all need to claim the victim high ground, the climb as high as possible, like less than

476
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,440
mine. I got it. No one else can have it. Ben, you're right. It's more cost effective to not do it.

477
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:46,440
That's why the end goal is to not do it. This, it should be like a month, maybe two months at most.

478
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,760
And it's not that, like you're over, you're over, you're over, you're over stating how expensive

479
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,600
it is. It's not like it's a fucking like a king's ransom. How much is two months of Hello Fresh?

480
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,720
I don't fucking remember. I'll check. Throw me at a number. Probably like, if I recall correctly,

481
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,200
it was like $40 a thing. $40 wasted. $40 wasted. That's all I'm saying. You, okay. I'm serious.

482
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,520
I'm serious. But you get ingredients. Yeah, you get the ingredients. It's not wasted because I ate

483
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,880
everything. Okay. And we didn't have to buy groceries. Okay. Just, okay. I'm sorry. Just mostly

484
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,400
wasted. Well, okay. All right. I could have bought that mango for like 75 cents at the grocery store.

485
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,640
They probably charged me like 250 of each one. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. I'm

486
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,720
gonna go sign up for Hello Fresh right now. I fucking can't. I can't fucking abide it. It's,

487
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:40,920
it's, it's unholy. It's unholy. Look, we got my Hello Fresh experience was, was completely valuable

488
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,640
and it changed my life forever. And now I cook regularly. I'm, I'm, I'm willing to drop it.

489
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:54,360
Let me just say one final question. What is, what is hard and what is averse to you about

490
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,560
just Googling a recipe and then buying there's nothing adversity whatsoever.

491
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,080
That's the alternative. I have the answer. You've got to see what you've got to step into what my

492
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:13,320
life is like. I'm sitting here in my piss and my shit. And I just don't know what the fuck I'm

493
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:21,000
doing here. And I need someone to spoon feed me baby recipes. I don't understand what it is. I don't,

494
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,920
I don't even know, Ben. I'm terrified. I'm terrified at the very idea of thinking about

495
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,160
what food to make. This rocks me to my core and that's where I'm coming from. Wait, Ben,

496
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,760
any old fucking thing, there's, there's more to it. There's more to it than just it having a recipe

497
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:47,080
for you. It is completely coddling. Hello Fresh and everything is baby-fying cooking for you

498
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:52,200
as baby steps. And here I sit a baby in my piss and shit. Listen, wait, no, no, wait, no, let me

499
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:59,000
finish. Let me finish. It babies you. It gives you recipe with extremely clear like picture book

500
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,920
X like pop up book baby shit recipe steps. It sends you all of the ingredients and like that's

501
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,680
twofold at what it says with the green so you don't have to go to the grocery store. Also,

502
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,280
it sends you the ingredients as like a ticking like clock timer, like a bomb that will go off

503
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:21,320
if you don't want to waste the food. Like it's here. You have to cook. You cannot avoid this.

504
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,960
You can't just have like stuff, you know, random shit in your fridge and like, oh, you know,

505
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,320
I'll cook it. Like, you know, one of these days, I'll Google how to do a recipe, you know, I'll

506
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:37,560
just do it sometime, you know, in the future at some point. I'm saying, I'm saying do it now.

507
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,160
I, but if you have Hello Fresh, then you're forced to do it. It's literally not like it's not an

508
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,960
option to not do it unless you just hold hostage by your own volition. And it's great. It's what

509
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,680
I want. Listen, I got this bag. I got like a four pound bag of coconut flour. And I'm like,

510
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,960
what the fuck do I do with this? So I go on the internet and I Google keto coconut flour recipes.

511
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:07,960
I find this recipe, I find this recipe for coconut flour cupcakes. And the ingredients are like,

512
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,920
it's like mix this shit, microwave this shit, mix it in, put it in a pan and wait an hour.

513
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:21,640
Okay. And that's it. I know I'm not cooking is not difficult. People are scared by cooking more

514
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,200
so than they should be. But okay, before I started Hello Fresh, I had basically not cooked

515
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,600
whatsoever in my entire life. I did not know how to cook a steak. Last time I tried to cook a steak

516
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:39,480
before Hello Fresh, I literally like like burnt my hand like sticking the steak into boiling oil.

517
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,200
I was that level of incompetent. I did not know how to do anything. Hello Fresh saved my marriage,

518
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:50,440
satisfied my wife. It fucked her for me. I didn't have to do anything. It was super convenient.

519
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:56,040
It was just what I needed. I got to apologize. I realized that I'm arguing from a position

520
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:03,480
of privilege. And I, you know, I'm privileged to be competent at things and I can't sometimes I

521
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:09,960
have trouble empathizing with those that aren't. I appreciate you acknowledging that. So I'm gonna

522
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,320
check my privilege right at the door. Enjoy some nice keto fat bombs later on in the day

523
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:21,800
and just feel sorry for the lot of you. That's my plan. That's my new plan for this Easter Sunday.

524
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,120
It's not for everyone. I wouldn't even, I don't even know if I would say that like,

525
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,160
I recommend it as like a blanket thing. All I'm saying is if you're intimidated by cooking

526
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:37,480
and you are able to pay for it comfortably, because it's not that much, then you can do it for like

527
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,000
a couple weeks, think, okay, this isn't that bad. And then stop. It's not like I'm advocating to do

528
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,440
it forever or even for a long time. You can do it if you think any of this sounds valuable to you.

529
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:57,560
You could eat, you could do it online. It's not, not valuable. I'm just saying it's reasonable.

530
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:03,400
And I'm just saying you could do that or you could do literally the same thing for free. Okay.

531
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,840
It's not, why do you think it's the same thing? That's all I'm saying. Let's, let's move on. We

532
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,560
have to move on. Listen, that's all I'm saying. We've got to move on. That's all I'm saying. Okay,

533
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,520
here we are ready for this talking prompt. Okay, here it is. Okay. Two diametrically

534
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:25,400
opposed quotes. Okay, here we go. Reggie fees him a from Nintendo quote, the game is fun.

535
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,560
The game is a battle. If it's not fun, why bother? Okay, that's Reggie. Other man, Neil

536
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,280
drunk, asked for context, or are you deliberately leaving out content? Well, it was, I don't know,

537
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,800
who's talking about his conceit of making video games. That was the idea. Oh, the making of the

538
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,600
game is a battle or rather like, why? I think he was talking about Nintendo games in general. And

539
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,800
he's just like, you know, if the game's not fun, why bother? Was the, was the, see, okay. All right.

540
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,360
Now, juxtapose that with Neil Druckman of Naughty Dog. I don't know if he's CEO or whatever. Here's

541
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:02,280
the, here's the quote. It's, we don't use the word fun. That's the full quote. And specifically,

542
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,240
that was in reference to the development of last of us two. They don't use the word fun. First of

543
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,560
all, who the fuck would say that when you're developing a video game? That's just the most

544
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,600
pretentious shit what the problem is there at all. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I think it's weird that

545
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:22,440
Naughty Dog would say that, but I don't think last of us and stuff. I mean, last of us is a

546
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,680
shooter. That's fun. It's just, I don't know. The word cucked really comes to mind when I think

547
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,320
about this. What do you, what are you talking about? Imagine making video games and not having

548
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:41,720
your primary goal being it being fun. That is so hard. You fucking fool. Survival horror games.

549
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,400
They're not fun. They're stressful. Sion Hill 2 is super fun. And well,

550
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:52,920
well, dot, dot, dot. I mean, it is fun. Horror games are not meant to, I can't even,

551
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,120
I fully agree. I fully expect you to be like, well, obviously you're right, Ben, but what I

552
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:05,800
meant was dot, dot, dot. Like games don't have to be fun. Games are an art form. Games can evoke

553
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,080
any, any emotion you want. They can have any message. We don't have the expectation that movies be like

554
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,680
fun. They can experience the full range of human emotion and we'll still have enjoyed

555
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,240
experience. Okay. All right. You know what? You know what? I realize all of a sudden this is

556
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,160
dumb because everything here hinges on the definition of the word fun. And it wasn't an enjoyable

557
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:29,800
experience. Like you like, I found Silent Hill 2, for example, a notable, very much liked horror

558
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,680
game, a very enjoyable experience. Like, I don't know. Like does, does unraveling the, the narrative

559
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:42,120
pathos of the tragedy of, I forget the name of the character, James is like psyche and all the

560
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:48,280
horrors. Like is that fun? I mean, I found it very enjoyable to play through. So I could call that

561
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,640
fun. You know, I guess I'm sure people would say the same about like Last of Us and Last of Us 2

562
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,840
when it comes out. Maybe Naughty Dog is taking a page out of Garfield Itz's book and they don't

563
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,640
talk about fun. They talk about entergagement. Do you guys know about Garfield Itz? Oh, of course.

564
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,880
Of course. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I'm following. Did I talk about, okay, well, there is an app

565
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,240
and I think it is currently only available in Saudi Arabia. But it is, well, no, no, I think, I think

566
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,560
it was in one of the countries below Saudi Arabia that I could be wrong. We continue. All countries

567
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:23,880
are below Saudi Arabia, but go on. But it is Garfield Itz and Garfield Itz is an app that lets

568
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:31,240
you order a Garfield shaped pizza, comma, a lasagna, comma, or a Garfield themed coffee.

569
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,280
And then while you wait, you can play Garfield themed mobile games and read Garfield comic

570
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,840
strips and watch the old Garfield cartoon show. And there is fucking videos of Jim Davis, the man

571
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:50,040
himself on the website talking about the core concept behind Garfield Itz, which is a concept

572
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:56,920
called entergagement, a combination of entertainment and engagement. That's fascinating. Garfield Itz

573
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:05,080
is entergaging fact. I mean, that's that's kind of an interesting idea to like keep people on

574
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,800
this app that's or for ordering food and then it also has games embedded in it.

575
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,280
Interesting. Yes. Good. Capitalist nightmare. Absolutely.

576
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:22,680
If you'd please direct yourself to the Garfield Itz website, which will you'll start scrolling

577
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:28,120
and you'll start thinking, haha, this is really funny. And then the God awful music will start

578
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:33,880
playing and you'll just like scramble to the volume mixer and fucking have a herney in the meantime.

579
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:41,960
Garfield Itz's catchphrase slogan is love me, feed me, don't leave me. It's the neat. It's the

580
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:49,480
neediest app of all time made by a disgusting man who photoshopped his own mouth to be tiny and dull

581
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,200
like because maybe that's cool. It's Saudi Arabia or something. I don't fucking get it.

582
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:00,760
The head manager is this is a guy who like just like he talks about how much he loves Garfield

583
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,880
and he has a small mouth because he purposely tries to Photoshop his mouth and all the in all

584
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,040
the Instagram if you go if you go to like his uh personal Instagram all the pictures of his face

585
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:19,320
his lips are like shrunk to make him look more attractive question mark. Huh. Yeah. Okay. Well,

586
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:26,520
that's cool. It's what it's allies with this man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, the guy had

587
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:32,200
like the idea for the app and then he went to Jim, I think. Okay. And Jim was like entertainment.

588
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Like, is entertainment not in and of itself? If you are entertained, are you not also engaged?

589
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,360
I mean, you'd think so. But I mean, maybe I would keep you that way. Like, I would think so.

590
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:54,760
Like, I mean, this app almost holds you hostage. It's like the it's like the message. It's like the

591
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:02,440
rallying cry for to use this app is like, come be ensnared in our corporate web, like have your

592
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,800
focus have your focus diverted to our IP. Well, you know, man, that's interesting because I that's

593
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,600
kind of how I think about like MMOs in general, which is why I've never really gotten into one.

594
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,080
So people, you know, depending on the quality of it, people are willing to sign up for that

595
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,680
shit. Well, yeah, yeah, but they don't say it like that. Well, yeah, I mean, yeah. Okay, fair enough.

596
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:28,040
They don't talk about like, like the hot this hot new MMO is going to enter gauge the shit out of you.

597
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:34,360
Well, you know, I might be tempted. They might say, you know, I'm going to be immersed and,

598
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,920
you know, I'm going to get my Pete Garfield shape lasagna delivered to me or immersed. I don't know.

599
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,320
You know, it's the talk about like immersion, talking about like, you know, adventure or

600
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,160
whatever, like those words are like, they're trying to sell like how fun, how much fun you'll

601
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,200
have, how cool it'll be, a word like enter gaugement, which is like, prominently featured on the

602
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,640
Garfield eats advertisement. Yeah, no, it's like, it's like naked business naked business talk,

603
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:03,880
like right out front. Guys, can you can you even like it's palpable. It's inside base. It's inside

604
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:10,600
baseball brought outside into the day. The markup they can charge on a pizza that they fuck up the

605
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:17,080
dough on and make slightly like like implied Garfield ears by just like not creating the dough

606
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:24,920
correctly and like, like making a little bit misshapen. The markup is like $4. It's I'll pay,

607
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,720
I'll pay, I'll pay extra to be enter gauge. I'll pay extra to have my pizza suck shit, please.

608
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:36,920
Yes. I mean, I think about like, what makes me like, please misshape my pizza. I'll give you

609
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:43,000
anything. I'll fucking order it from any app. I'll pay any amount. Please make my pizza not a

610
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:48,920
circle. It's like think about Garfield for one extra second of my life while I cut off his fucking

611
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,120
ears to devour. I should mention that's like the delivery of the like, like the Garfield eats

612
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,320
delivery service, like they all get delivered on like eco friendly green like scooters. Oh, yeah,

613
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,720
like they have like a fleet of Garfield eats scooters that is like going around fucking

614
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,760
Dubai or whatever. You know, when I was in Japan, pizza was kind of a luxury item there. And like,

615
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,120
I don't everything's really condensed. So like there's this tiny little pizza shops,

616
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,200
but you see outside of them, like in Tokyo, you'll see like a fleet of little buggies

617
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,840
that are like that's how they deliver pizzas in Tokyo. I mean, that's just that's just that just

618
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,560
seems efficient. Also, the pizzas are tiny, but that's that's Japan. They're like that in Italy,

619
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,520
too. Italy, pizzas are like a like a personal thing. They're not for it. But it's Italy. What

620
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,560
are they doing? They every pizza should be twice the size through the through the sheer. What's

621
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,200
that like the the geographic boost, like the stat boost to be a whole team, a whole team

622
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:46,440
advantage like stab stab stab type, you know, advantage. They just don't see differently.

623
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,200
It's it's a change in perspective. I guess it's not it's not communal engagement. Italians hate

624
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,600
the family. They're trying to actively destroy it. Yeah, you know what they say about Italy,

625
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:03,160
when you're here, you're not family. Hey, but on this game subject, though, like, okay, I'm thinking

626
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,720
about a game that I love right now, Sekiro. And I'm like, why do I play Sekiro? What am I getting

627
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:13,000
out of it? Specifically with Sekiro, it's like two main things. One is like the sheer joy of

628
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,120
exploring the environment, because it's totally sick. And the other thing is like, like, obtaining

629
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:25,640
mechanical competence and overcoming obstacles, especially in flashy and impressive ways. So,

630
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,520
so, you know, that that's pretty sick. But like with an MMO, like, I guess you definitely get

631
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:34,760
both of those things as well. But there's also like, I don't know, when people talk about like

632
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,040
VR and like wanting to immerse themselves, I get like almost scared of the idea of getting immersed

633
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:46,120
in like a VR world. I want a clear, defined line between me and the virtual world. Have you well,

634
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,560
have you have you used a Oculus Rift or something? Have you used a VR headset? Only like once at

635
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:57,080
Bronycon for like, oh, yeah, yeah, that that was rainbow dash flying around or something. That was

636
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:03,240
my first time using one, too. Well, you know, I have I have an Oculus Rift. Yeah. And, you know,

637
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:11,640
it's not it's it's not like you don't know there's a screen. Well, sure. Sure. So I don't know. Well,

638
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,760
I'm more questioning the the motivation doesn't concern me. What do you mean? Well, like, like,

639
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,480
I mean, with this with this quote here from our boy, Druckman, you know, like, we don't use the

640
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,280
word, but like, yeah, it's interesting to think about which game he's talking about. Well, he's

641
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:31,720
not talking about like, you know, some like you could imagine VR or whatever being used for like

642
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,040
just to create like an environment you can like explore and walk around or something like it's

643
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,520
just cool in some way. Like that may or may not be defined as fun. But he's talking about Last of

644
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:46,840
Us 2 specifically. And like, I don't know, like that game I would imagine is fun. And like, isn't

645
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:52,920
it fun to like get a sick headshot when you're down your last minute and you know, you got to make

646
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:57,640
the primary goal. So they thus they don't talk about the word fun.

647
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,040
I mean, I guess that's not their primary ethos when developing the game.

648
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:08,040
You know, honestly, I think probably their their ethos of it was probably like, you know, immersion,

649
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:14,840
engagement. Yeah, maybe. Intergagement in a way. Intergagement, you know, building tension.

650
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,840
Which, you know, might have the side effect of fun. Well, at what point does it become like a

651
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,320
primary focus? And what point is it just a side effect? I mean, they're making the game. They

652
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,120
know what it's going to evoke in people. They do testing and whatnot. Do they though? I mean,

653
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:35,400
I mean, they made Last of Us 1. Death of the Author, baby. You know, it kind of doesn't matter

654
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,200
what their ethos is. If like the end product comes out as something people want to experience.

655
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,400
I mean, whatever they call that fun or not. You know, honestly, this is a semantic argument. I

656
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,360
could, you know, I could rail and whine and bitch and virgin rage about his usage of the word fun

657
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,400
in this particular way. But ultimately, I mean, I would argue that I think you're trying to make

658
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,000
the game a little bit fun, dude. So that seems a little strange to me. But you know what? Who gives

659
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,080
a fuck? Oh, it's part of the problem. Okay, it's part of the problem to you that it's like,

660
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:08,200
like, you're trying to make the game fun. Like, like, are you like, like, obviously, that must

661
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,000
be something that means to be sub numbered in your calculation. So are you trying to say that you're

662
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,040
not making it fun to appease other people? Is that what you're suspecting that he's trying to be like

663
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:23,400
hoity toity and not like like be like games are an art and we're not about fun here. We're about

664
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,800
telling a story. Yeah, is that where the end comes from? Yeah, my my my gaydar flares when I hear,

665
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:35,800
you know, things of that nature. So yeah, so yeah, I have multiple gaydar various strikes. I mean,

666
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:41,800
you know, it is for a company like Naughty Dog to say that I mean, they made like Jack and Daxter,

667
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,840
right? But times have changed, you know, I guess times have changed. But still,

668
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,280
yeah, still that that's not the company I would think of to say something. I would mean, I would

669
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,320
think of like, you know, maybe someone like Jonathan Blow might say something like that.

670
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,720
Yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, what are the guy who made papers, please? When I played,

671
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,800
what are those Nathan Drake? What are those games, you know, explore uncharted when I played the

672
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:11,160
uncharted to only and like the whole time, those are definitely meant to be fun. Oh,

673
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,720
yeah, that's true. But like, when I was playing that, I felt like this is this is kind of weird,

674
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:21,000
like this game is a little bit too close to like a Hollywood movie that's not that great. And like

675
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,320
also like the controls like aren't super fun. So like, I feel like the the goal of that game was

676
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:32,120
just totally not what someone like me, like sure, it looked beautiful. And like, I don't know, I'd

677
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:37,000
rather just like watch a movie than play that particular game. I have never I have, I have

678
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
never played an uncharted. Yeah, I listen to like reviews of the whole, God, was it was it super

679
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,080
bunny hop or someone? Yeah, someone did like a big like a big like series of reviews about the

680
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:56,280
whole series. My impression is that playing one of those is basically just like a a like watching

681
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,400
an Indiana Jones movie, but like, you're hitting the buttons to make it happen. Yeah, yeah. And

682
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:06,440
which is very weird. And yeah, it does kind of seem like the antithesis of what I want in a game,

683
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:11,160
because I'm all I'm all about fucking, you know, action and like I'm all about like

684
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,440
platforming and like twitchy reflexes and enter the gungeon and down well and stuff that that's

685
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:24,040
my jam. I'm I like my I like my games, gamey. Same please. But I but I mean, I just suppose

686
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,960
that the sort of I don't think I don't think it's invalid, like I don't think that game. It's not

687
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:33,240
invalid, but I guess it makes me feel that like the the category of what makes for like triple

688
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:39,320
a great top of the line game like that. That's really widened. And maybe games like Final Fantasy

689
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:44,280
Seven are like responsible for you know, I mean, it was it was a big one along those lines. Although

690
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,960
the game that game was gamey as fuck. But it'd be it'd be foolish to not address the FMB creep.

691
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,760
Which game? Final Fantasy Seven, Final Fantasy Seven. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a big

692
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:00,280
was a big boost and all that shit. And look where it's landed screenix now in the shitter,

693
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:07,160
I would say in many ways, in many ways. I don't know games are complicated. It's weird.

694
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,360
Video game consoles are weird. Like I have to like consoles are weird and I don't like like

695
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:20,840
they're a computer. But PS5 was just announced. Yeah, they're a very limited streamlined computer.

696
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,960
PS5 was just an I think like documents are released. Who fucking cares at the PlayStation

697
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,160
PlayStation sucks, dude. It's all about the GameCube. PS4 is doing I think it's leading. I think

698
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:37,160
it's like winning the console war currently. The console war is like you like okay, you pop out

699
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:41,560
two you'd pop out three babies, you put them in a pig pen and you was like come back three years

700
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,880
later like oh, who won? Oh, I guess this baby won but he's still corpse. You know, it doesn't

701
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,400
matter. They're all dumb and I hate them. Consoles are like 600 bucks now, right? Well,

702
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,680
600, but they're expensive. Yeah, like consoles being as expensive as they are,

703
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:01,480
I kind of don't understand why we aren't just why we aren't just playing on PC. Yeah, I think

704
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,680
I think things are moving more and more that way. But I don't know. There's a lot of console

705
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,160
loyalists out there. Something like the switch like the switch brings something to the table.

706
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,560
And I know I don't have a switch, but I know everybody loves this. I have a switch and it

707
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,760
almost turned me away because it was extremely is way more expensive than I wanted to pay for

708
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,240
something. Yeah, because for the amount that I that I knew I would use it and continue to use it

709
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,480
now. But ultimately, I think it was worth it. But like a play station where it's like the reason

710
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,920
like the switch is because I can play it, you know, outside the house or anywhere like tucked away

711
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,760
and warm and cuddly. Exactly. I'm all about getting up and like turn on my TV to play a video game.

712
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,840
No one's got time for that shit. And that would be the most uncomfortable experience of my life.

713
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:50,600
I would hate doing that. I would never want to pay $400 to like turn on my TV. That's a nightmare

714
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,920
I can't abide by. I've just got a super powerful, you know, video game machine,

715
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:01,000
aka my computer that I just played Sekiro on brand new game. It runs like a dream and is fantastic.

716
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,120
And my computer is great. So it's not a problem. But sitting above it, I've got my ps4, my ps3,

717
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,760
my switches to the left. I mean, I got them because like, I don't know, had to play Bloodborne.

718
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:17,480
So had to buy a ps4. But for how long? For how long is the question? I'm surprised we're still

719
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,600
doing the console model. Honestly, it's weird. Yeah, I don't get it. I don't get why we have an

720
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,920
all transition. I mean, the weird thing that's happening now is like, have you heard about

721
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,760
like the Epic Store is rising as a real arrival to steam? I have heard of it. And I don't know

722
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,120
what it is. It's basically, you can just think of it like steam only, like they are much stauncher

723
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,560
gatekeepers of what content gets onto their shit. Because they kind of they make more of a pomp and

724
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,680
circumstance about which games get on there. They're like, wait, what are they? Are they selling

725
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:53,960
PC games? Like, are they basically just steam? Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. Okay. Okay,

726
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:00,760
Nate, why do people hate steam? I mean, I can tell you why I personally hate steam. And it's

727
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:06,840
because it is so I don't know how to use it. And it's so fucking hard every time. It's like weird

728
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:13,320
to like find games. And I don't know, maybe I'm not a PC genius. If I don't understand, if you know

729
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,400
what you're looking for, it's not hard to find a game. You know, that's probably true. I have been

730
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:24,200
plagued by confusion and issues with using steam for years. Maybe I know, I know, I know, I know

731
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,720
that I know that steam has a lot of like shit on it. But like, you don't have to buy. Yeah, you

732
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,680
don't have to wait. Okay, hold on. Okay, Nate, that's so contrary to my steam experience. Here's

733
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:42,040
I just did this to test to make sure I click on the steam app. It opens up. And I and I it's

734
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:47,880
literally one click away from being in a game not as into type over the games list. I mean,

735
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,920
you just have a list of all the games I own immediately upon pressing start. I might just

736
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,080
be an idiot. All right, let's do a challenge. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Yeah, I don't I actually I

737
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,800
don't get what you don't understand about using steam. I do it does annoy me that all my steam

738
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,600
games have to open steam and like games won't run if I'm not online because that's annoying for

739
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,640
sure. Yeah, that is horrible. And I hate it. But like, what do you mean? That's stupid. Okay, it

740
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,440
shouldn't be the case mandatory, but it doesn't bother me at all. I mean, it does bother me. Okay,

741
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,280
but I've just learned to live with it at this point. I mean, I guess that's okay. Let's do a test.

742
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,040
Name a game on steam. What's a game on steam? I probably don't have to. Oh, are you talking about

743
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:34,360
buying games? Hattiful boy. Oh, okay, wait, okay. I'm gonna go try to buy this right now. I'm not

744
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,560
going to. I'm gonna see if I can do it. All right. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, you know what?

745
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:43,320
Nate, stop, stop. Of course you don't do that yet. The search bar issues with like the library.

746
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,880
Look, I know I had like my parental thing was like locked on for some reason. I couldn't get to my

747
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,200
Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, okay. Okay, I'm gonna close steam. You close steam too.

748
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:59,240
I'm gonna time us and we're gonna see how long it takes me. This is so this is so fucking dumb.

749
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,640
You just you just type the name and you find what's the problem? We're gonna see. We're gonna see.

750
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,280
We're gonna see right now. What's the name of the game again, Ben? Hattiful boyfriend. Okay.

751
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:13,320
Hattiful boyfriend. All right. All right. Start the timer now. I'm starting up steam right now.

752
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:18,280
Here I go. Yep. It was closed. It's updating. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Updating for available updates.

753
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,520
All right. Gonna do this for 45 minutes. That's fine. All right. So we'll just we'll wait. We'll

754
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,680
see what's passed. No, I can still wait. 14 seconds in. 15 seconds in. I got it.

755
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:33,000
I'm searching the store. Okay. I'm there. It's still updating for me. Hattiful. I see it right

756
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,640
there. Okay. I'm at the page. I see there's a there's a bird. That's the bird. Okay. And I'm

757
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:44,280
still updating on add to cart. And where do I purchase for myself? I'm clicking on it.

758
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,720
And okay, I'm at the place where I can now buy it. Okay. So that's it. That was that was 30 seconds.

759
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:57,720
So what was the problem? Okay. The problem may have been some reason I have had like my parental

760
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:05,800
like limit on on steam for like years. And I don't know why and I did fix this the other day.

761
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:11,720
But it's just given me a real sour taste in my mind. I can only imagine. But you know what?

762
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:16,600
You're free now. I guess I'm free now. I suppose that's true. But I just feel I don't I don't

763
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,920
trust this. Like the birds and hatch a full boyfriend. This feels like a false sense of

764
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,560
security. This this bird's cold gaze looking at me. I feel like at any moment, it's real. It'll

765
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:31,640
betray me. He means every word. I feel like I've been here before. But I guess we'll see. I guess

766
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:37,480
we'll see. You felt this way before. So. Okay. Well, the point is steam. You know, a lot of

767
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,160
I don't I don't understand this. I know that a lot of like, particularly,

768
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:47,800
uh, well, I guess I'll just say, you know, like left wing ish, like free anti free speech kind

769
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:53,240
of people are like one, they don't like the Twitter allows a lot of hateful rhetoric on Twitter.

770
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:59,960
And then similarly, I think that same crowd also doesn't like that steam lets like unsavory content

771
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,640
on it. Like that's what like, like, like school shooter simulator and, you know, stuff like that

772
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:12,760
or, you know, like all the sex dojin stuff. Yeah, I from what I understand, those people

773
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,000
don't love that steam lets a lot of, you know, that kind of things on air. I don't care. Let

774
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,400
everything on. I don't give a shit. Okay. I know some people make an argument that like the crap

775
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,120
covers up the good stuff, whatever, don't care. Anyway, so Epic store exists. And some people

776
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,440
are making the jump because steam was the only party in town for a while. Wait, hold on. I want

777
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,440
to touch on that. Sure. For the crap to cover up the good stuff, you'd have to be on steam,

778
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,840
like, which I guess that's how some people use it. Actually, you know what, I have done that

779
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,800
because there were like, like, at some point, I would occasionally just jump on steam and look

780
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,560
at what's on sale. Yeah, that's the issue. I guess they're talking about just scroll through the

781
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:52,120
really cheap stuff. And yeah, there is a lot of like, really bad, like completely amateur hack

782
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,160
shit that I don't know why it's on there doesn't bother me at all. Actually, that's how I found

783
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:00,040
that's how I found Lisa the painful. Oh, there you go. I was just going through like cheap

784
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,520
shit on sale on steam. I mean, and I found and I found Lisa on sale for like $2.99,

785
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,880
and I thought the trailer was cool. And it was fucking great. Yeah.

786
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:14,280
Like does not impact me whatsoever, even one bit. It just means there's more options on the

787
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:20,360
platform. It does not obstruct any of the views. If you know, possibly like all it takes is like

788
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,600
like we just did with our wonderful exercise just now, if you know the game you're looking for,

789
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,320
it couldn't be easier to find you simply search for the game. And it's either there or it's not

790
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:34,040
if it's like not on steam or whatever. So yeah, so I mean, there's nothing to cut through there.

791
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:39,000
It's cool that people who don't like it have an option now, but I just never understood why people

792
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:48,680
don't like it. Hi, Tom Oliver here, world renowned video game creator and editor of this

793
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,760
Procrastinator's podcast. And there's really only so long I can sit here listening to these

794
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:01,720
fucking idiots talking about video games out of their asses. So I'm here to set the fucking record

795
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:07,240
straight and save this episode from heaps of criticism in the comments. First of all, the

796
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:13,480
console market exists primarily for two reasons in this day and age. One is cost and two is barrier

797
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:20,360
of entry. Even if consoles cost $600 now Ben, which they don't their 300 bucks across the board

798
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,880
are probably going to drop in price within the next year or so as the next generation of consoles

799
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:30,840
are announced. The reason that this market exists and this cost is important is because PCs to play

800
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:36,520
games at the same level of consoles are more expensive to build a PC right now in the mid range

801
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:43,160
that can adequately play games is about $500 to $600 for decent components. And that's not

802
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:49,000
including a Windows license, a display and then decent peripherals like a mouse, a keyboard,

803
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,880
and a gamepad. Put that all together, you're in the $800 plus range to get set up on PC,

804
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:01,880
as opposed to a $300 box that plugs into your TV you already have. So it's much cheaper for the

805
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:07,800
average person to just buy a PlayStation and not think about it for five to 10 years, as opposed

806
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,920
to building a PC and then having to upgrade the components constantly every couple years to be

807
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,200
able to play at decent settings. The second reason for consoles kind of builds off of that.

808
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,880
No pun intended. Building. To get a PC at a respectable price, you have to build it because

809
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,040
you're going to pay extra to have another vendor build it for you, whether it's a big company like

810
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:33,960
HP or Dell or a smaller vendor like CyberPower or iBuyPower or what have you. So if you want to

811
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:40,360
build a PC that takes much more skill than just again going to Best Buy, paying a single price,

812
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:44,760
getting a console, putting it on your desk and forgetting about it for the next 10 years. So

813
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,480
for these two reasons, consoles are around to stay because they're easier to get into and for

814
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:55,560
most people they cost less. Now for the Epic Games Store, this is really less of a problem with

815
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:02,840
consumers and more of developers versus consumers because consumers like Steam. Steam's been around

816
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:08,200
for like 10 fucking years now. Everybody has a huge library on Steam. The platform from a consumer

817
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:14,680
standpoint is very mature. It has all the features you'd want, wish list, shopping carts, user reviews,

818
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:22,280
a big community feature. Steam is established and people like Steam and users. However, because

819
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:28,200
they allow everything on the platform for the most part with very little curation, new developers

820
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:34,200
coming in who want to kind of like have their shit be noticed is very difficult because

821
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:40,120
dozens and dozens of games release on Steam every day. So unless you've built up a huge

822
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,640
presence on social media outside of Steam, you're not going to have a lot of people finding your

823
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:51,880
game. The onus really falls upon the developer to build up hype for themselves. The value of

824
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:57,400
publishing on Steam is not as big as it once was because everybody can just fucking do it.

825
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:03,240
You know, before in the beginning, if you were on Steam, you were on the big platform that not

826
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:08,600
everybody could get into. And so the clout of just being on Steam was a reason to be there in and of

827
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,200
itself. Nowadays, since everybody and can just asset flip on Steam, it doesn't mean shit, which

828
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,160
means you the developer have to work harder to get noticed outside of that platform to build an

829
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,640
audience before you even launch. So you're going to have any success on Steam anyways, because the

830
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:29,800
majority of your games sales happened within the first three days of release. So if you're releasing

831
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:35,080
with 50 60 100 other games at the same time, and you haven't built any presence outside of Steam's

832
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,760
launch, you're fucked. This is why Epic Games is targeting developers making all these deals to

833
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:46,520
bring in big high end games to be exclusive on this epic game store for six months to a year,

834
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,840
because that's going to bring in consumers, people who end up buying games. And it's also

835
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:55,960
attractive for smaller developers, maybe not one man studios, but smaller dev teams to go

836
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:01,160
onto the store that has less noise and a better chance of their game being seen by the public.

837
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,720
Now, Epic and steam aren't the only names in the game. You also have origin, you have you play,

838
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,960
and you have Gog. Gog is really good because they don't have any DRM or anything. But another

839
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,040
interesting player for small indie guys is Discord. Discord is trying to build their own

840
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:18,280
publishing service. And they're integrating it with Discord communities, which lots of small

841
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:22,760
development teams already have. So there's tons of players in this game right now. And it's going

842
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,560
to be really interesting to see over the next couple years how everything pans out. Epic does seem

843
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:32,520
set up to be the big new player that's going to be able to actually give steam a run for its money

844
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,720
and might actually end up being the de facto players because 10 cent who own so much of Epic

845
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:43,400
has so much cash to throw around, they can keep just getting all these exclusives. So the next

846
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:48,760
like 12 to 24 months is really going to be interesting because Epic has the exclusives,

847
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,720
but has none of the features that people from a consumer standpoint really enjoy about steam.

848
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,480
But at the end of the day, people are impatient and want to play their games. And when Borderlands

849
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,960
3 drops, you bet your ass is going to be a huge spike in Epic Games installs that day.

850
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,800
That's all I have to say. Get back to the podcast, patreon.com,

851
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,000
such as Polystation 2. If you want more commentary about games, that's actually informed.

852
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:14,600
Well now, now the world that we're arriving in is a world where like instead of having a bunch

853
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:21,160
of consoles, what we might find in the years to come is a series of icons of different online

854
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:27,160
game stores on your desktop. That's less bad. I mean, it's just probably annoying that I have

855
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:31,880
to deal with that. It is the biggest issue. You just kind of know which platform it is. I mean,

856
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:38,680
as long as it doesn't cost me anymore, I don't care. Like for my own convenience, I would sure

857
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:44,680
like if everything was in one place. But again, if I consider myself a relatively educated consumer

858
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:50,280
here, I will know what games I want to play and I will go find them. But you know, I find myself

859
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,280
at times, like your lease experience there, there's times when you're just looking for a game and

860
01:19:54,280 --> 01:20:00,040
you know, you'd want the quality curated so as you don't waste your time. And at those times,

861
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:07,480
I have been frustrated by the like swaths of totally amateur like crappy visual novel shits for

862
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:13,240
99 cents. But like it's weird to think that like deals. It's weird to think that the solution to

863
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:19,400
this problem is ban more things from Steam or you know, don't let them hold on. Hold on. It's not

864
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,760
we're not talking about banning. It's a question of curation. I mean, of like quality of like,

865
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:30,840
like they're a company. And like to you might argue that like their, you know, values or their,

866
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:36,280
you know, their quality standards are reflected in the products that they're willing to, you know,

867
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:41,800
host on through their platform. I mean, sure, sure. That's true. But like, let's just accept

868
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,680
the reality that there are games who that are there on Steam now that as this progresses may

869
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,840
not be there anymore. And I mean, I would argue that's a bad thing. I'd want them to be available.

870
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:57,880
I don't know if they'll get promoted. Nate, I mean, they're not, they're a publisher. They're

871
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,680
not obligated to publish everything. Like every publisher has to choose like, what do we want?

872
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:06,680
Like what's good enough? What do we want our brand to be associated with? Well, I mean,

873
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,720
that's choose what to publish and whatnot. That's certainly true. I just simply want the

874
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:16,520
availability of every game somewhere. And I mean, again, like for me, it's just the most

875
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:23,080
convenient thing. Well, yeah, but not through, I mean, you're arguing that a privately owned

876
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:30,680
company should be obligated to publish everything? Well, first of all, I never said that. I did not

877
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:35,000
take that position. That's what you just said. I mean, no, that's not true. Maybe you're trying

878
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,160
to follow my logic through to what you think is the conclusion. I mean, look, they're a private

879
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,080
company. I can't force them to do anything. That's the end of the story. But you didn't

880
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:47,880
talk about what you wanted me to do. You want them to publish everything. Here's what I want.

881
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:53,400
I want someone I don't care who to make every game available in one place for my personal

882
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:58,760
convenience. That's what I want. But I'm aware that that will not happen. So there's no even

883
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:05,560
point telling me it's dumb. I get it. That's the end. That's the end. Every every game includes

884
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:11,640
some shit that some kids shout out in their fucking beginner programming. Yeah, so just have

885
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,560
those be, you know, on the platform. So I have to search them out if I want to get them. But you

886
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,560
know, why do you why do those have to be on a platform? Those things can be like those things

887
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:25,880
can be available for my convenience is why that's why for my simplicity. That's the only reason.

888
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:31,560
Well, but as long as the game plays, that's all I get like whatever. It's just a portal.

889
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:36,200
That sort of flies in the face of like what it is to be a publisher.

890
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,400
But okay, well, why is it that I mean steam themselves took the look there. I know that

891
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,560
that's changing recently seems to be mostly due to market out like, you know, consumer outcry or

892
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,280
whatever. But like remember when steam took the position that like, we're just going to allow

893
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,840
everything that doesn't like break the law or whatever. Like they already did this. I'm just

894
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:00,520
saying that I liked that. I thought that was good. So you know, I know that I really like I

895
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,800
don't understand. Okay, I love I like the fact I literally enjoy the fact that like, you know,

896
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:11,320
not polished games can get on to steam. Because I like the fact that there can be like, you know,

897
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:17,960
it's like a big old, it's a big old marketplace that term implies a lot. But I don't really mean

898
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,720
like that. But it's like, you know, it's a big old space, where even even maybe some of the

899
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:27,080
unpolished, maybe some of the amateur stuff can rise to the top. If you know, if it's if it's good

900
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:31,480
enough, people reviewed enough, I think that's cool that you can be independent and it can and

901
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,880
it becomes successful. I don't want quality crowded out, obviously. But I mean, that strikes me as

902
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:41,320
just like, you know, like, I would put the curation in the like, what's promoted, like what, you know,

903
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:46,920
maybe like user votes or something or staff picks or, you know, I would use things like that to

904
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,840
put things to the top. That's, you know, that's that's what I'd like. But then if I want to play

905
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,240
some bullshit, then I just type in the name and no, it's weird. Yeah, it's we I don't really

906
01:23:55,240 --> 01:24:02,200
understand steam because like it's not they don't just allow everything. And yet some of the some

907
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:07,880
of the cruft that is on there seems like it could only be there if they just allowed everything.

908
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:12,440
Are you talking about low quality games or like, you know, like questionable content sort of?

909
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:17,560
No, I'm talking about low quality shit. I'm talking about shit that just seems like incompetent.

910
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,040
I think steam will allow anything that fucking runs and like passes their generic like, you know,

911
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:28,120
green light test. Well, I think they've changed their process a lot. Like, I mean, I think getting

912
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:34,040
on to steam used to be a bigger deal. And maybe maybe it is that now, I think now it's like,

913
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,960
to get on steam, you have to you have to pay like maybe $100 like application fee or something.

914
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,360
And then and then I think it might be a community thing, like you need a certain number of votes

915
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:49,800
on green light or something. So now maybe it is that literally anything can get on there as long

916
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:55,160
as it has enough like community support or whatever. Yeah, I don't know. I've seen a I assume you've

917
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:00,680
seen like, the Jim Sterling like digital homicide. I'm familiar with it in general. Yeah.

918
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:09,080
Yeah, like, I mean, the digital homicide games are just their trap, their asset flips. They're

919
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:16,520
not illegal, per se. But, you know, they basically only they only made sales by promoting themselves

920
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:23,800
with like giveaways and like some like dodgy like, like, you know, reward programs and stuff like

921
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:30,200
they would like give you steam credit in exchange for buying their games or some weird, some weird

922
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:35,800
shit. Yeah. And I mean, but you know, I've never really understood look, it's fun. I totally get

923
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:41,320
Jim saying that they're terrible games in talking mad shit. But I've always like, what's the real

924
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:46,920
problem here? Are those games being promoted above games that deserve it more? Is that like the

925
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:52,520
issue? And are consumers being taken advantage of in some way? I mean, I don't know who's to say

926
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:57,480
that like, you know, that they are, I think like, like terrible and no one wants to play them, you

927
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:02,600
know, I don't know. I don't think that was with digital homicide. I think the real problem was

928
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,720
their like frivolous lawsuits against a guy for criticizing. Well, that okay, I get that I get

929
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:12,680
that in that case that that's what like the controversy was other than the fact that they're

930
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,720
just I mean, yeah, I think it was like Jim played the games, shit talk them and then like lawsuits

931
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,120
ensued and that was bullshit. Like he's allowed to shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well,

932
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:30,040
that all sounds fine to me. You know, I don't know. It is it is kind of cool that it is kind of

933
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:33,960
cool that just any old fucking thing can get on there because sometimes, you know, sometimes an

934
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,600
amateur piece of shit or not a piece of sometimes an amateur project that's made with little technical

935
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:44,120
still can skill still have like a cool aesthetic or like a cool idea somewhere in it that that that

936
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:52,280
can indeed, you know, resonate with people and that and that's neat. So I don't know. I guess,

937
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:57,960
you know, to achieve that steam kind of had to sort of bite the bullet and be like, okay, well,

938
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:02,680
we don't really have any quality standards. Yeah, in terms of what's allowed in our plan,

939
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:07,000
but you know, they can still curate in the sense of what the total opposite of Epic's approach,

940
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,040
where like they're, I think it's Epic anyway, like they are curating like they want good big games,

941
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:16,200
like only on their shit, which, you know, that's fine. I'd be interested to see who does better

942
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:21,560
long term just for the sake of is Epic like the is that like the four? Yes, that's correct. That's

943
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,560
correct. Okay. Oh, there. Yeah, they're they're getting involved in the in the distribution of

944
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:33,160
games game. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. They're they're big. They're they're doing well. Was there anything

945
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:39,880
else I was going to say on that? I can't wait for Disney to own Fortnite. When the buy out it when

946
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:46,840
the buy out Epic games. Disney's buying everything. No. What? What's wrong? What? What don't you like?

947
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:51,320
Ben? I don't understand. What wouldn't you like about about Disney owning? I can't wait to see

948
01:27:51,400 --> 01:28:01,560
Mickey flossing. Oh my god. Yes. This is a perfect segue. Yeah. Perfect segue into my life. Do the

949
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:15,880
first tunnel. So sorry. He sort of unlocked new Keyblade Orange Justice. You know, that's a Fortnite

950
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:20,760
thing, right? I don't know, but it sounds right. Did you know that Sora does do a big old dab

951
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:25,880
in Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance? Fuck. Yeah, no, I didn't know that. He does it.

952
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,680
He's a killer. He's a killer through and through. That's true.

953
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:38,760
Well, speaking of big corporations, I paid my taxes this week. The United States,

954
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:44,440
the corporation that it is. Well, I'm just mad. I'm just mad that I paid more than Amazon in

955
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:48,360
taxes. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm just throwing that out there as a point. Argue

956
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:55,160
amongst yourselves about the justice inherent in that. It's not that you, well, like, what do you

957
01:28:55,160 --> 01:29:01,560
mean? What? What? Say it. Well, I'll kill you. Okay. Amazon provides value through its commerce,

958
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:08,200
like, and so they make deals with particular constituencies to, you know, get like their

959
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:14,440
costs mitigated because, I mean, you know, why does the state make this a deal? Because Amazon

960
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,760
provides them value and like, they're getting something in exchange for it. So, you know,

961
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:24,600
instead of paying money. Yes. And the end result is that they make $11 billion in profits and pay

962
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:32,920
no taxes. And I, Ben St, internet, indie content creator, make, you know, you know, struggle and

963
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:38,040
scratch my way up to crack the fucking five digit mark and pay more than them to the American

964
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:44,040
government. So that's pretty neat. Well, good stuff. Good stuff. I would argue if that's as

965
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:50,200
much of an injustice as it is being framed as, but I know we disagree on these, these topics

966
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:59,480
to a degree. Apparently, apparently so. So we did that. Also, so I was like, gone from the internet

967
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,880
for a while. Like, I, yeah, everyone thought I was dead. Everyone thought yet, right, because I,

968
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,000
yeah, I was like, yeah, desperately trying to get a hold of it. Everyone was trying to reach me.

969
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,440
I was off the internet. I did. Hold on. Okay. You were off the internet, but why didn't you

970
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:18,840
answer the calls that Nate sent you? I mean, Ben also just doesn't keep his phone. I don't look

971
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:25,000
at my phone. I wasn't looking at my phone. I did my taxes. I reorganized my room, which was a very

972
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:32,600
gratifying experience. He gives the mental map of your room. Well, my bed is now it's not in the,

973
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:37,480
it's not in the far left corner. It's in the near left corner and it's vertically oriented

974
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:43,720
instead of horizontal. I understand. Yeah. So I have a lot more, I moved, okay, okay. I had like

975
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:48,280
my dresser sort of tucked into a tiny little alcove, little corner part of my room that was

976
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:54,200
completely inaccessible. So I moved that out to my actual floor. So now I can actually keep my clothes

977
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,760
in it and access them. Oh, nice. It's great. It's really, it's really great. I no longer just have,

978
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,880
my clothes are no longer just in a big old fucking pile on my floor. They're actually

979
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:07,560
endorsement. I have a quote unquote clothes closet, but what that is is a repository where I dump all

980
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:13,400
my clean clothes in this closet and I have never folded them or attempted to organize them. I sift

981
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:17,800
through the pile for clothes. I'm surprised. I know. I'm surprised. I think people would be surprised

982
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:23,640
about the some of the slovenly aspects to my life that I don't broadcast publicly very often,

983
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,760
but this is one of them. My room is actually pretty neat. By doing all this, I opened up a lot

984
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:33,960
more floor space in front of my windows and now I realize that I need, much like the dude,

985
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:38,520
I need a rug. I have this empty floor and I need a rug. I'm looking at the space right now and it

986
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,560
would really tie the room together. I watched The Big Lebowski just the other day again. It was

987
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:47,000
good. It's very good. It's a good, it's a good film. Yeah. I just got this, this void, this empty void

988
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:53,640
of hardwood on my, well, it's, and it's just, it just cries out. It cries out to be covered with a

989
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:59,320
decorative item. Get that, get some sort of killer print rug or something, you know.

990
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:04,680
What print? A killer print? Yeah, you know. We don't sell rugs. Yeah, unfortunately. Red

991
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:10,760
Bubble does everything. We sell, we sell throw blankets and tapestries, which I now sleep under.

992
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:17,640
I now sleep directly under my giant cop killer insignia, drawn by, drawn by slimes, that good boy.

993
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:24,760
And it's a good, it's a good time. Anyway, my, my life feels less cluttered and I feel a little

994
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,960
less stressed to just exist in my living space. I was, I was pretty stressed about taxes as well.

995
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,200
I don't know, I keep my apartment relatively clean, but taxes was weighing on me, but it's all out

996
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:38,440
of there and it's done and that makes me feel good. You know, okay, okay. So I was doing my taxes

997
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,640
right. I go to mass.gov and I, and they're like, click here to go to an internet website where

998
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:47,320
you can do your taxes online. And you're like, Erin at website never heard of it and you stop.

999
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:53,640
I'm suspicious. So I do that and I go there, right? And it's getting late in the day. And, but you

1000
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:58,200
know, I still got time. Like I'm assuming I have until midnight and then the fucking website goes

1001
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:03,880
down at like 8pm and it doesn't come back on until like half till midnight and I'm late.

1002
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,960
Yeah. And I'm, and because of that, I end up being late. I don't send it out until like 2am and I'm

1003
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:14,840
like, fuck. However, however, so I was at the Boston comics round table this Thursday and, you

1004
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:18,600
know, after announced, we're all just kind of shooting the shit and someone, and I'm talking

1005
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,880
about this and someone tells me like, Hey, actually, due to, I don't remember some legal

1006
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,680
technicality. She's, she's like, actually, technically, you're not, you're in the clear as

1007
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,960
long as you got him in before the 17th. And I'm like, all right, if you say so, I'm going to choose

1008
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:40,760
to believe that. And that means everything's great. So yeah, did my fucking taxes like a good boy.

1009
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:46,680
Well, that's great. We all did them far too late, though. We got a next year, January rolls around.

1010
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:51,480
I can't, can you believe that people do them in fucking January? You know who does it there?

1011
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:56,760
Who doesn't in January? Jesse, Jesse did his like in January, right? As a new year hit.

1012
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,400
And I'm just like, well, shit, I gotta, I gotta get on that, man. I had all the paperwork ready.

1013
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:05,640
I just had to fucking organize it. It was just too lazy. So I, yeah, you know, like,

1014
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:10,840
there was nothing stopping me from doing it early. On the other hand, there were no consequences for

1015
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:17,320
me doing it late. Lesson learned. So what, so what's the lesson here really? Ask for forgiveness,

1016
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:23,400
not for permission. You know, just proceed until apprehended. Did you see that tweet that I made

1017
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:29,160
munchy about that? I did. I had no idea. I learned it from my mom. So I thought she invented it,

1018
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:34,040
but I guess she didn't. Nate, did you see that? It sounds familiar, but I can't remember about that

1019
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:40,360
lady. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The Navy lady, whatever. The Navy lady. Yeah. Okay. I always thought that

1020
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,440
that quote was from Teddy Roosevelt because it just sounds like something he would say, right?

1021
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:53,000
But in fact, it was the better to beg better to ask forgiveness than ask permission was from

1022
01:34:53,720 --> 01:35:00,200
God, I want to say Gail Lord Shuler, but it's definitely not her. Gail Lord Shoemaker. Gail

1023
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:09,000
Lord Shuler. Grace Hopper, who I don't know. I, God, who was it? It was, I was watching some

1024
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:16,920
fucking YouTuber. It might have been Cosmo, Cosmo, not Cosmonaut, Cosmo Kramer, something. I don't

1025
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:22,680
know. Okay. Whatever. It was some YouTuber and they mentioned it offhand. And I, they mentioned

1026
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,640
this person. I was like, wait a minute, that wasn't Teddy Roosevelt. And it looked her up.

1027
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:30,040
And she's so fucking cool. She's like a mathematician. She's like a 1930s, like

1028
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:37,800
mathematician woman who like was fucking a rear admiral in the fucking Navy and did it

1029
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,000
till she was 79 and like helped invent like early computing code. That's right. That's right. And

1030
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:49,480
then I found this quote about her that one of her, her like contemporaries says, she looks all Navy,

1031
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:53,320
but when you reach inside, you find a pirate dying to be released. And I was like, whoa.

1032
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:59,160
And I thought that was pretty much the coolest thing I'd heard about in a long time.

1033
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:03,400
Yeah, she's pretty cool. I remember hearing about it a while back. Computing pioneer. Yeah,

1034
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,560
pretty cool. Yeah. Cool. How, I don't know. Fucking neat. I think in my computer science

1035
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:12,040
education, she came up if I remember correctly. Oh, really? I think so. Oh, right. Yeah. You

1036
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:17,640
got like, you went to like school and shit for that or whatever. Indeed. Yeah. Well, I mean,

1037
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:22,760
early computing is pretty dope. You know, there was another lady like in like the 1700s. Her

1038
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:29,160
nickname, her nickname is grandma cobalt after like cobalt, the language. Yeah. That's cool.

1039
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:33,640
That's cool. That's cute. I thought there was like another lady of like the 1800s or something

1040
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:39,000
that like developed what was effectively like a very early computing language with like weird

1041
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,840
like animal like before computers existed or something. I don't know. That's crazy with that.

1042
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:49,960
Could be women doing things, like having thoughts. I meant more so the 1800s part,

1043
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,280
but also no, no, that wasn't purely my expression. That was not mocking you. No, no, no.

1044
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:01,000
Yeah. No, but that seems pretty early to be making proto computer. Yeah, I might be a little

1045
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,720
fudging the numbers there. I remember there was something like that. I don't know. I don't know.

1046
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,640
Yeah. I don't know. I've heard that like ancient, God, I don't know. This could be fake. I've heard

1047
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:20,200
that like ancient peoples have like clay jars or something with like metal, like a specific kind

1048
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:27,000
of metal rod inside. And it was like, if you filled this thing with like vinegar or some sort of

1049
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,600
acidic substance or something like that, it would have like an energy imbalance to be created.

1050
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,320
And it actually would create like a small electric current. And I think it was used to like

1051
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,320
electro plate gold onto other metals. And I don't know how that works at all. But yeah,

1052
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:48,600
I've heard that there were like relatively ancient peoples that had this sort of rudimentary way

1053
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:56,680
to create electricity and do like some weird like pseudo electrical shit. Okay, big if true. Do you

1054
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:02,440
guys ever think I like, okay, this is like a weird and I have no idea what people I'm even talking

1055
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:09,240
about. This is like a barely remembered factoid. Not an insignificant part of my life. Just like

1056
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:16,520
thinking about it is like comprised of like thinking about like ancient humans and about how we

1057
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:23,400
arrived at this point. I think about it like every day for like hours. Possibly because you're

1058
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:28,920
effectively a caveman displaced in time, sent to the far future. Yeah, it might as well be. I'm

1059
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:34,520
in Neanderthal. Yeah. Okay, I think about whenever I'm at a restaurant and thinking about like,

1060
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:38,360
this is impossible. There's no way this could possibly have happened. This isn't how like like

1061
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:42,680
earth was meant to be. Not as like it's bad, but just isn't like this is insane. This is

1062
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:48,760
fucking crazy that I'm a rough God's plan. Yeah. And I just I just often think about like how like

1063
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:54,920
fucking like insane it is that we do any of the stuff we like like who was the first person

1064
01:38:54,920 --> 01:39:01,320
to like even do stuff like as like as in like like fire, right? First person to put like meat

1065
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:06,600
over fire. Like why? That's insane. That's insane. That's madness. That's God actually. Yeah. Okay,

1066
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:12,760
I understand. So, so have some respect. Yeah. Why would you think to do that? Yeah. I mean a lot

1067
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,760
of us could have just been accidental and that people just learned from it. Well surely like

1068
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:22,840
but just like I don't know like there's so many things like we've we've so crawled up from dirt

1069
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,960
and grime and nothing. Yeah. You know, you know, I was thinking about that as like I was eating an

1070
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:34,680
avocado the other day and I was like what is it some natural instinct that made the first person

1071
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:40,520
like pick a fruit and like eat it like what made them like okay you're you're you don't know shit

1072
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,840
about the world you've been born into from nothingness and you're and you're clueless and like

1073
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:51,640
you're sure you're hungry but like how do you know to eat a thing? Well, there's an answer to that.

1074
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:55,880
There's an answer to that. How do you how do you look at like a wild fucking a piece of like wild

1075
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:01,480
mustard seed and think like I should put that thing in obviously this president for eating but

1076
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:05,800
like you know it has to start somewhere and obviously started like a like literally like like

1077
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:11,880
like the cell level first right and evolution you know bake that into us as it went along presumably

1078
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,800
the cooking thing. Well, here's what I'm if you were like just born I mean I guess if you're just

1079
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:20,760
born and like no one tells you anything and you're just a baby right yeah I guess you'll probably

1080
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,120
just have a natural instinct. Well, you'll also pick it up from people around you. Claw your way

1081
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:28,360
towards a fruit and eat it. I would think so humans humans aren't the blank slates that we sometimes

1082
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:32,760
think of them are you know there's some instincts baked in there yeah even though we're you know

1083
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:39,080
again off God's path but uh uh sure you know like like monkeys yeah dude fuck hell yeah monkeys I

1084
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:45,160
if I remember correctly I believe monkeys in some areas they do like brew alcohol like there's some

1085
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:51,240
like again I don't I don't think it's like intentional I think that there is some area I

1086
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,840
think I think I heard about this on Joe Rogan at some point that like there's some monkeys that like

1087
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:00,040
cater to like fermenting fruit and it like generates alcohol that they enjoy because it you know gets

1088
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:04,920
them fucked up or whatever uh I could be crazy but I I remember hearing something like that and

1089
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,640
that sounds like the sort of thing that's kind of a happy accident that they've you know adapted to

1090
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:15,160
or you know they're they're what limited intelligence they have you know I know monkeys are pretty smart

1091
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:21,080
I guess but like yeah they they appreciate okay I looked it up apparently apparently they they

1092
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:27,080
extract sap from a raffia palm trees and then they let the sap ferment creating a palm wine

1093
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:33,880
there you go and it seems I mean the wording of this article seems to imply that they're

1094
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:42,200
doing it on purpose which yeah I guess so shocking if true so I mean tangentially related to this I

1095
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:47,960
also often think about like going back in time or bring people into the future to like explain the

1096
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:53,240
way the world is and it's about how weird it would be to do that this is I don't understand why I do

1097
01:41:53,240 --> 01:42:00,120
this again takes up like vast swaths of my life and I don't know why I think about it so often

1098
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:04,200
you know I always think about like bringing historical leaders into the president being like

1099
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,280
here's what a plane is and they're like oh my god that's so crazy I'm like I know right and that's

1100
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:13,720
like the end of the thought uh thinking about it all the time every and then pick a new historical

1101
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:19,960
figure exactly literally exactly I think I know everything would have been relatively normal I

1102
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:26,520
think like uh uh if you brought George Washington to up up to like spend that all the time like like

1103
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:31,720
the 80s or you know a little before like the 60s or something well maybe even a little bit before

1104
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:35,960
that George bring George Washington to like uh let's say the 20s or something they have like he

1105
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:41,160
would have seen he would have seen people doing the twist and had a heart from the sheer impropriety

1106
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:46,920
of it all yes exactly it uh uh like up to that point like they started to have like telegrams

1107
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,720
and telephones I think around then so like the world was starting to be connected no when was the

1108
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:58,600
telephone uh the telephone well depends on how about telephone but like like telegram 1800s

1109
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:02,920
like a second half okay okay so that that happened pretty cool oh well you know what how did how did

1110
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:09,480
they play the game of telephone before the telephone wasn't damn that's a good question no idea um uh

1111
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:15,560
well my point is like humans were relatively stagnant I think until we started like even if

1112
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:19,480
with like guns and stuff again that's still you got to go into a field and march around and shoot

1113
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:25,080
people you know whatever you gotta make your way off base say your point but it makes no sense and

1114
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:30,520
it's wrong once we got like telegrams telephones and now at this point we're at the point where

1115
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:36,440
imagine explaining like the concept of social media that we all like we're we're basically

1116
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:41,800
psychically connected to every other member of the human race on the planet yeah through these

1117
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:47,320
kind of like opt-in systems of like Twitter and you know YouTube and all this stuff it's a totally

1118
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:53,320
that's the biggest mindfuck it'd be like if like you know like 50 100 200 years or whatever

1119
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:58,280
us going to a future where literally everyone lives in VR like all the time and like the earth is just

1120
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:04,440
like a caretaker for our useless corpses that bring our consciousness to the data realm or whatever

1121
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:13,960
uh strikes me similar to that um but yeah I'd be pretty kooky pretty cool man like the thoughts

1122
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:20,680
interesting right I don't know it just it's on my mind constantly thinking about how different we

1123
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:25,480
are from what we were like I don't know programmed to do I mean that's where anyone thinks that like

1124
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:30,040
I don't know like I'm not pooing at it at all like even slightly it's just an interesting thought to

1125
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:34,760
see how far we've come from what we were you know this thing I've been saying of like escaping from

1126
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:41,000
God's plan is is is true in the sense of like we like there's like a certain you know god of like

1127
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,240
nature whatever it's like you get to a certain point and like evolutionarily you're basically

1128
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:49,720
doing the same thing that like your other apes are doing but just at some point when over the tipping

1129
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:55,000
point and we just had like I don't know they say like the agricultural like the ability of humans

1130
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,840
to like settle down and grow food I think was like the first thing that like allowed humans to really

1131
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,560
flourish and like save up stories for when there was famines because like without that you know

1132
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:08,840
most humans would have continually died off when there's like a bad season or whatever uh so you

1133
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:12,840
you know we just we get a little bit ahead you get a little bit up in the game with your stores

1134
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,120
and you're able to breed a little bit more and spread out a little further and then you're just

1135
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:20,760
over the hill your crew and interest on your vast sums you know it's basically capitalism at work

1136
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:25,080
only human capital you got a little bit over the top it just interests it's paying for itself

1137
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:32,360
it's human centered capitalism yang 2020 it makes sense um yeah yeah I don't know it's just cool

1138
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:37,800
it just it's interesting to me that like bringing like Genghis Khan I don't know what year he lived

1139
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:42,520
bringing him to like you know 30 hundreds if I recall correctly sorry when was that when was that

1140
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:49,800
1300s bringing someone like him to like George Washington's day would not be that big a difference

1141
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:55,080
uh but bringing him to our day just uh you know a couple hundred years after that that's a huge

1142
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:59,960
difference and I guess it all shows up in like the the way that like the graph of like technological

1143
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:05,400
advancement is just like it's gone fucking you know parallel wait hold on no George he would be

1144
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,000
shocked and appalled if he went to george what that was like that like the industrial

1145
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,360
revolution that yeah it would have been insane it was well I question like if they had the

1146
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:20,200
fucking cotton gin but they did not have the kind of those are like economic and like they oh okay

1147
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:23,800
they didn't have okay they didn't have the cotton gin but they had like I mean it's just that those

1148
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:29,400
strength me is like economic factors and like well-being of man factors well okay there are

1149
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:34,760
many factors that would shock and appall him it completely different culture completely different

1150
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:40,440
technology completely different almost like like terrain like everything they had they had

1151
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:45,880
factories I mean I guess for some reason not my mind focuses on like the the communication

1152
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:53,160
well I mean in in george washington's day they had no I know I know not in this they did they did

1153
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:59,400
but they are different like mechanized yeah yeah yeah sure well uh things are I mean I think the

1154
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:05,320
I think like a city like like the the concept of the city was just like structured completely

1155
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:11,640
differently well like George Washington's day versus like what they was for for okay hold on I just

1156
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:19,720
want to say that like okay look there's there's many different things as opposed to like Genghis Khan

1157
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:26,680
the Mongol emperor to George Washington in America there are so many like of course Genghis Khan would

1158
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:31,480
be like what's the city and then burn it down I'm kind of think of like the human well no you know

1159
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:37,480
I'm saying that like you know I know that he would know what it is but like the it's not the same

1160
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,360
right he ruled over a lot of cities I'm like he's generally like a nomadic guy he comes from that

1161
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:48,120
background if you just want to see it you know if you just killed George Washington and put Genghis Khan

1162
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:53,800
in charge and like he you know he knew what was going on like I think that like the world had not

1163
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,440
changed so much like his understanding of like men and like okay he'd have to learn about guns

1164
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:03,560
probably but okay you can learn what guns do like I feel like he could adapt but seeing either of

1165
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:10,120
those adapt to like modern technology I think is is a whole nother ball game no completely disagree

1166
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:15,480
I mean completely wrong enough face and retarded well well boomers can't even adapt to today's

1167
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:21,160
yeah there you go they're they're they're they've just figured out facebook just in time to watch

1168
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:28,680
crumble you you underestimate how much has changed just constantly throughout like like I suppose

1169
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:38,280
I'm gonna kind of go with Nate here I think that the well okay it has changed more rapidly

1170
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:43,880
it's accelerated sure okay okay if your point is if like

1171
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:51,960
like like like it's it's changing faster now I definitely agree with that I'm saying well you

1172
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:57,160
know okay I guess I shouldn't say that like the um I just meant your specific example I thought was

1173
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:01,800
off base but you're like your idea that like you know it changed slower that's definitely true I

1174
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:06,840
know yeah that that's that's the main point I don't know whatever let's you know what let's go to

1175
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:13,160
fucking voicemail okay wait wait I feel like I had I feel like I had something else like maybe there

1176
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:20,200
was one of any other of the famous quote unquote events in your life oh fuck off dude yes my events

1177
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:25,720
you don't even know what that meant uh I don't wait did it mean something uh wait what did it mean

1178
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:30,280
well that's open to interpretation wait what did it mean well what did it mean though I mean uh the

1179
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:37,080
the joke that I was making I guess was that like your life what did it mean no has few things that

1180
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:42,360
would be considered legitimate events uh yes uh something like that yeah hold on wait no I got

1181
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:47,480
that I got that I need to retract a point for my own for my own personal well-being because I know one

1182
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:51,160
of those one of you motherfuckers are writing a comic about how Genghis Khan of course you notice

1183
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:57,080
it is yes obviously I know that he fucking you roll over like literally like you know like all

1184
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:01,560
like northern China I know I know he noticed our vast audience of history he's seen a lot of people

1185
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:06,440
in one place I know what he knows what I meant was just that you know comes from a nomadic background

1186
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:10,680
he'd probably be a little bit shocked by like the way the cities had progressed at that time

1187
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:14,840
uh uh based on guys I know well that's what I that's what I said like the the way a city was

1188
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:18,840
structured would just look it would I mean the art it would look different like you know they didn't

1189
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:24,360
have modern you know like building techniques and shit yeah I mean not to mention the the culture

1190
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:29,960
and and stuff and just I got it I am smart please no no no no no no Nate I'm not I'm not cheating on

1191
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:33,560
you at all I'm just I'm just saying for my for my own point I don't want anyone to make fun of me

1192
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:38,360
in the comments that's literally right yeah no no no I gotcha you guys you guys watch that uh you

1193
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,240
guys watch that they're uh Jordan Peterson versus Slavo Gizek I hope I'm saying no of course no I

1194
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:51,640
don't think so who's Slavo Gizek you know I wish I knew more about the guy he is uh he is kind of a

1195
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:58,440
he is kind of a cool Marxist guy but he's also very yeah those are your synonymous dude right

1196
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:03,880
he's he's like he's like a he's like a Marxist psychologist philosopher but he's also very

1197
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:09,400
like anti SJW okay which is okay I think I heard of this guy I don't I have heard of him a lot and

1198
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:15,800
I I kind of want to dig into his stuff more now uh I don't know okay never mind I thought me I kind

1199
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:20,040
of thought maybe you guys would have checked I would have thought that Nate would but it's the

1200
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:28,280
it's the sort of thing I watch uh you know and and it's very like uh Jordan's all like hey here's

1201
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:34,360
why capitalism's good and Marx's and Erdon Marx Gizek is like well here's the problems with it and

1202
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:42,040
you know it's it's uh Gizek's is very just a very like entertaining guy he's he's very he's very

1203
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:50,840
charming as uh Jordan points out that's uh mr. Peterson uh ask doctor doctor question on the

1204
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:58,280
honorable please the the the rya arbald the lord mayor of kekistan you know I kind of I kind of

1205
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:03,560
expecting I kind of went into expecting to be like rude and hardcore against dr. p and being like

1206
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:08,440
yeah fuck you sure and I mean I didn't really agree with him I still didn't really agree with his

1207
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:14,760
opinions but like I didn't like get mad at him during it or anything it was all very fine and

1208
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:19,160
you know reasonable discourse I guess you know I obviously haven't watched this I've watched a

1209
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:24,280
bunch of Peterson stuff over the years uh you know I'm sure some people disagree I mean I hear people

1210
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:30,280
like I don't know I hear things like some people just like call him like a transphobe and I'm like

1211
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:35,400
what I don't think that's an accurate statement I don't think you're assessing the the situation

1212
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,920
oh you know what I forgot because like the original controversy was that he didn't want to be

1213
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,920
like whatever he didn't want to be like forced to use pronouns that he didn't think legitimate or

1214
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:49,800
whatever uh so I again I can follow the logic to get to that conclusion but I don't know uh so I

1215
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,040
get it obviously I'm not one of those peeps who might take a personal issue whether anything

1216
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:59,240
but like he's always strike me as a as a relatively honest actor and I suppose you know if one was like

1217
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:05,560
a hardcore Marxist he is a devout capitalist and you know enjoys making money and profiting off

1218
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:09,880
his ventures so like I could see people being like ah he's you know a fucking fraud just trying to

1219
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:15,240
make money or something but I don't know he seems pretty seems relatively legit to me and I mean

1220
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:24,760
you know I mean I mean I think he's he's he oh man Anthony Fantano made a tweet like today I've

1221
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:32,680
seen some of his I think and it was like you know uh Peterson is a I don't think he called him a

1222
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:39,000
shit yeah but basically he's like he is he he just like he caters to you know he caters to like

1223
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,800
these like guys who just want their own biases regurgitated back at them you know sprinkled

1224
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:50,200
in with like you know a small amount of like you know good advice aren't we all like that though

1225
01:53:50,200 --> 01:54:00,040
and I mean like yeah I think that's probably sure sure uh and uh yeah you know he he loves he loves

1226
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:07,000
he loves capitalism and I'm not as and I'm not its biggest fan um and I mean you know so he's

1227
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,200
so fuck that guy that's that's fair you know when I like I've seen Fantano really shit on

1228
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:18,040
this guy in the past in various times and like look I get it uh he disagrees with him politically

1229
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:24,280
and you know I would suspect that like he kind of gets into like a more personal like finding the

1230
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:28,760
guy to be like fake like if you already don't agree with the guy's ideas the fact that like

1231
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:34,040
he markets himself well that's probably gonna rub you the wrong way like I get it but you know why

1232
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:41,640
would that be I don't I don't know if I I mean it's possible maybe he doesn't really believe the

1233
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:46,120
things that he says and he's just saying them because they make him a ton of money I mean

1234
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:53,160
that's not the craziest thing I've ever heard I don't think I mean I'm not you know I don't think

1235
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:59,240
there's like a you can prove that you know yeah you know and I think a lot of people they they get

1236
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:05,800
kind of in the space of like they they want that to be true so they read into various things like

1237
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:11,400
ways to it and like I can't even say they're wrong they're probably correct it's just I very much like

1238
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:16,680
to be charitable in my interpretations and like like just for example if you're like trans and you

1239
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:21,080
feel attacked by what the guys say I mean I could argue all day that like you shouldn't feel attacked

1240
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:27,240
that's not his point but like you feel how you feel so what can I do you know I mean I mean I think

1241
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:31,960
that probably and like this isn't just about him but about basically anyone like anyone who's like

1242
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:39,000
you know pushing a political position or an ideology or something like if if you say something

1243
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,360
and it makes and and you know people respond to it and you end up making money off it I think

1244
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:53,880
that most people will probably I don't think it's generally you you won't be like sitting there rubbing

1245
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:58,760
your hands to go like ooh I don't really believe this but I'm gonna continue to say it you know

1246
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:03,720
because it makes money what's more likely to happen is you're gonna say like uh I said this

1247
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:09,880
opinion and I had it validated you know by you know people's responses to it and by you know

1248
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:15,560
the the amount of like capital that it generated for me you know and that's that's just gonna like

1249
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:19,720
convince you more and they're like yeah what I said was right you know this I am right you know

1250
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:23,880
and I and you know I have evidence like the evidence that I am right in what I say is mounting

1251
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:29,880
and mounting indeed you know confirmation buys the work etc etc confirmation bias yeah and and you

1252
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:36,520
get uh what's the thing it's uh the um the affirmation the affirmation gang we're like okay I

1253
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,640
think I can glean what that means but yeah you like you you're like a you're like a thought leader

1254
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:46,360
and like everyone you know you got your crew that all it looks to you because like you say the thing

1255
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:50,920
you say the thing that is right and everyone wants you to keep saying the thing that is right so

1256
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:55,000
that they can like stand behind you and be like yeah this guy's an expert and he says the thing

1257
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,840
that's right and I agree with him and holds you up as their champion or whatever and it's like yeah I

1258
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:02,600
gotta keep gotta keep saying this thing that's right because these these guys all tell me that

1259
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:06,760
it's right and I mean of course it's true at any time someone who just fundamentally disagrees

1260
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:10,520
like you know if you've just got like a hardcore Marxist or whatever like someone can come out and

1261
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:15,160
just be like uh you know everything you're saying is wrong like you're like you're just getting swept

1262
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:19,320
up in this like cult of personality and you're just like letting your kind like you're just saying

1263
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:25,400
what you want to believe like again like um uh something like uh I mean just for example like

1264
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:29,400
someone like Ben Shapiro whatever he like straight up doesn't believe in like being trans or whatever

1265
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:33,720
due to religious and whatever like you know you could say all day that like you know this is

1266
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:38,520
his firm belief but somebody on the other side could just say that like um you know he just he

1267
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:41,960
wants to believe this so he's like convincing himself it's true or he doesn't believe that he's

1268
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:47,240
just saying it anyway and at a certain point you just get you're into mind reading and I don't know

1269
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:53,400
I I hate being in the business of mind reading uh like I don't know say say your I don't know I

1270
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:58,200
think I think about this a bunch like say your say your Dr. P right and maybe at some point you're

1271
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:05,400
like you know yeah I would Dr. P I'd wish I was Dr. P P and then I would get a sick uh Dr. Mario

1272
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:12,600
uh you gotta change your name to Dr. Peter Peterson maybe Dr. P P uh classic patreon.com

1273
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:20,120
slash bansane for quality jokes of that caliber uh the uh maybe at some point you're like you know

1274
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:27,560
I'm a guy I'm successful I'm an academic I think capitalism is pretty good maybe there's something

1275
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:32,840
maybe the communists have some good ideas but generally you know I think I like capitalism

1276
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,520
and then you know you say all this stuff and people respond to it and you're like and you're

1277
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:40,280
like you know I think you should clean your room and stand up straight and people respond to that

1278
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:44,200
and you're like wow the stuff you said changed my life and then you write your book and it's a best

1279
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:48,440
seller and then like the letters come flooding in and you're like the stuff you said changed my life

1280
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,760
and I mean you know it doesn't matter how many like maybe there's people that disagree with you

1281
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:56,760
just as much but you're hearing I mean you're hearing the haters but in your mind you gotta

1282
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:59,720
dismiss like well those are just the haters and then you're getting all this positive

1283
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:03,880
information people like the stuff you said changed my life it means everything to me you're a genius

1284
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:11,960
and you're like well I mean of course you know you're gonna you like no like forget about Dr. P

1285
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:16,120
if you're anyone like if this happens to you like this is you're of course you're gonna continue

1286
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:19,400
to do what you're doing because you're getting this kind of a response from it that's definitely

1287
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:25,320
true and and I just say that that's that's possible however it certainly remains a possibility as well

1288
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:30,520
that despite all those things on you know undoubtedly happening he remains you know intellectually

1289
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:35,560
curious and attempts to examine his own ideas and simply believes that he still is on the

1290
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:39,640
right track and that this makes the most sense despite the ideas he's coming up against I mean

1291
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:43,800
that's the most charitable way to interpret it yeah maybe I don't know yeah so I mean everybody

1292
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:48,840
just has to judge for that whatever that's like to anybody um and I don't know but generally like

1293
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:52,840
when I when it comes to listening to people like this I like to listen to and I admit it like you

1294
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:57,560
know I was listening to destiny the other day the thing I don't like about destiny is just how mean

1295
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:03,000
he is I don't like how mean he is and it makes me not want to listen to him because it's unpleasant

1296
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,080
and maybe like I'm a pussy because I can't take the heat yeah but yeah definitely yeah I mean that's

1297
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:15,960
for sure that's for sure but it's just I I'd rather go listen to you know uh uh some fucking like

1298
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:22,440
Joe Rogan um and I don't know like anybody else anybody's on his fucking show just because like

1299
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:26,360
they're respectful and nice and you know they'll they'll challenge each other and I can think

1300
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:31,240
for my fucking self about who's right and wrong and I don't even think I'm as smart as destiny

1301
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:34,520
especially when it comes to like a debate format or whatever it's like I'm not even saying he's

1302
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:41,640
right or wrong but like I definitely am attracted to positivity so I like steel manning I like like

1303
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:47,320
attacking your opponent's ideas at their best at their strongest and I try to do it as well myself

1304
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:52,280
so I don't know I don't know what I'm getting into I'm just saying that steel manning yeah yes it's

1305
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:58,360
good what a what a it's nice that's funny uh okay well I don't know uh would you recommend

1306
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:03,720
that uh the the Peterson and Zizek debate thing or whatever yeah I would say so especially like

1307
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:09,080
I didn't know much about Zizek I mean I kind of want to hear like a nice Marxist who I can

1308
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:12,920
take seriously and you know listen to his ideas and see if I'm wrong in some ways I think you I

1309
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:19,000
think you would I think you would appreciate him because like I I don't know much about him I've

1310
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,520
heard about him a lot but I've never looked into him and like seeing him in this debate I was like

1311
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:27,000
you know I should maybe like look into more about this guy because I don't know he seems

1312
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:32,360
interesting and I don't know I think you would find him you know reasonable if nothing else yeah okay

1313
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:38,360
I love politics that okay that wasn't really political that was that was as light as it could be

1314
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:46,120
okay all right well is that p is that p you know bro oh yep there it is uh well

1315
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:53,880
well shall we go let's go to the voicemail ladies and gentlemen uh let's let's hop on over here um

1316
02:01:54,760 --> 02:02:01,160
okay now now uh public service announcement we are getting an unforced review but by the way

1317
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:04,760
maybe we should say that hippo is gone for technical difficulties in case you've been

1318
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:08,600
wondering where that's true he had connections issues and they unfortunately his connect his

1319
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:12,920
connection died a long time ago it was in and out for a while and now it seems like it's just dead

1320
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:18,680
so that's why he's gone indeed indeed uh so have no fears ladies and gentlemen um excuse me okay so

1321
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:24,440
public service announcement here it is uh a bunch of people are just leaving like a lot of messages

1322
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,920
I don't know like like fat fuck faggot who left a whole slew I messaged my favorite like I'm gonna

1323
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:36,760
play some because they're good what what happened he's he's spider he's he people are training his

1324
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:44,200
spider but for fucking voicemails now why what did spider do the comments a thousand times oh

1325
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:49,960
you meant you mentioned him in the yeah last episode that he'll just leave like four comments

1326
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:54,600
right that's right on a video which is fine I don't know it's not I don't see the problem

1327
02:02:56,040 --> 02:03:00,520
what I mean the right or wrong I basically just I mean just because I'm busy I don't check really

1328
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:07,240
the comment sections of like any videos of mine I check all the comments most most weeks most

1329
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:12,120
weeks I will read through uh the comments I would if I just had the time I find it pleasant and I

1330
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:15,880
enjoy you know and I do look a little bit I do look when like the episode first comes out I'll

1331
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:19,960
just be curious to see what people are saying so you know I don't know if this is clear I don't

1332
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:26,360
ever said this but like like if you're wondering I always read the comments in case you aren't

1333
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:34,200
aware like I read everything I might not always respond but I I generally do um there I just

1334
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:39,160
so I mean we're watching for episodes that I'm on obviously I definitely want to hear if people

1335
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:42,840
had to say anything about the shit I said yeah that's a little good all right see there you

1336
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:48,200
I gotta find my enemies indeed okay I gotta keep so here's the end of my public service

1337
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:54,840
announcement it's just so people like just you can leave a bunch but you're just making my life

1338
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:59,400
more difficult so like if some people are spamming I might just start skipping you I'll tell you that

1339
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:05,160
that was my temptation like when I see like like six or seven messages from the same person I'm just

1340
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:10,680
like is this really did this person have like a mission this episode and they're here like to

1341
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:15,560
make sure I hear their quality thing they've thought of or they just spamming in the hopes

1342
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:19,800
that something will be good and maybe something's good so give it to me straight how many how many

1343
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:24,440
voicemails I mean it's just like 12 I think no 11 we have 11 so nothing nothing crazy but

1344
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:29,640
I did have to cut through a bunch so so people try to you know work on it work out ladies and

1345
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:34,600
gentlemen anything you've got to say you can say in what is it like a minute and a half is the limit

1346
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:39,080
for and I anything you've got to say you can say it you know some people actually some person left

1347
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:44,120
a message I forget who it was I didn't grab it but someone said like hey here's the real life hack

1348
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:51,320
to be on a pcp episode in the voicemail just leave like a million messages and you know one of them

1349
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:58,040
will probably be good honestly if I were you Nate I probably I would have been tempted to just not

1350
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:02,920
look at like the messages that were posted like like six messages but you know that you know I'm

1351
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:06,760
just saying I'm letting people know I might do maybe the first one so far maybe the so far I

1352
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:10,760
haven't missed a single single voicemail I've listened to all of them I've heard all of the

1353
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:17,640
depravity so okay anyway that out of the way uh let's hear what fat fuck faggot has to say okay go

1354
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:19,880

1357
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:54,200
running about it I think I think you don't need a voice modulator to ask a bullshit lame question

1358
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:59,480
this is people are looking for axe munchy I mean this fat fuck faggot left like eight messages so

1359
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:04,440
you know yeah what's the point of a voice modulator like there's no gimmie to make it more interesting

1360
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:09,880
for us I guess you weren't like oh fat fuck I just destroyed a fucking 10 pound chicken what's

1363
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:26,520
wow you're out of the league fair out of the game harsh but fair but I agree emulators are great

1369
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:56,200

1370
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:02,440
for a while uh I mean maybe it's it did not dawn I mean oh like emu later yeah emu maybe it's actually

1371
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:08,360
pronounced emu paradise and we've all been saying it wrong I don't I don't know well it doesn't look

control perhaps you're steam you're the steam of the pcb all right I just said that but yeah

1382
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:15,000
could this be a conspiracy to get someone else to do the voicemails so I just don't have to do them

1383
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:20,280
for no additional pay uh you know that's that's up only the stars know only the stars know the

1390
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:39,880
want so that's what they got oh god I shouldn't have said all you have to do is have a voice

1391
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:44,520
module later on you'll get on the show because yeah exactly like this and like the instrument

1392
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:49,720
thing is happening yeah they're figuring out like they're just like with the steam library

taking any and all comers so too does the pcp voicemail section uh and our curation staff

1394
02:09:55,800 --> 02:10:00,840

1400
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:32,040
starting up new like new fake companies and the genius behind it all it's got to be the bloody

1404
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:55,960
okay go all right pcp I've got a real question for you so I've been dating this girl for a few

1405
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:01,640
months and she's got a really interesting job now she uses a website called seeking arrangements

1406
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:08,520
and meets with men for money now she doesn't have sex with these men she just goes out in a public

1407
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:15,960
place has dinner maybe sees a movie whatever a casual date and she gets paid thousands of

1408
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:22,760
dollars for this I'm talking four thousand dollars a month just for meeting with men my question to

1409
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:32,120
you is would you be comfortable with your eso doing this for money right okay uh any any thoughts

1410
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:37,640
would I be comfortable no do I think it's like abhorrent or like morally objective not really

1411
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:49,320
I okay well this is interesting and I'm very confused yeah uh what is this this is a real thing

1412
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:55,320
this is a real thing I'm on I'm on seeking dot com right now and I'm signing up and I'm gonna be and

1413
02:11:55,320 --> 02:12:00,600
I'm gonna be a yeah see this is this is the real tester we we're signing up for a date with your

1414
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:05,320
wife so uh are you comfortable with that are you comfortable with that does that sound good

1415
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:10,040
yeah uh this is the real test you're absolutely right well uh you know people are lonely Ben

1416
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:13,880
people are lonely they want to hang out with women even if it doesn't mean that okay listen

1417
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:17,320
this this is something don't really understand because like people will say that you just want to

1418
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:22,680
hang out with women for you know like like uh you know like you know for fun you know people

1419
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:28,440
will say that but like you have to be eaten up inside like this obviously like like it plays into

1420
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:31,960
like a sex thing right where it's like you know obviously if they just want to have sex they would

1421
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:36,200
order a prostitute but you know some people just want to hang out with people and just you know

1422
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:40,760
just go on a date with them and feel that like like you know a fake romantic connection there they

1423
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:45,720
want to have that experience right but like you know I don't believe it's purely like a platonic

1424
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:50,360
or just a romantic thing like surely they must be like eaten up inside like oh maybe if I play the

1425
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:55,080
long game maybe they she'll actually fall in love with me and I'll be able to have sex or yeah maybe

travel vacation okay no hold on so you is this like a no sex website or it depends on what you

1433
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:43,240
want I think there's the way that this is it just like the way that this girl does it I'd imagine

1434
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:51,560
so I'd imagine so and I assume she's up front but you know so so they're oh god so these guys are

1435
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:57,880
paying to go to date with a girl to like just go eat dinner with them they said go to a movie or

1436
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:06,920
something or you know something like that oh boy I mean the answer to the answer to this question

1437
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:12,600
for me would I be comfortable with it could not be simpler the answer is no uh not in a million

1438
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:20,040
years would I be in a situation such as this uh but I mean you know I don't know yeah like well

1439
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:24,440
do I sit here in judgment I mean whatever do what you gotta do to get by you know it's fine

1440
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:29,320
everybody's I I want to like twist language a little bit way because I feel like the word

1441
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:34,600
cuck needs to be defined here a little bit okay because cuck you know like like literally in the

1442
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:39,160
dictionary is like you know it's like a sexual thing you like it I think the spectrum for sure

1443
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:45,880
for sure I think the way that I like you're only a cuck in the way that we mean being a cuck if

1444
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:50,280
you don't like it that could mean as in it's a surprise you as a girlfriend shielding you or is

1445
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,160
just as in like no no way or or or that she wants to be in an open relationship but you don't want

1446
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:59,640
to you're just like um yeah you know I guess we could do that um I guess we could be in a relationship

1447
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:06,680
that's fine yeah you're like here's what I think on honestly I think I think it depends on how much

1448
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:11,400
you trust her right like I think if you really trust her that like she's not doing anything

1449
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:17,160
untoward with any of these guys and it's all completely above the belt platonic then I think

1450
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:21,960
yeah I probably would be okay with it it's just that that is like that just like you're always

1451
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:26,680
gonna wonder right you're always gonna be kind of well that's what I mean if you're like really

1452
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:33,480
if you really know her and you really if you think you can really trust that it's not there's

1453
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:37,400
nothing else going on then I think it is I get that Ben I mean it's a little crazy thing to think

1454
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:42,360
I think but the thing is like maybe you trust the girl but how much you trust the guys and I'm not

1455
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:47,640
saying like they're gonna like rape or anything I'm just saying like are all their intentions like

1456
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:53,160
totally pure like is she never gonna get any kind of a little bit going beyond my my answer to that

1457
02:15:53,160 --> 02:16:00,120
is like I mean imagine you know imagine if you will dating a girl you know hard difficult I know

1458
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:05,720
but like stretch stretch your mind out a little bit um you're dating I mean she's gonna have friends

1459
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:11,080
she's gonna have her own friends and some of them you know could very well be guys and like

1460
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:17,080
you know that like thinking about it yeah probably at least some of those guys are like

1461
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:20,840
you know well you know they're not gonna do anything but like maybe if you guys broke up

1462
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:26,040
then maybe they try maybe you know or maybe yeah that's for real so like so like how is how is this

1463
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:29,720
any different I'll tell you how like you're not you're like you're not you're not gonna say oh you

1464
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:33,880
can't hang out with your guy friends because what if they like you what if they'll try I mean well

1465
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:38,760
first of all that kind of depends on the situation again like that's when you mean it depends on

1466
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:45,560
the situation I would never like force anyone to do anything they want however I would absolutely

1467
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:49,960
set ultimatums of look I'm comfortable with XYZ if you don't want it then we'll just break up that's

1468
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:56,200
all I mean again it depends what those things are hold on like what's XYZ I mean I don't know dude

1469
02:16:56,200 --> 02:17:01,400
like if she had like a really like okay I like I knew someone okay I mean maybe there was like a

1470
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:06,680
particular guy who like creeped you out for some specific reason this is this is just easy follow me

1471
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:12,440
from this like I know a person who knows someone or something like I heard of a tale that like uh

1472
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:16,120
that this is not the other gender side of it that there was like a girl who was dating a guy

1473
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:22,520
and the thing was this guy had like a long time best friend who was female and they would do such

1474
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:27,960
things as sleep in the same bed now they both say nothing ever happened but it's like well that's a

1475
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:34,280
little odd uh that's kind of strange and like it like you know if you broke up with them do you

1476
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:39,400
think that nothing would happen uh probably not probably some moves would be made um and and

1477
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:44,840
incidentally just in this particular situation the girl the the friend who is a girl in question

1478
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:51,000
like once spoke to the girlfriend of the guy and said like is this guy making you guys uncomfortable

1479
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,760
and the guy was like oh no this is totally fine like it's totally full time don't worry about it

1480
02:17:54,760 --> 02:18:00,680
but even the girl in the friendship was detecting some vibes of probably like you know some kind of

1481
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:06,920
beta-orbidiness around her despite being sure okay well like yeah you say like I would judge it

1482
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:11,640
you know I don't want you sleeping in the same bed as this person well that's all I mean I would

1483
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:17,240
judge on the specifics that's that's all it is yeah okay okay makes makes sense well that's what

1484
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:23,880
I'm saying is like if you're like I don't know it just comes down to trust I guess is is the

1485
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:29,720
is my final word on the subject and that's maybe all there is maybe I'm a caveman stuck in the past

1486
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:37,480
but I would absolutely say that like cuckoldry is 100 a spectrum and to me to me it's not so much

1487
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:43,800
about what the person wants it's about like kind of the value signified by it like it just strikes

1488
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:49,640
me as like if you're a man who is dating a woman who let's just say is a porn star for example

1489
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:55,000
like I'm sure there's a pride that can be gained from that of a certain kind but on the other hand

1490
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,560
she's literally having sex with other men like maybe you're also having sex with other people

1491
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:05,800
but to me like to me this signifies kind of like a weak relationship like a weak bond and you know

1492
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:11,960
what maybe that's presentive uh it is presentive and I don't care I stand by it I think I think

1493
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:19,320
I mean you know maybe all right you're dating a porn star right she's having sex with other guys

1494
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:25,160
because that's your job maybe you're having sex with other women or whatever sure but maybe just

1495
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:31,640
you know maybe the sex is not like what your relationship is about look I mean I'm sure that

1496
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:36,200
there's maybe maybe you're both you're both doing that under other circumstances and like your

1497
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:41,320
relationship is founded on other there's there can be a massive difference between sex for porn

1498
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:46,280
as opposed to like you know make it look call me a dinosaur and maybe I'm just wrong it could be

1499
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:52,520
proved wrong but I believe that like sexual intimacy is like important to a relationship and isn't

1500
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:58,680
really something to be treated trivially uh so like you know like two people dating each other uh if

1501
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:03,320
they're like both fucking other people but they say they love each other like okay I believe them

1502
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:09,320
it's just like it would that be as strong a bond if they didn't fuck other people I suspect no but

1503
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:16,680
again I'm no fucking expert here I'm just saying you I mean uh you know it's a I think it's

1504
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:21,560
up to the individual and I'm gonna I think it could be I think I think it could be just as I think

1505
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:26,120
it could be just as strong or opinion on someone else's relationship look people can do whatever

1506
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:32,760
they want obviously I'm just saying this is where my mind goes all right I think it could be fine um

1507
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:41,080
but and to me see it's a it's a very hot I I hate to repeat myself uh just I just

1508
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:47,640
like you like this situation I would be okay with it if I trusted that there was that it was all

1509
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:54,520
totally platonic and that in in the situation which is really fucking weird that is an extremely

1510
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:59,080
high threshold of trust sure that would have to be hit because this whole situation is just so

1511
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:06,440
fucking sketchy right um my my thing is again it's only a cuck if you're not okay with it like

1512
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:11,880
if you're dating a porn star I would say that's you're not a cuck because you know like if you're

1513
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:16,280
if you're if you're like if it's the boundaries are clear you have clearly ordained it and you

1514
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:20,360
have made peace with it internally then like no you're just comfortable with something that other

1515
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:26,040
people wouldn't be and I don't think that's a cuck thing yeah I think well yeah if you if you have

1516
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:31,080
no qualms about this you aren't a cuck well okay but the question is should he have

1517
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:36,040
quality here's the question here's the question that comes to my mind wouldn't it be great

1518
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:41,800
for this man like would this person in any way prefer a situation where everything's the same

1519
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:47,720
it's just the girl has a different job earns the same and isn't you know selling her body

1520
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:52,360
effectively you know not in a sexual way she's not selling her she's not selling her attention

1521
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:57,720
if it's okay let's say she is because my answer would be the same and and that's like that you

1522
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:02,680
know you sure he could prefer it but if he doesn't have a problem with it then it's fun but see that

1523
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:08,760
right there that preference is the spectrum of cuckledry at work in my opinion my my read on this

1524
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:16,200
situation and this guy and I could be wrong but what I what I infer from it and I guess is that

1525
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:23,080
the problem is that maybe this is all not platonic right and that is the source of the

1526
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:27,560
yeah consternation he wouldn't be asking this if he didn't have doubts and I think the fact that

1527
02:22:27,560 --> 02:22:34,520
you do you might have doubts in any way is that it's not okay yeah that that yes the fact that

1528
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:39,400
you're even asking this question I mean I mean look we can speculate all day about like trust

1529
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:44,920
levels I'd be out of there in a fucking second dude I'd drop it like a hot potato and be gone

1530
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:50,120
I don't I don't know like just imagine a situation where you find a girl who doesn't do this there's

1531
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:55,320
plenty of them let me let me let me just let me just say my piece imagine like you know maybe you're

1532
02:22:55,320 --> 02:23:00,680
like maybe you've been friends maybe you've known this girl for like years and maybe maybe you guys

1533
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:05,160
are like soulmates maybe you guys tell each other everything you're like super close she just and

1534
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:09,720
then you know she starts doing this because it makes good money and she's totally open up front

1535
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:13,320
with you about it and she's like none of this is all platonic I'm not comfortable with doing

1536
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:17,720
anything beyond that it's just that it makes good money and like you know it's not hard work so I'm

1537
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:22,200
gonna do it and maybe she does it and maybe like you talk about maybe she tells you funny stories

1538
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:26,600
of these weird guys and you laugh about it together or something and like there's no any there's no

1539
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:31,640
and you have no doubts at all that everything she's telling you is the unadulterated truth

1540
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:38,360
I don't know that seems fine my only response to that is that uh uh uh oneitis is the deadliest

1541
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:44,120
virus known to man that's all I've got to say about that what just move on get another bitch uh no

1542
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:50,840
problem wait what the what the I'm just okay well then let me only semi move on and just

1543
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:55,720
can we talk can we talk about this service because I'm still really confused I mean you just look

1544
02:23:55,720 --> 02:24:00,520
maybe I should I mean it's you could think of it like craigslist only for semi sexual acts too full

1545
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:04,840
on sexual acts I think you just go there you like find the listings and you're like oh I want to do

1546
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:10,360
this and then you message him and I think you just talk about and stuff is it just is it just

1547
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:15,800
rich guys wanting to feel us mostly I may not rich guys but people also sugar babies who want to

1548
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:24,600
find a rich guy to you know pay their bills it as I mean that makes sense right well I yeah you're

1549
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:27,880
right that's probably look you know what I think seeing the range is a little more broad I'm sure

1550
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:31,640
that there's probably just people who just like want friends and they just go on there like I'm

1551
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:35,960
not I'm not casting judgment on the website frankly I don't give a shit it's you know friends did you

1552
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:40,920
say they go on here to find me yes I think so like it's a huge spectrum of like that's that's not

1553
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:45,640
how they that's not how they've branded maybe I'm not not friends in the way you know more than we

1554
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:50,680
do Ben at this point you've gone to the website I have seen the homepage so I know I'm pretty much

1555
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:55,160
an expert you know what Ben please everyone in the show notes there's gonna be a link to this dude's

1556
02:24:55,160 --> 02:25:01,000
wife please utilize her services she's gonna be really she needs it she needs it test test

1557
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:07,240
and don't be afraid to get a little rough with her we I hear that she's down for that so okay

1558
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:14,600
I will just say that on the spectrum of cuckoldry I would say that normal committed relationship

1559
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:22,760
zero cuckoldry things like your your girl being like a sexualized snapchat model is another thing

1560
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:28,920
doing the kind of like patreon ludes as so famously are done it's absolutely on the spectrum

1561
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:33,320
then there's like porn stars in there somewhere I'd say and then there's full on getting cupped

1562
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:37,720
like down at the deep end that that's a big jump down to that but we're all we're all on the spectrum

1563
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:43,320
we're all on the spectrum and I'm and I'm just saying if you got you if you got what you're

1564
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:50,520
comfortable with and you are fully convinced that those boundaries are not being crossed then

1565
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:57,240
what's the problem yeah I was Ben I was Ben but again like don't be afraid to trust your instincts

1566
02:25:57,240 --> 02:26:01,720
if you feel uncomfortable I'd say that's very normal yeah and and I mean and I mean whatever

1567
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:06,920
and and like set whatever boundaries you want yeah right like I'm not saying like like if your

1568
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:12,040
boundaries are you know that you're not comfortable with the dates at all even if they are supposedly

1569
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:15,960
platonic when it comes when it comes to or if your boundaries are farther than that that's fine

1570
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:20,200
I mean sure if you're comfortable with that yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever they are you know I think

1571
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:26,040
our culture likes to push inclusivity in some of this stuff when it might feel wrong for you

1572
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:31,480
so like I don't know like hey man everybody's in a polyamorous relationship don't let that you know

1573
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:37,640
don't let that I mean no there's nothing that I would not judge or think there was anything wrong

1574
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:42,600
with not being okay with this yeah right I mean just as it's okay to feel okay about it yeah so it

1575
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:47,960
is on the contrary as well so and it because it's you man it's you so uh do whatever you want do

1576
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:52,600
whatever you want okay well that was that was an interesting question yeah there's a lot to unpack

1577
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:57,800
there um that was a good that was a good question it didn't have a voice modulator and if only

1578
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:03,320
when someone was looking out for the quality of these questions if only if only he had ended the

1579
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:09,480
question with a piano yeah then he really would have a reclinch unfortunately he's being deleted

1597
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:22,600
my homepage my go-to destination for all things entertainment on the internet my my hub my hub

1598
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:29,320
for con for indie content yeah my hit my my hub for underfunded indie content and let's let's keep it

1599
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:36,520
that way ladies and gentlemen all right guys guys tax guys taxes were fucking brutal are you are you

1600
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:43,720
gonna get a refund though oh no really you're not like under the threshold or whatever well here

1601
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:49,160
i don't i don't know how it works exactly here here's the thing that all my income all of my income

1602
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:56,120
was um what what do you call it self-employment so with self-employment income so i okay my expenses

1603
02:29:56,120 --> 02:30:02,280
brought me well under the uh the taxable income like level but that doesn't matter because with

1604
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:08,040
self-employment income all your income is taxable with self-employment with a self-employment tax

1605
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:12,120
even if you are under the threshold that can't even if you're under the threshold if it's

1606
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:18,280
self-employment tax you still get tax that doesn't mean that's crazy it's like oh like the self-employment

1607
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:26,040
tax is like applied after the the deductions you're made and like it doesn't matter if you if you

1608
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:32,120
you you get you get taxed on like all of your income including the stuff that is under the like

1609
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:38,360
deduction oh you know the like the via the generalized deduction yeah yeah that like 1400 or

1610
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:44,600
whatever the fuck it is it is 12 is 1200 in in my state anyway yeah yeah yeah so like my my overall

1611
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:51,080
income minus expenses was well under that threshold but it because it wasn't zero it all got taxed

1612
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:56,840
under the stuff it was fucking well okay i don't i don't get it it's like it's like 15 fucking percent

1613
02:30:56,840 --> 02:31:03,640
i thought it was more i mean i remember looking up like i put away 25 of all my income specifically

1614
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:09,000
or all my all my online because of my my job like already gets taxed uh i put it i just put it away

1615
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,840
for tax paying so i'm i'm happy if i pay extra or if i put away too much fantastic couldn't be

1616
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:20,520
happier that's just extra money i'll save i mean i do i save most of my money like it's not like i

1617
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:26,040
had spent it all and i had nothing you didn't pull a digi yeah i like yeah like i yeah i could pay it

1618
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:34,440
but boy did it hurt um so yeah that's me out i didn't i did not real i did not realize that

1619
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:37,800
i did not realize it worked that way i thought oh i'm gonna be under the threshold i'm gonna be

1620
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:45,880
fine i probably won't have anything wrong wrong last year okay last year because i didn't

1621
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:52,120
technically get yeah i made less overall and also the um the kickstarter like i did not get

1622
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:58,920
the kickstarter payout until january so that was not so i did i did pay a little last year but it was

1623
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:05,960
it was a lot less um i mean you think that that kickstarter income like that should all get eaten

1624
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:10,280
up because like it's all goes to expenses and maybe there's some leftover as like income but like

1625
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:15,560
you know ideally you'd think that it works that way but not not all of it yeah i mean not not all

1626
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:21,000
of it and anything that wasn't um anything that wasn't eaten up with expenses i mean just a similar

1627
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:26,200
example like the radcon three like that money came in like this year and like that was income in my

1628
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:31,240
name so i put that on my taxes and stuff but like all the money got distributed to you guys and got

1629
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:35,560
eaten up with stuff so like none of us made a profit at all which you know was fine but like so

1630
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,280
theoretically like you'd think i wouldn't get taxed on that uh and i hope that's how it works out but

1631
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:46,760
i guess we'll see if if it's if it's all if it all goes to expenses then it all gets deducted from

1632
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:52,360
your taxable income i think is at least how it's i'd imagine so i mean i think so okay anyway all

1633
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:59,640
right let's move on uh uh uh uh uh okay message from racism the only race i care about is nascar

1634
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:06,360
okay go okay okay think about this nascar like the cars they they turn left i think that's the

1635
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:11,640
direction they go because it's like a circle and they just go fucking left every time and left is

1636
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:18,520
politics and uh nascar is propaganda thanks ted talk that that was my ted talk fuck you

1637
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:26,360

1638
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:34,200
in eva louis benz left like nascar you guys yeah but we got it we got it you know nascar is doing

1639
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:39,320
god's work shifting that over to window we got to shift it left boys uh hashtag turn it's only it's

1644
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:23,400
incredible once you uh had your mic on i mean we weren't hearing you were performing that live

1645
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:27,000
from antarctica you're pretty far from the mic when i start to play i mean if you're holding

like your guitar like below your mic or something i could see why it's like far or something but i

1647
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:35,320
just i just cranked my head yeah i had to do that too your voices exploded my eardrums when you

1648
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:39,080
started talking it but it was worth it for that american munchie did you coin that phrase that

1649
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:44,840
term american ooze was that you sounds like something i would say no idea no okay all right i i think

02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:11,240
getting like legit i started getting dizzy because it's like just the caffeine

1655
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:18,440
yeah yeah well there might be other stuff but mostly it's just okay okay uh all right next one

1656
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:23,800
this is from voicemail anon i think there's like a public service announcement one okay go all right

1657
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:33,800
so every episode you play the voicemails people send in and some of them are really great like

1658
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:40,280
the them snakes skates voicemails yeah for example yeah them snakes i would like to listen to them again

1659
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:51,480
if i could find them but i can't find them and i i know they exist on some uh fucking sound cloud

1660
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:59,160
but i can't find this fucking sound cloud and i i know it exists because i've seen it before

1661
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:06,600
like some a long time ago but i can't find it now i've gone through my google history and

1662
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:15,240
everything all right so my question to you okay where's the voicemails guys hashtag where's the

1663
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:22,440
voicemails yes good okay good there is only unlike the question of where's the podcast this

1664
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:27,400
question actually has an answer i believe it does okay so i look this up ahead of time so it's sound

1665
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:34,520
cloud dot com slash the dash pro dash crastonators those aren't underscores those are dashes and also

1666
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:39,800
it'll be in the show notes although i thought it was in the fucking is it not in the general links

1667
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:43,880
i guess i guess it must not be uh okay it's going to be in the show notes soundcloud.com

1668
02:36:43,880 --> 02:36:49,560
forward slash the dash pro dash crastonators that's the soundcloud but i also brought this up because

1669
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:55,320
there's there's there's a thing going on um the soundcloud is full and so i'm being forced to week

1670
02:36:55,320 --> 02:37:03,000
by week delete old weeks voicemails to make room like we could pay for like a pro account and keep

1671
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:09,320
them or something but like this one's free and that's pretty great so i'm i'm all about that uh

1672
02:37:09,320 --> 02:37:13,320
so we are losing history the voicemails are in the show they are the voicemails are they're all

1673
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:17,400
embedded so like there's not much being lost so like i thought i don't i don't see i don't see

1674
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:21,160
preservation as a problem okay i'm glad i'm glad to hear you say that because i was i was wondering

02:44:53,560 --> 02:45:02,840
who would take advantage of that kind of bitch i believe and he says and also she looks retarded

1747
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:10,280
okay i believe that's what would said um well it takes another waiting we're waiting for your

1748
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:16,200
answer wait what was the question again like would i no no no is she retarded is she retarded

1749
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:22,040
simply post so so what uh you know i mean i really think retardation is a spectrum and is first of

1750
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:27,240
all yeah second of all it's in the eye of the beholder uh it's a social construct uh these

1751
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:31,480
things can't be defined by modern day language uh you gotta understand the context there's the

1752
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:35,640
there's an odd spectrum of retardation spectrum the cut the cut yeah you gotta take all these

1753
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:40,280
factors seriously okay we want a steel man here so so let's take let's take his argument and

1754
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:46,760
struggle okay good so so so here is what he's pausing she he's asking you if your girlfriend

1755
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:51,160
is retarded right here is the evidence you look like the kind of nigger that would take advantage

1756
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:56,840
of that kind of bitch and secondly she looks retarded okay well okay so let's and let's

1757
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:02,120
analyze both of these arguments you look like the kind of nigger that would take advantage of that

1758
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:07,160
kind of bitch that's right do we think this is accurate because i okay well let's okay aesthetically

1759
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:12,840
like visually definitely 100 yeah definitely a lot of goodwill from this man so i'm i'm inclined to

1760
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:19,240
to you know take give him a lot of leverage in this debate in this yeah you know so that

1761
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:25,240
definitely checks out definitely think i mean you know my my my my answer my answer i am that kind

1762
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:30,520
of nigger that's all i can say that's that's really all there is to say uh and and secondly uh she

1763
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:35,400
looks retarded yeah i mean it's guilty is charged ladies and gentlemen i mean there's no there's no

1764
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:41,160
getting away from that one uh check out both of those i mean i think we just have to conclude

1765
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:44,920
i mean after presenting his argument as best we could i think he's just he's got a point here i

1766
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:51,800
think he's just unequivocally correct and that's all there is to say one more time i beg you one

1767
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:54,760
one more you know what all right let's hear this one more time for the road ladies and gentlemen
