1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators. As I move my microphone and I move my mouse,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I realize that the Who Are These Podcast guy was absolutely right. My mouse is right next to my microphone.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I basically do have my mic right directly on my mouse, so recording the loud sounds of my mouse clicking.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Honestly, it's not even exaggeration. That guy really had me pegged.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I guess I don't hear it because Discord has a default noise gate for little things like that.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But no, it's like inches away from my microphone, so I'm sure it is audible.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's up? Once again, a week has passed.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh my god.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What the fuck? Nothing even happened.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, I had a thing that happened, but it's not the story of an adventure, but it's hard to tell without it being just me reciting a list of things that happened.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I went to Canterbury and it was nice. It was a nice day out.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's there to do in Canterbury?

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Nothing much. It's an old sort of medieval English town. There's like bricks, there's like old walls from castles occasionally just strewn around.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And it's like, yeah, it's nice. We found a cool museum there and they had bagpuss in it.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, right, bagpuss, right.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And the clangers and noggin the nog and Ivor the engine and Rupert Bear.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
These can't be real. They're so real.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're making at least some of these up.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no, I actually remembered them all. There was one or two I hadn't ever seen before.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And then there was Basil Brush, the fucks. I didn't know Basil Brush.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Who could forget Basil Brush?

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Who could forget? Ha, ha, ha, ha, boom, boom, the classic catchphrase of Basil Brush.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is that true? I don't know.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, boom, boom, like it's so silly and obnoxious.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But I remember watching it like a, I don't know if it was late 90s or 2000s or whatever.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They had like a Basil Brush came back for a TV show and that's where I knew about him.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Like a revival?

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, because I had no idea that he was like in the, in the olden times, in the 60s,

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
when he was first invented as a little cartoon fucks.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I asked you about...

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Anybody remember Basil Brush?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait, so Basil Brush...

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, okay, so Bagpuss was like a show and these were all characters in the show, right?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As we were talking about.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Bagpuss, well, these, this was all in one room in the museum, which was like this particular artist,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
puppeteer, craftsman, animator, stop motion guy.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And these are all shows that he worked on or created.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So Bagpuss was one, Basil Brush was another,

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nog in the Nog, which was, I think, a Viking.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it was like two dimensional, like South Park, but not like South Park.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Paper cutouts, but with like hinges on their arms and legs and they would walk.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's like, you know how the old Norman tapestries that would depict medieval people?

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They sort of have a weird...

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
From the side, from the side view, because they didn't know how to draw a person in three quarters view.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, so they, it was like a show based on that sort of way of doing things.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, cool.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They've got all the, like the original puppets, the original little paper people.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They got everything.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And I was like, we had no idea any of that was there.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We were just like, oh, that's a cool building.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go inside.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And we saw it.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That reminds me of, do you know a YouTube channel called Atrocity Guide?

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Nope.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Atrocity Guide is a pretty cool channel.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They have a bunch of videos that are about weird, just kind of about weird things.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like there's one about, I hope I remember the name.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's called The Throne of Fred Hampton.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, you've probably seen the Down the Rabbit Hole about Henry Darger and Realms of the Unreal.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, I have not watched Down the Rabbit Hole before.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I see them, but I'm like, eh, whatever.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's my favorite Down the Rabbit Hole, Henry Darger and The Realms of the Unreal.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's about a guy who worked as a janitor his whole life, but his whole life he spent

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
cutting out magazine clippings and tracing over them to create this huge volume of illustrated stories

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
about these, I think it's like seven twin, seven sisters who were like princesses of this magical, like, other world.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's awesome.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And yeah, I think it was, I think it was Sporktown Heroine that turned me on to this channel.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She recommended me a video called, huh?

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No, nothing.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, called The Throne of Fred Hampton.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it's a similar thing.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This guy, Fred Hampton, who I think might have also been a, maybe not a janitor, maybe like a garbage collector or something,

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
but yeah, he had this little like warehouse space or like a storage unit.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And in the storage unit, he spent years collecting trash, like aluminum foil and light bulbs,

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and he would take any piece of like glittery or like reflective or shiny trash that he found,

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and he would make it into, he would form it into a piece of this throne

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and all this like, this like royal like, like adornments to go along with like, he built this throne room

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
out of like aluminum foil and light bulbs in this storage unit.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I guess he thought he was like a prophet who was possessed by God.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, it's not that he, he didn't think he was a prophet, but he did think he was tasked by God to build a throne like for like the return of Christ.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Or something to like ascend to.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's so cool.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then this, hold on.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A glittery room in a storage unit wouldn't surely, I mean, obviously that's probably just what they had.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But like, you can't see the glitteriness if there's no light shining in.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, I mean, there was a light, eternal light bulb on.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think I remember he brought like a woman over and he was like, hey, check this out.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And like he just, he went in and just turned the lights on.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And like the lady was like, oh my God, what the fuck is this?

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But yeah, anyway, there's an atrocity guide.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think it just came out and it was about this, I'd never heard of this before.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Russian cartoonist making a, he's been working on a movie for like 15 years.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, it's him and his wife, they're like a pair.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So yeah, these two Russian animators have been making this movie.

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's called the, it's called like, is it like the cloak or like the coat, the overcoat, I think.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it's, okay, you know that when you think of like old Russian cartoons, you think of like, yeah, like,

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
like sort of South Parkish, like like paper puppets, right?

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That like kind of move on hinges.

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They sort of look like the Monty Python cartoons.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, it's like that, but it's like the most complicated form of that you can imagine.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's like that, but with like every individual like finger of like the hand is like hinged and like it's all,

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it's not like flat colors.

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's like, it's all like painterly.

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And like they do like, you know, 20 different images of the same like face or whatever at different angles.

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And so as the guy turns his head like they're replaced, they're moving it slightly between frames,

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but they're also replacing it with a slit to make it like a smooth.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's so weird looking.

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's bizarre.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Honestly, this guy has been making this move.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
These people have been making this movie for like 15 years.

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's never, it's probably never going to be finished.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is just going to be the rest of their life finishing this movie and never actually doing it.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I got to say, it's an admirable work, but it looks scary.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It looks scary and creepy and unsettling and uncanny and I don't like it.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just don't like it.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What's it called?

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I believe the movie is called The Overcoat.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me look up Atrocity Guide and make sure.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Atrocity Guide.

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The newest video is called...

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, it's called The Animators who've spent 40 years on a single film.

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Maybe in the description it has a...

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, it's called The Overcoat.

127
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Like there's clips that have been shown of it.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I mean, the whole, the movie, it's not done yet.

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They've made other...

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They've made other animation work, like to fund the project.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know, I guess they are...

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I guess they like the Russian style of, you know, like paper puppet animation.

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And they're basically doing like taking that to its logical conclusion, doing like the most advanced form of that a person can do.

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And I guess that's fair enough.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I truly feel that the resulting product is horrifying.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I want to see it.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's hard to Google.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let me...

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, Jesus.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I just clicked to like a random point in the...

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, okay, okay.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A clip of the movie.

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll sort of find you the exact...

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll find you the exact timestamp.

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Here.

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, share.

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Start at 25.09.

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Here's just like a little clip of...

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, yeah, there's something...

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There's something uncanny about the fluidness of that hand movement.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think it's...

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I mean, I think it's part...

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't know if it's entirely the animation style.

155
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, I think the illustration style, like the way that he's drawn is part of what is making it creepy.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And I think it's got to be somewhat intentional.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like they drew him like that on purpose.

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But like, I just hate it.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I hate seeing it.

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
40 years in a single film.

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I said 15.

162
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I guess I meant 40.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, they've been...

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They made another...

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's one about like a fox stealing a baby.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And they made that movie like...

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I guess it's based on a myth or something.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And they made that like, you know, 40 years ago and it was a big hit.

169
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And they were like, well, for our next one, we're going to adapt this piece of folk literature called the Overcoat.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And that's what they've been doing for 40 years.

171
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Crazy.

172
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, I know.

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The dedication alone is inspiring, but also I would never want to do that one thing for 40 years.

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Later on in the video, she says like, it seems like the guy just sort of is like a weird misanthrope

175
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and kind of just doesn't care like what people think of his movie.

176
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And he's just doing it to do it at this point.

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it doesn't seem like he's in any hurry to like finish it up and get it released.

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I mean, why would you...

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
At this point, it's his life, I guess.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why would you stop?

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Like if somebody says, huh, this has taken a while and doesn't even look good.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It looks creepy.

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And it's like, oh, I guess I should can it then 40 years in.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He, it must be, it must be supposed to look like this.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Of course.

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But like...

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Movies don't have to look beautiful.

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They can look fucked up.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I just don't know why you would make it look like this on purpose.

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know who would want to see this.

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know.

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Freaks.

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't know, man.

194
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm...

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I...

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
God, not...

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Jeez.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Art enjoyers.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Art enjoyer.

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The average, the average Russian paper, paper doll style of animation enjoyer.

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The soy jack.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't know.

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Anime connoisseur.

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Anime freak.

205
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Something, something, something, something, something, haha, good, bad.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Anyway, what were we talking about?

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was talking about the museum in Canterbury.

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, I asked you about that on the Shekels for Hekels because I was not familiar with

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
any of these characters.

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The reason I don't really feel like it's worth, like a story worth telling is because there

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
wasn't really anything particularly exciting that happened.

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It was just like a nice day and like if we went to the seaside, we saw the sunset over

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the sea as it receded into the ocean.

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And it was really nice, but it's like, I can't really describe it in a way that anyone could

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
really get anything out of it.

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yesterday, I saw the moon, right?

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I know, but it was really low over the horizon.

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was really low and it was so like yellow.

221
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It was like orange.

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was the orangeest moon I've ever seen.

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It looked very spooky.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I missed the lunar eclipse.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There was a lunar eclipse like this weekend, I think, but it was cloudy.

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I couldn't see it.

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Bummer.

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, well.

229
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, well.

230
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Guess I'm fucked.

231
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, you know, another thing is the only sort of interesting thing, but it's like I'm mostly

232
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
interested in how many people in our audience who are British remember this one thing.

233
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Me and my brothers, we have this in-joke that started from Michael Owen, who is a footballer

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
who plays football.

235
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Who is this guy?

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Michael Owen.

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, okay.

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And the reason he's a meme, like an in-joke, is because we had a cereal box where it was

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Michael Owen themed shreddies or something.

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was a shreddies box and Michael Owen was on the front.

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He was hot shit.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He was like David Beckham, but at the same time, it was like Michael Owen and David Beckham,

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but David Beckham was more famous for longer lasting and Michael Owen, nobody remembers him.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But Michael Owen was on there.

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He's like, cool, the sports guy.

246
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know why we had this cereal.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There was this how Michael Owen eats shreddies, like how to eat shreddies with Michael Owen.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are shreddies like Wheaties?

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, yeah, very similar.

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So there was a four, it was four pals, I remember, and it's like step one.

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Wait a minute.

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Wait a minute.

253
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I Googled shreddies and I do see the cereal box, but there is also apparently a line of

254
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
underwear and other fabric goods that are designed to filter your farts and make them smell better.

255
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That is also called shreddies.

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, that's very unfortunate.

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't like that I know that now.

258
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The original shreddies, they claim.

259
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, the underwear?

260
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's what their website says.

261
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I just wanted to know.

262
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Now I can't help but picture fighting through a piece of cereal.

263
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I kind of don't believe them.

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think they're lying.

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think that probably the cereal came first.

266
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But what do I know?

267
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean, it's like a grid, a lattice grid.

268
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking at it.

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Anyway, there was like celebrities being on cereal wasn't that strange.

270
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But the thing that was funny was the how to eat shreddies or shredded wheat or whatever it was.

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, I've always wondered, Michael Owen, how do I eat shreddies exactly?

272
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah, and it was like panel one, like put spoon in to bowl.

273
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Panel two, lift spoon.

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Panel three, exercise taste buds.

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then panel four, repeat.

276
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I found it so funny because at no point does he put the cereal in his mouth.

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If you follow those steps exactly, you lift the spoon up out of the bowl.

278
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You put it in, lift it up, just move your mouth around a bit and then do it again.

279
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You'll die of starvation.

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And it was so stupid and me and my brothers laughed forever.

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We've laughed until 2021 about fucking Michael Owen.

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And now whenever we want to think of someone who's an idiot, a stupid character.

283
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We think of someone who's an idiot.

284
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Whenever we have like a stupid character for something that like, oh, what if, I don't know,

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
what if you had a grape that could tell a time, you know, Michael Owen, brand grape.

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We would just put Michael Owen there.

287
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's very stupid.

288
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's very in-jokey.

289
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But I'm really curious as to if anybody remembers Michael Owen's How to Eat Shreddies from the back of that cereal box.

290
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Comment below.

291
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Please comment below if you remember Michael Owen's How to Eat Shreddies.

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I mean, do you Google it?

293
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I Googled it.

294
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
All right.

295
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Here's one of the images.

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is what he looks like.

297
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So open your mouth or like whatever.

298
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Back, I think, I think this is like an edited photograph.

299
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They put the word back in there because that's the back button of their website about...

300
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay, okay.

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are you sure it was Shreddies because I'm seeing it on a box of sporties?

302
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Another cereal that sounds ridiculous to me.

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think that was like a version of the thing.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Nestle is the same company.

305
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Nestle Shredded Wheats.

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't think it was Shredded Wheat.

307
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's not quite the same product.

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This looks more like, this is Shredded Wheat.

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Does it sort of look more like Chex?

310
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know.

311
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I guess Shredded Wheat was like the original one, but then to make it cool for the kids,

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
they made Shreddies.

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And that was the one I know more of.

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's got more sugar on it.

316
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But yeah, Michael Owen, I found this one image.

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I can't find the rest.

318
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Like Shreddies How to...

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Like it's so stupid and nobody would keep track of it.

320
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Except for this one website that seems to have images of the old Michael Owen box.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When I Google this, all the results are him not on a Shreddies box, but on a sporties box.

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Are you sure you're not misremembering what cereal it was?

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, Shredded Wheat.

324
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It was like a limited time version.

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's like, oh, Lucky Charms, but with only nothing in it.

326
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And you call it Shitty Charms.

327
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's the different name for the same cereal, but branded with a celebrity.

328
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm looking at it.

329
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can tell that Shredded Wheat is not the same thing as Shreddies.

330
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay, we had Shredded Wheat.

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I mean, it's very similar.

332
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, I made a mistake, whatever.

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But that's what it was.

334
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Michael Owen on Shredded Something.

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Wait, well, hmm.

336
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Wait, I found a...

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Damn it.

338
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't think this is it.

339
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But I found some box images.

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Maybe this is just a different box, actually.

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Here's some important imagery for all of us to remember on Christmas Day.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Here's another one.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But here, I'm about to show my favorite one, which is...

344
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, there's more.

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
There's more.

346
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You found more?

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, there's these three boxes.

348
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And then there's three front cover boxes.

349
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But what I like most about this last one here is in the bottom right corner.

350
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Or sorry, the bottom left.

351
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What is this power zone?

352
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's like new Shreddies with power zone.

353
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, if you want to be good at sports, you need the power zone Shredded Wheat.

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What does this have? Cheese inside of it? What is that?

355
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No, it was just a layer of sugar.

356
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It looks like cheese.

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It looks like maybe honey, something or other.

358
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't know.

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But it's got the...

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
These Sporties have the power zone.

361
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh my God, I found it.

362
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Really? Which? Where?

363
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Open image. I just need to...

364
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's on Reddit.

365
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'll just copy paste.

366
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh my God.

367
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Michael Owen's morning workout.

368
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Anyway, yeah, here's how to eat the fucking cereal.

369
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The winner's way to start your day.

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You lift your arm, you stretch your mouth, and you don't eat it.

371
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah, you don't actually put it in your mouth.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's such a bizarre thing to include.

373
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And he's just so boring looking.

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, he seems totally uninterested.

375
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He's...

376
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh my God.

377
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
This is like a magazine or something, man.

378
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah, and the Beano, that's probably what it was.

379
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The Beano?

380
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, the Beano's a comic book.

381
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh.

382
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Like a weekly comic book with cartoon people.

383
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It looks like a wiki-how.

384
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Those wiki-how illustrations?

385
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah, a little bit.

386
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah.

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
How to eat sporties.

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know.

389
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Stupid.

390
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Fucking Michael Owen.

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The diagram for exercise taste buds is like a circular motion.

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You're meant to rotate the cereal through your...

393
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
over the tongue, and then under the tongue, and then back and forth,

394
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
back and forth in a circular kind of motion.

395
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The last image is the same as the first one,

396
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but it's ever so slightly smaller.

397
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, it is.

398
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

399
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, I love that I found this.

400
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, now I know how to eat sporties, shreddies.

401
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It probably works for any cereal, honestly.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

403
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So as long as you have the winner's spirit inside.

404
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Base.

405
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, now I know.

406
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Thanks, Michael Owen.

407
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Thanks, Michael Owen.

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Speaking of...

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Speaking of Michael Owen.

410
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Speaking of athleticism.

411
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Speaking of being fit and powerful.

412
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So I've been continuing to lift and become extremely strong.

413
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And I hit my PB.

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I hit my personal best on the bench press this week, 160.

415
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Nothing too impressive, but it's pretty good for me.

416
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So that's pretty cool.

417
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Kazi and Munchy are also PBing.

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Kazi is hitting their PBs on, I think, the overhead press

419
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and maybe the bench press and maybe the squat too, I think.

420
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So they're powerful also, which is nice.

421
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But this week, every time I went over there, they were like,

422
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Ben, after we get done lifting, let's get drunk.

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Let's get drunk.

424
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I was like, and I'm like, no, no, you're terrible.

425
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You're terrible.

426
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're a terrible influence.

427
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Friday, I said.

428
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We'll get drunk on Friday.

429
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And we said, okay, we'll get drunk on Friday.

430
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And then the Friday comes and then they're sick.

431
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Everyone's sick.

432
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Munchy gets sick and then Kazi gets sick.

433
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And now I'm probably going to get sick because I probably got

434
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
whatever they got.

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So that's that shit.

436
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Speaking of being sick, I think I said last week my dad got the

437
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
coronavirus.

438
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Did I mention that last week or was that the...

439
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That may have been during the stream.

440
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The stream.

441
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh yeah, my dad got the test positive for the coronavirus,

442
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
which made me very worried.

443
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But he says he's not, he's got no symptoms.

444
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And he said, I haven't talked to him in a few days,

445
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
but I haven't heard anything.

446
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So probably nothing, hopefully nothing has happened there.

447
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He said, he suspected it might be a false positive.

448
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So he said he was going to get tested again.

449
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And we'll see.

450
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I mentioned this on the stream, but I'll say it again.

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I felt, I felt sad because it was his birthday this weekend.

452
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And I had planned to go visit him as like a surprise.

453
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Like, hey, I'm here to hang out for your birthday.

454
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But then he got tested positive for the coronavirus.

455
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So we canceled that.

456
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So as not to spread the virus.

457
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So I didn't get to do that, which was kind of shit.

458
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And it would be kind of shitty if it turned out,

459
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
oh, it was just a false positive.

460
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I could have gone anyway, but I didn't.

461
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Whoops.

462
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But I mean, I guess Thanksgiving is like this week anyway.

463
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So whatever.

464
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'll be there either way.

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It doesn't matter.

466
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Nothing.

467
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Nothing matters.

468
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I hope it is a false positive.

469
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So I don't have to worry about catching it.

470
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes.

471
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That would be helpful.

472
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That would be optimal.

473
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

474
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

475
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, by the way, for, for my adventure,

476
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
there was a lot of walking involved.

477
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And it's my first big Pikmin bloom outing.

478
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, God.

479
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And I got so many nectar.

480
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I got so many flowers bloomed.

481
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Wow.

482
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That sounds incredible.

483
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And guess how many steps that was for that entire day.

484
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
For what, for one day walking around in museums and shit.

485
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Walking around in museums and then also walking like to the ocean.

486
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There's quite a lot of walking, really.

487
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay, let me think.

488
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
At a rate of about one step a second,

489
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
let's say a day out is maybe,

490
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
if it's a long day, maybe eight hours, right?

491
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So 60, 60 steps a minute times 60 steps is 3,600 steps per hour.

492
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Times eight would be 24, 25,800 steps.

493
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And let's say maybe you were walking for half of it.

494
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So I'm going to guess about 12,000 steps.

495
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Hmm.

496
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Well, well.

497
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
There's actually 21,656 steps.

498
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Wow.

499
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Damn.

500
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That was a lot.

501
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
My legs hurt quite a lot afterwards.

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Because we planned it badly.

503
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We didn't exactly know where we were going.

504
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It was really just sort of like, let's get the fuck out somewhere.

505
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And then we did.

506
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And we had to walk a lot.

507
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We could have got more buses, but we thought,

508
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
no, this is an adventure.

509
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We can walk.

510
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We can walk through this forest.

511
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, oh, we can't.

512
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So you were like, you were on like a family trip to Canterbury.

513
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And while you were there, you were like, let's get out.

514
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's just go walk around somewhere.

515
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
No, no, no, no.

516
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We just, it was just a day trip.

517
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We got on a coach to Canterbury at like 8 a.m.

518
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Just you and your brothers?

519
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

520
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah.

521
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And then we explored the town.

522
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We walked through some farms and some woodland on our way north

523
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
where the coach was going to pick us up.

524
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That was the plan, generally, is we go to Canterbury,

525
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
then we get the coach back in like seven hours.

526
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But we thought like, oh, seven hours, that's plenty of time

527
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
to get to a place like, I don't know, one town over.

528
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's not even that far, like a, you know, whatever.

529
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We're walking there.

530
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And it took a while.

531
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And we had to sort of, we had to take a bus near the end.

532
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
To get there.

533
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And it hurt.

534
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes.

535
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Mm-hmm.

536
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
At least we saw the sea, though.

537
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That was really nice.

538
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Hey, you ever seen the sea?

539
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, of course you have.

540
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You're in Boston.

541
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You see the sea all the time.

542
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm in Boston, yeah.

543
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Well, I mean, I see the Charles River all the time,

544
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
which is very close to the sea.

545
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I see the sea occasionally.

546
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I've seen the West Coast too, you know, once or twice.

547
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

548
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's something just magical to me about an X,

549
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
like a huge flat, no, nothing in your line of vision.

550
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Seeing the ocean just keeps going.

551
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The, you know, if you guys were walking around all day,

552
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
does that mean that Henry's leg is better?

553
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Didn't he have like a broken leg for a while?

554
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No.

555
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
All right.

556
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Here's the silly thing.

557
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay.

558
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Henry has been getting better.

559
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He's on a medication that is, you know, for most of 2020,

560
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
he was like, my leg's fucked and I can't get a doctor

561
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
because coronavirus, everyone, all the doctors are busy.

562
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Right.

563
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And so his leg got worse and that was really fucked.

564
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes.

565
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Now coronavirus has eased up a bit.

566
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
He's able to have, he's been able to have more doctors

567
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
looking at his leg.

568
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He's got things going on, so it's improving.

569
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And now he has to, it's at the point where he needs

570
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
to walk a bit in order to build up strength

571
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
because if he's laying still, it's not going to improve.

572
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So he has to do physical therapy for it basically.

573
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah, a little bit of physical therapy.

574
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And we thought, okay, this would be like, you know,

575
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
maybe you could come with us on this fun walk.

576
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And that was, I mean, it was kind of his idea.

577
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He wanted to get out of the house.

578
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It was just a lot of walking.

579
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Luckily, we thought this was a stupid idea,

580
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but he brought like a light, like an aluminum metal chair

581
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and he strapped it to a backpack

582
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and he had that carrying around the whole time.

583
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And he had a walking set.

584
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
To just say it if you needed to?

585
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, and we were like, okay, but there's going to be benches.

586
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
There's going to be like places where you can sit.

587
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it was actually very useful because the bus stops

588
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
where they had benches that were like anti-homeless benches.

589
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You can't lie down on them.

590
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You sort of slip off them if you, you know, try to relax in any way.

591
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's basically just like you're supposed to lean up against it

592
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
while standing basically.

593
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They're not really seats.

594
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And so when we were waiting for the bus, it's stupid.

595
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I hate it.

596
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's like a metal cuboid that's slightly tilted downwards.

597
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What?

598
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I've never seen such a thing.

599
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I mean, I've seen anti-homeless benches,

600
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
but I've never seen one that's just a slanted cube.

601
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well, like you got the bus area like a shelter, right?

602
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh, wait.

603
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So you're saying that it's basically just sort of like a featureless metal like slab

604
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
that just kind of sticks out of the ground

605
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and has like a sort of horizontal surface on top

606
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that you could maybe sit on, but it's angled.

607
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can kind of picture what you're talking about.

608
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You could slip forward.

609
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Does it have like handles or railings or a back?

610
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It has a back.

611
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's like, you know, bus stops that have like a back

612
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and then like a roof to keep you out of the rain.

613
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yes.

614
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's like one of those with like glass on each side.

615
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And then the bench itself is just a metal cuboid

616
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
that's slightly slanted downwards so that you slip off it.

617
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And so he wouldn't have been able to sit on that

618
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
for any extended period of time.

619
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So that chair actually did come in handy a few times.

620
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So good idea.

621
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I see.

622
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I see.

623
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Fascinating.

624
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Honestly, really weird.

625
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Our bus stops, I mean, we have benches that are just, you know,

626
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
they're benches you can sit on.

627
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah.

628
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Most of our bus stops just don't have a bench in them though.

629
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Most of our bus stops around here are just,

630
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
they're just, you know, a little like, you know,

631
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
glass and metal shelf you can stand under.

632
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
What would you call a bus stop thing like a kiosk?

633
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's not really it.

634
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe a kiosk, maybe a little...

635
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, this is kind of coming up.

636
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Not a pagoda, I don't know.

637
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Overhang?

638
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No.

639
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You're coming, we've mentioned this before,

640
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
but you're planning to come visit in January, right?

641
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes, I'll be coming over.

642
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Very cool.

643
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That'll be epic.

644
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It will be a little bit epic.

645
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay, I can't find a good image of this.

646
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
God dang it.

647
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Are you looking for the bench?

648
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm looking for a type of bench that's similar enough,

649
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
so I can illustrate what it is,

650
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
but these images are like tiny,

651
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll post one so you can get a, maybe zoom in.

652
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What?

653
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's just a little pole.

654
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's just a little pole and it's sort of slightly angled.

655
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That one in particular, that red one,

656
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
that's the London one, those are okay.

657
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You can sort of sit on them.

658
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But the ones that we were at in Canterbury and Whistable,

659
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
they sucked.

660
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's so silly.

661
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah.

662
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Most people just stand next to them,

663
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
but you don't even bother.

664
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I could see leaning again.

665
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I could see leaning against it for sure.

666
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Hmm.

667
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That seems like aggressively like,

668
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
we're giving you as little bench as we can get away with.

669
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah.

670
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh well.

671
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh well.

672
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is billions so they can just not spend it elsewhere.

673
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You know, not to revert the topic,

674
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but I forgot to mention something else about lifting yesterday.

675
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
We were doing it and we were in Kazia Munchie's basement

676
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and their boiler, their house boiler that heats the water,

677
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
heats their house through radiators,

678
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
just started belching steam.

679
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It just started blasting big steam cloud out of a pipe

680
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and it was billowing up into the ceiling

681
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and it heated up the room and it made it all moist and sweaty.

682
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And it was...

683
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah, it was very uncomfortable.

684
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We had to move the bar over to another section of the place

685
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
a little further away from all the steam.

686
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And it was very upsetting.

687
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It was very uncomfortable.

688
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It made me very mad,

689
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
but we thought we were being poisoned by gas for a minute.

690
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
But I went over and I took a big lung...

691
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
To test the poison gas theory,

692
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I went over and I took a big lung full of it

693
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and I survived so I was like, no, no, it's steam, it's fine.

694
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I mean, would gas...

695
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Would there even be a gas pipe?

696
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, it's a standard feature of most boilers in American houses

697
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
that there's a big pipe that comes off it

698
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that periodically just emits huge amounts of poisonous gas.

699
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I know the emitting part is not part of it,

700
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
but does the house use gas for the stove?

701
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, I believe it's an oil-burning boiler, right?

702
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It burns oil to heat the water in the boiler

703
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
that then circulates through the radiator system.

704
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So it could have been oil.

705
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Did I mention...

706
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Did I mention that I had a leaky roof?

707
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Did I tell you about this?

708
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, a couple weeks ago, I forgot to mention it.

709
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, okay, oh shit, my headphones just got unplugged.

710
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, a couple, like two weeks ago,

711
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
my ceiling in my shitty apartment, it's made of those...

712
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You know, in an office building,

713
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the ceiling might be made of corrugated rectangular tiles

714
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
that just kind of fit together.

715
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You know what I mean?

716
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, a little bit.

717
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, my roof is made of these corrugated cardboard-y tiles.

718
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Cardboard?

719
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't know if they're not actually cardboard,

720
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
they're stiffer than that, but they're these cheap tiles.

721
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And one of them over my radiator has kind of a brown stain on it.

722
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, and it's sort of bowed out.

723
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Well, from that brown stain bowed out area,

724
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
one day I just started hearing a tip, tip, tip, and I look over and yep,

725
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
there's just water dripping out of the tile in my ceiling.

726
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So I'm like, oh god, oh my god.

727
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And I put my trash can under it to collect the water.

728
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I am like, what do I do?

729
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
At first I was like, you know what,

730
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
maybe I'll just hope that it will go away.

731
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So for one day I waited and was just like,

732
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
maybe it just won't happen again.

733
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I think, I actually think, and this is not something I'm sure of,

734
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
but I think one time I went, I think I was drunk, I was kind of drunk,

735
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I came home, I woke up, and my face was kind of wet,

736
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and I was like, and my pillow was kind of wet,

737
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and I was like, did I spill something on my pillow?

738
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And in hindsight, I think that maybe the ceiling was dripping on my face,

739
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and I just didn't notice.

740
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because it was pretty close to where my bed was at the time.

741
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Fortunately, the water was not, it was not like sewage or anything,

742
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
it did not smell bad or anything, it smelled like nothing.

743
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So a day went by and it kept dripping,

744
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and I'm like, oh god, fuck, I have to call my shitty fucking landlord,

745
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
my psycho landlord, who was a fucking slumlord scam artist piece of shit.

746
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I call her, she's like, okay, I'll call the property manager.

747
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That guy couldn't come that night, but he came the next day, he showed up,

748
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and he took a look, and he figured out it was like the radiator system

749
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
was like emitting steam, and the steam was condensing into this water,

750
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and so he just had to like, he just had to like drain the pipe,

751
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and he like tightened up some shit or whatever,

752
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and now it works, it doesn't leak anymore.

753
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So that's pretty cool.

754
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I had to rearrange my room to keep my bed dry for that one night.

755
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So, you know, it was pretty bad, pretty disgusting,

756
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but not as bad as it could have been, a happy ending, I guess.

757
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
That's what happened.

758
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Anyway, what was that, steam, leaky roofs, shitty apartments?

759
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't remember what the point of that story was.

760
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You said something about lifting and then gas.

761
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, oh right, the poison gas, I got paranoid.

762
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I get paranoid about carbon monoxide poisoning while I'm asleep,

763
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
so I bought a carbon monoxide detector.

764
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I actually had a carbon monoxide detector, but it was kind of broken,

765
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and I think like a battery that had been in it had leaked or something,

766
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
so I wasn't confident that it still worked, so I replaced it,

767
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and now I'm good.

768
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It is reading zero right now.

769
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It has been reading zero the entire time since I installed it,

770
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,000
so your boy is safe from suffocation.

771
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.

772
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Hooray, hooray.

773
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
There's a boiler in my room.

774
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's behind a cabinet.

775
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah, there's a boiler in my kitchen.

776
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I also am scared of carbon monoxide, and I've been a little short of breath,

777
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
not like all the time, but only during the night

778
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
when I have my door closed and the window closed,

779
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and I think there's just not a lot of ventilation.

780
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I feel like if it's not carbon monoxide, it doesn't seem to be.

781
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's carbon dioxide that I'm breathing out into a room that isn't getting any fresh oxygen.

782
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I feel like if I don't open a window a little bit,

783
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm gonna fucking die.

784
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm gonna suffocate.

785
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I have the same fear sometimes.

786
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It's probably unfounded, at the probably won't happen,

787
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
but I get it.

788
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It's like the slight lightheadedness that I can't exactly determine

789
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
whether it's sleepiness or lack of oxygen.

790
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And lack of oxygen is the scariest thing,

791
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
because lack of oxygen, you just sort of slow down and stop.

792
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And once you've stopped, would you ever be able to get out

793
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
if somebody doesn't open the door?

794
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
If I'm unconscious, I am completely vulnerable.

795
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yes, yes, true.

796
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Even though it's winter, I have to keep a window open just a little bit,

797
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
which means it's really cold outside of the duvet.

798
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Otherwise, it just doesn't feel right.

799
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Makes, yeah.

800
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I still have my air conditioner in the window,

801
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
even though it's definitely too cold for that now.

802
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Also, kind of, yeah, for the same reason,

803
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't want to be like I'm sealed in here.

804
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It sort of gives a little bit of air flow,

805
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but it's limited air flow, because it's not just like a hole.

806
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't even know if it does allow air through, actually.

807
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It might just be a mental thing.

808
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I feel like it provides ventilation, whether it does or not.

809
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I got new curtains.

810
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I had no curtains, and I'm on the ground floor,

811
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and I have two big windows, so I had no privacy.

812
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I just tacked up a bed sheet over most of my windows,

813
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and I put some pieces of cardboard, literal cardboard up.

814
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I stood them up on top of the hung bed sheet,

815
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
just resting on top of it to cover up the rest of the windows.

816
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I bought some actual curtains,

817
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
but the curtains that I bought, they got here,

818
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and they were, because I didn't want blackout curtains,

819
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
because I want the natural light to wake me up,

820
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
to maintain a certain amount of regular sleeping schedule.

821
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I got these thin curtains, but they were so thin

822
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
that they were completely see-through, completely transparent.

823
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
They didn't obscure anything.

824
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So I bought another sheer curtain,

825
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and I was like, if I just put two on top of each other,

826
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
that will obscure things.

827
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
No, it wasn't enough.

828
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Even with both on top of each other still transparent.

829
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So I'm like, okay, okay.

830
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I will buy a thicker curtain, and I did.

831
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So now I have all three of them stacked on top of each other,

832
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and I think that maybe all three stacked on top of each other,

833
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I think it's not quite enough to...

834
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think it's mostly enough to obscure me from the outside,

835
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
but also it blocks more of the light than I wanted to block,

836
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
because I want that natural light, and now I'm...

837
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
The bedsheet, the bedsheet let all the light in,

838
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and completely obscured the view.

839
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So the bedsheet was literally the perfect solution.

840
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Why can't a curtain just be made of the same sheet as my bedsheet?

841
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It did everything I wanted it to do.

842
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Problems upon problems for me.

843
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Wait, how...

844
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
In your apartment, I forget.

845
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Are you in the one up stairs?

846
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
No, I'm on the first floor.

847
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

848
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The low down where the people could just walk right by your window.

849
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah, okay, I can understand that.

850
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

851
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
See, if I was up on a second floor,

852
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I usually wouldn't really worry too much about people looking up.

853
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh, no, like, people can just...

854
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I mean, cars pull into my driveway, right?

855
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Like, it's at the level where if a person pulled into my driveway

856
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
and parked in front of my house,

857
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
their eye level would be exactly at the level of my windows.

858
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
They would be looking directly into my room.

859
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So, yeah, I have to have something.

860
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
What a weird window.

861
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Ah, but it's just a weird...

862
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's just a weird location relative to the outside.

863
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Oh, well, it's fine.

864
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah, the room came with...

865
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It had, like, metal bars.

866
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It had these bars over the window.

867
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Supposedly, it's some kind of, like, an anti-breaking measure.

868
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But I was like, well, I need an air conditioner.

869
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's hot. It's still summer when I moved in.

870
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So I had to get the guy to just take the bars off.

871
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So, you know, now I'm vulnerable.

872
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Now anyone can just climb in my window.

873
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It doesn't even matter.

874
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm sure those tiny, those tiny, thin little metal bars

875
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
would have stopped someone before.

876
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Um, yeah.

877
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They would go up to the window,

878
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
see the Bensaint lives there and say,

879
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
ah, man.

880
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Ah, nothing, there's nothing here.

881
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
No reason.

882
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, I hope so.

883
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Unless they want Road to Radcon.

884
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Then they'd smash it.

885
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, they would steal my, like, 50 leftover copies of Road to Radcon.

886
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, I could sell those for $15 a copy.

887
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh, damn, yeah.

888
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Uh, please buy my extra copies of Road to Radcon.

889
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Uh, please DM me on Discord or Twitter

890
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
or just PayPal me.

891
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Arigato.

892
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Okay.

893
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Um, right.

894
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So on the subject of selling stuff,

895
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I, okay, I'm still not ready to publicly announce

896
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
what my little side project,

897
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
aside from Phantom's Revenge, is.

898
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But, um, without getting into two specifics,

899
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I will say that, uh, it's coming along.

900
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's, it's getting, it's getting ready to be public.

901
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But I had a, one of the, I can't say what it is,

902
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
an item, an item that I needed to do it.

903
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Uh, I got a new one, and then it broke immediately.

904
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It broke, like, instantly.

905
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And, uh, I am trying to negotiate for a refund on that.

906
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Progress is held up for a moment

907
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
because I really don't want to buy a new one,

908
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and I really don't think I should have to buy a new one.

909
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I really don't think anyone should have to pay for this,

910
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
except for the manufacturer who gave me a product

911
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
that just broke instantly.

912
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But I, they are being, uh, annoying.

913
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And I, I don't, just don't, I just,

914
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
just doesn't seem right.

915
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Just, it just doesn't seem right.

916
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's just the principle of the thing.

917
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Um, so I'm just trying.

918
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Do they just not have a refund policy?

919
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Uh, I don't exactly know.

920
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's, uh, the, it's not clear at the moment to me.

921
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, that's all you can really say about it.

922
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Uh, but very, but very annoying.

923
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Hold on.

924
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm, I'm, I have to, quick, I have to extract some files.

925
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I have to extract some.

926
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
This is part of the whole thing.

927
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
This is, these are the files.

928
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
This is, this is the work that my man Slobodan,

929
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I got, I got a guy, I got a guy from Serbia named Slobodan

930
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
to work on this for me.

931
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
He's, he's done, he's done great work.

932
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So let's see the clues are an item that breaks instantly sometimes.

933
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
A Serbian man.

934
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Slobodan.

935
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
You know a guy.

936
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Not just any Serbian guy.

937
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Slobodan.

938
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Slobodan.

939
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Slobodan.

940
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I told, I told Slobodan, I explained to Slobodan what I needed from him.

941
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
And he responded, he responded with a smiley face and said,

942
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Okie dokie.

943
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I love Slobodan.

944
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Okie dokie.

945
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So.

946
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Okie dokie.

947
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Slobodan and digital files.

948
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I wonder what it could be.

949
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
There are, there are in fact digital file.

950
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
There are, there is digital, there is digital work afoot here.

951
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
We're living in the digital age.

952
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Sad.

953
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Sad but true.

954
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That means it's not even interesting.

955
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It means it's normal.

956
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Then saying, how could you dare do something normal?

957
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Unfortunately.

958
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yes, it is.

959
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It's just normal.

960
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's just some normal shit.

961
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Okay.

962
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

963
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Well, less, less I be tempted to spill the beans.

964
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I might, since, since it's going to be a thing that I'm going to have to sell because

965
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm spending money to make it.

966
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I might not announce it until January.

967
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I might not announce it until after New Year's.

968
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Strictly because, like, if I'm selling it for money, I want it to be in the New Year

969
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
because of, for tax reasons.

970
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Because I think, because I think I'll be taxed more heavily on it if I sell shit this year

971
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
than if I sell, wait till next year.

972
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And it's only like a month away, so I might, I might do that.

973
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And it might not even be ready until then anyway.

974
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I've got to do my tax return for January.

975
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
God damn.

976
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I just, I just finished my taxes.

977
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I just got my taxes, like, filed for 2020 because, like, I filed for all these extensions.

978
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But they finally ran out and I had to do it.

979
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I think I still owe my, I filed the returns.

980
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I think I still owe the federal government, but I paid my state taxes.

981
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It wasn't as, it wasn't as, I found some, I found some loopholes.

982
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I found some, like, I found some, what's the word, some, some, like, tax breaks for, like, certain categories of things.

983
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Like, I qualified for some, for some breaks that I didn't think I was going to cat, cat, kit, qualify for.

984
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So it wasn't as bad as I expected.

985
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Yes!

986
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Yeah.

987
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Based.

988
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah.

989
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh yeah.

990
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I've just realized, Lord of Ghosts income, I'm going to have to, like, to figure out how to do the taxes on that.

991
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Because I haven't been able to buy all of that.

992
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Like, a lot of the cost is postage.

993
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
But if I don't have all the things ready to send by the end of the year,

994
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and I don't start posting them, I can't put that on my taxes as, like, money spent for business or whatever.

995
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Oh yeah.

996
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh no!

997
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I mean, you could buy, you could, like, buy stamps ahead of time.

998
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, yeah, I could, I could do all that.

999
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's just, I'm really stressing out.

1000
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm stressing out about a lot of things, but it's mostly just the Lord of Ghosts Kickstarter, everything around that.

1001
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And then the needing to do it before the end of the year, and now the taxes are like, oh yeah, that's also a thing.

1002
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I should try to get it done by the end of the year.

1003
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I'm still waiting on a few people to get the ghost stories finished.

1004
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Yeah.

1005
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
But unfortunately, Kazi is sick right now, so they can't draw.

1006
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Why can't you draw when you're sick?

1007
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Well, they, I don't know.

1008
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
They just said they'd try to get better first.

1009
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I thought they were, like, done.

1010
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I don't, they said, like, two of the pages are basically done, and then there's two others that they're working on at the same time.

1011
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then just recently they got sick, so what would it, and there's-

1012
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
They're sick for like two days.

1013
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Whatever.

1014
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Whatever.

1015
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I don't want to be, like, angry at anyone.

1016
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I do.

1017
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Because it's, it's, it's like...

1018
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Mm-hmm, gone, gone.

1019
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Well, it's not like I gave them a deadline.

1020
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I said I would like it to be done, but, you know, take your time, because I've got a lot of other things to do.

1021
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I've got the plushies to be made, and that's really the thing I thought was going to take the longest.

1022
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But now I have all the plushies, and I need to do a little, like, test prints on, like, the, how to figure out the green on the Redman comic,

1023
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:51,000
but then I can print those, and then everything will be ready as long as I have the Lord of Ghosts themselves,

1024
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and then I've got to do the signing, and I've got to do the doodles,

1025
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and I've got to get a bunch of envelopes and packages and figure out the, do the Kickstarter, like, send out a request for addresses,

1026
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and then all the people have to be prompt with that, and it's like, oh my god, everything's going to go wrong.

1027
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I just feel it.

1028
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
True.

1029
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And I don't like that.

1030
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That's upsetting.

1031
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, I was asking you about shipping, because this thing that I'm working on is something that I would have to ship,

1032
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
and I was looking into, okay, so the Road to Radcon are books.

1033
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
That's paper.

1034
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I can put those in an envelope and mail them as a letter, so that keeps the costs down significantly.

1035
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
The pins.

1036
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I kind of cheated with mailing the pins.

1037
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I put them in an envelope, and I sent them as letters, and it probably shouldn't have counted,

1038
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:03,000
but I got away with sending most of them as letters in the mail instead of as packages, so that also kept the costs.

1039
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I mean, it was higher because some of those were sort of heavy, but yeah, that kept the costs down.

1040
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
This thing that I want to sell soon is, I don't think I'm going to be able to send it as a letter.

1041
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I think it's going to have to be sent as a package, which is not so bad for domestic shipping,

1042
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
but internationally is pretty bad.

1043
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I was looking around, and I got really scared, because I was picking worst case scenario.

1044
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
What's the worst country that I would have to send something to to find out what's the upper limit of how much this shipping is going to cost?

1045
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Australia.

1046
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Okay, Google, how much is it going to cost me to ship a small four ounce package to Australia?

1047
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
$116.

1048
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And I'm like, are you fucking shitting me?

1049
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

1050
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1051
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I know it would be expensive, but like $100.

1052
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
There was a reason.

1053
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:13,000
The reason is that apparently, first class is what you call just normal send a package for cheap.

1054
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So normal first class shipping to Australia and New Zealand and maybe a couple other countries is just suspended right now because of COVID for some reason.

1055
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So yeah, it's just that they don't offer normal shipping to Australia at the moment.

1056
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So I would have to go with some other like priority mail that is like rush delivery costs $100, right?

1057
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So that's why.

1058
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And it turned out that shipping to other countries was not as bad as I thought.

1059
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It's kind of bad.

1060
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It's going to be like 15 bucks to ship to basically any other country.

1061
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:56,000
A few countries might be a little more like Brazil was $19 for some reason, but like 15 up to maybe 20 seems to be.

1062
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So I would probably just charge like $15 shipping, which is less than I thought, but it's it sucks.

1063
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
But like if that's I think that's the best I can do.

1064
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah, so that's why that's why I was asking you about the shipping stuff.

1065
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah, it turned out not to be it turned out not to be as bad as I thought.

1066
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
A lot of ghosts is like hundred pages.

1067
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's not going to be an envelope.

1068
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's going to be at least a large envelope.

1069
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
A large envelope or like if it's got a plush, it's going to be a box, small box.

1070
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And all of the ones that have the comic have the red man comics that makes it even thicker.

1071
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So, oh, everything's going to go wrong.

1072
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah.

1073
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Man, after this never again.

1074
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Never will I ever do shipping of any kind.

1075
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You know, after I did the first I think after I did the first Vapors, I found myself being like this was so hard.

1076
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Like this Kickstarter was really difficult and it and it was not quick and easy.

1077
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And I like for months I was still fulfilling orders and I was like, this is so hard.

1078
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
This totally wasn't worth it.

1079
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But like I've done more of that thing and I think I have.

1080
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I think I don't really mind it.

1081
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I think I don't mind the work of like, you know, addressing envelopes, going to the post office, putting them in the mail.

1082
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I think it's it's work and it takes a while, but I don't think I mind it that much.

1083
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And it like this kind of thing selling like selling physical products makes money more easily than like, I don't know.

1084
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Then then like, you know, donations online, right?

1085
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
It's just kind of a.

1086
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I feel like it's a model that works pretty well.

1087
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And so I think I have decided that I don't mind it and I might continue to do this sort of thing into the future.

1088
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I'm just it's because it's the first time doing such a big thing.

1089
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And it's I'm I'm just stressed out.

1090
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm nervous.

1091
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah.

1092
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I made sure I feel like I made sure to be like extra.

1093
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Like, like what do you call it, a margin of error, margin of too much money for shipping?

1094
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yes, yes.

1095
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
When I came up with all the original things.

1096
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
But if the shipping in general is just more expensive now, I don't know that that's going to cover it.

1097
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Fuck.

1098
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Well, I got to do it, but I might cry.

1099
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I might cry about it.

1100
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
The stakes, the stakes are.

1101
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Well, I'll do it either way.

1102
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
It's just a question of whether I cry doing it or not.

1103
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's a question of how much like tier like the volume of tears, how much you would displace in a cup.

1104
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And don't don't cry too much because tears are heavy.

1105
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And so they'll add weight to the packages and they'll make it cost more of a ship.

1106
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So I'll I'll ship them to myself.

1107
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I won't need I won't.

1108
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Tears are extra.

1109
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Yeah.

1110
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Speaking of stuff, I showed you the Edward Edward D. Al's progress on the Radcon for dojin.

1111
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Yes.

1112
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Which I'm sure I say this all the time.

1113
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm sure everyone believes that that's vaporware and will never materialize, but it will.

1114
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Edward is maybe not quite halfway done drawing it.

1115
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Thereabouts, something like that.

1116
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It looks really good.

1117
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I'm looking at a sample page right now.

1118
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It looks great.

1119
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yes.

1120
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I'm going to be I wasn't going to do this, but I think I am going to I'm going to print I'm going to print some copies.

1121
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I'm going to I'm going to offer print copies to anyone that wants to buy them in the same way that I'm offering a road to Radcon to people.

1122
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Because maybe it could be a double a bonus.

1123
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm going to do it.

1124
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm going to do it like dojin get a free road to Radcon or slightly more like a discounted road to Radcon.

1125
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I gave anyone who was a PCP patron five dollars off of road to Radcon.

1126
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I think I will with with with the dojin.

1127
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I think I'll say like you get five dollars off the dojin if you either are a five dollar patron or you bought road to Radcon.

1128
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So that like if you were to buy both and you were a patron, you would get like a total of ten dollars.

1129
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
You get five dollars off one and five dollars off the other.

1130
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Right.

1131
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I think it'll be the same because I don't want to do it that like, oh, if you're a patron, like if you're a patron and you bought road to Radcon, you got five dollars off the first the road to Radcon and now you get both stacked for ten dollars off.

1132
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
The dojin so 50.

1133
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I don't want to give that much.

1134
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I want to give that much of a discount.

1135
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I want to give ten dollars across both books.

1136
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That seems fair to me.

1137
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah.

1138
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Anyway, it's it looks good.

1139
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Edward, I want to say Edward's work looks really great and I can't wait for the final product, but he did annoy me a little bit by kind of disappearing for a while.

1140
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I was a bit worried that he was just gone and I would not be hearing from him again, but I was wrong.

1141
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
He did eventually get back to me with the progress on the comic.

1142
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So it's all it's all good.

1143
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Yeah.

1144
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
He seems to be working on it again.

1145
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Funny, funny shit.

1146
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Yeah.

1147
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It would have been pretty funny, though, if like he just he just disappeared.

1148
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
He was like, well, I started it, but goodbye.

1149
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
No, no, not what happens.

1150
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Lamal.

1151
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Well, we're coming up to the ending of twenty twenty one and the and the Radcon four stuff is still it's still coming out.

1152
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Not quite finished.

1153
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Told me Nate has been in Communicado lately.

1154
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I asked he told me as I told him Edward is getting the dojin done and he said that yes, he will work on getting the the OVA and the music video done.

1155
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And I have not heard anything about it from him about it since then.

1156
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
So I don't know if he's been doing it.

1157
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm going to guess probably not.

1158
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,000
But I hope he will do it because he said he would and we need him to.

1159
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yeah.

1160
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I guess maybe I'll ask him again and say like, hey, so remember how I said the dojin is coming out?

1161
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Well, that's more true than ever.

1162
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
So can we get those videos, please?

1163
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Just put a nice big bow on this whole Radcon four debacle.

1164
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Put it all behind us.

1165
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Have it all break break the curse.

1166
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Well, this is the only way to break the curse of Radcon four is to deliver on all the Kickstarter promises.

1167
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Just get that shit sorted.

1168
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Yes.

1169
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yes, we're so close.

1170
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
We're pretty we're pretty close.

1171
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
We're pretty fucking close.

1172
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Should I release the should I post like a PDF version of Road to Radcon?

1173
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I suppose.

1174
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But then would people not want to get the physical version?

1175
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Well, they would.

1176
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I mean, I think everyone who is going to get a physical version has probably already gotten one.

1177
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Maybe a few people might see the PDF version and be like, oh, this is cool.

1178
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Maybe I do want to own a physical version.

1179
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I suppose it's not like that strange of an idea.

1180
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I think it could be worth it.

1181
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I think I had planned to maybe post a PDF version at the same time that I posted the dojin.

1182
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Whenever that happens, I don't know.

1183
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
And I guess I was yeah, right.

1184
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I keep meaning to ask Tom because I want to post I was going to post it on the website and I don't know how to do that.

1185
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I have not asked.

1186
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh, well.

1187
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Um.

1188
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah.

1189
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
In other news, I guess I'd been still working hard on the second secret project.

1190
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Wait, one more.

1191
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Would people be mad?

1192
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Would people who bought the physical book be like mad if that I posted the PDF version?

1193
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Would they be like, if I knew there was going to be a public PDF version, I wouldn't have bought this piece of junk.

1194
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Throws it against the wall.

1195
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Does anyone care about that?

1196
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Is that a concern?

1197
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I don't know.

1198
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I mean, people who bought it probably bought it because it's like an item, not because they wanted to read it.

1199
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Commenters, let me know.

1200
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Of course, they don't actually want to read it.

1201
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Commenters, it's more interesting as like a thing that they could be like, I have this.

1202
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Commenters, if you bought Road to Radcon, let me know in the comments whether you'll be annoyed.

1203
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
If I post the PDF version on the website for people to read digitally.

1204
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Also, please buy more copies.

1205
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I have a box of 50 copies.

1206
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I don't need 50 copies of Road to Radcon.

1207
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Please, please take my extra stock.

1208
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Yeah.

1209
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Okay.

1210
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I guess that's all I have to say about that.

1211
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh, you were going to talk about your...

1212
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Well, you started talking about your secret project.

1213
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, it's really not because I can't talk about what it is.

1214
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But it's getting to the point where I'm a little worried that it may go into December, still not be ready.

1215
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And then...

1216
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Oh, I'm sure that my stock is going into December.

1217
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
December will be like, oh, suddenly you got to do things like family.

1218
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
No, I don't want to do all that, but I should.

1219
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I mean, you can't just ignore social gatherings entirely because then they'll have happened and then you're like,

1220
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I don't know how to speak to anyone anymore.

1221
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Yeah, the holidays always feel like a big thing.

1222
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm always trying to work on something and then it's always like,

1223
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I have to take like two or three days away from that to go do some bullshit,

1224
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
go see my fucking aunts and uncles.

1225
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I hate my aunts and uncles.

1226
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Yeah.

1227
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I mean, I don't hate mine, but they're not friends of mine.

1228
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah, I don't hate them, but I don't want to stop doing my shit to go and catch up with them.

1229
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Oh, how are you doing?

1230
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Oh, who got married this year?

1231
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Oh, that guy?

1232
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Okay, cool.

1233
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Oh, who had a kid?

1234
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Oh, that guy?

1235
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Oh, cool.

1236
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Wow, that's great.

1237
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I love that.

1238
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
All right.

1239
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Oh, I love the, I love the, I love the Guam keys you made.

1240
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
These Guam keys are just to die for.

1241
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah.

1242
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Incredible old family recipe.

1243
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Okay.

1244
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Bye.

1245
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You just get that clip and then play that on your phone.

1246
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah.

1247
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Instead of speaking to them.

1248
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Yeah.

1249
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
That's all.

1250
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:46,260
Like, ultimately, I enjoy the break because Christmas time alone, even if you get a lot

1251
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,000
of work done, it feels hollow afterwards.

1252
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
You're like, dang, the holidays are over and I didn't speak to anyone sucks.

1253
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Kind of.

1254
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I like to, I like to indulge in things I don't actually like.

1255
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And like Stockholm syndrome.

1256
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Like, I'm stuck with this family.

1257
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Absolutely.

1258
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Like drinking a bit and talking about nothing in particular and just saying hi.

1259
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah.

1260
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That's not so bad.

1261
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Nah, you're right.

1262
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's never as annoying as I think it's going to be.

1263
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah.

1264
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I mean, I always think it's going to suck shit.

1265
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And then it usually only sucks a little bit.

1266
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yeah.

1267
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Especially when I was younger, I would always hate the idea of it.

1268
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And then I'm there and I'm like, you know, there's chocolate.

1269
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
There's like peanuts.

1270
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
There's a dog.

1271
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
There's a dog.

1272
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
You know, it's people saying hi and I don't have to do anything about it.

1273
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah.

1274
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's like, you know, this is fine.

1275
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Family is actually good.

1276
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
If I'm at like a thing like that and I don't want to be there, it feels like an eternity.

1277
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It feels like I'm like, God, there's so many other things I could be doing.

1278
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
There's so many things I could be doing with this time.

1279
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But then if I step back and think about it, I'm like, okay, that was maybe like six hours,

1280
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
maybe 12 hours if I had to spend the whole day.

1281
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I waste 12 hours all the time, right?

1282
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
12 hours comes and goes without even noticing all the time.

1283
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It's stupid to get bent out of shape about one day, right?

1284
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I waste most days of my life, frankly.

1285
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:32,000
It's like I've never been to a social gathering with friends or family that has lasted longer than the longest streams I've done.

1286
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah.

1287
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Yeah.

1288
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
True.

1289
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That's right.

1290
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yeah, I'll stream for like seven hours sometimes.

1291
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Yeah, you're right.

1292
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I think it's just sort of like a holdover.

1293
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
When you go to those things in your young time, obviously feels like it takes longer.

1294
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Yeah.

1295
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
At a place for two hours is like agonizing.

1296
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But two hours, even if you're bored, it's not that bad as an adult.

1297
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And also, we've got phones now, so we have an excuse to just distract ourselves with some bullshit.

1298
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Yeah, two hours is nothing.

1299
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, you're right.

1300
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And maybe it is.

1301
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
It's just, I remember being bored as a kid and feeling like it was interminable.

1302
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But now, yeah, just goes by in a flash.

1303
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
No problem.

1304
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Merry Christmas.

1305
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Merry Christmas.

1306
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yes.

1307
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Yes.

1308
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Excellent.

1309
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Oh, did my files extract?

1310
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh, did my files?

1311
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I think they did.

1312
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I think my files extracted.

1313
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Let me check.

1314
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah, essential oils.

1315
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Let me check on my, oh, did it?

1316
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
There it is.

1317
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Ooh, that's a good file.

1318
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's the right size, too.

1319
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Hmm, that's a great file right there.

1320
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Takes a extraction like no problem.

1321
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1322
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Let me compare it to my other file.

1323
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Six, seven, six, eight.

1324
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Okay.

1325
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Ooh, very nice.

1326
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Very nice.

1327
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
A sound of an accountant.

1328
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Well, that's me.

1329
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,340
I'm I'm all about I'm all about adding up the numbers

1330
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,240
True

1331
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:24,520
Sure, I'm you know, that's that's the churning lifestyles. You got it. You got a key you got to get a count all your pennies

1332
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,000
Stack them up

1333
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,200
I'm stacking pennies some some people some people

1334
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,240
Stack Benny's I'm over here stacking pennies

1335
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,680
But all the same tease Ben Ben. Yes. Yes, exactly

1336
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:48,200
And Benny's but it all gets us to the same place eventually just mine gets me there slower and I never get as far

1337
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,560
I think my audio is really quiet for some reason my microphone is quiet

1338
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,440
Eleazar you're probably gonna have to like increase my volume a bit. I don't know why I'm just quiet today. Sorry about that

1339
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,360
Do do something about it?

1340
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,520
I don't know man

1341
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,520
Dog

1342
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,560
What's up? Yeah, what were we talking about?

1343
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:20,560
Well, I mean, I basically said everything. That's I've been working on the the secret project

1344
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,040
Stressing out about the Lord of Ghosts. I've been playing fucking

1345
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,440
Tower defense bloons. Oh god

1346
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,760
And that's been fun. I've been putting monkeys down and they've been throwing darts

1347
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,760
Putting monkeys down putting them down like dogs taking them out behind the shed

1348
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,200
Ah

1349
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,960
Duh-duh

1350
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,960
Went on that one adventure

1351
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,080
We talked about Michael Owen

1352
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:53,840
Yeah, and yeah, that was like on the adventure. Remember all the all the memories remember all those times

1353
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,480
remember remember those times where we

1354
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,520
Came up with like the Michael wave as a dip as an alternative to the microwave

1355
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,680
Michael Michael Owen. Yeah, the Michael wave

1356
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,680
He waves his hand around food and it cooks it just like a microwave

1357
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,200
But it's Michael Owen doing it and that was that was one of the many jokes

1358
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:20,560
So we came up with as we were walking across Canterbury and the fields and the woodlands beyond and that was like

1359
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,920
Yeah, what a story really not really good for a not a good for a podcast that one. It's kind of stupid

1360
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah for real

1361
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
That's true

1362
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,640
Hey, there's this one farm that like had

1363
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:42,840
We were looking on the the Google Maps and stuff and that was like a public footpath

1364
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:49,480
That goes straight through this farm out into the woods and this farm did everything in its power

1365
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,980
to imply that it is private land and you can't go there

1366
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,640
and

1367
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,640
it's all like

1368
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,880
You like they didn't have

1369
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,880
legal authority to kick you off because

1370
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:09,360
The road like the driveway road through their main gate

1371
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,240
It had to stay open

1372
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,240
but they had loads of signs in

1373
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,400
Red with bold white letters saying private property

1374
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:25,120
So but it was a public road, right? You say it was a public road that just happened to go through a public footpath like

1375
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,160
Like there's like sectioned off little places with

1376
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:36,480
With signs wooden signs with arrows saying, you know, yellow triangle saying this way is the

1377
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,280
Is the continuation of the of the public part that goes through forests

1378
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,280
there's things like that all over Britain and

1379
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,120
They sometimes go through farms, but farmers don't like it, but they can't really do anything about it

1380
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,280
So they have to imply if they don't want people walking near their their buildings

1381
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:57,200
They have to imply that it's so fucked up that you're here and we're gonna shout at you and shoot you if you

1382
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,120
This is anything this this is not a place of honor

1383
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,240
Nothing. Nothing is no great deed is esteemed here. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah, I do not oh

1384
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,360
There's a reference something the the

1385
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,440
The the like thing about like like how would you how would you?

1386
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:23,420
Denote a like like a toxic like radioactive place in a way that like would still be

1387
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,960
Comprehensible like thousands of years later. I

1388
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,760
Don't know. There's like

1389
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:35,240
Hold on if I Google this is not a place of honor

1390
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,520
Okay, yeah, the Wikipedia long-time nuclear waste warning messages

1391
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:47,960
Hold on here. Yeah, here are some like think things that like this is just sort of like a theoretical

1392
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,400
Idea of like how would we communicate?

1393
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,320
Don't go here to like future generations

1394
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:59,360
It's like what would we want to evoke and some of the the phrases are like this place is not a place of honor

1395
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:07,000
No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here. Nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us

1396
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,440
This message is a warning about danger

1397
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:16,440
The danger is to the body and it can kill the form of the danger is an emanation of energy

1398
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,400
and

1399
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:24,920
Like yeah, the idea was like maybe they were like maybe we could maybe we cover the entire like

1400
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,240
Surrounding like square kilometer with like, you know giant spikes

1401
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:35,920
We just like cover it and like Giants like wooden spikes to just be like this place will kill you don't come here. It's deadly

1402
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,560
I don't know so that they do that is what I'm saying

1403
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:45,760
The sign with all that language on it seems like oh thousands of years later

1404
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
Surely the language would be

1405
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:55,520
Changed. I I think I think the idea is that it would not literally say that in English. These are like

1406
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,280
ideas that they want

1407
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:04,000
To yeah, they want you not here's it yeah a 1993 report from the Sandia National laboratories

1408
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,520
Aimed to communicate a series of messages non-linguistically to any future visitors to a waste site

1409
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,840
It gave the following wording as an example of what those messages should evoke

1410
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,600
right hmm

1411
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:24,200
The end you're is unleashed only within danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically

1412
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,720
This place is best shun and left uninhabited

1413
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,920
Oh

1414
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:34,920
We would know this is good this place is a message and part of a system of messages pay attention to it

1415
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,360
Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture

1416
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,120
This place is not a place of honor, etc. Etc

1417
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,320
I feel like no matter what very right

1418
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,080
People will still curiously go there and die

1419
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,720
Yeah

1420
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:59,640
Probably because I guess the sign would then they would be like oh sign

1421
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:05,280
Says something somebody died in maybe it's dangerous in yeah, I mean

1422
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:10,520
There's always the chance that like no matter how strongly you try to convey like

1423
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,480
This place is dangerous. Someone might get the idea like oh they want they want to keep me out

1424
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,080
You know, they must be guarding something good

1425
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,160
Right like they must want to do something valuable

1426
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,280
They must they must hmm. This must be a place of lots of honor

1427
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:34,280
There must be some extremely highly esteemed deeds commemorated here. There must be some very valuable things here

1428
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,880
Otherwise why would they tell me that there aren't you know, what what are they hiding right?

1429
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,160
They're scooby-doing it

1430
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,960
They go the spooky scary guys saying

1431
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,560
Get out of here so that I can steal the money

1432
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,640
Yeah, you're scared away

1433
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,520
You're right

1434
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,840
Yeah, that is that is one way to interpret

1435
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,320
Scooby-Doo as a verb is to do something scary to make people leave you alone

1436
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,640
So you can get that you can reap the rewards so you can collect the insurance money or something

1437
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,960
There's insurance money, there's

1438
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:21,640
Buried gems or like a deed to a house is gonna expire and ownership is always some sort of thing like as long as people are scared

1439
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:28,880
And they're gone then I'll have all this money. I gotta scare people truly we live truly capitalism sure is fucked up that it

1440
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:34,600
Incentivizes like putting on a goblin costume and running around and scaring people

1441
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,760
These are systems broken man

1442
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:47,440
Fuck I was going to say so. Oh, yeah, isn't there maybe it's not in England. Maybe it's in like Wales or something

1443
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,440
but isn't there some

1444
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,120
policy of like

1445
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,980
You're like anyone is allowed to walk anywhere

1446
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,880
Or like like farm like anyone is allowed to walk on a farm even if it's private property like as long as they don't like

1447
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:07,360
Take anything. I feel like there's some countries that have laws that are specific. America's not one of them

1448
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,880
Yes, America's very get off my land

1449
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,640
I

1450
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:18,080
Think you that might be Scotland. There's a row of right to Rome. Yes

1451
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,680
Yes, I think Norway also. I'm not sure if England does. I'm not sure if Wales does either

1452
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:29,840
Okay, this is I feel like what wasn't that guy who like walked in a straight line across

1453
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:36,760
The con the island. Yes across Wales or Scotland or England. It was across Wales

1454
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,920
Yeah, maybe okay. Maybe that's why I was thinking Wales because I remembered that guy

1455
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:47,960
Just walked but he probably had to trespass at some point. He did do another one where he attempted to cross Scotland in a straight line

1456
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Hell yeah, yeah

1457
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,760
um

1458
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,080
Okay, I just uh, I thought maybe

1459
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,520
That was why the farmers can only imply

1460
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:09,400
Yeah, well, I don't know. Um in England. It's it's a different thing. It's not you don't have the right to go on people's land

1461
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,440
Yeah, um necessarily but there are

1462
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,560
Built into the countryside

1463
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,200
um

1464
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:22,520
Like hard and fast like this needs to be accessible by foot

1465
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,160
You need to be able to walk through these fields

1466
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:31,720
To get to a river or whatever. There's just like a network of public footpaths

1467
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,640
You have to be able you have to let people walk here

1468
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:43,800
Um, the public owns these little walkways and things and they're signposted by councils or whatever

1469
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:50,440
And farmers sometimes it they go straight straight through their land and nice farmers will make it very clear

1470
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:56,200
They'll upkeep the sign saying this is the way you go and people generally walk on the edge of a field

1471
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,880
Right to get to like a gate or a style to go into the next one and then it goes, you know this way and that way

1472
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,440
It's like a curated little

1473
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,600
series of paths

1474
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,680
And I like it I

1475
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:13,720
It was one of those things where I didn't I never really thought about it until I realized that not every country does that

1476
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,080
Yeah, I mean

1477
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:23,320
Got it just like gotta gotta have usually if there's a field if there's a farm and there's a field

1478
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,480
Usually you're allowed to go through

1479
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,000
some of it

1480
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,440
I would hope so

1481
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:34,600
It would be a bit shitty to let someone's private property impede, you know the public's ability to move about freely

1482
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,960
In my opinion

1483
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,960
Uh

1484
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,240
Um, uh, you want to talk about you want to go to voicemails? Um, I'm out of stuff

1485
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,600
Uh

1486
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,680
What else happened?

1487
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,200
Oh, there's kyle written house, but I don't really know anything about that still

1488
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,520
Oh, well, I was I was

1489
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,000
It was funny

1490
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,280
I was listening back to last week's episode and I heard myself talking about kyle written house and how everyone

1491
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,000
I follow on twitter said he was gonna get a full acquittal

1492
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,160
And uh, I was right or they were right. Um, yeah

1493
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:16,680
Even he even got off on charges that seem unambiguously true like illegal possession

1494
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,160
Like he just he just did illegally possess the firearm like it's not even a question

1495
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,040
But he just got off on the charge anyway

1496
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,080
Yeah, that seems weird. I feel like

1497
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,720
Like, uh, obviously they were pushing for guilty or nothing for to get him off

1498
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:39,480
But like sure I feel like if you are in possession of a gun or you're you're an owner of a gun

1499
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,040
You're in charge of this gun and this gun while in your possession

1500
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,920
You know

1501
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:52,440
You're kind of responsible for what it does you're responsible for what happens to some extent if it's a misfire

1502
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,560
Or it's an accident, but two people end up dead

1503
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:00,600
Or whatever. Yeah, I feel like at the very least there should be should be like

1504
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,960
A fine and like a removal of gun rights for a certain period of time

1505
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:13,400
Well, there's a very bare minimum something like that. Well the fact that nothing happens is a bit well the the um

1506
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,160
There will be the okay. I I am genuinely

1507
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
shocked and befuddled that like

1508
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:25,960
None of the charges stuck that I was pretty sure he would get off on the murder charges

1509
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,160
But I thought there was no way he was dodging, you know

1510
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:35,240
Illegal possession illegal open carry that kind of stuff, but he did somehow which is very weird

1511
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,160
um

1512
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,720
But uh, you know, none of the criminal charges stuck

1513
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:46,920
But like there's still civil suits to be filed like the family like the families of like the victims and uh other people are gonna

1514
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:53,400
Be like they're gonna be in court for like damages and stuff, right? So like it's not

1515
01:28:54,360 --> 01:29:00,440
Not it's not nothing is gonna happen. Nothing criminal is gonna happen. He's gonna have to deal with this for a long time, which is good

1516
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:08,360
But of course right-wing psychopaths will like pay all his bills for him and raise money for him to cover anything he gets sued for so

1517
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,240
uh, whatever

1518
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,240
Yeah, um

1519
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:19,800
Anyway, right so everything everything I was saying would probably happen with kyle did last week. So

1520
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,760
Uh funny funny shit

1521
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,360
Love it

1522
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:33,800
That's depressing that's pretty depressing. I guess that's just the the news there's not really much else I can think of

1523
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,400
funny funny funny funny thing, um

1524
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:44,440
Friend friend of the show spiral the guy who was compiling the n-word counter

1525
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,400
For the pcp he's going through every episode and keep in count for all everyone

1526
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:54,520
Uh, he he asked me to help him with a school assignment. It was very funny

1527
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,960
He I guess he had to like interview people about times things went wrong. This is how he described

1528
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,200
This is how he described the assignment to me

1529
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,240
So he asked me if he would he could ask me some questions and I was like sure

1530
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,920
So he did a voice call and he asked me about he asked me about like uh the falling out with trixie

1531
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,600
That was what he what he wanted to me to talk about

1532
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:20,920
So I I he asked me a bunch of stuff about that and I just gave him some sound bites about it. Uh

1533
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,560
I guess I just thought that was funny

1534
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:32,280
Um, it's something I'm always down to talk about um as I continue to see and cope with rage

1535
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Uh at all times

1536
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,080
Yes, about that. Yes

1537
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:41,320
Speaking of of of that then did you know that the streak?

1538
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,120
The streak was broken last episode

1539
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,280
A few people pointed it out. Yeah, I read a voicemail

1540
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:55,720
The title that had the n word in it the soft with the soft a though, but uh, yes, I know it's it's still

1541
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:02,440
It's still the n word. I I I do have that in in my head. I'm like, yeah, it's okay if it's the a but like

1542
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:08,040
Why is there a discrepancy? Why is there a difference in the first place? It's really just to get away with it

1543
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,640
There's no reason that's used. I said it

1544
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:18,120
I said it. I realized after I was like, oh jeez. I said it lull. Uh, I mean I was reading the voicemail

1545
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,240
Uh, I don't know. I've said it before

1546
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:30,200
Uh, I don't know. I'll just say it again. I'll just I don't know it it's it's not it's not I mean it's a dark day

1547
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,680
It's a dark day

1548
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:37,160
It's sad. Let's let's let's face facts. It's not the first time it's happened on this show

1549
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,640
Uh, oh well

1550
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,800

Uh, what can you do but say you're welcome?

1552
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,720
Let's say what can you do? What what can you do but pledge to patreon.com slash the procrastinators?

1553
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,960

1555

Don't censor me. Uh, don't tread on me. Uh

1558
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,680
Okay, that's it

1559
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,760

Zero it has been zero it has been zero episodes since the n-word was added

1566
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,800

1570
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,600

1571
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,320
Never seen it

1572
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,520
Give

1573
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,520
Digimon ghost game

1574
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,520
I know I hardly knew is that a new one. I've never heard of it

1575
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,240
digimon go

1576
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,880
Digimon ghost game

1577
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,720
Ninth anime series in the digimon franchise

1578
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:37,560
Uh, oh, oh, yeah, it's it's running right now. It's current. So I have no idea. I have no idea

1579
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,560
Is it like squid game but different?

1580
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,800
Yes

1581
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,800
Did you watch squid squid game?

1582
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:48,600
No, I've seen the some of the character designs and I was like, yeah, it looks pretty good

1583
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,280
Yeah, oh, I saw the why I saw yms's review of it

1584
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,520
He thought it was pretty good. I turned that off because I didn't want to be spoiled because I

1585
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,280
I didn't one of those

1586
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,400
I didn't care about one of those things that probably would like to know about

1587
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,960
Yeah, I was like, yeah, fuck it

1588
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:09,720
Okay, next one is called a question three two one go

1589
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,560
Hey Ben you talked about a book with a guy trying to write the perfect sentence

1590
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:20,920
If you remember the name of the book, I can be free of one of my brain worms also. Fuck Trixie

1591
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,320
yes

1592
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,320
uh easy actually

1593
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,520
I mentioned the book

1594
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:37,000
I would be should I could be a real shitter and say that the book in question is one that I mentioned on the last episode

1595
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,640
Uh

1596
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,520
But I won't do that. I won't make you go back and listen to it. Yeah, the book is the plague by camu

1597
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,720
It's not like a main plot point. It's just what it's just kind of a side

1598
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:54,280
Uh bit in in this sort of sort of a side story in that book

1599
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:59,560
The guy who wants to write the perfect sentence and what is he the one he comes up with like

1600
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,480
one

1601
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:07,720
One it's like one one fine. I mean this doesn't translate perfectly because the original book was in french. I think

1602
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,080
Like one fine day in may

1603
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,360
A lovely young woman

1604
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,560
Writing a black sorrel mare strolled down the boo de boo yon

1605
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,720
Something like that. And I don't know if I'm pronouncing that name correctly

1606
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,360
Um, it's the plague by camu

1607
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,800
Um, next one is called Alaskan weeb to gibb re kino's journey

1608
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,280
three two one go

1609
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,760
All right gib so for kino's journey, whether you want to finish it or not

1610
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:44,520
If you're looking for some sort of big payoff at at the end where it all comes together and goes full circle

1611
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,360
You're not going to get that neither the original version of kino's journey nor the

1612
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,880
2018 I want to say version of kino's journey

1613
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,160
Has some big payoff at the end. What are you what you're getting in the first three four episodes?

1614
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,840
That's what it keeps what it keeps being. It's good. I recommend it

1615
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,840
It's one of my favorites, but you're not going to get a massive payoff at the end

1616
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,680
So bear that in mind if you're just say deciding on whether to finish it or not

1617
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,880
wait

1618
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,880
They remade kino's journey in 2018

1619
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,360
I had no idea

1620
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:21,240
When I gul that I only found the like 2003 or whatever it whenever it was version

1621
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,600
I think it wikipedia says it was it started in 2000

1622
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,280
Yeah, um

1623
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,920
the first episode of kino's journey is like

1624
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:36,440
It's a backdrop of some sort of melancholic

1625
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,160
like

1626
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:42,600
Not really dystopia, but kind of dystopia-esque future

1627
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:45,960
And and this kid

1628
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,600
and a bike

1629
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:55,480
are driving around and they're having deep conversations about philosophy and humanity and

1630
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,960
I

1631
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:02,760
Yeah, if that's the entire show, I don't know whether I'd want to watch all of it because

1632
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:09,240
I feel like it's the sort of thing that I would have found deep if I was younger listening to them talk about it

1633
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:16,200
I'm like, yeah, I've thought about this stuff before that. This is like teenager. Shit. It's not exactly like low brown

1634
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,840
um, but it's

1635
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,600
It's

1636
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Not would you say it's not that interesting. Would you say it's I'm 14 and this is deep?

1637
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:30,840
I would say it's approaching that that's a bit of a that's a bit of a derogative way to put it

1638
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,400
Yeah, it's it's not that like dumb

1639
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,440
smart if you know what I mean is it's just sort of like

1640
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:40,600
Are they going to is this going to actually

1641
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,040
Interest me as an adult or is it the sort of thing?

1642
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,760
That is good when you're younger and you haven't thought about what if

1643
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,680
What about the the reason religion exists?

1644
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,920
Like I've thought of that

1645
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,880
That's old news. Yeah

1646
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,920
Yes, I

1647
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,280
I watched I think I mentioned that I watched a few episodes of it

1648
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:11,080
I must have seen the old version because yeah, there is a new version called kino's journey the beautiful world

1649
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,200
Uh, I didn't know they remade it. I guess they did

1650
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:21,000
Yeah, I watched some of the old one, but I never like finished it and I guess that's fine because I guess it doesn't really have like

1651
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,160
An ending so okay

1652
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:29,480
I'm gonna watch a few more episodes. Do you ever watch do you ever watch high bonnet renme?

1653
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,040
No, I've heard that name. What is it? It's another

1654
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:37,960
It reminds me of kino's journey and it's like in its tone

1655
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,640
It's another one that I kind of think doesn't really

1656
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,480
Have much of I mean it has a story and it has some lore

1657
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:51,560
It's about these like girls in like a village, but like the girl they grow

1658
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,680
Like wings they grow like wings and halos

1659
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,800
And it's just like

1660
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,560
I don't even remember

1661
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,800
They're just kind of like living they're just kind of like living in this little commune village

1662
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,040
and just hanging out

1663
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:10,760
And they just go through this weird like oh sometimes we grow wings and halos

1664
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:14,360
But it's fine and we're just uh

1665
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:22,440
I think it might be some kind of like oh some of us are actually like dead and we got to like deal with like

1666
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,720
The trauma of like our life. I genuinely don't remember whether the twist is like they were dead all along or not

1667
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,000
I genuinely don't remember if that twist ever comes

1668
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:36,680
Uh, I remember thinking it was probably coming

1669
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,600
um

1670
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:42,680
But it's like you know, and then it's just kind of a sort of meandering sort of

1671
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,160
calm

1672
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,840
Sort of like let's just kind of talk about life man sort of anime

1673
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:52,440
Yeah, yeah with a with a muted color palette

1674
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,160
That's a weed smoking show

1675
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,560
That's a calm weed smoking show. Maybe yeah, maybe a weed smoking show

1676
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,400
Uh

1677
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:04,280
High bonnet ran me is a bit somber for weed smoking

1678
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:09,720
Well, I don't know I haven't seen it but like you know, it's journey. I feel like is yeah

1679
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:14,840
Perhaps perhaps smoking weed and driving no motorbike

1680
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,680
What more could you ask for?

1681
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,360
um

1682
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:28,600
Next next voicemail is not a voicemail. It's just a question. Do you enjoy making pcp content?

1683
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,320
um

1684
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,320
I mean the only the only real

1685
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,720
Content we make now would be the podcast and yeah, I enjoy recording the podcast

1686
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,200
I enjoy it being a thing

1687
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:46,600
It's like ben sain and I like talking up to ben sain and it's like that's easy

1688
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,840
I like talking to you too give

1689
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:53,320
If I if I didn't I probably wouldn't still be doing it

1690
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,080
um

1691
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:59,160
If you mean okay in terms of I guess the radcon stuff is

1692
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,320
Still is pcp content which I have been you know having get made for a while I

1693
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,480
I

1694
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,520
I feel a certain sense of

1695
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,280
I feel a sort of uh

1696
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,720
Yeah, I think I do even though you might think oh my god

1697
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:23,480
It's been like a year and a half almost two years since this fucking radcon thing happened and I'm still working on it

1698
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,560
It doesn't bother me

1699
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,720
I just feel a sense of like anticipation of like boy. I can't wait

1700
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:33,800
I can't wait until it's done and everything's done and I can look back and I say

1701
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,240
Yeah, it took me two years, but I did it. We did it

1702
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:44,200
Uh, uh, uh, uh, fuck fuck everyone that said we weren't gonna do it. I did everything

1703
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:50,920
Um, every everything that I had everything that had to be finished was and I know that that day is coming

1704
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,480
and uh, it makes me

1705
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:59,480
Happy so it's not yeah, I guess I do enjoy it in that I enjoy in sort of the sense of a job well done

1706
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,680
Not in terms of like, oh, this is fun. I'm having fun right now

1707
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,880
Um, because I mean most of that stuff is yeah

1708
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:13,400
Like um, the fact that it isn't done. I am not enjoying. Um, but like yeah same as

1709
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,720
Getting it done is not like something I dislike

1710
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:21,000
It's just a lot of work. Hey having it not

1711
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,600
Done is a is a source of unenjoyment

1712
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:30,760
And I would consider I would consider the removal of unenjoyment to be a form of enjoyment

1713
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,920
Which I will derive from

1714
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,160
the completion of

1715
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:37,160
Radcon

1716
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,280
Yes, and even just in general like pcp content

1717
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,760
is

1718
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,960
largely

1719
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,800
fun

1720
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,200
And not really work because if it was

1721
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,080
Then we would have tried harder to like push the algorithm and do things more

1722
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,760
And all of us knew like at any point

1723
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:01,320
We're just like just making things that we kind of were interested in

1724
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,960
Damn the algorithm damn large success

1725
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:10,840
Yeah, there came a point there came a point where I think we all kind of were just like

1726
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,360
There's not like

1727
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,360
The pcp is not meant to

1728
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,160
Be like an algorithm appealing

1729
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:25,400
Yeah thing. This is not designed to you know catch catch fire and go viral, right?

1730
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,360
Uh, yeah

1731
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,520
Uh next

1732
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,560
Let's do it. I'll do it out of love. We do it out of love

1733
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,760
I do it for you the viewer because I love you

1734
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,960
Yes

1735
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:44,040
The next voicemail is janes three two one go

1736
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,200
Ben saying you mentioned the golden girls a couple of times throughout the pcp

1737
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:57,480
And it reminded me of this youtube video called golden girls buys a dangin rompa class trial

1738
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:03,080
I think it's the most that any zoomers on the internet would have watched of the show

1739
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:07,560
But I am curious how you came across the golden girls

1740
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,360
Because I don't imagine you as the type of person to ever watch a sitcom

1741
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,160
golden girls

1742
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,600
buys a

1743
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:21,800
Golden girls buys a high bump not high bonnet rend me a dangin rompa trial. That sounds really funny

1744
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,960
um

1745
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,080
I

1746
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,680
That's funny that you think i'm not a sitcom. I mean I did watch sitcoms as a

1747
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:35,720
Kid. I mean the simpsons is is a sitcom. I watched so much of that. You know, I watched seinfeld

1748
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,440
uh, I watched uh

1749
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,400
You watched a fresh principale

1750
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,360
A little bit a little bit

1751
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,560
That was my main one aside from simpsons. I guess

1752
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:55,080
Uh, I mean I I mean when I was a kid kid. I watched, you know, I would watch like full house and and uh

1753
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,840
Step by step

1754
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,080
Wait, is that a is that a show step by step, right?

1755
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:09,880
I don't know family, you know family matters. I was an I was an urkel fan. I guess for a while

1756
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:14,360
Um, I remember one called my wife and kids

1757
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,760
I've never heard of that one

1758
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,080
It's yeah, it was more modern

1759
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,520
Then but like 10 years ago. Uh, yeah

1760
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:29,240
The hell when when was that step by step is a sitcom um, but I

1761
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:36,840
But I did not watch golden girls as a kid. No, uh, the the the answer to that question is that my my uh,

1762
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:41,480
My ex-girlfriend was a big fan and she got me to uh

1763
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:44,600
She got me to watch the the entire series with her

1764
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,640
Uh, and uh, you know what? I don't even regret it because I mostly enjoyed it. I thought it was a pretty pretty good series

1765
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:56,200
Uh, had some had some memorable moments that I continue to

1766
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Bring up in conversation

1767
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:04,040
Uh to this day mostly the the one about uh, uh dorothy

1768
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:10,200
Having the like the chronic fatigue disorder and not being able to find a doctor that would like, uh

1769
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,920
That would diagnose her

1770
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,920
That one really stuck with me

1771
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Uh

1772
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,040
I don't know that's a pretty good show

1773
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:23,640
I don't know if I would recommend watching the whole fucking series. I don't know if it's worth that

1774
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:26,280
That's pretty enjoyable for what it is

1775
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:30,600
Uh, rose and rose is rose's best girl, of course

1776
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Blanche's worst girl obviously

1777
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:41,480
Do they wear my my my ex like blanche so so, you know, that's why I got a pick first girl. Fuck. Fuck blanche

1778
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,920
Yeah, well

1779
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:48,600
Blanche blanche is the worst though blanche is very obnoxious

1780
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:55,800
But I mean obviously like that's on purpose right she's supposed to be kind of a snooty

1781
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,680
snooty southern bell rich girl

1782
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,840
Oh, now I want to watch it. Oh really?

1783
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:09,960
I love snooty rich girls in media. That's my favorite. Uh, I don't know if you would like

1784
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,160
You know what golden girls is about right?

1785
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:19,880
Uh old women. Yes. Okay. As long as you as long as you realize that these are old women we're talking about

1786
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,960
Well, uh, you know

1787
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,920
I

1788
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,800
Risk is gonna get old one day. She's gonna be in a home

1789
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:39,320
I mean, yeah, I honestly give it a shot. Give it a shot. You might like golden girls. I did

1790
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:46,440
Yeah, I I it's hard to imagine that it would be good because I I always thought of it as like

1791
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,600
Because they're old

1792
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,960
characters

1793
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,520
The show must be very old and therefore bad

1794
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,680
It's like it's before it's before jokes and were invented

1795
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:04,280
But no, believe it or not believe it or not the show like the just the older the characters are the older the show is

1796
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:12,680
Just like that's that's my head just goes to 100 years ago everybody who acted in on tv was like ancient

1797
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,680
It was like a hundred years old

1798
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:19,400
It was like a prestigious position. You had to work your way up before you could act

1799
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,800
Uh

1800
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,800
Minimum of 80

1801
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:30,840
You would you would you would probably like rose but for me rose is best girl and I I feel I feel like that's pretty

1802
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:38,360
Commenters, let me know in the comments if rose is best girl or if you who's who's best girl, right?

1803
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,320
Rose is like the funny one rose is like the pinky pie

1804
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:48,600
Uh, what about fucking garenet? What about no the worst golden girl?

1805
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,560
um

1806
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,880
Wait gold's not even a gold's not even a jewel gold's not even a jam

1807
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:02,440
New new show but the girls are made of minerals golden girl. It's she's

1808
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:06,040
She's made of molten metal

1809
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,160
There's there's fools golden girl

1810
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,920
That's blanche for sure

1811
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,880
Uh

1812
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:19,320
Yes, so that's the story of why I watched golden girls

1813
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:25,640
Uh, next one is called a keyblade spirit. She hurt three two one go

1814
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,240
Holy fucking shit

1815
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:36,200
Oh my fucking god get to the point. I'm a fucking girl

1816
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,600
anyway

1817
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:44,200
I'm establishing the consortium of gibhuggers to combat the nate fuckers

1818
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,600
I uh

1819
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,600
I hope you don't join

1820
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,840
Bye

1821
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,520
Did we

1822
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:56,520
I feel like we didn't comment. Yeah, it was this week that nate released a video

1823
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:03,480
Tempting many off the path of righteousness and causing them to fail no nate november. Oh, that's true

1824
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:08,760
Yeah, I I hadn't gotten around to it and then people mentioned that and I was like, oh, that's true

1825
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,840
I've got a whole true to my roots to my

1826
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:19,400
To my cause the delta rune video. I would I would describe the delta rune video as the 9 11 of no nate november

1827
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,840
Uh, it was just catastrophic

1828
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:30,040
I did not watch the video because I do not want delta rune spoilers because i'm still going to play uh

1829
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,920
Part two at some point

1830
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:37,000
I haven't gotten around to it, but it definitely will happen first phantom's revenge or delta rune

1831
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:43,720
Genuinely, I might finish phantom's revenge first because like I why would I play another video game when I should be making one?

1832
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:47,560
I actually that's might actually be what happens

1833
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,280
um

1834
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:55,800
I guess I approve of the gib the consortium of gibhuggers gibhuggers. It's pretty good

1835
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,960
It's pretty good

1836
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,680
Which is better is is a consortium better than a league?

1837
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,040
uh, well

1838
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:07,000
I wonder what the the etymology of those are consortium

1839
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:14,680
Is like everyone's consorting together. Yeah, I feel like a consortium is just a bunch of people that's like a military thing or like a

1840
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:17,160
A measurement of distance

1841
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:23,560
Lee league really used as a military thing league really feels like it's a group of people that have gotten together to do something

1842
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:27,480
Consortium feels like it's a bunch of people that have gotten together to talk about something

1843
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:31,080
So maybe the hugging of gibb is gonna make remain mostly theoretical

1844
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:35,800
They're just gonna talk about the heart of gibhuggers. Think about what if they did

1845
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,600
battalion

1846
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,600
uh

1847
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,600
The battalion the legion

1848
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,080
I like le I like legion it kind of sounds like league but more violent

1849
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,080
Yes, like roam roam roam like roam

1850
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:59,640
Next next voicemail is not a voicemail. It is an image. So here here it is. Let's see what we got

1851
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:03,080
uh

1852
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,600
Okay

1853
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,880
What is

1854
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,880
So we so we've got

1855
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:10,760
We've got a whole all right, so ben saint in the middle here

1856
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:17,000
Can I just have just had a little phone session with my dad about the rise of american fascism? I feel better

1857
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:22,920
Maybe it'll be okay. Oh, I see vermark performing nazi salute. I don't know why i'm connected to that

1858
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:28,040
But okay, this is a dab the so-called dad. Oh the so-called dab. Oh

1859
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:37,800
Okay, these that string should go from me to the dab to the vermark salute. Okay. That's fucked up slime corp israeli flag

1860
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,640
Jew jewies. Oh, not jew. Oh, okay. This is a

1861
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,840
nuzla nuzla conquest of a hat looks like a nazi hat. Oh

1862
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,720
destroy israel

1863
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,960
No

1864
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:56,600
Damn this makes me really got gut. This makes me rethink everything

1865
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:05,960
It's just it's all true. I like I like it's all I guess I mean, it's all it's all right here in black and white

1866
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,320
I like that he used the picture. Maybe that's the best

1867
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,920
Picture of me dabbing is me at the the rfck lecture

1868
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:18,680
It's a pretty it's a pretty good picture of me dabbing. That's really great. I love that. I'm in like the dark hood

1869
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:23,320
Uh, I love this I approve of this 100% and

1870
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:30,280
You know what? I just said the n word too. So it all it all comes together lamel. Oh god, ben

1871
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,580
It's bad. I'm gonna have to put you down. I'm backsliding

1872
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,200
Next next image is uh another image. Here we go

1873
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
Oh

1874
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,800
Geez

1875
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:49,160
Oh geez rick. It's true. It's true. It's ben saint going. Uh, what was I talking about?

1876
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:52,760
I say it all the time on the hit podcast the procrastinators

1877
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:53,800
Was I

1878
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:59,240
Did I was it before we started recording today that I mentioned to you that I was listening back to last episode and I was

1879
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:05,320
A bit disgusted with how much I go uh and uh and pause and that was before the episode started

1880
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:12,280
I was I was noticing it really bad last episode. I've been trying to not do it as much this and repeating myself

1881
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
starting a sentence with uh

1882
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,840
And then a pause and then

1883
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:21,720
Start the sentence. Oh, so I realized uh, okay. So I realized that what I all right

1884
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:28,680
So I think I realized and repeat the start three two or three times while I like think of what I'm actually going to say

1885
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,520
In the sentence. It's a bit of a cheat that I

1886
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:37,000
Uh uses a crutch. I think sometimes

1887
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:44,760
Anyway, stay quiet. Actually. No, that's not true. I also do a bit of like

1888
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:46,920
um, yeah

1889
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,960
Well, I what I do is I I'm doing it right now

1890
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,760
So I don't exactly know where I'm going

1891
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:56,200
but I leave long ish pauses for me to

1892
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,240
Find the words that I need to use

1893
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,640
Yes, yes

1894
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:05,640
It was weird thinking about that as I was saying it and I'm doing it

1895
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,040
Um

1896
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,240
Okay

1897
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:21,080
Next voicemail is called paying people to unsub Trixie

1898
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,720
three two one go

1899
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,760
Ben, how dare you

1900
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:32,360
affect Trixie's livelihood like affecting someone economically is just going too far

1901
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,120
Absolutely. You're just like the union during the civil war

1902
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,640
Don't you know plantation owners needed slaves

1903
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,960
And then the union economically affected them. That's you

1904
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,000
You're radical abolitionist ben saint

1905
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:55,800
Uh, not a good look. Um, we've got to abolish Trixie's patreon. Uh, yes, I would like in Trixie two-way and antebellum

1906
01:55:56,440 --> 01:56:01,160
Slave-owning cotton plantation owner. Yes, I would agree with that comparison

1907
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,880
I wouldn't because there's no way she would be able to organize such a thing

1908
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:09,640
Hey, oh, she couldn't afford it. Ha ha because she's poor

1909
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,760
Whoo, yeah

1910
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:15,720
Um, also she doesn't also she doesn't want to be white

1911
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:21,720
So she doesn't she she doesn't like being white. She she wishes she could become a trans

1912
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:25,240
A trans racial individual. She wishes society was ready for that

1913
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,400
So that's a little different too. So it's not a it's not a one-to-one comparison

1914
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,200
But uh, you know

1915
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
It's a metaphor

1916
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:38,200
Was it uh, was it this week that Trixie made that

1917
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:43,720
That's that's substack post about being a bitch online. Was that this week?

1918
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:47,500
I don't remember. Hold on. I gotta check twitter

1919
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,960
There's something about um, I

1920
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,920
Trixie I'm going to be positive

1921
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:01,720
It was like some something of a oh, no, it was it was this week. It was the 15th. Yes. Oh

1922
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:06,120
Yeah, it was something of a uh, a walking back of how she treated me

1923
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:12,920
Uh after after she saw someone else. It wasn't really though. It wasn't really though. Well, yeah, I was getting to that

1924
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,600
it was just like

1925
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,000
an attempt was made but like

1926
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:20,600
It really wasn't like I'm going to

1927
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:24,520
Make amends. I'm going to not be a bad person. It's oh, no

1928
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,400
Being a bad person is bad for me

1929
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,560
economically

1930
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:34,760
Um, so I will just not do that anymore. It's not about it's not about caring that she hurt

1931
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:42,040
People or myself or whatever. It's just that the repercussions. It's yeah, uh, we're bad and that sucks for her

1932
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:48,360
She's she's literally in in in so many words. She's just saying uh, I got owned

1933
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:51,720
I should probably not do that or I'll get owned again

1934
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:53,480
Yeah

1935
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:55,480
in in this this article really annoys me

1936
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:57,640
because

1937
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,480
what it says

1938
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:01,480
This is okay. She she's

1939
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:07,320
She's adopted. She started to adopt this whole like like positivity thing. She's like no, I'm I'm different now

1940
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:13,160
I'm I'm like I've left all the hate like I've left all the hate out of my heart now. I'm only positive

1941
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,320
I only I only like things right

1942
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,120
Um, and she's and then this started she says I'm not I'm over. I'm done with being a bitch

1943
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,200
I'm not going to be mean anymore being mean

1944
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:26,520
Is bad being nice is good, right? And this is in

1945
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:32,280
Not not as an apology but sort of as a response to yeah to the who are these podcasts

1946
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,280
appearance

1947
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:39,560
And to that and it's very it rings completely hollow for many reasons

1948
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:44,200
But the thing that galls me the most about it is that yeah, it's it's adopting this stance of like

1949
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:49,640
I'm no longer going to be mean. I'm being nice now. I'm above I'm above being I'm above petty

1950
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:55,160
arguments and and spite and and and uh drama and bile, right?

1951
01:58:55,640 --> 01:59:00,040
But this comes as a response to her doing something aggressive

1952
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,440
and getting

1953
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:07,560
Owned for it getting backlash. It totally fell on its face and failed. This is literally just

1954
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:10,760
She's posturing now like she's like she isn't

1955
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:17,400
Gonna attack anyone but like she did she literally she attacked us. She came after us. She tried

1956
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,600
To hurt us with the what the who are these podcasts?

1957
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:26,360
She wanted us to get made fun of us to get a backlash people to say hey, these guys suck. I hate them

1958
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,040
Uh, it failed

1959
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,440
But that's what she was trying to do. She was trying to hurt us

1960
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:35,320
And it's only because the attempt failed that now she she'll walk it back and be like

1961
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:39,160
I'm not about I'm not about attacking anyone. No, no, I'm actually not

1962
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,680
Like that at all. I don't do that kind of thing. I'm I'm only nice

1963
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,400
Right. It's like the way she

1964
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:49,560
After her after after her attack fails. It's so easy to be like

1965
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:56,760
Attacking's lame. Actually, you know what being aggressive being the aggressor. That's cringe actually. I'm not um

1966
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:59,080
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna let things roll

1967
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:03,480
Yeah, the way after you try and you fail because you're too weak and nobody cares what you think

1968
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,120
the way it reads is is definitely like

1969
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,760
Not from the perspective of someone like say for example, it worked and she didn't get backlash for it. Yeah

1970
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,640
I don't think she would come to the same conclusion because the way it reads is like

1971
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,080
It's it's like bad for me

1972
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,640
To be a bitch online

1973
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:25,640
Because it comes back to bite me

1974
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:29,000
It's not that I feel I feel bad about what I did

1975
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,800
It's just I guess I shouldn't do it again

1976
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:38,280
She says I don't think the results of operating that way have been positive for me. I e I got owned

1977
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,680
I got corn cobbed

1978
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:43,240
Uh

1979
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,560
Yeah, I mean it's it's

1980
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:47,480
We'll see we'll see

1981
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:52,520
Whether she actually stays with that. I don't I mean I I know I know that it's just completely hollow

1982
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:57,560
And if she ever and if she ever feels like an opera if she ever senses an opportunity

1983
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:03,400
To attack us and hurt us she'll do it. Of course. This is all total empty posturing

1984
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:05,880
Just hot air. Yeah, right

1985
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:07,160
um

1986
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:09,880
But but she can't but she can't because she's weak

1987
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:14,520
She's weak and she can't do anything about us. Uh, she wishes she could

1988
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:19,320
But she can't so this is this is the next best thing to pretend that she doesn't want to anymore

1989
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,880
Uh, oh well

1990
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,880
That's life. I guess

1991
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:24,840
um

1992
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:26,840
Next voicemail is called what?

1993
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:29,560
three two one go

1994
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:33,720
All right guys who what win where why of retcon?

1995
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:37,800
What's gonna happen at the next retcon? What are you gonna do?

1996
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:41,000
Everybody ask this there's not much more to what

1997
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,440
What you I don't know

1998
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:50,200
Shut up shut up. No, I don't know. I don't know the answer to this question

1999
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:54,440
We haven't thought about it. We're gonna play pikmin 2

2000
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:00,040
Like any given thing could happen when you

2001
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:06,120
Give when you when you come to visit in january will that be radcon 4.5?

2002
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:07,720
I

2003
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:11,560
Don't want to record anything. I just want to hang out. So well, we didn't record well

2004
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:15,240
We didn't record anything at 3.5 either or no, we sort of did

2005
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:19,720
Well a little bit we sort of did there was new goal. There was new goal remember that

2006
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:25,240
um, but like uh, that was a beating uh, like

2007
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:28,280
Uh, the the point of that right hit around

2008
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:35,320
Around organizing pcphq or something. I don't fucking remember not not even it wasn't like a big

2009
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:39,560
Not even pcphq. It was just about like whether nate should move to virginia

2010
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,920
Yeah, and it was just like oh everyone's meeting i'll fly over

2011
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:46,600
Yeah, because it was fun because I like my friends

2012
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,560
It was fun me and munchie were talking about this a little while ago and like radcon 4 3.5 was like the stupidest and like most

2013
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,080
pointless

2014
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,080
thing of all time

2015
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:02,760
And like practically speaking like there was absolutely no reason for you to come and be there for it

2016
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:05,960
But like we're still glad you did because it ended up being fun

2017
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,600
in spite of the fact that like

2018
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:12,200
The reason for it was so asinine

2019
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:16,600
Uh, there was no need for nate to

2020
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:22,120
Get together with trixie and like hang out literally your house just to talk about

2021
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,080
this

2022
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:29,320
Was it literally like they couldn't organize getting into a call together

2023
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,760
On discord. I mean you would think they could just do a call together. You would think that would be I think that was it

2024
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:38,520
I think it was that they were always on a different sleeping time or like

2025
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Trixie was hard to get in touch with for a call and nate was like, I guess I can't

2026
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,880
Is it I guess I'm just gonna have to go there physically and talk to them

2027
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:51,480
Is it just that trixie was like so unreliable that nate was like fuck it. I'll just go there in person

2028
02:03:51,720 --> 02:04:00,120
I vaguely remember that being much of the reason. Yes. That seems impossible even trixie even for trixie. That seems unbelievable

2029
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,880
I mean, I know she was always very hard to get a hold of

2030
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,640
But wow

2031
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:09,880
Wow, okay

2032
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,440
Yeah, well, obviously there was like

2033
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:16,280
They were gonna look at places nate and michelle. Yeah

2034
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:20,520
But they didn't so there was a reason to go there, but they didn't what was it?

2035
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,720
Whatever. I don't think I don't think they did

2036
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,240
But no no no because um

2037
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:33,240
Because they weren't talking about moving to boston because that was in boston or brain tree

2038
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:38,120
Yeah, so so they couldn't have been going house hunting for virginia houses

2039
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:44,360
Yeah, so it was all yeah, it was all theoretical. They they got together in person to talk about

2040
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:49,240
Should we move somewhere else so it couldn't have been about like scouting out the location

2041
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:53,880
Yeah, they literally could have just had a fucking voice call about it and gotten like the exact same amount figured out

2042
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,520
I think I think we all decided this

2043
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:59,080
Nevertheless, it was fun to hang out and you know

2044
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:03,960
All the other stuff was was cool and we it ended up being a good time

2045
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:07,880
But like yeah, the reasoning behind it was so goofy

2046
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,040
Uh

2047
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:16,920
Yeah, I that's where I got my iam games shirt that I still had I lost mine. I don't know where my iam game shirt is

2048
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:21,960
Uh, you're not games anymore. I'm not games. I'm not games

2049
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:31,560
When you when you make a game do you stop being games? I think we think you become even more games

2050
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:34,840
Uh

2051
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:36,840
Nobody knows

2052
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,680
Well, at least you'll be able to get a saberspark 64 t-shirt

2053
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:46,920
To replace it god. I hope so god. Can I just can I just say fucking hate listening to saberspark?

2054
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:50,680
He sounds so annoying. He's so obnoxious

2055
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:54,280
His voice

2056
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:02,360
He doesn't sound like a human being he doesn't inflect like a normal person

2057
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:08,600
I don't have like a youtuber voice but like extreme. Yes. Yes. He has this bizarre like

2058
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:11,560
It's like he's trying to do like a radio announcer

2059
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:15,880
But like he doesn't know how and it just comes off like the most stilted and like artificial thing

2060
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:21,480
Uh, I've met him in person and he sounds normal. It's kind of the same

2061
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:25,960
As with uh with with I love Kim possible a lot. I love Kim possible a lot

2062
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:32,280
Legitimately sounds like she has a speech impediment in her music music in her in her videos

2063
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,080
And she talks really fast and she yells a lot and she takes forever to say nothing

2064
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:42,360
And she sounds like she's got a speech impediment in person. She doesn't in person. She sounds like normal

2065
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:45,320
And I don't know why why do they do this?

2066
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:51,960
That I notice the thing about myself when I would record like voiceovers for hypocrite or whatever

2067
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:59,240
Talking off the cuff in a podcast or with a person is very different from reading and speaking

2068
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:03,880
So I would put on a voice unintentionally because I'm trying to like

2069
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:09,160
I don't know. I'm not even really know why I'm changing my voice, but it just happens

2070
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:13,800
And I feel like unless you notice that you just do it forever

2071
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:15,640
Yeah

2072
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:17,640
maybe uh

2073
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:21,400
You know you might yeah, maybe I'm maybe I'm throwing stones

2074
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:27,160
Maybe I'm in the glass house here throwing stones because like maybe if I read more scripted content, I would sound weird as well

2075
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:29,720
I mean

2076
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:33,160
Did you script your Winnie the Pooh videos? No

2077
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:40,520
Okay, so it wouldn't feel different. I hardly script. I hardly ever script anything. I didn't script um

2078
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:44,280
Yeah, with the with the Winnie the Pooh videos and with tbap too

2079
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:49,320
I would just go in with notes and I would just go in with like points to hit that's a convo. So

2080
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,200
It's a little different. Yeah

2081
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:57,720
It's sometimes there would be it's impossible to have a full script for a conversation between two people

2082
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:01,400
True, but sometimes there would be there would be bits that we would think of that

2083
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:05,640
We would want to deliver and we would make a note of like, okay at this point, you know

2084
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:11,320
Make make a joke about make this joke, right? But they wouldn't be like written out and scripted

2085
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:14,040
They would be just like a little note that I would take a cue from

2086
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:17,080
Uh, yeah

2087
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:18,920
Uh, that's right

2088
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:20,920
So maybe I'm

2089
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,160
Don't have any actual

2090
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:27,560
Bases to criticize. Maybe I would be just as bad. I don't know. Maybe if you did that audiobook

2091
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:33,160
You'd you'd you'd find god fucking oh lillia. I fucking hate him

2092
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:38,760
Just fucking let me let me make you some free money idiot you fucking moron die

2093
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:47,480
Law he stole it from me. I was gonna be the guy, but he just doesn't care

2094
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:50,760
Ah

2095
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:56,200
Next voicemail is called nnn week three three two one go

2096
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:02,760
Hey, nonators. We're going three weeks strong now. We only got a bit left to go. I'm on the road this week

2097
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:06,920
So this will be a short voicemail as always. No, Nate. Yes watch

2098
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:16,520
Well, I hope uh, I hope we all remembered I hope we all kept our cool and and kept our our uh, self control

2099

2100
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000

02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,680
Okay

2102
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:30,680
And if you didn't stay strong

2103
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,320
Next one is a uh paste bin

2104
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:36,440
Link

2105
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:38,520
Yes, oh text. Okay

2106
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:43,480
Do you think mainland china is or will become the most powerful nation on earth?

2107
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:49,240
If so, what are the consequences if you don't consider yourself sufficiently informed on the matter just ignore this

2108
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:54,520
Well, good news. I do not consider myself sufficiently informed on the matter. So

2109
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:58,280
I'm not

2110
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:00,280
sufficiently informed on the matter, but I have

2111
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,520
watched a few videos of by this guy who used to live in china

2112
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:08,840
Okay, and he has opinions about how china loves to

2113
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:15,640
Like emit the air of them being a growing superpower that's going to become the most powerful

2114
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:18,760
Nation in the world. Yes, and in reality

2115
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:24,360
They're they're kind of it's kind of a front. They're not really doing as well as they'd like people to think they're not

2116
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:26,440
They're not as powerful as they

2117
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,960
pretend to be

2118
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,960
Yeah, because they used to be more

2119
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,720
like

2120
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:34,040
lifting everyone up, but now they're more

2121
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,960
Or

2122
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,520
He had to leave china. He was having a really good life in china. I can't remember the name this youtuber

2123
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:44,920
Um, he was having like a real good life in china working and living and and all that

2124
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,280
And he had loads of friends and he spoke chinese fluently and it was like there for years and then slowly

2125
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:52,920
like

2126
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,920
something in government changed and

2127
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:58,360
It was just sort of becoming worse and worse for a lot of people

2128
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,320
And at the same time they were becoming more

2129
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,800
There was more like nationalistic pride

2130
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,880
um, and

2131
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:06,680
like

2132
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:14,120
Oh americans are the reason for all your problems. And so it's it's all it's it's muddy and not like

2133
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:17,160
Not what you would expect given

2134
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:22,520
Vague notions of china being like a looming threat that's going to take over the world from american

2135
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,400
Or other western media. I saw a tweet this week

2136
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:32,840
Someone was making fun of and then they posted four screenshots of headlines

2137
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:40,360
That all claimed to be claiming that like, oh china is china's momentum is slowing down

2138
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:43,800
You know china is stalling out china is not as powerful

2139
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:48,120
It's not it's not, you know, gonna keep growing and growing forever like they claim

2140
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:52,360
But I guess the idea was that people have been saying that for like a long time

2141
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:56,120
Like people been saying that for years and they keep having to say it. I was like, no, no, no

2142
02:11:56,280 --> 02:12:00,040
It's kept growing but like now it's stalling like now it's stalling. Well, yeah

2143
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:06,600
I mean, I don't know whether this one youtuber has all the information. Yeah, I just know that he did live there and he's

2144
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:13,000
For years. I'm like, I guess he has more of an understanding than I do. So yeah, whatever

2145
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,880
I just I just don't know

2146
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:23,640
I have no I have no insight into this whatsoever. I believe that I can take over china single-handedly

2147
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:27,400
All I need is a butter knife and

2148
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:30,360
15 minutes, you know

2149
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,920
Wait, I gotta check

2150
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,160
Gotta check bitcoin

2151
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:37,160
No, you don't this makes me want to check bitcoin

2152
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:44,200
No, you don't no doesn't bitcoin dropped a bit this past week. It may be bound rebounding

2153
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,520
But you hopefully Ben are not gonna rebound and buy into it

2154
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:57,560
Listen ice I have said that if I thought bitcoin was going to the moon

2155
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:00,120
I would buy it. Yeah. Yeah

2156
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:04,280
It's only a question of do I think that is going to happen and I genuinely don't know

2157
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:07,320
Uh, it's just

2158
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:15,400
It could it it's it's at a position where I think it could make another big leap

2159
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,200
But it could also likely

2160
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:22,280
I think it's more likely that it will continue to grow slowly for a very long time

2161
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:29,240
And crash in the in the future at some point. I think I don't think it's going to like zoom up, but

2162
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,840
Why do I think I know anything? Yeah

2163
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:35,160
I mean true

2164
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,160
I mean true

2165
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:40,120
Well, okay, never mind never mind about that. Um

2166
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,960
Next voicemail is uh may mayday

2167
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:46,760
Dishane desk chain

2168
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:49,640
three two one go

2169
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,240
Okay

2170
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:56,840
First time voicemail a long time. Listen. Oh, what up? My name is may mayday. Dishane

2171
02:13:57,560 --> 02:14:03,400
Uh fellow trans woman. What's up? Give love you big inspiration. Anyway, um

2172
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:06,120
I'm actually just here to talk shit about Trixie

2173
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:08,600
A trans person that I don't respect

2174
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:16,920
Okay, yeah, that fucking appearance of one of these podcasts is like, oh dear. Oh my as a fellow trans woman who, um

2175
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,720
finds it really

2176
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:26,840
Difficult to do a fan voice because I'm afraid of coming across like this is what a man thinks a woman sounds like so I see

2177
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,720
um

2178
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,720
Yeah, it's a big ouch

2179
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,440
Like, okay, fine. Um

2180
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:41,640
Also while I'm at it their scripts have never been good and I don't understand why people are going on about how like

2181
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:47,080
Oh, they're they've really fallen. They've really dipped. They've really dropped their scripts. I mean, who are these podcasts?

2182
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:53,080
Incredibly lazy and rush. Who and who's like they've needed at least two more drops

2183
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:55,960
I

2184
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,960
People really underestimate how

2185
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,000
Much DeVoo really did to make those videos watchable back in the day. Oh

2186
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:10,200
It's really painful. It's real. I don't know either of you have

2187
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,920
bothered watching any of the anime outfit

2188
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:15,800
videos, but not yeah

2189
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:18,520
The scripts need a lot of polishing

2190
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:26,920
Um, I have not watched like an entire video. I've seen little bits and pieces here and there and my my impression is that they

2191
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:31,000
lean pretty heavily on just kind of recapping

2192
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:33,640
the events of the of the

2193
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:35,720
anime

2194
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:37,480
Which is whatever

2195
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:39,480
and uh, yeah, I've heard that uh

2196
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:46,120
DeVoo, well, I've heard a lot of people say that like DeVoo was the reason the videos were good back in the day

2197
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:50,920
Uh, but I don't know. I haven't watched the new one. So I don't really have any

2198
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,720
strong opinion on what they're like myself

2199
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:59,400
I don't know gave you anything to add. I've uh, I listened I watched the first

2200
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:02,280
Up to the Digimon one I think

2201
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:04,840
um

2202
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:06,040
and

2203
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:10,280
The first world was bad. It was just a recap of the show the other ones were sort of

2204
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:17,960
Had more to about like the the the external like nature of the show where when it came out and stuff

2205
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:19,560
I feel like

2206
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,720
talking about the idea that Trixie's

2207
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:25,080
Scripts for anime videos were always bad

2208
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:27,640
It may be true

2209
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:29,640
In it in the sense that the only reason

2210
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:35,080
I believed a lot of what she said was because I didn't know anything about anime and I just assumed

2211
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:37,400
The things she was

2212
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,640
positing or throwing out there were like

2213
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:42,440
informed and smart and whatever

2214
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:46,680
But I don't know whether I can make that judgment exactly because I haven't done

2215
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:52,680
My own anime research and then gone back and listened to those videos to figure out whether or not they were smart or

2216
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:57,880
Like surface level on the I mean on the subject of like anime knowledge

2217
02:16:58,280 --> 02:16:58,920
I don't have yeah

2218
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:03,160
I don't have any room to criticize it because like I don't know that much about it

2219
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:07,640
And so I can't say like oh, she did or did not know what she was

2220
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:09,720
talking about

2221
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:11,720
in terms of like

2222
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,440
In in terms of like other

2223
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:17,480
Aspects that she might have talked about in her

2224
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:23,560
So much in her anime videos been like her other stuff again her after dark stuff in like her vlog content and stuff

2225
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:24,920
I know

2226
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:30,200
That I definitely feel at this point that like there may have been a time that I might have like

2227
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:33,480
I might have respected her opinion about stuff

2228
02:17:33,480 --> 02:17:39,080
But I have come to understand that I just don't think she is smart or knows what she's talking about or or like

2229
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:47,000
Has much of value to say and I don't and it has retroactively made me think that like lots of things that maybe I would have just

2230
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:53,480
Accepted as an opinion before now. I have to shake my head and be like well. That's just fucking dumb

2231
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:56,360
Uh, yeah, so I don't I don't know

2232
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:00,360
Yeah, no, that's not true for everything but for some things. I I feel

2233
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:02,680
uh

2234
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:04,200
my

2235
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:08,360
Because just yeah, and any anything that I didn't know about myself

2236
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:14,840
Anything that I did not have a personal opinion on that she said I might have gen I would have generally just taken her word for it

2237
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:17,240
But now I've it has to I have to question everything

2238
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:22,920
Uh, and you know often the the questioning does not lead me to a positive

2239
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:29,000
Conclusion about the yeah content. I guess I guess the the thing that also

2240
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:32,600
I'm not sure about is the people who do know

2241
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:38,200
About this the the things she talked about. Um, I haven't seen people

2242
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:41,800
Saying in comments

2243
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:45,480
Anywhere that much when it you know when they were happening

2244
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:48,040
The Trixie didn't know what she was talking about

2245
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:52,840
So I feel like she had a basic grasp enough to make a video on these subjects and I was

2246
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:55,560
Like at minimum acceptable

2247
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:58,680
I feel like now that Trixie has gone off the rails

2248
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:03,720
Yeah, uh, it's easy to look back and say well, they were always bad, but I didn't think it at the time

2249
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,920
I don't know if that's true

2250
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:10,360
You know, I I I think it's okay. I think it's a combination

2251
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,880
I I think it's

2252
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:17,320
There is there are some things that I now would think more negatively of just because I know

2253
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:23,080
More about the person who's having them who's saying them. I think but I think it's also

2254
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:25,960
That like she has just gotten worse

2255
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:29,000
Insert like I don't think she could make

2256
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:35,080
Asterisks war sucks now Asterisks war sucks was an interesting analysis and it

2257
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:40,280
Touched on, you know, it was it was pretty like, you know, honest about like

2258
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:45,560
Feelings and stuff. I don't know. I feel like it was a good little series

2259
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:50,440
And now she's she's a different person now and like now she's on this whole thing about like

2260
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:52,440
I

2261
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:59,160
Don't know she's she's like gone into this like contrarian positivity thing and she's all just like I like things now

2262
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:04,920
Digi bro was bad because because he didn't like things, but that was actually just a character

2263
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,920
I was playing that wasn't really me

2264
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:12,600
That was just a character Trixie is good Trixie likes things Trixie is nice Trixie's positive

2265
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:16,920
And I just feel like it doesn't come from an emotionally honest place and I feel like it would not

2266
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:20,120
I don't feel like she could write something that I would be like

2267
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:25,080
Hmm. You make an excellent point. Hmm. That speaks to something that I feel

2268
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:28,840
Yeah, is relatable anymore. I suppose a lot of

2269
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:35,400
The the content of the videos that she made was not merely

2270
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:39,160
This anime is good. Um, it's it's like

2271
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:45,800
Using the anime as a framing device for talking about the internet or her

2272
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:48,360
self yeah, or like

2273
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:50,360
various

2274
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:53,720
Things that people can relate to on an emotional level

2275
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,760
And that's that's you know

2276
02:20:57,400 --> 02:21:01,320
People like that. That's okay. I feel like if she tried to do the same stuff now

2277
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:04,040
She would not relate to anyone because she is

2278
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,280
So

2279
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:08,840
Different she's such a she's such like a closed

2280
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:13,960
You know, you know like she's so cagey. She doesn't she doesn't tell anyone what she's up to

2281
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,520
She doesn't like nobody

2282
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:20,360
I know I know where she lives because I'm smart and I figured it out and it wasn't even that hard

2283
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:23,320
But like nobody knows where she lives because she's like a secretive about it

2284
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:28,120
Like she doesn't uh, she's she doesn't want people to know about her anymore

2285
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:31,240
Uh, and it comes through

2286
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,240
In her scripts

2287
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:38,280
This that what you just said about like how the videos are really they're not they're sort of about the anime

2288
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:40,360
but they're really about like

2289
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:43,640
They're about the host

2290
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:45,880
Yeah, I've been thinking about that

2291
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:51,000
Tim tim rogers has made me think about that lately like those videos are not like they he does talk about the game

2292
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:54,280
But like the the point of those videos

2293
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:59,960
I really think is just for him to talk about himself, which is like fine. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that

2294
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:01,880
um

2295
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:03,880
But it's true of just I think it's just true

2296
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:08,920
Of youtube I saw a video that was a criticism of

2297
02:22:09,160 --> 02:22:17,960
It was a a specific philosophy tube video where like some someone who worked for like a university who was like an actual philosophy

2298
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:22,040
Professor gave like wrote like an essay about like, you know

2299
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:24,760
Learning philosophy from philosophy tube

2300
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:27,400
Is kind of like not a great way to do it

2301
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:30,040
Because those the philosophy tube videos

2302
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:37,480
Are only sort of about philosophy like the the point of those videos is not to is not principally

2303
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:40,280
To exposit ideas

2304
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:44,680
But to profile the host right the point of the videos is to

2305
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:49,560
Feature the personality that makes them and I think that's true of so

2306
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:53,080
That's true. I think that's just true of like everything

2307
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:58,200
I think that's like the point of youtube the point of youtube is to provide a platform for people to

2308
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,080
nominally talk about stuff you might be interested in video games you like movies you like whatever but the point

2309
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:11,720
Is for them to sell themselves to you as someone that you like and that you want to give money to

2310
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:15,080
And I don't know

2311
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:19,080
I'm not even talking about tricksy anymore. Although it's true of her as well. It's true of everyone

2312
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:24,200
I don't think uh, yeah, that's probably bad. That's probably a bad thing

2313
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:31,160
I mean, maybe I'm my my brain immediately goes to someone like tom scott who is

2314
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:36,440
Yeah, obviously very well recognized because of his videos being very popular

2315
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:41,160
And he's got his signature look and the way he talks and he's like it's tom scott

2316
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:46,280
I like tom scott. I see tom scott and I click sure. Um, but the content

2317
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:51,240
I don't know whether I could describe it about being about tom scott

2318
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:56,120
Other than the fact that it's things that he thought would be interesting to put into a video

2319
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:59,080
And in that sense, I don't know whether there's anything wrong with that

2320
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:03,880
I don't know. I guess there's there's there's certain aspects of parasocial

2321
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:10,280
Like there's a there's a gradient I guess here's here's where it could be more about the host than it is about the stuff

2322
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:15,560
That is being talked about what what if I phrased it like this. What if I said that the the business model

2323
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:22,280
Regardless of the actual like content of the videos or how educational they are the business model of youtube is not

2324
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
explaining things

2325
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Educating people the business model of youtube is to make people like you invest people in you

2326
02:24:31,880 --> 02:24:34,440
Sell them on you as someone they want to give money to

2327
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,440
By whatever means yes, I think that's only

2328
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:45,480
Due to the fact that most youtube channels are run by an individual and not a company

2329
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:49,160
Because if it were if it were all companies it would be the same thing

2330
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:52,120
But like to get people invested in the brand or whatever

2331
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:56,840
Well, yeah, yeah, okay. I get okay. Yeah, I guess

2332
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:00,840
I guess in a way that's kind of the point of any brand

2333
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:04,040
And some brands are just a person

2334
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:07,720
So I guess maybe I'm not really describing anything new, huh?

2335
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,800
Yeah, in fact, you might be an idiot Ben saying

2336
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:17,880
Perhaps perhaps. Let me just check bitcoin again real quick. No

2337
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:23,400
Oh, it crept up a little bit. Ah, it's creeping back up toward it. It dipped below six hunt 60k

2338
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:25,640
But it's creeping a little bit back up towards it

2339
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,160
I hope that it doesn't like

2340
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:36,440
Pass 60k and then shoot up again because it's like oh, oh, we've we've beaten the resistance point. We're past the resistance point

2341
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:41,320
Whatever fuck it

2342
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:43,640
um

2343
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:45,880
Duh, what were we talking about youtube?

2344
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,600
Whatever man

2345
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:51,320
Yeah, Trixie sucks. Uh, that's all I have to say

2346
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:57,400
One last thing about that. Okay. Uh, male is uh fem voice is tough

2347
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:00,280
Yeah, and I totally get the

2348
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:02,920
the the the the

2349
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:05,080
the aversion to

2350
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:09,800
I guess I guess flippantly or like without practice put on a voice

2351
02:26:10,360 --> 02:26:15,960
That people can hear and make judgments. I'd rather perfect it in secret and then suddenly start using it

2352
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:19,320
I don't know if that's possible. I feel like your voice would gradually change

2353
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:21,400
um

2354
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:25,640
But it's I I don't want to I don't want to without having

2355
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:28,280
under undergone like a rigorous

2356
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,040
training

2357
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:33,800
It's just start doing a voice off the top of my head because it's gonna sound

2358
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:36,600
Very bad

2359
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:38,840
Hmm

2360
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:43,240
Just like it would be with any sort of accent thing you're trying

2361
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:46,360
Probably yeah, probably yeah

2362
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:48,440
um

2363
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:49,960
okay

2364
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:52,920
Uh, one more voice mail this one is uh

2365
02:26:53,880 --> 02:26:57,320
This isn't like they used another website that's fast upload

2366
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:05,560
Okay, you got it open it's called bends bends crass and cast formerly nates

2367
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:11,160
You got it wait wait, that's the joke

2368
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:16,520
And press it needs needs feed and seed formerly chucks

2369
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Well, it doesn't make any sense because

2370
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:23,560
Sneeds feed

2371
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,440
wait

2372
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:26,760
Sneeds feed and seed

2373
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:30,120
I'll end with eed

2374
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:33,640
Yeah, so your brain automatically goes chucks

2375
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:35,880
Suck and suck

2376
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:42,840
So if this is okay, so if it's bends crass and cast formerly nates then it would have been nates crete and kate

2377
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:46,360
So that doesn't make any sense. Yeah, this is okay

2378
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:49,000
Are you are you ready?

2379
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,320
Yes, okay three two one go

2380
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:55,480
I mean, have you been following the uh the the kyle written house stuff?

2381
02:27:56,120 --> 02:28:02,280
The the details are iffy in my I mean in my corner of the internet obviously everyone thinks he's he's guilty

2382
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:05,080
If he gets an acquittal

2383
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:08,040
the messages

2384
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:10,280
White people

2385
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:12,280
Yeah, why bring such a large gun?

2386
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:14,040
Yeah

2387
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,400
what

2388
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:19,000
I thought the message is the message is white people

2389
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:22,120
I thought it was going somewhere else

2390
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:26,760
I'm not sure exactly what the message of that was supposed to be

2391
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,960
uh

2392
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:33,320
I thought it was going to be I thought I was going to end on like what did I say?

2393
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:35,560
I said like, you know white people go out and kill protesters

2394
02:28:35,560 --> 02:28:37,880
I thought it was going to end on a dramatic beat of like me

2395
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:41,960
You know the music stops and I say white people go out and kill protesters

2396
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:46,120
Uh, but it didn't so I guess it subverted my expectations

2397
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:53,560
What a strange voicemail. That was a strange voicemail. Oh, we got another one a new one 17 minutes ago

2398
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:59,320
It's called rod surling the crypto zone. Yes, please

2399
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:05,880
Are you ready? Yes. Okay, three two one go

2400
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:16,920
Imagine if you will the world in which the only rational option would be to invest in bitcoin

2401
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:24,520
Impossible why it is not so in the mind of ben saint internet comic artist and game developer extraordinaire

2402
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:28,840
What if you knew for a fact that your money would double after you invested

2403
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:34,520
Forget that in this scenario the whole point of the speculation market that bitcoin relies on would be deflated

2404
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:38,200
Because it relies on some people losing out for others to make gains

2405
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:42,840
Which is made impossible when the stock rise and fall is made predictable to everyone

2406
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:47,000
Or imagine that bitcoin became the only currency and you would become a literal

2407
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:50,280
Vagrant in a mad max wasteland if you did not invest

2408
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:53,880
These are the scenarios we wrestled with in the crypto zone

2409
02:29:54,520 --> 02:30:00,840
Where ben saint goes when he must once again justify why he still feels the subtle temptation to invest in bitcoin

2410
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:05,320
Though at the same time admitting that they are a scam pyramid scheme with necessary victims

2411
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:07,960
Not the least of which is the environment

2412
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:10,680
Gotta get that bag i guess

2413
02:30:11,080 --> 02:30:16,360
If i wrote to radcon so that ben saint becomes secure enough in his finances that he no longer feels that

2414
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:22,760
Survivalist instinct that tempts us all to slice the achilles tendon of our federal man to steal his meat

2415
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:25,960
And his crypto wallet his meat

2416
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:32,040
Uh that is a completely that is a very emotionally

2417
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:37,400
Honest that is an that is exactly how it feels. I am living in the crypto zone

2418
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:39,720
All the time

2419
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:45,080
That's very eloquently put as well very eloquently put. I love i'm gonna fucking voice grail that one

2420
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:48,680
Yeah, voice grail rod serling goes right to the voice grail

2421
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:53,320
And and ser it's an honor to have you among our esteemed

2422
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:57,160
Right, you you said you said it you said it better than I ever could have

2423
02:30:57,720 --> 02:30:58,760
uh

2424
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:00,760
Yeah, I I do uh

2425
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:09,560
What more is there to say you just hit the nail on the head that that music should play every time you check bitcoin

2426
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:13,160
Yeah, it should it should

2427
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:16,840
Uh can we get elia's r2 start editing in the

2428
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:20,520
The twilight zone music whenever bitcoin comes up

2429
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:25,800
Elia's are uh, I'll get I'll get you I'll get you the music. I will get you

2430

2431
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:34,760
Yeah, um

2432
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:37,080
Congrats, okay

2433
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:39,400
Anything else? Are we are we done?

2434
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:42,600
I suppose we are

2435
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:44,360
God

Gone behind people have been complaining that they're not four hours long

2438
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:58,360
Yeah, I saw a couple people were like I got so used to four hour long podcast and this one's only two hours and 15 minutes

2439
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:04,280
I don't even know how we were able just the two of us to go on for four hours

2440
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:08,520
These days I don't because nothing nothing happens to me anymore

2441
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:11,800
I just fucking sit in my room and I work on my gain and I lift weights

2442
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:15,080
That's all I do

2443
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:18,520
We just gotta finish these projects. Yeah, and we can talk about them

2444
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:23,320
Genuinely, yes true genuinely the case

2445
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:29,240
Uh, well, but that day not yet that day is not today. So until that time comes

You want to you want to wrap up?

There were bird men in there. I remember that

Yes, what else was there? I think there was some world war two shit. I don't know
