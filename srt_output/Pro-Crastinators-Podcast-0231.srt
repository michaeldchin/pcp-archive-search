1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's go! That's it, that's the start.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We got me, Ben Saint, we got Gibbontake back from wherever the fuck,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and we got our special guest, Oblivionfall, who I'm sure most of you know.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome to the show, OF.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, jeep.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How you, how you done? How you, how you living?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Half dead, as usual. Working myself to the grave every day, except this weekend I finally took a break and played Minecraft.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's good.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Would you, would you like to introduce yourself to anyone who doesn't, who isn't familiar with your, with your uvra?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh my god. I've been like, I've been PCP adjacent for like almost seven years, I guess,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and I don't even think anyone was aware until very recently.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like, oh jeez, like I saw it, I've been, oh man.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wait, the PCP hasn't been around for seven years, hasn't it?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I know, like this goes back to the,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe if you count, if you count like pre-PCP stuff.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This goes back to the pony days, like I remember watching Tommy Oliver, Anthony C, Cantalot Wedding Review,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
like way back, and there's been a whole, there's been a whole bunch of characters who I have heard mentioned in your circle,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or even on the PCP every so often, it's like, oh hey, I live compostable a lot.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Lamal, or you know, FNGR, Keyframe, you know, Misanthropony, et cetera.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And like, I've been around those people.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
These shadowy figures from the Misty Pat.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, were you, were you ever in the Rift Cafe?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, luckily, I don't think I ever was.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
However, a lot of people...

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You missed out on a real part.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I had a lot of friends in there, though, and a lot of them spoke to you guys,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and I'm like, man, I'd like to talk to you guys.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why do all my friends talk to you, but I don't talk to you?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And that's how it was for years.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's impossible, it's impossible.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm very hard to reach emotionally.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, either, there's two ways to get in contact with us.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Either be like a terrible, my little pony reviewer, Sokara 2014,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or be an incredible god of other worldly ability,

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and then put, like, references to our things in animations and videos you make.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right, right, that's the only other way to do it.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's the only other way, and I found it.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I uncovered it myself.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You put, right, you had, you had a voicemail.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What was the song about cum?

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What's the song about cum?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Your cum won't last, the sequel to the cum zone, I think.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh no, there was another one, there was a third.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They were free, they were free.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The cum zone is not even like, actually, maybe it's the first one.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, I put PCP references in a couple of DA games music videos.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They're a channel with like a million sub scuba divers who,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
they got popular doing like FNAF songs and let's plays and stuff,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and they branched out to a whole bunch of other like nerd core stuff,

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and I was friends with that guy since he had like 200 subscribers,

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and so when I was leaving the pony fandom,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
when that, you know, collapsed and I'm like, I gotta escape in 2016,

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
they hired me on to make some music videos,

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and I put PCP references in a few, in a few of those,

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and then I made the cum zone, which is all PCP stuff all the way through,

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
like you see the broth, you see the fucking clannad crab with testicles in there,

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
a whole bunch of things.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So many people have seen those two videos,

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
probably more than have ever, ever watched like all of PCP videos combined.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, maybe.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like some, I think when it comes to video games videos, there's the Tattletail song,

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
which there's like a computer-y like glitchy part,

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and there's like a little, I put a bunch of code on screen,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just googled some code and had it scroll past,

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and hidden in the code, like in the corners,

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
a bunch of like PCP references, that was one.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then I did the Brothers in Arms Cuphead animation,

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
where I put an entire section dedicated to Gibbons,

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hippo tries not to die from skeletons, I put that in there,

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and that's got like 60 million views now, I didn't even realize.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, 60 million, okay, oh fuck.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
65 million.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I thought it was like five or six million.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's so cool, and I think you had like a,

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
like how you animated the Hippo on your channel.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A little time lapse.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think that same channel, and because people saw the DA,

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
not that same channel, your own after dark or something.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, my own channel.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, so my main channel is lesser than my after dark actually these days.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And like people saw the DA games thing,

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
they saw you had like animated in it,

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
somehow they found the Hippo thing,

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
then they went from that to the video that you linked

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
of me making my game, and then to the Itchio thing.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I think I may have got one whole sale

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
from those 60 million people.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's epic.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It system works.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The game wasn't free?

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It was free, but you could pay for it if you wanted.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think I definitely got a few downloads.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't think actually anyone paid for it, but you know, exposure.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's okay.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's okay.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, it's about reaching people at the end of the day.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's about getting those eyeballs.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The only other big DA games video was the Baldi's Basics song,

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
which is very funny.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's a very silly song.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I actually wrote the synth solo.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I did some music for it.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why have I been hearing about Baldi's Basics?

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It has just the past couple of weeks.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've heard about it a bunch of times, and I've never heard about it before.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, it's weird.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It lost relevancy like a year ago.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Maybe there's a DLC or something coming out.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I haven't kept up with it.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But in that video, there's a whole bunch of posters on the wall,

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and all of them are PCP references.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Some of them really obscure.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Mysterious Rhinoceros even makes an appearance on one of those.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That secret channel.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh my god.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Imagine that.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Wow.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's a deep cut.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's just fuck all this bullshit.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's just talk about the pony days.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Those are the good old days.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's just reminisce about the good times.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you remember Ben being in the Rift Cafe Skype group,

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and then every few hours,

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
they'd have a call in which they played Cards Against Humanity,

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and that was it.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's all they did.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I remember Cards Against Humanity.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What a fucking shitty game.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
For assholes.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yikes.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I might have played once, just as a meme.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I definitely played a couple of times,

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
because it's like, I don't know how cool I am yet.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm just some guy just like one of the rest of these people.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't realize that they were even worse than me.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean, you gotta do something, right?

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, it's funny.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's funny in hindsight.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Card games.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Very cool.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
For very cool people.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The Rift Cafe was...

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I got an argument there a lot.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I had beef with a couple of people.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, I remember what I was going to say.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I had this idea.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Did you see what Mage did recently?

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
She made a Vtuber avatar?

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She made a Vtuber puppet

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and rigged it up and did a stream with it.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was a little glitchy, but it mostly worked, as intended.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I gotta say, I asked her about it.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I asked her how she did it, what program she used.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She told me, I am very tempted to try it.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm very tempted to make a phantom horn.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Continue T-Bat plays or something?

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't know what I would do with it.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It just seems fun.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It seems like a fun thing to make.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It does.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's just sort of like...

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's multiple ways to do it.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I know the way you're supposed to do it, there's the program.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I think I downloaded it.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I just never got around to looking at the tutorials of how.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm like, whatever.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I guess I can figure that out eventually, and I never will.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm in the same place with Live2D.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I assume that's the program you had.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, FaceRig and Live2D, right?

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, FaceRig, that's the other one.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm too lazy.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't like tutorials.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They suck.

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have too much other shit I should be doing

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
to even think about doing it right now.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If I had nothing on my plate, I might start fucking around in it

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and see what I could cook up.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I mean, there's always something on your plate.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It doesn't matter how non-busy you try to be.

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There's always going to be something more important

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
than making a puppet for live streams,

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
unless that's your career goal.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just a bit of fun.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's always going to be less important than something.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My career goals are whatever I fucking want them to be.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If I want that to be what I'm doing, it will.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This doesn't make any sense now that I'm thinking about it,

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
but you should do gummy worm live streams,

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
creating gummy worms live and have phantom horn

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
matched to your movements somehow.

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It doesn't make any sense because you need to.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What the fuck?

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I just thought two things Ben St. does

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and put phantom horn there.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It would be like footage of me cooking in the kitchen

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
with a little phantom horn in the corner

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
commentating on it or something.

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You pre-record you making gummy worms

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and then you webcam yourself as phantom horn,

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
stream the video and commentate on it

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and say, what an idiot, what a stupid piece of shit.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Talk about what a piece of shit, garbage.

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I am going to make a worm cooking video soon.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think I complained last episode that it's actually,

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I thought I was going to get great deals from China

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
on isomaltoligosaccharides,

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
but it's turned out to be a nightmare

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and much more difficult than I thought.

222
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And not even much cheaper,

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
actually more expensive than just buying them domestically.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm so mad.

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm so mad that they don't just sell them

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
through fiber yam like they used to.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What a fucking joke.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Wait, phantom horn reacts.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You just do phantom horn reacts videos.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I got to pivot back to the pony days.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Just go back to being a full time pony tuber,

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
but this time with a V-tuber, a P-tuber if you will.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, like live reacting to my little pony episode.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The world's first P-tuber?

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Dude, you have to react to your own T-Bap episodes.

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Me and Tom keep saying that we're going to make,

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
we're going to do bonus episodes

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that are us reacting to old PCP episodes,

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
like doing commentary tracks over them.

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh my God.

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We haven't done it yet.

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It sounds like a clusterfuck, but I want it.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And it would be so hard to determine

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
whether the person talking,

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
to differentiate between present us talking about it

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and past us talking,

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it would be these two identical sets of voices

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
like randomly cutting in and out

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and interrupting one another

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and commenting on what each other is saying.

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think we should do one of those.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We should definitely try.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I definitely think our voices will have changed a bit.

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Mine, I feel like, would have been a lot meeker, at least.

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I'd be like,

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
oh God, did I sound like that?

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And you'd be like, yes.

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Maybe.

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah.

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, that would be just the kind of thing

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I would want to hear, you know,

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
us notice about an old episode.

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Did I really used to say that?

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Did I really sound like that, whatever?

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Funny.

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I like it.

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We'll do it.

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We'll make it happen.

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You guys want to talk about current events?

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Minecraft, I guess.

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's the current event that I'm interested in.

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Minecraft has been...

276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Minecraft Steve is announced for Smash, first of all,

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
which was epic,

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and I really like the game explanation Sakura did.

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I didn't watch the full thing.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I watched some of it.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I think that it looks...

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I didn't care at first,

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but then I saw how he plays and I thought,

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
oh wow, that's really neat.

285
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's funny.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The idea of like randomly,

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
like at any moment placing blocks

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that you have in your inventory

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and to the stage to like block people's attacks

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and then jumping away.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It looks so cool if you could get really good at Steve.

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Like that would make great footage.

294
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And like mining for materials

295
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and like what materials you dig up

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
determine like the quality of the weapons you make.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Like that's so good.

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's super good.

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Such a gimmicky character.

301
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

302
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He got a mind for diamonds.

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But yeah, it's like the first time...

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't even play Smash

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and I'm kind of excited about it.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The first time I had even considered like,

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
maybe I should get in on this like Nintendo Switch thing

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've been hearing about, you know,

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
so it's a little new.

312
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Really?

313
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I still haven't bought one.

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You weren't tempted by animal crossing?

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't care about animal crossing.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've never played one.

317
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They seem fun and nice and wholesome,

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
but it's like...

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You didn't see like everybody animal crossing,

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
posting on the all across the internet

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and be like, shit, this is a cultural event

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that I got that I don't...

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
All right.

324
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Here's my gamer thought.

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I hate cultural events

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and I hate games that are like destined

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to become irrelevant at some point.

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Any multiplayer game

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that has like seasons,

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
like season one of like Fortnite,

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I hate feeling like the idea of like,

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
if I don't get in now,

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll have missed out on all of the cool cosmetic stuff.

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You can only get in season one

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and then season two and season three.

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And it's like, I hate that.

337
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I hate it so much.

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It pisses me off to see that even.

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So I avoid anything that is like,

340
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
designed to be like,

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
to catch you in like perpetually playing the game.

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Not because it's good,

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
but because you're scared of missing out on all the shit.

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah.

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I had played an animal crossing before.

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I did not anticipate the degree to which

347
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
new horizons would be like,

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that thing you just described.

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It was like, yeah,

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I have fallen off it partly because it's like,

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not interested in playing it forever, you know?

352
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And I don't,

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm not interested in keeping up with the,

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you know, yeah, the new,

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
like holiday expansion packs and so forth.

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I mean, I get that it, you know,

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
it's smart business because it works

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and people are constantly manipulated easily

359
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
by it all the time.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's just, I,

361
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I grew up on games where you play them

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and then you go back to them if you feel like it,

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
not because you feel compelled to be part of the event.

364
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah.

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's like, it's kind of why I like,

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
stopped playing Pokemon Go because I missed a bunch of things.

367
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was just going to say the same thing.

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was just going to say the same thing.

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Like once, like the,

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
they keep releasing new updates for it.

372
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've missed the last few and I'm like,

373
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
at first I was like, yeah,

374
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want to be like,

375
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I want to get lots of Pokemon

376
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and make them really powerful and be like,

377
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
a fucking Pokemon master.

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But then like the fact,

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
it's like World of Warcraft,

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
like the fact that new updates keep coming out,

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
they keep rendering the old stuff obsolete,

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
you know, the CP cap keeps rising.

383
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's like, eh, the grind will never end.

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
God, that's why,

385
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
that's why World of Warcraft Classic is so fucking good

386
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
because it's all going to stay exactly the same.

387
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's the whole point.

388
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can just play it

389
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and you can see all of the stuff that used to be there

390
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that they destroyed horribly.

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How big the shoulder pads are.

392
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh my God.

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's what I think of Warcraft.

394
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
World of Warcraft,

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
shoulder pads used to look like,

396
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
they've always been chunky and big,

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but newer designs are like,

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
spikier and smaller details

399
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that you can't really see from a distance.

400
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The early like,

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
classic ones were like really big,

402
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
chunky,

403
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
like, you know,

404
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
chocolate bar shoulder pads.

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You just,

406
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
you want to bite into them.

407
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You want to,

408
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you want to have a little Lego figurine

409
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
of your Warcraft character.

410
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Now it's like,

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know,

412
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
stupid and socks.

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's old, good, new bed.

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's what it's always been.

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I've already had this rent before on the PCPs.

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't need to say it again.

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's why we have,

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
that's why I got to go back to the pony days

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and become a P-Tuber again.

420
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
P-Tuber?

421
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If only I'd had,

422
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
if only I'd had face rig back in 20, whatever,

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
when T-Bap was happening.

424
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Things would have been different, I tell you.

425
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's going to put me out of business,

426
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
though, with my commission model that I do

427
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
for these pony YouTubers,

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
pony in the corner people.

429
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh, oh right.

430
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you still do those?

431
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I do.

432
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Do people still want those?

433
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, every so often I get a message

434
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
from people being like,

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
hey, can you make vectors of my OC?

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And I'm like, sure,

437
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
give me a million dollars,

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and they do,

439
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and it's cool.

440
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Ponies specifically,

441
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
or just like anything?

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's all ponies.

443
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay, so,

444
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
oh my God,

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
this goes back a little bit,

446
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I guess it's tangentially related,

447
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
so people obviously

448
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
want their character to look show style,

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because oh my God,

450
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it looks official.

451
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
How embarrassing would it be

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
if your pony OC was like off model or style?

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, imagine having a unique art style, cringe.

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But, yeah,

455
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
so this goes back to,

456
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I think, 2013.

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There were leaks,

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
a bunch of animation files got leaked from DHX.

459
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I remember this.

460
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It turned out,

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I actually had the leaks before they were public,

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
because I was working on a project

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
with a guy who I won't name

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
for the sake of his,

465
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know,

466
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't want him to get in trouble.

467
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He works at Warner Brothers.

468
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He's a big boy there now, apparently.

469
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's just call him Pro Jared.

470
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah, Pro Jared.

471
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So,

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Pro Jared approached me in early 2013

473
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to work on a project for free.

474
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh my God, epic.

475
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And he gave me some...

476
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
For exposure?

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, exactly.

478
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, terrible.

479
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He gave me some files,

480
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and he's like,

481
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
don't show these to anyone.

482
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And I'm like,

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
oh, I assume these belong to your old animator.

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Then the leaks happened,

485
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and it turned out they were official rigs

486
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
from fucking DHX,

487
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and I'm like, oh, fuck.

488
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But from there,

489
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I studied them,

490
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and I created my own rigs in their likeness.

491
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I basically just traced over every single piece,

492
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
one by one,

493
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and made it my own.

494
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So technically not stealing.

495
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And...

496
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You just traced them exactly.

497
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, traced.

498
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Pixel, pixel perfect.

499
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, and people got mad at me for like,

500
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
how dare you do that?

501
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's the same as using them.

502
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Use our rigs where we traced it instead,

503
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and I'm like,

504
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
they did the same thing.

505
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I mean, I agree with them,

506
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but for the opposite reason,

507
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
like, I do agree, like,

508
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
why do that?

509
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like, what's the point?

510
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Like, if you're just going to copy them exactly,

511
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
what's the point in not using them?

512
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I changed up the design slightly,

513
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and made improvements to it,

514
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but from there,

515
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have this animation rig,

516
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and I'm like, hey,

517
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I could just pose this character

518
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
a bunch of times in flash,

519
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and render an image sequence.

520
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why don't I do that

521
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
for people who make, like, analysis videos?

522
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And I did it for a friend who, for free,

523
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to just start off with.

524
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And then a bunch of air friends were like,

525
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
oh, do mine, do mine next,

526
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
do mine next.

527
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I'm like, okay.

528
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And then I did it for free the first few times,

529
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and then I thought, wait,

530
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
what if I, like,

531
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
what if people pay money for work?

532
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What's that?

533
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I'm like, sure,

534
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll make you, like, a hundred images

535
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
for $1 each,

536
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
but all I really have to do

537
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is just make the image once,

538
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and it automatically completes for rest.

539
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And so I have done

540
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
over 40,000 vectors

541
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
in the last few years.

542
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And it's going up,

543
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
because every character,

544
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
it's now 150 per character.

545
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Do you, do you have, like,

546
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
do you have, like, an algorithm

547
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
where it's like, you make the rig,

548
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and then, like, you run it through an algorithm

549
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that creates, like,

550
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
vectors in different expressions,

551
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or whatever?

552
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What it is, is I have the rig,

553
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
all of the poses are keyframes

554
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
in my animation software.

555
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I do it in flash, right?

556
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So they're all just keyframes

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
with symbols.

558
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And if you change, like,

559
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
what is inside a symbol,

560
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it updates on every frame.

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I have, like, a temporary hair,

562
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
like, for the tail,

563
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
temporary hair on the head,

564
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I have a temporary cutie mark,

565
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
a bunch of temporary stuff.

566
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And then I, there is an algorithm

567
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that automatically recolors

568
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
everything in the file,

569
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
so that's easy for recoloring.

570
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And then I just vector,

571
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
like, the tail, the hair,

572
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the cutie mark, whatever.

573
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And once I've done that,

574
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can just go through all the frames

575
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and, like, make small adjustments.

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Like, if the hair is really big,

577
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
it might, like, clip into, like,

578
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the neck or something

579
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
at a certain point,

580
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
so I'll have to find all the frames

581
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
where it clips into the neck

582
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and, like, move it slightly

583
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
or, like, erase part of it.

584
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Like, I do have to do

585
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
a bit of manual work,

586
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
but most of it's pretty automated.

587
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And, um, yeah,

588
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
using the power of capitalism,

589
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I lure people into buying the bigger packs

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
because it's slightly cheaper

591
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
than getting the smaller packs,

592
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
like, per image.

593
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You say, you ask them

594
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
if they want a supersize.

595
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, they want a supersize.

596
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You get 150 images

597
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
for only $20 extra.

598
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And they're like, yes.

599
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
$20? Oh, my God.

600
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
God, the value.

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, and I can get,

602
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can get, like,

603
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
oh, like, there was one day

604
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
where I did six in a day,

605
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
so, like, that was, like,

606
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
a thousand images in one day,

607
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
but I did.

608
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That was my record.

609
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But most characters of these days,

610
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
because I put,

611
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I stupidly put more care

612
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and attention into it,

613
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
it can take me a couple days

614
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
to do one now.

615
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But if it's a really simple design,

616
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can knock out in, like,

617
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
two or three hours,

618
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and that's, like, 120 bucks.

619
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Not bad.

620
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wait, all right.

621
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's so funny.

622
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Has your,

623
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
has your user name

624
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
stayed the same the whole time?

625
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Were you always oblivionful?

626
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I was,

627
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
oh, my God,

628
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I used to be Pivot Master CF

629
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
way back.

630
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I did Pivot Animations

631
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
forever ago,

632
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and I just,

633
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
there was,

634
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
okay, there was a guy,

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know,

636
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that's another tangent.

637
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I got to stop myself.

638
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
A guy made stick figures on crack,

639
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
his name was Pivot Master DX.

640
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I just put my initials there,

641
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
because I'm dumb,

642
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and I was, like, 12th.

643
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, I had oblivionfall as my name

644
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
since 2009.

645
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There was an animation

646
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
on DarkDemon.org

647
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
called oblivion.fail,

648
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
because it, like,

649
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
back then,

650
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
if you didn't finish an animation,

651
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you called it a fail.

652
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, look, here's an animation fail

653
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
or something.

654
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't know.

655
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And I'm, like,

656
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
oblivionfall,

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
that looks cool,

658
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and I saved it.

659
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I'm, like,

660
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
that would be a cool user name.

661
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Two weeks later,

662
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
my YouTube account gets hacked

663
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and deleted.

664
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I'm, like,

665
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
oh, I guess I'll make that name.

666
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And only later

667
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
did I realize it was fail

668
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
the whole time.

669
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So, ooh, I'm an idiot.

670
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's for the takeoff.

671
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's a real fail.

672
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That's my tragic backstory.

673
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's my tragic backstory.

674
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

675
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I asked because

676
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I was wondering whether you,

677
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the whole time,

678
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
were the vector brony,

679
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but I think that's someone else.

680
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I have his business card.

681
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I have a physical business card

682
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that he gave me, though,

683
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
in 2014.

684
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I made,

685
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I did not use a rig.

686
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I hand drew them.

687
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I drew some pony.

688
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Have I ever mentioned this?

689
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That I drew some pony,

690
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
like,

691
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
pony in the corner poses

692
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
for a brony YouTuber.

693
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
For free,

694
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
just because I liked him?

695
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, I think I remember that.

696
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Who was it?

697
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
His name was, like,

698
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
his, okay,

699
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I remember his pony was dark blue.

700
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He had, like,

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
long black hair

702
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and, like, a goatee.

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
His name was Tom Oliver.

704
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No.

705
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But,

706
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
his cutie mark

707
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
was the fee symbol,

708
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
like, the Greek letter.

709
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And his name was, like,

710
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the philosophy brony,

711
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
or, like, the Gnostic brony,

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
or something like that.

713
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah, I remember it.

714
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That guy.

715
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think,

716
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
is that the guy who, like...

717
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I know his face.

718
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
His pony face.

719
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
He had a video

720
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that said that Twilight Sparkle,

721
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
he made, like,

722
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
a philosophical argument

723
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that Twilight Sparkle

724
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
died

725
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and was replaced

726
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
by the Alicorn version.

727
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That it is,

728
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that it is, like,

729
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
philosophically impossible

730
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
for it to be the same

731
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
entity.

732
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
What we have is not

733
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Twilight Sparkle,

734
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
but a new entity

735
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that has replaced the old one.

736
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I think I've seen this guy's videos.

737
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I saw, like,

738
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
one where he was, like,

739
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
comparing, like,

740
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the characters to, like,

741
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
you know, real philosophers

742
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
in history

743
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and, like, going off

744
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
on all this lofty shit.

745
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And I'm like,

746
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I can't follow any of this.

747
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's retarded.

748
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Has he got a...

749
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Has he got a deep British voice,

750
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
English voice?

751
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think so.

752
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't know.

753
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Maybe.

754
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't...

755
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Damn it.

756
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't even remember, like,

757
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
any of his other videos.

758
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He wasn't that big.

759
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You know.

760
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This was early in the

761
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Brony analysis thing, so...

762
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think I saw him, though,

763
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
because, yeah, he had, like,

764
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
only a few hundred subscribers

765
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
when I saw it.

766
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It sounds familiar, though.

767
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It sounds very familiar.

768
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I just liked his video,

769
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and I had no creative outlet

770
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
at the time.

771
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
T-Bap didn't exist yet.

772
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So I was like,

773
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
this guy is using, like,

774
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
the crappy, like,

775
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
show vectors.

776
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It looks like ass.

777
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I am going to...

778
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The pony creator?

779
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The pony creator vectors?

780
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah.

781
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He had a pony creator avatar.

782
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm like, this is unacceptable.

783
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I get so many references.

784
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So many clients

785
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
will send me their pony

786
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
creator character

787
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
as a reference.

788
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Of course.

789
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Of course.

790
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And because they all re-use stuff

791
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
for those characters,

792
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I just open up a previous rig

793
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I've done,

794
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and I just take the hair

795
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
because it's exactly the same,

796
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and I just recolor it.

797
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Mm-hmm.

798
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah.

799
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And then,

800
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and then,

801
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I drew,

802
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I drew him his poses.

803
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I drew him in a custom,

804
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in a different style.

805
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I did,

806
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I did a whole, like,

807
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
custom background for him.

808
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So he's, like,

809
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
his pony is, like,

810
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
sitting behind a desk,

811
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and there's, like,

812
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
it's like in, like,

813
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
a wizard's tower,

814
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and he's got, like,

815
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
bookshelves,

816
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and he's got, like,

817
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
stuff.

818
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You know,

819
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
it was kind of nice.

820
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I thought it was pretty okay.

821
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So,

822
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you know,

823
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
pat myself on the back

824
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
for that.

825
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And then he, like,

826
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
quit doing YouTube.

827
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Keep making pony analysis videos,

828
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
philosophy,

829
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
brony,

830
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
or whatever your name is.

831
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Where did you go?

832
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I need a return on my investment.

833
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You gotta be the change

834
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
you want to see in the world.

835
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You gotta come back yourself.

836
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You gotta,

837
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you gotta

838
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
research the fandom.

839
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Single-handed.

840
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't even know

841
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
what all those people are doing.

842
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Like,

843
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the show is completely over.

844
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They probably just went and got jobs.

845
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Nah, it's impossible.

846
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They never do that.

847
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They probably just,

848
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
like,

849
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
got married or something.

850
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't know.

851
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I know K.P.

852
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
is reviewing,

853
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
like,

854
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
not pony stuff now.

855
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What cringe?

856
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I mean,

857
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
that's,

858
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that's the normal.

859
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Just,

860
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
like,

861
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
continue doing the same thing,

862
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
but with different media.

863
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But,

864
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
like,

865
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
how successful is that?

866
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Are people still clamoring

867
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
for pony reviews?

868
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Probably not.

869
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I mean,

870
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
there will,

871
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
there will always be,

872
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
there will always be

873
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
more audience for that.

874
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

875
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But it's,

876
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
yeah,

877
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
it's not what it used to be.

878
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It never will be.

879
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Even if,

880
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
even if,

881
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
like,

882
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
my little pony,

883
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Gen 5 or whatever,

884
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
came out,

885
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and it was,

886
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
like,

887
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
a hit,

888
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and it was popular again,

889
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think even if it rivaled

890
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Gen 4 in its popularity,

891
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
the,

892
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
like,

893
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
brony YouTuber thing would not

894
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
happen again,

895
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
because it would be,

896
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
like,

897
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
be seen as sort of like

898
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
an old,

899
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
like,

900
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
sort of embarrassing thing

901
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
that they used to do

902
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and it might get awkwardly,

903
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
like,

904
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
tacked onto the cartoon review

905
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
fandom quote-unquote.

906
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I think,

907
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I think some people would do it,

908
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
but I think more people

909
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
would see it as cringe.

910
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I,

911
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I mean,

912
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
if it's actually is,

913
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
like,

914
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
interesting,

915
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
like,

916
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
like,

917
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
if you could do philosophy

918
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
about fucking

919
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the next gen of pony,

920
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and people start doing it,

921
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think

922
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
people will appear

923
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
that have never heard of

924
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the previous,

925
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
like,

926
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
even younger youngsters

927
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
will,

928
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
get into that

929
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and then it'll become

930
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
a whole different thing.

931
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah,

932
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
you know,

933
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I guess the itch

934
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
that that kind of content

935
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
scratches

936
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
is probably just part of

937
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
the human condition

938
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and will never go away.

939
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So yeah,

940
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Minecraft.

941
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So yeah,

942
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Minecraft Steve, baby.

943
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I,

944
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I might get a switch

945
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
just to play as Minecraft Steve.

946
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Although,

947
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I,

948
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
the DLC pack

949
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
for,

950
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
like,

951
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the,

952
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
like the second roster

953
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
characters is three more

954
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
that has to be revealed.

955
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I kind of feel like

956
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
it's worth

957
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
waiting

958
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
to see if I want to buy

959
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the,

960
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
the season pass.

961
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't like

962
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
gambling on whether the,

963
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
they will be characters

964
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I care about,

965
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but like,

966
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't want to just

967
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
get Steve,

968
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
if later on

969
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I want to get

970
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
one of the other ones.

971
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Um,

972
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
oh,

973
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
would like,

974
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
would like it save money?

975
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It, it would,

976
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
like get the season pass

977
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and then you get all of them

978
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
instead of having like

979
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
buy them separately.

980
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You can get the season pass

981
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
for the DLC

982
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and it will be like,

983
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I think at the moment

984
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the arms lady,

985
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the spring lady,

986
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Steve,

987
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and then three more.

988
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And once those are revealed,

989
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I will know whether I want

990
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to save money on getting all of them

991
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
or just Steve.

992
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Who's it going to be?

993
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Uh,

994
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
duh.

995
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
People have been not looking

996
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
for Gino for ages.

997
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't know whether that's going to-

998
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's just not that many more

999
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
video games.

1000
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Um,

1001
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
uh,

1002
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
it's probably going to be

1003
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Gohu

1004
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
right here.

1005
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Homer Simpson,

1006
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
maybe.

1007
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, yeah.

1008
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He's a video game.

1009
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That would be so good.

1010
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That would be so funny.

1011
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
SpongeBob SquarePant.

1012
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I know people argue

1013
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
that Goku is technically

1014
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
a Nintendo character

1015
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
because like the

1016
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Budakai games were on

1017
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
a Nintendo console

1018
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
or something like that.

1019
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So I like,

1020
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
they could do it.

1021
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I,

1022
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I remember Digi's video

1023
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
about like why Goku

1024
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
could be a Smash character.

1025
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, maybe that's what

1026
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm thinking of.

1027
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Cause it was,

1028
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
it was like,

1029
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
um,

1030
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
if,

1031
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and Dragon Ball Z

1032
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
have been in

1033
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
tons of games

1034
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that people love and cherish.

1035
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I'm like,

1036
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
you know what,

1037
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
that's a decent argument.

1038
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It just feels weird.

1039
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But I wouldn't-

1040
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I wouldn't like

1041
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
flip my shit

1042
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
if Goku got in.

1043
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I wouldn't be like,

1044
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
this sucks.

1045
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Is the argument,

1046
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
is the argument against it

1047
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
that like the character

1048
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
should have originated

1049
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
in gaming?

1050
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes, I think so.

1051
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I guess I could see that too.

1052
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Uh,

1053
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
yeah.

1054
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I could see,

1055
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I could see

1056
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the arguments for

1057
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and against Goku.

1058
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Uh,

1059
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think it would be really funny.

1060
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I want to smash-

1061
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There's,

1062
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
there's the Toho girl as well.

1063
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Who?

1064
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
To- Toho girl with red

1065
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
clothing.

1066
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't play Toho,

1067
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
but-

1068
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1069
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Ray, Riemu,

1070
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Mie-Maru.

1071
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Are those on Switch?

1072
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
No, those are like,

1073
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
well,

1074
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
actually, I don't know.

1075
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But,

1076
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
that's a big gaming thing.

1077
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What are they on Nintendo consoles?

1078
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I think they're-

1079
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, that doesn't-

1080
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I don't think that has

1081
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
anything to do,

1082
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
cause Banjo-Kanzui is still

1083
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
well,

1084
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
actually, I guess it's on-

1085
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Banjo-Kanzui,

1086
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
those on the N64,

1087
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
what are you talking about?

1088
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I thought you were talking about

1089
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
like, current,

1090
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
like, oh, if they can't advertise

1091
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
on the Switch,

1092
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
why would they put a character in,

1093
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
but like-

1094
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No, I mean,

1095
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I thought the idea was that

1096
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
they would only include a character

1097
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
if it was on,

1098
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
in a game

1099
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that was on Nintendo consoles.

1100
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So,

1101
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
if like,

1102
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Toho's not on-

1103
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
on Nintendo consoles,

1104
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
then I think they're out,

1105
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
right?

1106
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I suppose

1107
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
they gotta make a new one

1108
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and put it on Switch.

1109
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I mean,

1110
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't see why not.

1111
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's a big-

1112
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
They're putting the fucking shit,

1113
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
like,

1114
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Undertale on Switch,

1115
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
so why not?

1116
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Crash Bandicoot,

1117
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
the remastered trilogy,

1118
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I think,

1119
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
was put on Switch.

1120
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh,

1121
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that's-

1122
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So Crash could be-

1123
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
They could total-

1124
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay,

1125
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
that seems like a no-brainer then.

1126
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Crash Bandicoot would be epic.

1127
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Rayman would be epic.

1128
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You know,

1129
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
just like,

1130
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
save all of the poor souls

1131
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
who got like,

1132
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
trapped in,

1133
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
like,

1134
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
PlayStation All-Stars,

1135
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Battle Royale,

1136
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
the most, uh,

1137
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
attempt at like,

1138
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
like,

1139
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
you know,

1140
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
showing up Nintendo

1141
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
at anything ever.

1142
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Um,

1143
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
where Sony got all of its

1144
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
beloved play-

1145
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
PlayStation characters

1146
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and

1147
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
somehow made it

1148
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
terrible and boring.

1149
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Um,

1150
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
like,

1151
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
just take all of them,

1152
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
take fucking,

1153
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
uh,

1154
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Ape Escape Man,

1155
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Spike,

1156
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
take fucking

1157
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Jack and Daxter,

1158
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
take all of the play-

1159
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
just all of the

1160
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
PlayStation characters

1161
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and a new character.

1162
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's-

1163
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I mean, yeah.

1164
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah,

1165
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
like the more-

1166
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, oh, here's-

1167
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Nintendo gobbles up IPs.

1168
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Here's my-

1169
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The worlds are-

1170
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Here's my big, I wish,

1171
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
please,

1172
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
um,

1173
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
one that,

1174
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
um,

1175
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
it could definitely happen,

1176
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
but,

1177
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I haven't seen any reason

1178
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
or like,

1179
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
hype around it,

1180
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
is a Matarasu

1181
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
from Okani.

1182
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The dog.

1183
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The white dog.

1184
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh,

1185
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that would be sick!

1186
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That'd be awesome.

1187
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
She's got so many,

1188
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
like,

1189
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
cool weapons and moves

1190
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and attacks

1191
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and she's a dog

1192
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and that's funny.

1193
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And, um,

1194
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
she's

1195
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
so

1196
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
cool.

1197
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like,

1198
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
imagine an Okami themed

1199
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
smash stage.

1200
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Just-

1201
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That'd be so cool.

1202
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It'd be so fucking

1203
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
sick.

1204
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I want that.

1205
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
They already have

1206
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Bayonetta,

1207
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
so like,

1208
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
they have links to

1209
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
the studio.

1210
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is a hype.

1211
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
This is a hype idea.

1212
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I like this a lot.

1213
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I hope they do it.

1214
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I hope they fucking do it.

1215
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I mean,

1216
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
there's no,

1217
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
it's Team Cherry,

1218
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
right?

1219
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Is the one that made

1220
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Okami?

1221
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
No, that's

1222
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
that's Hollow Knight.

1223
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Oh, fuck.

1224
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What's the

1225
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
what's the team that made

1226
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Platinum Games,

1227
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
previously known as

1228
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Clover Studio,

1229
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
made Okami

1230
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and then

1231
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Platinum stuff,

1232
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Bayonetta

1233
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and whatever.

1234
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Which,

1235
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
that's,

1236
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
yeah,

1237
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that's the same company

1238
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that made Bayonetta.

1239
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So,

1240
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
yeah,

1241
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
okay,

1242
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
they already got the

1243
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
they got the connections

1244
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
now that'd be sick.

1245
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
That'd be so sick.

1246
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah, I hope they do that.

1247
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, I mean,

1248
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I've hope they did

1249
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
they did that for like ever.

1250
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah,

1251
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
that's the sort of thing

1252
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I want Nate to do,

1253
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000

And manga.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1266
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Um,

1267
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000

1268
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Hey,

1275
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you heard of Minecraft.

1276
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
That's a game

1277
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that's still cool.

1278
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I played that.

1279
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I played that once.

1280
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000

1295
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I said,

1296
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000

1298
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000

1302
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
uh,

1303
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I have in my brain

1304
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a brand new

1305
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
build,

1306
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
a big

1307
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
building that I will build.

1308
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I,

1309
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because,

1310
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
um,

1311
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
uh,

1312
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I went to,

1313
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
on the holiday,

1314
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I went to see some ruins.

1315
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
This is ruins like

1316
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Priory,

1317
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
a big old church,

1318
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
monastery,

1319
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
place where monks

1320
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
would go

1321
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and,

1322
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
you know,

1323
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
be praying and shit.

1324
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Um,

1325
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and it's a whole big complex

1326
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
of ruins

1327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
in this park

1328
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and they had these

1329
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
um,

1330
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
signs

1331
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
with like,

1332
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
here's some history

1333
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
about stuff.

1334
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I took pictures

1335
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
of all the signs

1336
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and all like the

1337
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
blueprint layouts

1338
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
of the place

1339
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and I got as many angles

1340
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
as I could

1341
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and I'm going to use those pictures

1342
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
to recreate

1343
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the,

1344
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the Priory of St.

1345
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Pancras

1346
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
in Minecraft,

1347
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
in the Minecraft

1348
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
PCB

1349
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Minecraft server.

1350
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's my goal.

1351
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Wow.

1352
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Pretty,

1353
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
pretty cool.

1354
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Must have,

1355
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
must have left an impression

1356
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
on you,

1357
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I guess.

1358
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Um,

1359
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
MarinPan

1360
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
sent me

1361
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
a screenshot

1362
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
of the progress,

1363
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
some progress

1364
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that's been made

1365
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
on building a

1366
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
New Los Angeles city

1367
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and it looks really good.

1368
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I guess that's what

1369
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
they've been doing

1370
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
while I was,

1371
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
forgetting to stream.

1372
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So,

1373
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'll have to,

1374
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
we'll have to,

1375
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'll have to,

1376
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
what's the word,

1377
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
feature that.

1378
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'll have to

1379
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
show that off a little bit.

1380
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Maybe we'll do it

1381
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Wednesday,

1382
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
which,

1383
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
if you're listening,

1384
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
we'll have been

1385
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
this past Wednesday

1386
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
if you want to see that.

1387
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Okay.

1388
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Cool.

1389
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
What else?

1390
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What else we got?

1391
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What's going on guys?

1392
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Uh, well,

1393
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
which one of you

1394
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
gave the president COVID?

1395
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Um,

1396
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
it was me.

1397
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh,

1398
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
yeah,

1399
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
me too.

1400
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh,

1401
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it was all three of us

1402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
at the same time.

1403
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh,

1404
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
you sold your,

1405
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
you sold your hair

1406
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
so I could buy

1407
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
these combs and all

1408
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
you sold just

1409
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
your swatch so I could buy

1410
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
this chain and all

1411
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
you gave the president

1412
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
COVID,

1413
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
but I was giving

1414
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the president

1415
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
for the express purpose

1416
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
of COVID.

1417
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes.

1418
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It was my plan.

1419
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Where do you live in America?

1420
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Where are you from?

1421
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm,

1422
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I forget.

1423
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm from New Zealand.

1424
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Like Swedish?

1425
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh, New Zealand.

1426
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't fucking know.

1427
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's all the same.

1428
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Every English-speaking person

1429
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
could live anywhere.

1430
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's a fake country.

1431
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Low Australia.

1432
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's not real.

1433
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's a tiny little island.

1434
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I was there

1435
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
for my whole life up until recently.

1436
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
New Zealand,

1437
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
like,

1438
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
like Flight of the Concords,

1439
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
right?

1440
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah,

1441
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Flight of the Concords.

1442
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah,

1443
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
like Lord of the Rings.

1444
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah.

1445
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well,

1446
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
yes.

1447
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Literally,

1448
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Lord of the Rings

1449
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the only thing in New Zealand

1450
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
that ever happened.

1451
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And Flight of the Concord.

1452
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And Flight of the Concord.

1453
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Well,

1454
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Flight of the Concord

1455
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is better than Lord of the Rings.

1456
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The two things.

1457
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh,

1458
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the hot take.

1459
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's a comedy

1460
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
band

1461
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
show,

1462
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
TV show.

1463
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Next,

1464
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000

Lord of the Rings

1467
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
versus Flight of the Concord.

1468
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh,

1469
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
we should.

1470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We should.

1471
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Why not?

1472
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh,

1473
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
we should.

1474
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I know

1475
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Flight of the Concord.

1476
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You know

1477
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Lord of the Rings.

1478
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000

Fucking

1501

I promise.

1502
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Like America is so

1503
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
different.

1504
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It is so fucking different

1505
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
being here.

1506
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
America is basically

1507
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
a continent.

1508
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It is.

1509
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It is pretty much

1510
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
like the thing

1511
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
in New Zealand is that

1512
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
everyone knows everyone.

1513
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Like

1514
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
the common thing is

1515
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like two degrees of

1516
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
separation.

1517
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Like the friend of your

1518
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
friend like knows

1519
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
like if you

1520
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
if you took all your

1521
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
friends and took all their

1522
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
friends,

1523
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
that's the whole country

1524
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
basically.

1525
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Like

1526
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and because of that

1527
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
like it's common

1528
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
like for just to just

1529
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
end up on TV

1530
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
like that.

1531
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Really?

1532
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah.

1533
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Like my parents have been

1534
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
like interviewed on like

1535
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
live television a few times.

1536
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Actually maybe that's

1537
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
not as common.

1538
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Maybe that's just a thing

1539
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
my parents did.

1540
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But I don't know.

1541
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Wait.

1542
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
All right.

1543
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm looking into the size

1544
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
because I'm

1545
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I thought it was

1546
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
like the same size

1547
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
as the UK.

1548
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Turns out

1549
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
United Kingdom

1550
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
243,000

1551
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
square kilometers.

1552
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
New Zealand

1553
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
268,000

1554
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
square kilometers.

1555
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So it's ever so

1556
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
slightly bigger

1557
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and it you're saying

1558
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
everybody knows

1559
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
population is small.

1560
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

1561
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Actually, yeah, of course.

1562
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
There's like loads of farmland

1563
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
there or something.

1564
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's mostly farmland

1565
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and mountains and forest

1566
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and like a few cities

1567
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and like a fifth

1568
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
of the country is in one city.

1569
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I mean, how much of America

1570
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
lives in big cities?

1571
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's like a lot of it, right?

1572
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Population of the UK

1573
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is 67 million

1574
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
population of

1575
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
new.

1576
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is like 5 million.

1577
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh,

1578
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
wall.

1579
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Owned.

1580
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We have more people

1581
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
than you that

1582
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
therefore we need

1583
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
where we're suffering

1584
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and people are starving to death.

1585
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We have more sheep than people

1586
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and we'll trample you.

1587
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Is that true?

1588
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, we do.

1589
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
We have like several times

1590
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
more sheep than people.

1591
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Do they vote?

1592
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes.

1593
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well,

1594
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
if only if only if a human

1595
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
marries them,

1596
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
they can vote.

1597
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's fucking you.

1598
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
My parents

1599
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
are trying to tell me to vote

1600
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
in the New Zealand election

1601
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and I have no idea

1602
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
what the fuck is even going on

1603
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
in that country right now.

1604
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm not going to...

1605
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Are you guys

1606
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
in the midst of a

1607
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
fascist coup right now?

1608
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
New Zealand is like...

1609
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, that's cool.

1610
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I always like...

1611
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I wonder how that feels.

1612
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I always assumed

1613
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
because New Zealand is

1614
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
like extremely progressive

1615
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
but I didn't know that growing up

1616
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
because like my family

1617
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
was always like sort of

1618
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
like center right-leaning

1619
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
but that's like right-leaning

1620
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
by New Zealand standards

1621
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
which is still pretty left.

1622
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah.

1623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So I'm like,

1624
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
America,

1625
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm sure if a right over there

1626
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
is pretty good probably

1627
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
yeah, healthcare,

1628
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
who needs it?

1629
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I don't have that.

1630
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It turns out,

1631
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I actually did.

1632
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It turns out I had

1633
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
universal healthcare

1634
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
of a whole time

1635
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and no one told me.

1636
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It's like weird.

1637
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I go to America

1638
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and I'm like, oh.

1639
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Well, yeah,

1640
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
like why would they need to tell you?

1641
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Like obviously.

1642
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's going to cost

1643
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
$20,000 to stub my toe.

1644
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Actual statistic.

1645
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Look it up.

1646
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
No.

1647
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
A real statistic I learned

1648
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
is delivering a baby,

1649
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
$40,000.

1650
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, you want to hold the baby?

1651
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That's an extra $150.

1652
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh, you want to,

1653
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you want to kiss it on the cheek?

1654
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That's an extra thousand.

1655
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Wait, wait.

1656
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That can't be real.

1657
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They can't charge

1658
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
for delivering a baby.

1659
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I have heard this too.

1660
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I know.

1661
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I thought it has to be free.

1662
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But I looked it up

1663
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and several people have showed

1664
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
like people took screenshots

1665
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
of the bill,

1666
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
people who didn't have insurance.

1667
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
$40,000.

1668
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Unbelievable.

1669
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Just tell the child

1670
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
they'll have to work

1671
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
in the hospital.

1672
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's even more expensive

1673
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
to be born.

1674
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's even more expensive

1675
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
to be born than it is to die.

1676
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Probably not, actually.

1677
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Maybe it is.

1678
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't know.

1679
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's easy to die.

1680
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You get like a rock

1681
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and you just hit your head

1682
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
with it until you're dead.

1683
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't know if it's the same.

1684
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah, but then everywhere

1685
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
in America.

1686
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Insurance though.

1687
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
They got to clean your carcass up.

1688
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's not cheap.

1689
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Nah, it's easy.

1690
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You just drump in the

1691
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
drump in the ocean.

1692
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Drump in a bitch.

1693
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Cool.

1694
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I feel like I should have more

1695
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
to say about that,

1696
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
but yeah,

1697
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that's what's up.

1698
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The only other thing

1699
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
about New Zealand

1700
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
that I know

1701
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
is that they had

1702
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
a flag referendum

1703
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
not too long ago.

1704
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh, yeah.

1705
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
To get a better flag.

1706
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yes.

1707
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah, our flag looks

1708
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
just like the Australia flag.

1709
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You change one line, basically.

1710
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's embarrassing.

1711
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's really embarrassing.

1712
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
There was a competition

1713
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
to change the flag

1714
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and a bunch of people sent in designs.

1715
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So the New Zealand flag,

1716
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
the Australian flag

1717
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
basically just has one extra star

1718
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and the stars are white

1719
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
instead of red, right?

1720
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Is that the difference?

1721
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Yeah, something like that.

1722
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Is that the Pleiades

1723
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
on the flag?

1724
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's the Southern Cross

1725
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
for New Zealand, I think.

1726
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The flag referendum,

1727
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I was like all for it,

1728
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
but a bunch of people were like,

1729
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
yeah, but we don't like

1730
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
the Prime Minister

1731
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
at the current time.

1732
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
We don't like him.

1733
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
We don't like John Key.

1734
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So let's just vote no

1735
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
just to piss him off.

1736
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And I'm like, guys,

1737
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I just want a good flag.

1738
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Some of the designs are really cool.

1739
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I heard about it

1740
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
through the Hello Internet podcast

1741
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
where they talked about it.

1742
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, that's a good podcast.

1743
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah.

1744
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It is.

1745
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Worse than this one.

1746
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Don't listen to it.

1747
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Way worse.

1748
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Some of these,

1749
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I just, I looked up

1750
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
New Zealand flag referendum.

1751
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Some of these are like weird looking,

1752
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but I like them.

1753
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I like them.

1754
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
They're all like swirling.

1755
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, I like,

1756
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
because I think it was

1757
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
something to do with

1758
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
something,

1759
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
New Zealand.

1760
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Are you the answer, right?

1761
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

1762
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I think there was a reason

1763
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
that it was a certain way.

1764
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
No.

1765
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay.

1766
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I think it came down to,

1767
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't know if it was

1768
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the bottom left over top right

1769
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
in the end,

1770
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
but I liked both of those.

1771
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I liked the bottom left

1772
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
a little more, but.

1773
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The top right is almost too cool.

1774
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah.

1775
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's almost like video game,

1776
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
pirate crew sort of thing.

1777
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah.

1778
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I do like it though.

1779
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The bottom left one

1780
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
does look like,

1781
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I mean, that's just a pretty good.

1782
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah.

1783
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I remember,

1784
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I remember looking at these things

1785
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
and being like,

1786
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
all of them have some aspect

1787
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
that I really like.

1788
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The fur and the leaf,

1789
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but like the color choices

1790
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
with all of these,

1791
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
like I don't quite like

1792
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
all of this color choices

1793
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
that have the leaf.

1794
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And the black and white

1795
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
with the swirly is great,

1796
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
but it feels like it's

1797
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
missing some aspect of it.

1798
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah.

1799
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So the silver fern is like

1800
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
a huge like New Zealand icon.

1801
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Our rugby team has it

1802
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
as their thing.

1803
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And New Zealand is more

1804
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
recognized for the silver fern

1805
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
than it is for its own flag

1806
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
pretty much.

1807
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Because like our rugby team

1808
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
has like a ridiculous

1809
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
like win record.

1810
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
They win like,

1811
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I don't know.

1812
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's like something like

1813
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
80% of every game they win.

1814
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You know,

1815
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
New Zealand is a great rugby

1816
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
thing.

1817
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
They're always in the big six.

1818
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It would be really funny.

1819
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm not,

1820
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm imagining like,

1821
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
okay, Massachusetts has a shit flag.

1822
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Have you ever seen the

1823
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Massachusetts flag?

1824
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
No, how do you spell

1825
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Massachusetts?

1826
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Fucking America.

1827
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Don't even worry about it.

1828
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
American names.

1829
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I just have to say

1830
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
American place names.

1831
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Stupid.

1832
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't like them.

1833
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That's great.

1834
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That's racist.

1835
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's a Native American name.

1836
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I take it back.

1837
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I take it back.

1838
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You piece of shit.

1839
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I just about.

1840
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Massachusetts has two S's and two T's

1841
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and the rest sounds like it says.

1842
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Google fixed it for me.

1843
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Let me see this.

1844
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Massive cheats.

1845
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't like.

1846
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh, this is a weird flag.

1847
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah.

1848
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's a weird flag.

1849
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's not,

1850
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
it's not super exciting.

1851
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's not so bad.

1852
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I've seen worse.

1853
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You shouldn't have text

1854
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
on your flag though.

1855
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
No.

1856
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But like,

1857
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
like it's got two to three colors.

1858
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It doesn't look like a terrible

1859
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
garish piece of shit.

1860
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And it's got a shield.

1861
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So that's cool.

1862
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
My problem with it is like,

1863
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
this isn't a flag.

1864
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is a crest.

1865
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Right.

1866
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah.

1867
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's just white.

1868
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Like the crest is fine for what it is,

1869
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
but it's not a good flag.

1870
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
In my opinion.

1871
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So I'm thinking like,

1872
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
what if we.

1873
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I like that.

1874
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I like the blue and pink stripes though.

1875
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's pretty nice.

1876
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

1877
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Where did.

1878
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah.

1879
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
They must have hired someone real.

1880
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But,

1881
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but like,

1882
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
imagine they were like,

1883
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
okay guys,

1884
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
we need a referendum.

1885
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's time for a new flag.

1886
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And then it's like,

1887
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
hmm,

1888
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
what do we like here in Massachusetts?

1889
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Well,

1890
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
the Boston Red Sox are really popular.

1891
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So then like,

1892
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
we made like the new like Massachusetts state flag,

1893
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
like a pair of Red Sox or something.

1894
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And it's like,

1895
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
yep,

1896
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
because we like those guys.

1897
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We just made,

1898
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
we just based the flag on our baseball team.

1899
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Or hell,

1900
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you can have all the sports teams in there just on one flag

1901
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and like,

1902
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
that's it.

1903
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Just like put them all next to each other.

1904
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Make it one of those like,

1905
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
those patchwork jackets where you have like a million like

1906
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
band logos and emblems and things.

1907
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah.

1908
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
If I,

1909
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
if it wouldn't,

1910
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
if it wouldn't distract me,

1911
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I would go and like cobble together the new like

1912
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
state flag of Massachusetts right now.

1913
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It has to be made out of denim.

1914
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I will,

1915
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I will post it in the chat after,

1916
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
after I will make it afterwards.

1917
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It'll be,

1918
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
it'll take me five minutes,

1919
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
but it'll be very epic.

1920
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yes.

1921
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Right.

1922
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What the fuck are we talking about?

1923
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
We're talking about flag referendum.

1924
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't,

1925
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I don't think they,

1926
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
they didn't,

1927
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
yeah, they blocked it.

1928
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Didn't they?

1929
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
There was no new flag.

1930
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It didn't go through.

1931
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
People,

1932
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
it got blocked because

1933
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
young people were like,

1934
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
we don't like the prime minister.

1935
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Fuck you.

1936
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And old people are like,

1937
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
we're boomers.

1938
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Fuck you.

1939
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And that was it.

1940
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Did they like just,

1941
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
did people just like not want change?

1942
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I guess it almost went through.

1943
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It was pretty close.

1944
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I remember,

1945
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I was,

1946
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I was still living there at the time.

1947
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I voted on it,

1948
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
but yeah.

1949
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Cause everyone who knows anything in America

1950
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
wants us to stop making the penny.

1951
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
We don't need the penny anymore.

1952
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Oh, we don't.

1953
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
No, no you don't.

1954
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
We boomers are just like,

1955
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
no, it's got Lincoln on it.

1956
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And that's America.

1957
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay.

1958
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
What about national pride?

1959
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I've lived,

1960
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I've lived through coin destruction.

1961
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
The five cent coin in New Zealand

1962
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
got yeeted out around 2007

1963
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
or 2006.

1964
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Fucking good.

1965
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And it was fine.

1966
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Like we handed out,

1967
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
we handed out coins

1968
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and then everything was fine.

1969
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
In fact, it was easier.

1970
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And that's the five cent coin.

1971
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Did you like have to go

1972
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and like give them back?

1973
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I mean,

1974
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I mean, if you held on to them,

1975
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
they would just become worthless.

1976
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But if you hand them in,

1977
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
you can get an exchange.

1978
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So it's worth it.

1979
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
They would exchange.

1980
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

1981
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
They also updated all the coins too.

1982
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Like they completely redid the currency.

1983
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
They changed all the coins

1984
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to be a little bit lighter

1985
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and a little bit more like

1986
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
material efficient.

1987
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I think they did that.

1988
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They did that in England, I think.

1989
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah.

1990
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
In like the 70s or 80s or something.

1991
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Or like not that long ago.

1992
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah.

1993
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I mean, it was only like

1994
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
10 years ago in New Zealand.

1995
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And yeah, everyone,

1996
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
you just hand in your coins,

1997
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
they give you the new coins

1998
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and that's,

1999
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
it's easy.

2000
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's fine.

2001
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's not hard.

2002
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
They've done a few,

2003
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
like getting rid of things

2004
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
recently in the UK as well.

2005
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They've changed all the paper money

2006
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
to be like plastic money.

2007
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So it's,

2008
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
it's plastic.

2009
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah.

2010
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It feels different

2011
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
and it's more durable

2012
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
and doesn't crinkle and rumple

2013
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
over time.

2014
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh yeah.

2015
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And they changed the one pound coin

2016
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
to be a little different.

2017
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I think,

2018
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I can't remember what they did with that.

2019
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
All right.

2020
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Here's an idea.

2021
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
$2 coin.

2022
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We got that.

2023
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's pretty cool.

2024
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah.

2025
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We have a two pound coin as well.

2026
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I think,

2027
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't know if they have two Euro coins.

2028
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I thought they had like

2029
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
two Euro and five Euro coins.

2030
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I really like big,

2031
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
big value coins.

2032
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
High value coins are good.

2033
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I hate,

2034
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
like we,

2035
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
we have a $1 coin.

2036
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We have a couple of different $1 coins

2037
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
that are like technically valid

2038
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
currency in America,

2039
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but nobody uses them.

2040
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Everyone hates them.

2041
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm the,

2042
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm the only one.

2043
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm the only one who likes them

2044
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and I wish we had bigger coins.

2045
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
If,

2046
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
if I can't wait,

2047
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I can't wait for Trump to die

2048
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
so that we can commemorate him

2049
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
with the new like $5 coin.

2050
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's going to be so sick.

2051
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's on the back.

2052
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It says billionaires only, please.

2053
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It'll be the $5 billion coin.

2054
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah.

2055
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh my God.

2056
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That coin's sick.

2057
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Uranium.

2058
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I love that.

2059
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah.

2060
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I've always liked the two pound

2061
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
because it's like double,

2062
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
just silver and gold.

2063
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Two colors.

2064
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's,

2065
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
that's fucking sick.

2066
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
That's a,

2067
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I love,

2068
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
yeah,

2069
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I love the two color coins.

2070
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
They got them in Europe.

2071
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
They don't have those here

2072
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and I think they're nice.

2073
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The little gears in the middle.

2074
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So intricate.

2075
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's so like,

2076
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
it doesn't,

2077
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
it's weird how it's like abstract.

2078
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yeah.

2079
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I don't know why,

2080
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but they always have the queen on the other side.

2081
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So the heads is always the queen.

2082
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah.

2083
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
The head is on the other side for my team.

2084
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And the others,

2085
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and they're like,

2086
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
well, nothing else is worth

2087
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
minting on the other side.

2088
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So just throw a bunch of gears on there.

2089
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Fuck it.

2090
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah.

2091
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So it's the queen in our coin,

2092
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
even though we're not technically

2093
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
like,

2094
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
beholden to the UK anymore.

2095
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That's some,

2096
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Canada too.

2097
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Canadian money,

2098
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I think all has the queen on it.

2099
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Look at this old lady.

2100
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
After America revolted,

2101
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
when you,

2102
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
when New Zealand said,

2103
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
be independent,

2104
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
the UK is just like,

2105
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
yes, honey.

2106
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Did you know,

2107
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
this is probably

2108
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
recently,

2109
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
common knowledge,

2110
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
but did you know that as the queen is aged,

2111
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
they update her face to be older,

2112
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
to be more accurate to herself?

2113
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
No, I didn't know that.

2114
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So you can look at the back of a coin

2115
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
to see how old it is

2116
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
without looking at the year.

2117
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It'd be like,

2118
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
oh, she's young there.

2119
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
There was a video I saw

2120
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
that like showed like

2121
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
how the queen's face like changed on notes

2122
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
or coins over time.

2123
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And like early on,

2124
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
she was like,

2125
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
she had to be like a fucking kid

2126
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
at the beginning

2127
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
when they started.

2128
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, she was very young

2129
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
when she got the crown

2130
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and everyone was like,

2131
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
oh my God,

2132
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
it's so cool.

2133
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm watching on TV.

2134
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It was like the,

2135
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the reason,

2136
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
the reason most people in the UK.

2137
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The reason television was invented.

2138
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I mean, literally the first thing

2139
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
that people bought a TV for

2140
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
was to watch the,

2141
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
the coronation live.

2142
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That was, that was the selling point.

2143
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Epic.

2144
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That is so fucking cool.

2145
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
This is the longest running,

2146
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
take a picture of yourself every day,

2147
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
YouTube video of all time.

2148
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It's still being made.

2149
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Imagine like a time lapse.

2150
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I wonder if someone's made a time lapse

2151
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
of just like every year of the queen.

2152
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
There is.

2153
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I saw one a few months back.

2154
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I mean, on the coins.

2155
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I mean, with the coins specifically.

2156
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, maybe it might exist.

2157
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I don't think there are that many.

2158
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
There's like maybe every couple of years

2159
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
they would have one.

2160
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So maybe it would take a few seconds, but.

2161
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
My back when I used to play

2162
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
dwarf fortress,

2163
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
one of my favorite things to do

2164
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
was to have my dwarves mint coins.

2165
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And I would just look at them

2166
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and examine them and like see

2167
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
like what they decided to like,

2168
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
what images they decided to press

2169
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
into their coins.

2170
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
No, they would have like pictures

2171
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
of like historical figures

2172
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and pictures of like, you know,

2173
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
the king or pictures of like noblemen

2174
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
from like other places or hero like folk heroes.

2175
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Or like sometimes they would have like

2176
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
insignias from like the region they're in

2177
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
or like their country or like their town has every

2178
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
it turns out like every like town

2179
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and like principality has its own like logo

2180
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and sometimes you you find out what they are

2181
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
because they mint them on the coin.

2182
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You're like, oh, I see.

2183
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Like the national symbol of you know,

2184
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
bronze hammers is two diamonds

2185
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
in a pool of lava.

2186
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Nice.

2187
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Minecraft.

2188
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Epic.

2189
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Bringing it back around.

2190
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And then they and they and like

2191
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and you mint them out of different metals

2192
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and like they'll put different things

2193
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
on like the silver coin versus the gold coin

2194
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
versus the platinum coin.

2195
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So it's so cool.

2196
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So satisfying.

2197
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah.

2198
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But it's useless though.

2199
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Like they're used dwarf fortress used to have

2200
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
a thing called like the dwarven economy

2201
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
that was this whole like sub game

2202
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
within the game this whole system

2203
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
but it was like completely broken

2204
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and it got taken out.

2205
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So you can still like the dwarves

2206
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
would trade with each other for money.

2207
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So you can still make the money

2208
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
but it doesn't do anything.

2209
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's just like it's just bullying basically.

2210
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Like you can trade it away and that's it.

2211
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's a little disappointing.

2212
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Okay.

2213
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I said to go on a dwarf fortress.

2214
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm I'm every time dwarf fortress is brought up.

2215
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm like how could possibly have there been

2216
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
so many like things thought of to program

2217
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
to make that they have all of these different logos

2218
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
in the game that they could choose from

2219
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
to make when they decide to mint a coin.

2220
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's just like how could they do that?

2221
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
There's no way.

2222
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
There's no way that dwarves could have

2223
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
unique coin minting abilities.

2224
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And yet they do and yet they fucking do.

2225
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's so good.

2226
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's so big.

2227
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
How do they do that?

2228
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
They I mean I guess it's like the game

2229
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the game just generates all this shit.

2230
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It's like generates like a huge amount

2231
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
of like background information

2232
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
that like you will never be privy to.

2233
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, I really like like the idea that

2234
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
you generate the world and you see what you see

2235
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
but then like other like a whole list of like

2236
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
like the name of the place you're at

2237
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
or like the region and stuff like they come up

2238
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
with all this I guess they draw from a list

2239
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
of potential names for things

2240
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and then mash them together into like a list

2241
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
of those places and past kings or whatever

2242
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
that it keeps track of and then it just

2243
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
when it comes up it comes up.

2244
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It generates like the whole like geographical

2245
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and like geopolitical history of the world

2246
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
like from the beginning of creation

2247
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
to like whenever to whenever you're playing

2248
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and it knows like you know how different like

2249
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
leaders like founded countries and like how

2250
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
different countries like moved and like

2251
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
changed hands and like power was exchanged

2252
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and like who ruled each one and when and stuff

2253
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and it's because it like because it tracks

2254
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
like the individual like creatures right

2255
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
like the individual like creatures

2256
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
that like would let go on to become like

2257
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you know kings or you know whatever.

2258
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I mean there are there are common elements to it

2259
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
like there's always there's like the goblin empire

2260
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
always exists and there's always like a demon

2261
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
who was summoned at some point who usually

2262
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
is the leader of them but sometimes the demon

2263
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
can like be killed and like someone else

2264
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
might rule the goblin empire or something

2265
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you know but like yeah the specifics of like

2266
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
you know the different towns that they founded

2267
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
like it knows all that it decides like

2268
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
okay this one had this was called this

2269
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
this was its logo this is who ruled it

2270
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I love how it was founded it's these were like

2271
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
the battles it had against other towns.

2272
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It's just like my favorite thing because like

2273
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the real world is like that you look at the

2274
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
the etymology of like English town names

2275
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
they just mean like this guy's house was

2276
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
next to this river and he was his name was

2277
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
like sex and then it looks like sex and

2278
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
or something or Samson and then it'll be like

2279
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Samson forward or and then like the town

2280
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
name would be like like sounding similar to

2281
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
that and it's like wow this name that seems

2282
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
like a bunch of random syllables is just wasn't

2283
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
like normal language and it's all most of the

2284
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
towns were just so like what's this

2285
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
cliff town it's near a cliff

2286
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I like how you said it like you just see

2287
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
what you see like you don't like the only way

2288
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
you like know the history is like your dwarf

2289
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
makes a coin and you pick it up and you look at it

2290
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
and it's like oh yeah on this coin is an image

2291
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
of like you know George George

2292
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
like Mick Mick elf fellow the elf who

2293
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
became King of the Dwarven Empire between

2294
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
the years like 200 and and 410 who

2295
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
was slain by a bronze titan yeah the image

2296
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
depicts him being crushed under the foot of a bronze titan

2297
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
it's it's like oh cool I guess that

2298
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
now I know it's

2299
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
but it's like it's all there for you to

2300
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
like archaeologically dig up and that's

2301
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
it's just like real life you go to a

2302
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Wikipedia article of a place and you learn

2303
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
all about it and it's like wow that was

2304
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
not apparent at all you can you can make

2305
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
it I mean you can like generate a world

2306
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and then just go into like like I forget

2307
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
what it's called there's a mode where you

2308
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
can just basically like look shit up and

2309
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
you can look up like names and figures

2310
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and like just like look up like what's

2311
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
this kingdom who was its leader like what's

2312
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
their history look through that oh where

2313
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
did they live oh look at that town oh they

2314
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
had a battle against this other place who

2315
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
fought in the battle you know you can

2316
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
sort of just kind of dig through all this

2317
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
like information without not instead of

2318
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
actually like playing the dwarf game

2319
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
because who has time for all that shit

2320
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm looking forward to dwarf fortress

2321
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
too when they they get the heavy weapons

2322
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
guy I want them to when are they going to

2323
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
put dwarf fortress in smash when are they

2324
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
going to just have the little like

2325
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
dwarven smiley face just like be just

2326
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
like moving like like square to square

2327
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
just like creating a little square

2328
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
next to it that represents that's being

2329
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
mined out and like that's it that's its

2330
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
hitbox or whatever I don't know I have no

2331
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
idea what that would look like they'll

2332
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
figure the map would be very very

2333
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
interesting though the stage I mean what

2334
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
if yeah what if instead of like instead

2335
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
of the character they just had a map and

2336
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
them and like you know your smash

2337
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
characters are in the map but the map

2338
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
is like a grid based and like the little

2339
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
dwarves are going around the map like

2340
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
digging out and mining and like building

2341
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and rebuilding and filling in and stuff

2342
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and just like yeah changing up their

2343
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
fortress and whatever maybe they build

2344
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
some like arrow traps and like they

2345
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
shoot like ballistas at you at some

2346
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
point I don't know that'd be cool that'd

2347
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
be pretty neat right Sakurai you

2348
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
listening get on the phone with Tarn

2349
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000

2350
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
so he needs to make money now so I'm

2351
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000

2352
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
in in working out a deal with you I mean

2353
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
if you did mine probably get a little

2354
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
fortress it's kind of inspired minecraft

2355
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
a little bit so old old good new bed is

2356
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000

00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
it must have been it must have been in

2360
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
like the early days of dwarf fortress

2361
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
though because dwarf fortress has been

2362
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
developed for like what like 20 years

2363
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
or something right and something crazy

2364
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000

2368
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
mean I've been excited about some

2369
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
minecraft news outside of that because I

2370
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
don't know what a smash is I don't know

2371
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
what a Nintendo is but we're getting

2372
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
that that cave update that people have

2373
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
been asking for for years and lots of

2374
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
cool shit I don't know anything about

2375
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
that yeah it's quite recent they've been

2376
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
talking they've been the minecraft

2377
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Twitter has been making some videos with

2378
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
showing off a scree a creepy mob that

2379
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
appears to be like drawn to you by the

2380
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
sound you make not by sight which is

2381
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
like a different aspect he lives so far

2382
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
underground that he's blind and he

2383
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
attracts you down and yeah which is

2384
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
which is such wait like who is this

2385
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it's a new scary monster that in the

2386
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
cave update and like usually you play

2387
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
the game you jump around you break

2388
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
blocks because all of the enemies all

2389
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
of them only react when they see you so

2390
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
if you're not seen you're fine and now

2391
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
with this scary like sound man you're

2392
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
gonna have to think about like whether

2393
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
you're running and jumping in the deep

2394
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
dark depths and that's that's pretty cool

2395
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
make sense make sense pretty good pretty

2396
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
solid every time I see like an I hear

2397
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
someone talk about a minecraft update

2398
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I'll like see the game and I will like

2399
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
not see anything different about it and

2400
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
then when I do hear like what they added

2401
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'll be like really that like the last

2402
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
one I heard about was like the one that

2403
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
added the like pitchfork that it was

2404
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
like the fish update the Trident and you

2405
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
could have the tree at the Trident

2406
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
weapon that you could and I was like that's

2407
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
that's cool and all but like why like why

2408
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that I was like that's just like one

2409
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
small part of like they can they completely

2410
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
redid the oceans and like added a whole

2411
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
bunch of stuff yeah I'm aware I'm aware

2412
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
that there was more to it than than that

2413
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
but like I guess it's just that I didn't

2414
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
know how the oceans worked before so I

2415
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
couldn't really see the difference so

2416
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
that's probably why they didn't have

2417
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
anything in them before they had

2418
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
squids right there's like squids and

2419
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
gravel and that was and at some point

2420
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
they are they added the the the sea

2421
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
undersea like temp oh the ocean monument

2422
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
yeah ocean monuments those are kind of

2423
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
cool but yeah if I completely like

2424
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
redid the oceans and then they redid

2425
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
villagers and redid the never and now

2426
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
they're doing caves and all these

2427
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
updates are pretty good I like it

2428
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
villagers seems weird

2429
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
villagers seemed like a weird addition

2430
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
to the game to me they've been around

2431
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
so long they've been around since like

2432
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
2011 and they were really they were they

2433
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
sucked they were terrible but now they're

2434
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
kind of cool but I didn't like know about

2435
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
them and then when I found out they were

2436
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
in the game I was like why are these people

2437
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
walking around like why do you want like

2438
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
NPCs like in a village

2439
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
like I don't know like the more

2440
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I feel like the more I found out about

2441
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Minecraft the less I understood it

2442
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
because it seemed at first

2443
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
when I knew literally nothing about

2444
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I was like oh it's a game about

2445
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
building with blocks

2446
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and it's the natural environment and you

2447
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
dig for stuff and like yep got it

2448
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
but then like I don't know there's these

2449
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
other like sort of esoteric things in

2450
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
there like the villagers system and

2451
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
shit and it's like I mean that stuff

2452
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
still pretty surface level there is a

2453
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
like a lot of like other hidden stuff

2454
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
about Minecraft though that and redstone

2455
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and stuff yeah like the redstone stuff

2456
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
the Psycraft people and I don't know

2457
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I'm a big mind head is that

2458
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
the word I don't know the word is it's a

2459
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
blockhead probably blockhead yeah

2460
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
about you a blockhead uh well I'm

2461
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
glad you're not a fucking globe head

2462
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I know the Illuminati are trying to tell

2463
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
us that the earth's not the world is flat

2464
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
it just has six sides you know

2465
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
yeah

2466
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I believe in six flat earths

2467
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
all glued together

2468
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
cubically

2469
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
dude I got to the edge of Minecraft and I

2470
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
went 90 degrees and I played

2471
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Minecraft again

2472
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
started over

2473
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I you know

2474
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
speaking of video games

2475
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
that they should be in Smash Brothers

2476
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
a spore

2477
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
when I was waiting for spore

2478
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
when I was waiting for spore to come out

2479
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
they I was

2480
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
so hype because like

2481
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
you've both seen the

2482
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
the old spore video

2483
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
do you know what I'm talking about the one that

2484
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I've seen a little bit of it yeah

2485
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I watched it the old one that Will Wright did

2486
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
showing off the game before it was like

2487
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
really like finished

2488
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
but it's got it looks so cool

2489
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
it looks so robust it's so it looks

2490
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
the animations they work so dynamically

2491
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
it's so like wow how did they do

2492
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
that and then the real thing comes out

2493
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
and like half of that shit's gone there's no

2494
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
aquatic stage it's like it's just not the same

2495
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
it must have just faked a lot of it

2496
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
it's just bullshit

2497
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
it got bought out

2498
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
by a big company and the company

2499
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
fucked it

2500
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I think it was

2501
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
being made by EA from the beginning

2502
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
was it I remember it being bought

2503
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
by EA and then getting fucked

2504
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
but I don't know the details

2505
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I mean maybe EA had something to do with it

2506
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
but like I don't know

2507
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
if there was

2508
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
if like the stuff that you

2509
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
could see in the demo

2510
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
was possible

2511
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
there's no way that it would have

2512
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
been taken out like it's just the final

2513
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
product is like demonstrably worse

2514
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
in almost every way

2515
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I don't know like it's to the

2516
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
point that like if they had to cut all that shit

2517
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
for corporate reasons

2518
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
then like Will Wright could have like taken

2519
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
it and just like made a second game that was that other stuff

2520
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I don't know

2521
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
it was very bizarre but

2522
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
one of the things that you could do in it

2523
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
was you could do terraforming and you can technically

2524
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
do terraforming in the

2525
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
actual spore game but it sucks

2526
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
so bad

2527
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
at least in the base game I know there was expansions later

2528
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
but in the base game all you could do

2529
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
was like you could put down like stamps

2530
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
like you could fly around your

2531
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
your fucking

2532
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
you could fly around your fucking planet

2533
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
and you could just put down like basically

2534
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
stamps like basically little mountains that were like

2535
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
shaped like things like star shape

2536
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
or like spiral shape whatever and it sucked

2537
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
it's so fuck

2538
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
it's garbage Will Wright

2539
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
he shows in the demo he has like sliders

2540
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
that he can like dynamically change like

2541
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
the planets like water levels he can change

2542
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
he can change like

2543
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
he could like change the atmospheric

2544
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
composition in a way that would like

2545
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
dynamically change like the water level and it would

2546
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
like cause like he

2547
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
he does

2548
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
in the final game

2549
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
there is a there is a thing

2550
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
that you can do to like terraform a planet

2551
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
and basically it's just you like throw down

2552
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
an object

2553
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
and it like terraforms the planet and now it's like

2554
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
a habitable planet it's green it's lush

2555
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
oceans are blue great

2556
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
but that he talks about that being like like a

2557
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
late game like final thing

2558
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
in before that like

2559
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
you could terraform planet but like you would have to

2560
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
do it you know you would have to like throw

2561
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
down like

2562
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
volcanoes that would like release the right gases

2563
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
you would have to like increase the temperature to like get

2564
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
enough moisture in the air and like da da da da

2565
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
and add add add hydration and make it rain

2566
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
and like move all this stuff add life

2567
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
seed life let life spread over there

2568
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
do make uh uh uh uh

2569
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
what's the word bacteria start to grow

2570
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
and in the final game it's not that

2571
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
it's just like you like click up like you have

2572
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
money you click a button and like oh planets terraform

2573
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
just fix okay that's my

2574
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
spore rant but the thing

2575
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
one thing that I really wanted to do

2576
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
was he had this beam

2577
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
that you could terraform the planet like you had

2578
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
fine control like you could go to one little spot of it

2579
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and like pull it up and go next to it and like push it down

2580
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and you could like sculpt the planet and I was like

2581
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
oh man it would be so cool if I took one of

2582
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
those and I just made a cube and if

2583
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I just like sculpted the spherical planet

2584
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
into a cube and had a cube planet yes so

2585
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
that's where this was all going is it was going to be

2586
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Minecraft world uh but it never

2587
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
happened because will write

2588
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000

2589
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000

you opened it with saying a character

2602
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
that should be in smash spore and I'm like

2603
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
like like would you just

2604
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
dynamically change based

2605
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
on the battle that's happening and by the end

2606
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
they like the super smash is like to be

2607
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
fully evolved

2608
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
oh like they evolve right like

2609
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
they have like a bite attack and every time they bite

2610
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
they get like more dna points or whatever

2611
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and like you can like spend it on

2612
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
the fly like grow extra limbs or something

2613
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I'd be fucking neat that'd be neat oh

2614
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
dude you customize your

2615
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
character mid battle to make a giant like

2616
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
a penis creature is that

2617
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
the strat yeah that's the strat

2618
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I think I played spore

2619
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
for a little bit or maybe I just watched a let's

2620
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
play but it was definitely big

2621
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
penis is involved

2622
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
there might have been the game grumps um

2623
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
yeah probably well I remember that

2624
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Russ was playing or something oh no

2625
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I can't remember but that was fun

2626
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I think that's the only spore let's play ever

2627
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
saw and it was pretty funny

2628
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
they just made like dicks and

2629
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
butts and it was

2630
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
really funny and I was like hey that's

2631
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
a good game yeah

2632
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
you can make him hold his own balls

2633
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
as he walks around and his penis is a foot

2634
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
has a foot so like jack hammers down when

2635
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
he walks

2636
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
just like me

2637
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
oh oh well your penis has

2638
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
a foot yeah I thought you meant I thought you said is

2639
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
a foot I mean the penis has a foot on the end

2640
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
of it and so when you walk like your back legs

2641
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
walk normally but your front foot is like

2642
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I made I made a mistake

2643
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I misunderstood dab

2644
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
dab dab

2645
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000

how high energy are you feeling

2654
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I'm thinking like a low to mid

2655
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
two degrees

2656
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000

2657
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000

oh here's here's the thing

2662
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
on the last PCP episode

2663
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
it was like September 13th

2664
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I think

2665
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
the next day

2666
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I announced on this is when we recorded

2667
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
the last episode that I was on

2668
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
the next day I talk about

2669
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
how I'm trans now and so I

2670
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
realized I haven't been on the PCP since

2671
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I made that tweet so people

2672
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
aren't aware lol

2673
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
there's just an update

2674
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
for you I

2675
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I don't remember I think

2676
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
me and Tom mentioned it

2677
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
a little bit you might have like briefly

2678
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
discussed that it was a thing that occurred

2679
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
was that in the most recent one

2680
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
with cyber shell

2681
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
maybe or one of them I haven't finished watching

2682
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
that one yet but yeah anyway um

2683
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
yeah

2684
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I am

2685
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I am one of those

2686
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
pretty epic

2687
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't really know what to say about it

2688
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
there's a lot of aspects and I don't know

2689
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
whether people give a shit

2690
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
in the comments let us know if you give a shit

2691
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
if you give a shit

2692
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
put a comment

2693
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
if you give a shit

2694
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
give a little bit

2695
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
give a little bit of shit

2696
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I've only had a few little like trans

2697
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
thoughts in my head ever

2698
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
trans thoughts

2699
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I think I had a dream

2700
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
when I was like 11 and in the dream

2701
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I was just like a girl

2702
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
in some kind of mech

2703
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
suit thing and I don't know

2704
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
it was nice but also

2705
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
a penis good I want to keep it

2706
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I think that was

2707
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I think that was just the end of Metal Gear Solid

2708
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Peace Walker

2709
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
maybe

2710
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
yeah I mean I used to have

2711
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
like thoughts like that

2712
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
it's like what if I was a girl but I always assumed

2713
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
that was just like a thing and everybody did

2714
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
and maybe it is

2715
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I don't know if it's a thing

2716
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
it was always weird like

2717
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
after I decided

2718
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
like you know all of these things they're clearly leading

2719
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
to this one thing so I'll just say it

2720
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
get it over with saying it

2721
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
it's funny

2722
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
but then like what about my actions

2723
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
in the past

2724
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
like was an indication

2725
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
of this or was it

2726
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
could all of them have been

2727
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
like not related at all

2728
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and I was

2729
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
just thinking about that a lot like

2730
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
what about what I did

2731
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
was like indicative of that

2732
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
there's a few things that are very obviously

2733
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
weird like girly

2734
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
things that I wanted to do

2735
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
like this one time

2736
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I really wanted this

2737
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
at the gift shop

2738
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
from this zoo

2739
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I think and I wanted a penguin purse

2740
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
there's a little blue fluffy

2741
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
penguin purse

2742
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and my parents were like

2743
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
are you sure you want that

2744
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
that's not very cool

2745
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
maybe you'd like a toy dinosaur

2746
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
instead you know something cool

2747
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
and I'm like what

2748
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I didn't realize that it wasn't manly

2749
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
to have a little pink

2750
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
a little blue fluffy penguin purse

2751
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
to put my coins in

2752
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
but I don't know whether that was like

2753
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
a gender thing

2754
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
who says a man can't have a purse

2755
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
exactly like it really

2756
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I don't think there's any like hard and fast

2757
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
like oh this was a sign

2758
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and this wasn't like it's just

2759
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
it's a very complex

2760
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
web of stuff

2761
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I don't fucking know

2762
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
sometimes you just want

2763
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
big booby mommy milkers

2764
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
and that's it you know

2765
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
forget about the trans stuff

2766
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
although there are like a hundred thousand trans

2767
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
people in big booby mommy milkers

2768
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
it's very trans inclusive

2769
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
very trans positive

2770
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
update on that server

2771
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
it is turned into an ERP server

2772
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
there's just people fucking each other constantly

2773
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
it's completely debaucherous

2774
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
like the worst

2775
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
like AK the best and based

2776
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I you know

2777
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
you know

2778
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
that's cool

2779
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I guess

2780
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I'm in there I had sex

2781
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
one time and I thought gay

2782
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I'm just gonna be the growth man

2783
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I have not had sex

2784
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
just like in real life

2785
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I will never consent to sex

2786
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
if you do question mark size

2787
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
question mark size it'll tell you how many times

2788
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
you've had sex

2789
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and there are a few people who are trying to maximize

2790
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
that number by fucking everyone

2791
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
all the time it's really funny

2792
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
it's my favorite video game

2793
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
for having sex

2794
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
number go up

2795
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
okay yeah sure

2796
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I mean I understand

2797
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
that is all the motivation

2798
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
that's really required

2799
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
it's just really funny like at first

2800
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
the server does having bigger boobs

2801
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
make it easier to have more sex

2802
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
no

2803
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
but it is just fun to have

2804
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
the way to have sex

2805
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
alright here's the two avenues to sex

2806
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
one

2807
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I want it to be like

2808
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
cookie clicker where it's like

2809
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
you start having sex

2810
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
you have lots of sex but then you're like

2811
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
man if I can make my boobs bigger

2812
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
that will increase my rate of sex having

2813
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
yeah every time you have sex you have

2814
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
three times as much sex

2815
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
every time you have sex you get bigger boobs

2816
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and every time you get bigger boobs you have more sex

2817
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
so it's like mutually encouraging

2818
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
a cycle

2819
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
mutual reinforcing systems

2820
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
crazy

2821
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
until you're having more sex than there are

2822
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
atoms in the universe

2823
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
an exponential rise

2824
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
to infinite sex

2825
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
we could add that

2826
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I mean it's really funny

2827
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
add infinite sex to the bottom

2828
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
please

2829
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
it's really funny like watching

2830
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
the progression of the server

2831
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
go from haha this is all just for fun

2832
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
this is all just goofy

2833
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
to being like

2834
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I want to like people were like

2835
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
excited about the prospect of a

2836
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
exclamation

2837
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
question mark fuck command

2838
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
where like consent

2839
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
is not necessary

2840
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and somebody has to like sign up

2841
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
for that treatment they have to

2842
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
set race

2843
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
sex object

2844
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
set race sex object

2845
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
and then people can

2846
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
question mark fuck them at any time

2847
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
and the flavor text

2848
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
is like more

2849
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
raunchy and sexual

2850
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
and people are really into it and it's really funny

2851
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I like being a part of this

2852
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
horny on main is like

2853
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
actually cool

2854
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
so if you

2855
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
wanted to have the most sex

2856
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I assume you could just go where the sex objects are

2857
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
and just like it would be like

2858
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
exclamation point mining

2859
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
exclamation point fuck them over and over again

2860
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
you would and they also their number

2861
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
would go up

2862
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
okay if you want I mean listen

2863
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
this broken game design right we need to

2864
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
need to rebalance it needs a patch what you got

2865
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
to do is you have to you have surely

2866
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
you must have to like expend some kind of

2867
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
resource while having sex like you must

2868
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
you must have to like refill your

2869
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
your testicles or whatever

2870
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
whatever fuel it is that is

2871
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
required right just so

2872
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
the thing the thing

2873
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
one or the other I mean I would

2874
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I was thinking of like adding

2875
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
like a

2876
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
penis size stat

2877
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
somehow to the game that you could also

2878
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
like

2879
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
make bigger somehow

2880
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
but I think

2881
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
my thoughts initially

2882
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
were like I don't want

2883
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
people to be alienated

2884
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
too much from

2885
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
like okay like not everybody has

2886
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
a penis there are actual girls in the

2887
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
server

2888
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
and they like if I

2889
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
if the sex command includes

2890
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
like

2891
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
like mention of the penis

2892
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I was like that

2893
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
that won't work that would be like

2894
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
take you out of the experience

2895
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
because a lot of the initial like commands

2896
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
of the initial responses

2897
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
for like question mark sex

2898
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
and question mark accept is

2899
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
you hold hands

2900
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
or like you cuddle each other

2901
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and it's like whoa based

2902
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
so lewd

2903
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
and that was the joke

2904
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
and then it just actually just became

2905
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
fucking

2906
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
but

2907
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
you know

2908
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I could add penises in there

2909
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I think that would be a fun

2910
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
extra thing like a little toggle

2911
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
penis toggle

2912
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
toggle have penis the thing is then

2913
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
like if you don't have penis how do

2914
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
you have sex is it

2915
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
possible well I mean I'm sure

2916
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
surely we can figure

2917
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
something out

2918
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
surely there must be some alternative

2919
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
nipple pussy let's go

2920
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
like what

2921
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
is like what do the female

2922
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
have they have the vagina but they

2923
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
don't have little like nothing

2924
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
nothing they have nothing else

2925
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
everyone has a butt

2926
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
it's true that you can expend

2927
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
your butt resource he's right

2928
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
you know okay

2929
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
how can we solve

2930
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
this problem of how to

2931
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
have sex without penis

2932
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
with regards to having

2933
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
with regards to having

2934
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
a resource specifically because like

2935
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I don't know

2936
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
what do the lesbians do they just sort

2937
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
of squidge together

2938
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
they get maybe a dildo

2939
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
a dildo

2940
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
you just get a dildo you gotta

2941
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
have a dildo I mean I guess in real life

2942
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
the thing you're expending is like energy

2943
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
because it's exhausting to do

2944
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
so much of it to fuck

2945
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
a thousand times a second

2946
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
if you spam click

2947
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
question mark fuck

2948
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
over and over again

2949
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
are people botting?

2950
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
people aren't botting that

2951
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
people are doing the

2952
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
question mark squeeze to make their breasts bigger

2953
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
in the titty bar

2954
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
excellent good

2955
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
but nobody's botting as far as I know

2956
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
you could have like a libido

2957
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
resource or something like that that's like a secondary

2958
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
maybe I don't know if that would be good

2959
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I'm not a gay man

2960
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
yes that that could work

2961
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
so you can only sex when there's

2962
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
libido is high enough

2963
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
game mechanics

2964
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I guess it would like refill automatically but maybe

2965
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
you can accelerate it by doing certain things

2966
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
perhaps

2967
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
yeah like chugging

2968
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
libido pills

2969
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
what are those things in like dojins

2970
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
they always have where it's like I gave you

2971
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
these secret pills that make you

2972
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
want to have sex more

2973
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I gave you the penis having pills

2974
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
no not those

2975
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
those are different pills

2976
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
they're like

2977
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
they call them like aphrodisiacs that's the one

2978
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
you chug aphrodisiacs

2979
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
to get your libido back

2980
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
so you can fuck more

2981
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and it's like I'm imagining like a black market

2982
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
developing of like people

2983
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
like it's a limited resource

2984
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
and you have to like you have to work for it

2985
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
you really gotta like what are you going to do for me

2986
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
if I give you these aphrodisiacs like I just

2987
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I gotta have my fix because I want to fuck

2988
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
maybe you could trade

2989
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
like the estrogen pojins

2990
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
for aphrodisiacs like if one person

2991
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
wants to prioritize one over the other

2992
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
yeah you could

2993
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
maybe you could like transmogrify

2994
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
an estrogen pojun into an aphrodisiacs

2995
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
so you can decide to get bigger breasts

2996
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
or you can get some stuff

2997
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
to fuck more

2998
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
choices this is good

2999
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
like game design talk

3000
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
you know what other game was designed

3001
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Minecraft

3002
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
oh my god it was

3003
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
hmm

3004
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
they should add sex to Minecraft

3005
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
um

3006
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
wait they didn't

3007
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
wait then who what have I been doing

3008
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
like dude

3009
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
you know you can put your Minecraft bed

3010
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
next to someone else's bed

3011
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
and then it becomes a big bed

3012
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
oh does it actually become a big bed now

3013
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
somebody

3014
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
it just looks like it

3015
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
somebody said like hey did you

3016
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
see what happens when you use

3017
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
sleep on Minecraft

3018
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I assume they mean like the jigglypuff sleep

3019
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
yes he gets in a bed

3020
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
oh well okay I thought that might be it

3021
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
he puts down a bed and goes to bed

3022
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
it goes to sleep when he jigglypuff

3023
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
uh

3024
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
sings at him which is funny

3025
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
does he actually like put a bed down

3026
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
or does he just become

3027
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
he puts a bed down and gets in it

3028
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
oh something

3029
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
a secret Minecraft strat

3030
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
that few people know about

3031
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
that I discovered by accident and many of my friends

3032
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
we don't use it for Minecraft sex but you could

3033
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
in your options

3034
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
you can actually you know how your Minecraft skin

3035
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
has like an outer layer and an inner layer

3036
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
have you ever mastered that before

3037
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
don't really use it

3038
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
because it never looks that good

3039
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
basically your skin can have two layers to it

3040
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
there's like an inner layer and an outer layer

3041
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
if the outer layer can have transparency

3042
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
it's usually used to like make hair stick out

3043
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
slightly further or something like that

3044
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
what you can do is in game

3045
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
you can go to your options and you can actually turn off

3046
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
the outer layers

3047
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
so you could design your character to be

3048
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
naked underneath and then put like clothes

3049
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
on the outside

3050
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
and then you could climb into bed with another

3051
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Minecraft player and go into your options

3052
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
and just slowly turn the other layers off

3053
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
it's doable

3054
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
there would already be like

3055
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
client side though they wouldn't know

3056
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
oh no it works it works on servers

3057
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
my friend made his head is a

3058
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
giant like colon V looking thing

3059
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
oh of course

3060
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
occasionally he'll walk up to me and he'll just go

3061
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and his head turns black because he'll turn that off

3062
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
and he does it to scare me

3063
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
and it's actually scary

3064
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
he scares me

3065
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
yeah

3066
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
that's cool

3067
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
server side like you can see whenever people

3068
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
turn their things on and off

3069
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
guys here's a big question

3070
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
when having sex in Minecraft

3071
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
spherical boobs

3072
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
or square boobs

3073
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
that's tricky that's a tricky question

3074
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
wait what say that again

3075
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
when having sex in Minecraft

3076
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
do you go for the

3077
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
spherical boobs or the square boobs

3078
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
the spherical out of this world

3079
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
literally

3080
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I don't

3081
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I mean

3082
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
where do I compare the two

3083
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
the thing is with spherical boobs

3084
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
they break the law of Minecraft

3085
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
they cannot have curves in Minecraft

3086
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
unacceptable

3087
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
on the other hand square boobs

3088
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
look stupid

3089
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
and not attractive in any way

3090
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and it's really funny when people draw all have

3091
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
like

3092
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
some of the like Minecraft

3093
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
source filmmaker porn

3094
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
are you talking about a slippery tea

3095
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I don't know any of the things

3096
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I just know that they exist

3097
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I never looked at them

3098
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
never

3099
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
never looked at them recreationally

3100
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
at least

3101
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it's just really funny seeing that

3102
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
they animate these like

3103
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
ooh so hot

3104
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
and it's the Minecraft girl and she's got

3105
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
like

3106
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
cuboids coming out of her chest

3107
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
and it's like oh yeah

3108
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
cuboids like no it's stupid

3109
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
um

3110
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I mean yeah it's stupid

3111
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
but

3112
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
everything is stupid

3113
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
you know what you're right everything is stupid

3114
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I don't know why I have such a thing

3115
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
against cuboid breasts

3116
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
some of our listeners

3117
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
might have cuboid breasts

3118
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
and they will probably have their feelings

3119
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
always

3120
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
please don't cancel me

3121
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
our Minecraft audience is going to be

3122
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
uh it's going to be up in arms

3123
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
oh no

3124
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
they can be furious

3125
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I made

3126
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I made a tweet earlier

3127
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
and I think it might have been misinterpreted

3128
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
really

3129
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
a tweet misinterpreted

3130
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
maybe well I don't know

3131
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I'm not sure

3132
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I wrote I tried to join an org

3133
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
last week and they straight up took my info

3134
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
and never got back to me because this is a thing

3135
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I did

3136
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
an org like an organization

3137
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
like a mutual aid

3138
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
not an orgie

3139
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
see that's what I think some people might think that I meant

3140
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I think some people might think it was a typo

3141
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
and I was saying that I tried to join an orgie

3142
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I did not

3143
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I did not

3144
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
do that

3145
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
there is a

3146
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I see these

3147
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
signs on lawns around

3148
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
in my neighborhood

3149
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
for a thing called

3150
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
sex

3151
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
yeah it's called sex

3152
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and I thought hmm I should try it sometime

3153
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
it is for

3154
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
the organization is called

3155
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
mutual aid

3156
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Medford and Somerville

3157
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
because that's the area I live in

3158
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
that

3159
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
so it's a mutual aid org I guess

3160
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
and I was like

3161
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I wonder what that is so when I looked at their website

3162
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
and you know there was like a thing

3163
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000

okay

3212
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I just had to complain about that

3213
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
what's oblivion fall

3214
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000

01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
right yeah I do

3216
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
did you have some shit

3217
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I don't even know

3218
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
we sort of talked about some of it already

3219
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
there was like another thing

3220
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
with the PCP references being hidden in things

3221
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
one that I don't think

3222
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
anyone knows about is

3223
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
an heir to the come throne

3224
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
which is the second comes on video

3225
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
is that the one with the boobies

3226
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
no that's the one with the dick masterson

3227
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
yeah the dick masterson one

3228
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
that's been seen by two million people

3229
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
and those two million people

3230
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
have unwittingly seen

3231
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
horseshoe finale without realizing it now

3232
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
why

3233
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
how okay so

3234
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
all the videos have a bit of like a psychedelic

3235
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
backdrop to them right

3236
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
you have a kaleidoscope effect yeah

3237
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
and I took horseshoe finale

3238
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I sped it up really fast

3239
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and that's it

3240
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
and that's what I did for the video

3241
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
no shit

3242
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
yeah every so often you'll see like an arm poke out

3243
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
and it's just Jesse

3244
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
well they haven't

3245
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
you say they've, is it the whole video

3246
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
just sped up yeah the entire video condensed

3247
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
into like two minutes that's so fucking

3248
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
funny okay

3249
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I see I see the hand

3250
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
well the cool thing is like he has so many posters

3251
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
around his room that like when the kaleidoscope

3252
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
they look really cool

3253
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I just saw

3254
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
a face there's a face

3255
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
at um wait wait

3256
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
who is at

3257
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
one minute 18 seconds oh I

3258
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
had like extra things in there as well like

3259
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
okay there's just a still

3260
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
image of somebody's face yeah I had Chris

3261
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Ray Gunn's face in there because he reacted to

3262
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
the cumzone once also

3263
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Call Me Carson and

3264
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Mumki Jones a few random people I hid in there

3265
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
because there are people who had like reacted to it before

3266
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
and I was just referencing them but yeah

3267
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
that that was a thing I wanted to mention

3268
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
because it's PCP relevant it is

3269
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I can see the bookcase

3270
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
yeah

3271
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
uh yeah

3272
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I would never have noticed

3273
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
in a million years but

3274
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
it needs

3275
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
the only other interesting thing I guess

3276
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
is something like I guess

3277
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I discovered it recently or I rediscovered it

3278
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
it's something I forgot or repressed I guess it was

3279
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
uh an early

3280
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I don't know if you'd call this a red pill or a black pill but

3281
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
um you know

3282
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
like those TV interviews you see on the news

3283
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
sometimes where like the news presenter

3284
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
like who you see every week I mean

3285
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I say this I haven't watched the news in like 10 years

3286
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
but they're like talking to someone on video

3287
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
and like they're having a conversation back and forth

3288
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
like in two

3289
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
screens like yeah there's like two screens

3290
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
like not like a reporter on the scene

3291
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
like they'll be like interviewing like some person

3292
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
or like some professional or something about like

3293
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
a recent event maybe

3294
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
sure yeah my mother was on one

3295
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
of those news interviews ones and

3296
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
you assume that what happens

3297
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
is you know they just

3298
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
set up a live feed and they have a conversation

3299
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
but it's not what happens

3300
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
so this was like probably

3301
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
like 2004-2005 this happened

3302
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
but uh the news crew came over to our

3303
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
house the day before

3304
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
they sat my mother down in a chair

3305
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
and pointed a camera at her

3306
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
and they had someone read the

3307
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
questions and they recorded

3308
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
her answers and then they packed up and left

3309
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
the next day

3310
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
the news presenter

3311
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
read out similar questions

3312
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
um and they and they

3313
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
needed to have a conversation where if they played

3314
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
the clips of my mother like

3315
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
him talking back and forth and every time they needed

3316
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
to make a cut they'd cut to just the news presenter

3317
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
and then they'd cut back again um

3318
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
so that way it was like this fake live

3319
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
interview that was all staged

3320
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
um and the questions were also

3321
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
worded differently so that way like if it's

3322
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
like a contentious political issue and they wanted

3323
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
to look like oh you're dodging the question

3324
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
they'll ask you a slightly different

3325
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
question so that way it looks like you're not

3326
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
answering or something

3327
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
really that sucks

3328
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
it does suck and even

3329
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
worse version of this

3330
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
happened to my dad

3331
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
probably 2010

3332
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
2011 around that time

3333
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
it was a channel 9 interview so no one watched it

3334
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
we only have like free channels

3335
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
in New Zealand that people watch

3336
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
but um this was like another like

3337
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
political discussion about

3338
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
something um and like

3339
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
so my dad sits down it's like

3340
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
it was like a Jordan Peterson style interview

3341
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
was the one from a few years ago with the

3342
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
the lobsters and shit something like that right

3343
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
where you know oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

3344
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
it's like two people like like they're sitting on

3345
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
they're sitting like they have these little nice chairs

3346
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
and there's like a table in between them and it's like

3347
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
a back and forth they're in the same room right

3348
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
is it the is it the it's an Asian

3349
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
guy interviewing him and Jordan

3350
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
talks about like like women in

3351
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
like wearing lipstick and stuff is it that one

3352
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
it was the one I mean the Jordan Peterson

3353
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
style interview I'm thinking of is the one where he was

3354
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
with the blonde woman and

3355
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I don't know I don't know if I've seen

3356
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I don't know it was like there's a few years ago

3357
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
people memed it a bunch I saw a bit of it

3358
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
but yeah imagine interviews sort of

3359
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
like that where it's like two people in a room

3360
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
and there's like a table between them and they're just talking

3361
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
um you know shot reverse shot camera

3362
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
so my dad

3363
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
goes in the lady shakes its hand

3364
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
and they sit down and they're like all right you know nice

3365
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
to meet you okay now we're gonna go through the questions

3366
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
and immediately the lady

3367
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
starts screaming like

3368
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
very angry like oh how dare

3369
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
you think this opinion what do you think about this

3370
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
you idiot you you hate

3371
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
women you you know you know whatever like whatever

3372
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
the discussion is like throwing and hurling

3373
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
insults yelling being aggressive

3374
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
and my dad is like flushes like he's like taken

3375
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
him back like whoa what the what the what the fuck is this

3376
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
um and then he like you know he

3377
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
loses his composure but you know he tries to answer

3378
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
the question as best he can and the lady

3379
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
so so it's not not the interviewer

3380
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
it's like the person who's like interpreting

3381
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
the interview questions for well no this time

3382
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
it was the actual interviewer in this

3383
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
occasion okay um the last time they sent

3384
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
someone over to my family's house is a proxy this

3385
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
time my dad was in the studio with the actual

3386
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
person and so this interviewer lady

3387
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
was being super aggressive and yelling

3388
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
and you can see that my dad is

3389
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
a little bit flustered um

3390
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
you know he looks a little bit taken aback

3391
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
but he answers her questions and I assume

3392
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
he did a good job and then after they're

3393
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
done like she immediately

3394
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
like a switch she's calm again she's like all right

3395
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
you know thank you for the interview and as my

3396
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
dad's leaving he turns around

3397
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
he sees the lady sit back down and they

3398
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
record her asking the questions again

3399
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
but this time really calm and polite

3400
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Jesus so

3401
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
when you see it on the

3402
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
on the TV it's like she's talking

3403
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
it's crazy that that they would do it

3404
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
just right there in front of it yeah

3405
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
they wouldn't even try to hide that from him

3406
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
that's no I guess I guess

3407
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
this is a routine no they can get away with it

3408
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
fuck yeah and so when you see it on

3409
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
television she's all calm and polite

3410
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
and my dad's looking all flustered and it's like

3411
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
this idiot it's like

3412
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
damn what did she want to like get him for

3413
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
uh there's talking about

3414
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
some thing I don't remember what

3415
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
it was it was

3416
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
my dad was a controversial figure he's like a

3417
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
philosopher guy he's got a phd

3418
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
um and like moral

3419
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
ethics and they were talking about some like ethical thing

3420
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
it might have been related

3421
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
to euthanasia or like

3422
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I don't know something

3423
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
okay sure but uh yeah

3424
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and uh

3425
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
obviously these clips they're on the internet

3426
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
yeah like you can't

3427
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
find them like no one fucking watches channel 9

3428
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
but yeah

3429
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
my dad told me about it and I was like that's fucked dude

3430
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
uh that reminds

3431
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
me

3432
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I mean uh makes me wonder about

3433
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
that thing I don't know if you happen

3434
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
to see that that Nancy Pelosi

3435
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
clip from like a couple weeks ago

3436
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I don't know it's been floating

3437
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
there's a there was a someone

3438
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
was in it was talking to Nancy Pelosi

3439
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
on the um

3440
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I don't fucking know what network

3441
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
but they asked they asked her a question

3442
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
and she's just like

3443
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
stares like I know there can be like a

3444
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
delay or something oh right

3445
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
yes and she just stares for they ask

3446
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
her a question and she's like

3447
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
good morning good morning it's Sunday

3448
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Sunday yeah no no no it was weird

3449
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
good morning Sunday morning

3450
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
so I mean the program I don't know

3451
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I guess that makes it well

3452
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
maybe some weird shit happened and it

3453
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
made sense at the time and it wasn't just

3454
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
like her going senile or something yeah

3455
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
we'll never know like we'll never know

3456
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
you never know like obviously some of the conversations

3457
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
you see on TV have to be real like when they're

3458
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
having like proper arguments and stuff like some

3459
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
of it has to be live but I wonder how much

3460
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
of it is like just pre-recorded

3461
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
where they've like manipulated it in some way

3462
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
yeah

3463
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
because that happened both time my parents

3464
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
were on like TV for stuff like this

3465
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
and like that's just New Zealand

3466
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
you know and the techniques

3467
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
have advanced it's been like over 10 years

3468
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
it's kind of cool it's kind of cool to imagine

3469
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
it like I don't know

3470
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I don't know what you said before about how everyone knows each other

3471
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
so like

3472
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
it's not that uncommon to just end up on TV

3473
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
well yeah but

3474
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
you all kind of like know everyone or know

3475
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
someone who knows everyone

3476
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
has at least one relative or friend of a relative

3477
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
who was in Lord of the Rings

3478
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
right like you were an extra

3479
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
you helped make like the armor for the orcs

3480
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
or you were a fucking like animator

3481
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
like I um one of my best friends

3482
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
growing up his aunt

3483
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
like animated the spiders

3484
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
in the Hobbit movies and she recommended me

3485
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
to go to a certain school that she went to and I went there

3486
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
yeah and when I was

3487
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
yeah and when I was there like some guy from Weta

3488
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
like came over and was like hey guys here's how we made

3489
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
a Abraham Lincoln vampire

3490
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
hunter and I don't know

3491
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
give some presentation

3492
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
how strange

3493
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
yeah I remember

3494
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
do you remember

3495
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
or have seen the um

3496
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
the Lindsay Ellis trilogy

3497
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
of the Hobbit movies

3498
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
and how the

3499
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
like they

3500
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
have fucked a lot with

3501
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
the workers rights of New Zealand

3502
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
errs

3503
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
yeah I did watch that

3504
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I didn't know about that until I saw her video

3505
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
and I was like fuck that's

3506
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
that's stupid

3507
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
they're really good videos and I can't remember

3508
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
the points so I can't regurgitate them for the PCP

3509
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
they're pretty long

3510
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
and they're pretty yeah

3511
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I remember hearing a little bit about it

3512
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
at the time it's like people the New Zealanders

3513
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
like Lord of the Rings

3514
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
is extremely like tied to like

3515
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
like I guess national

3516
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
identity in a certain way we have very few

3517
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
things we're allowed to be proud of

3518
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
it's like being proud of your country

3519
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
a stupid cringe

3520
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
unless it's rugby or Lord of the Rings

3521
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
or Flight of a Concord I guess

3522
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
you're not allowed to be proud of your country because that's bad

3523
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
bad New Zealander

3524
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
they were talking about

3525
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
they were talking about

3526
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
they were talking about filming it

3527
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
and like somewhere else

3528
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
and everyone's like no no you have to keep it here

3529
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
we need it for vatorism and stuff

3530
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
yeah it was basically like

3531
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
like a

3532
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
like a monopoly thing like

3533
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
either you

3534
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
either you sweeten this deal

3535
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
by like undercutting

3536
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
workers union rights or whatever

3537
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
so we can film here for cheaper

3538
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
or we'll just film it somewhere else

3539
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
and of course a lot of a country

3540
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
is the like 5 second explanation of it

3541
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
yeah pretty much it's like do you want the film

3542
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
here or do you want workers rights

3543
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
and people voted no workers rights

3544
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
that sucks

3545
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
yeah we want

3546
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
it to make sense right if it's like

3547
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
a big part of the frickin

3548
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I don't know New Zealand economy

3549
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
is like Lord of the Rings

3550
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
and then

3551
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
and then it was and then it's such a shame

3552
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
that these movies weren't even good

3553
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
yeah they sucked they were awful

3554
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Peter Jackson got fucked

3555
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
they didn't give him any time

3556
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
to do the first one

3557
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I was watching

3558
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
the behind the scenes videos

3559
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
with Peter Jackson working on the movie

3560
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
as they were as the last

3561
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
as they're working on the last one they're like

3562
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
yeah we're gonna have like a free

3563
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
months of crunch time at the end or something

3564
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
like that and I'm like free months

3565
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
like I can barely handle a week for my projects

3566
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and I almost

3567
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
like if I had done

3568
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
what my parents wanted me to do I would have

3569
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
probably been working on those fucking movies

3570
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
like at least for the last one

3571
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
because I had like connections there

3572
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
and I'd gone to the same school that the other person

3573
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
went to like I could have applied but

3574
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I decided to do internet shit instead

3575
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
hooray

3576
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
sorry

3577
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
no it's good

3578
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
that's how I came to America it's epic

3579
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
oh that is pretty epic

3580
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I'm actually earning more money than I would

3581
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
if I had gotten a job there so

3582
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
it's fine

3583
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
wow just from internet stuff

3584
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
yeah like two big

3585
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
two big youtube channels

3586
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
simultaneously it's good

3587
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
you get some

3588
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
do you mind me asking about your

3589
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
payment models or whatever do you get paid

3590
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
like per project do you make like a salary

3591
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
um it's salary

3592
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
times two actually right now

3593
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
because there's da games

3594
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
and there's pencilmation which

3595
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
huge channel like 17

3596
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
million subscribers they were in youtube rewind

3597
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
last year they got like

3598
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I think they were in for the number free most viewed

3599
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
youtube channel of 2019

3600
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
crazy

3601
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
yeah like every video gets like tens of millions of views

3602
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
pretty much and they make like free

3603
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
a week um I put some

3604
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
pcp references in there too but they're

3605
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
really subtle I have to be sneaky about it

3606
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
ooh I haven't heard

3607
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
of pencilmation references

3608
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I know you did pencilmation

3609
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I saw a few episodes

3610
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
um I

3611
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I posted them in your chat

3612
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
uh Gib at a certain point like

3613
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
when they came out um I don't have the

3614
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
screenshots on me right now usually it's like

3615
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
for like one frame during an explosion

3616
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
like I'll make a certain piece of the cloud

3617
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
into the like brop face

3618
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
that was one I did um

3619
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
and there's one where there's like an abstract

3620
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
painting on the wall and I again changed

3621
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
it to look like the brop face like I just

3622
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
kind of changed the

3623
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
so it's just a bunch it's just a bunch of brop

3624
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
references mostly that

3625
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
it's I love it for one so

3626
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
easy to hide it's so versatile yeah

3627
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
yeah yeah I could see that

3628
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
it's such a simple like little shape with

3629
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
more specific pcp stuff like

3630
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
next time there's an explosion could you maybe have

3631
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
that spell out like patreon.com

3632
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I think

3633
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
one of the supervisors would notice if I did

3634
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
that

3635
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I don't like the thing is I don't animate

3636
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
the episodes but I kind of

3637
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
supervise every single stage like from

3638
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
storyboard to color to like

3639
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
through animation and I do like some

3640
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
re-timing editing and um

3641
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
so you can sneak a little thing in the background

3642
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I have accessed all the files yeah so like

3643
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
when the animator finishes and sends me the file

3644
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I can go in and like tweak stuff and I do

3645
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
because I usually there's certain problems that

3646
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
sometimes maybe the animators

3647
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
didn't do a good job fixing it so I'll go and fix

3648
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
it maybe there's like a coloring error and I'll fix

3649
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
that or and while I'm doing

3650
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
that I can like hide in little references

3651
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
one of my favorites is it's an episode

3652
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
that my friend made did

3653
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I don't know what it's called on YouTube but the

3654
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
production code was p migration

3655
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
there's a TV static

3656
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
and the TV static

3657
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
is the pcp theme

3658
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
audio wave just running by

3659
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
really quickly

3660
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I'll put it

3661
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
in the show notes you won't see it like you can listen

3662
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
to it or is it just like visual audio

3663
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
no like I opened it on audacity

3664
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
and I took a screenshot of the audio

3665
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
wave form and then I loaded it into

3666
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
flash and I converted it

3667
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I right I converted there's

3668
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
an option called trace bitmap that converts

3669
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
the bitmap into a vector image

3670
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
and then I like colored it like TV static colors

3671
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
and yeah that's that's in there

3672
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
it's like the most subtle reference ever

3673
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
but wonder if somebody

3674
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
could like reverse engineer that way

3675
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
how could you possibly even know

3676
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I'll get a

3677
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
screenshot it might take me a minute but you'll see

3678
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
it in a bit I know that

3679
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
wave form anywhere

3680
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
yeah I see

3681
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
it in my dreams actually I'll just

3682
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
link the video of the timestamp and then you'll know

3683
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
but based

3684
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
on that

3685
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
it's so cool that like

3686
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
people we know are so much cooler

3687
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
than us

3688
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
yeah agreed

3689
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I'm not I'm not cool as a person

3690
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I just work on cool things

3691
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
that's cool that makes you

3692
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
cool

3693
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
no you made a video about

3694
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
come and you got 60 million views

3695
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I'm the only cool one

3696
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
actually when you really think about it

3697
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
well good thing I don't think

3698
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
good thing I have no brain

3699
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
yeah yeah

3700
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
yeah

3701
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
okay

3702
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
there's a there's a timestamp the TV

3703
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
static when he changes the channel

3704
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I think that's the way form there are a few

3705
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
different way forms I think that last one was

3706
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
the PCP theme but yeah

3707
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
oh yeah yeah that in the TV

3708
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
when it's static II yeah

3709
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
string yeah I see it

3710
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I see it

3711
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
that's

3712
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
so

3713
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
like

3714
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
no one would ever know

3715
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
that's the fun thing about it is I know

3716
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
and no one else does until I tell them

3717
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
yeah

3718
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
pencil mate's great escape

3719
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
from the cold

3720
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
what is pencil mate is

3721
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
just kind of like just kind of goofy cartoons

3722
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
right it's goofy cartoons

3723
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
especially for the recent episodes

3724
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
the animation is actually really really good

3725
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
like we hire

3726
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000

3727
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000

3745
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
and he used to be a pony boy

3746
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
he did some pony animations

3747
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and he talked to Jesse a few times actually

3748
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
at a certain point

3749
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
pony animation

3750
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
imagine

3751
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
whoa he spoke to Jesse

3752
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
there's a PCP connection

3753
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
and that's cool

3754
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
well

3755
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I'm looking at Zurell

3756
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I'm trying to think what was the first

3757
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
oh it was Sanfages

3758
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
nine years ago god

3759
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
that was the first one

3760
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Sanfages 30

3761
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I think it was the Pinkie Pie Cupcake song

3762
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
oh yeah how do you make Sanfage

3763
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000

01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
take a couple flower but it was like

3765
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000

in the background

3864
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
there's probably like halloween themed songs

3865
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000

01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
and I 100% blame ben saint

3894
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
for that and I want ben to atone

3895
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
for his sins

3896
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
for making me say co-co-ro wish

3897
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
in real life

3898
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
it's his fault

3899
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
it's all of your faults

3900
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
so I expect

3901
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
compensation thank you very much

3902
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
keep making this podcast

3903
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
because if you don't I will actually

3904
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
kill myself

3905
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
don't do that

3906
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
that's cringe

3907
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
except

3908
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
god damn I'm

3909
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
so cringe

3910
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
he admits it

3911
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
just say co-co-ro wish

3912
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
more people need to say it

3913
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
he thought he was cringe for saying it

3914
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I normalize saying co-co-ro wish

3915
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I think it's more cringe

3916
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
than the other things he said

3917
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
co-co-ro wish is the only thing that was cool

3918
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
he was just being cool

3919
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
what else

3920
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
what did you do that was cringe

3921
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I felt bad about saying co-co-ro wish

3922
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
and then he said he was going to kill himself

3923
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
if we stop making the podcast

3924
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
that's fucking cringe

3925
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
yeah you're absolutely right

3926
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
next one is called

3927
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
please help me

3928
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
alright let's see

3929
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
about four months ago

3930
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I discovered a youtuber

3931
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
by the name of totally not mark

3932
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
he then

3933
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
decided to start reviewing One Piece

3934
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
so I started reading One Piece

3935
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
then youtube's algorithm

3936
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
recommended to me

3937
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
almost four hour long lecture

3938
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
about One Piece

3939
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and that was

3940
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
you guys

3941
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
and then I said right

3942
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I watched every other lecture

3943
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
from PCP University

3944
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
based

3945
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I've listened to many of your podcasts

3946
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
you've essentially ruined

3947
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
my life because

3948
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I just

3949
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
love listening to you assholes

3950
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
talk about nothing

3951
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
and I've started using based and cringe

3952
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
and just so many other

3953
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
things in my day to day life

3954
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I've alienated myself from my friends

3955
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
and family

3956
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I have no one who understands

3957
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
why

3958
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
son of a shoe is cringe

3959
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I have no one who understands

3960
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
why surskit is based

3961
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I've never even read fucking homestuck

3962
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
and I know everything about homestuck

3963
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
because of you people

3964
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
you've ruined my life

3965
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
and it's up to you guys to

3966
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
to fix it

3967
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
unruined my life

3968
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I have no social connections anymore

3969
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I spend all my time waiting

3970
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
until it gets trolled

3971
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
and hundreds of dollars

3972
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
on Animorphs books

3973
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
no

3974
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
it just cuts off

3975
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
it's the end

3976
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
you know alright

3977
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
there's an added layer

3978
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
of interest to that

3979
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
totally not mark

3980
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
is a guy

3981
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
who nexus mania edits for

3982
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
nexus mania friend of the show

3983
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
who has drawn a

3984
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
vape red in your vapers 2 book

3985
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
yes he did

3986
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
so everything's connected

3987
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
nexus mania now he's kai jukun

3988
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
right that's his new handle

3989
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
is that allowed

3990
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I didn't even know that

3991
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
yeah

3992
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
he changed his handle he commented on the last video

3993
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
because he left a voicemail

3994
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
yeah he's kai jukun

3995
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
interesting

3996
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
but that's serendipitous

3997
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
sounds familiar

3998
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
strange this is what happens

3999
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
when you're a big youtuber

4000
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
like us you get connected

4001
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
you're in with the elites

4002
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
it's funny we're like the most

4003
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
connected least viewed

4004
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
group of internet creators ever

4005
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I wonder

4006
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I don't know

4007
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I feel like our connections go a lot

4008
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
further than our podcast

4009
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
at least

4010
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
would suggest

4011
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I feel

4012
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
like you're right

4013
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I feel like you're right about that

4014
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
but also do you think that a lot of big

4015
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
youtubers exist completely

4016
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
in isolation and don't have

4017
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
any connection to anyone

4018
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
yeah they probably talk to each other

4019
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
all the time

4020
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I would imagine most of them probably know a few

4021
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I guess in regards to

4022
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
the ratio of bigness versus connectedness

4023
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
you're pretty good

4024
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
yeah

4025
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
which sucks I'd rather it be the other way around

4026
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I did stumble across a podcast once

4027
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
which was like a bunch of big

4028
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Disney animators and people

4029
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
and they were getting like 100 views

4030
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
an episode

4031
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
and they were quoting the PCP

4032
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
and like saying

4033
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
just be cool

4034
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
you know what Dinsney

4035
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
is actually cringe

4036
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
and they said

4037
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
that because of us

4038
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
saying it because we invented those words

4039
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
after he dropped out

4040
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
but Bernie was doing streams

4041
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
and he was getting like 300 concurrent viewers

4042
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
which is like

4043
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I've had more than that before

4044
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
so it's like

4045
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
was he playing

4046
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
yeah

4047
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Minecraft obviously

4048
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
we have to build a better society

4049
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
in Minecraft

4050
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I'm gonna build a better society in Minecraft

01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
yeah that's pretty good

4083
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
poggers uh I guess I would be

4084
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
longhorn steakhouse

4085
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
because I like me

4086
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
stupid

4087
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
fuck you is the answer to this question

4088
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I would be Aldi

4089
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I'm fucking Aldi

4090
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
it's not a restaurant

4091
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
it's not fast food but that's because I'm too

4092
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I don't I'm like the

4093
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
instead of going to fast food

4094
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I just go and I buy some raw avocados

4095
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
for 98 cents a piece and I just eat them whole

4096
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I mean that's pretty fast

4097
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
yeah it's

4098
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
faster if you know what you're doing

4099
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
if you're trying to speed run

4100
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
real answer water burger

4101
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
because what is a burger

4102
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
there you go

4103
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I've never had a water burger it's good I like it a lot

4104
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
they got good fries

4105
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
water burger gate

4106
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
you ever had five guys

4107
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I have it tasted like home cooking

4108
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
as in

4109
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
when I make it at home it's bad

4110
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
but it was okay

4111
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
it's fair it's fair

4112
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
a blast from the past

4113
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
chip

4114
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
on the subject of pornography that I will

4115
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
have been talking about for the last two episodes

4116
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
of the procrastinator's podcast

4117
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I Oliver Cromwell

4118
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
as the long dead ancestor of one Mr. Gibbenteek

4119
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
would like to speak up about the subject

4120
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
what the hell accent is this

4121
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
the fact that the wall sees pornography

4122
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
as something that's okay to exist in the world

4123
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
at all is a telltale sign

4124
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
of its corruption on our own natures

4125
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
now I'm also

4126
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
close to realising

4127
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
the runes affects the porn half

4128
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
on the soul of every living man and a woman

4129
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
whether they want to partake in it or not

4130
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
through the example of jaden animations

4131
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
but thou have us not

4132
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
realized

4133
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I can only pray to God

4134
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
that he will shine his light upon my faces

4135
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
oh well I'm off the chop off king Charles's head now

4136
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
have a good day

4137
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I feel stupid

4138
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
because I kind of missed

4139
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Gaby with you

4140
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
reverend

4141
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I kind of missed the

4142
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
crux of that the main point of that

4143
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
is saying something about jaden animations

4144
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
it was something about the jaden animations thing

4145
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
we got on a whole big

4146
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
thing about it

4147
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
yeah the thing about

4148
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
whether it's okay to draw porn of jaden animations

4149
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
answer yes

4150
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
my take is

4151
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
not a good look

4152
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
but you do you

4153
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I know one of the artists who did that

4154
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
why is it a bad look

4155
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
why is it a worse look

4156
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
than porn of anyone else

4157
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
because

4158
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
jaden won't like it and then she won't like you

4159
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
and if you don't want that to happen

4160
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
don't

4161
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I guess

4162
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
kind of think if she doesn't like it that's her problem

4163
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I know but I guess if you care about her

4164
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
opinion

4165
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I think what it is

4166
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
there's an implied caring about

4167
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
jaden animations if you are to draw

4168
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
porn of her you probably care about her

4169
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
or like her content or know about her in any way

4170
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
and so there's

4171
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
an implication that you don't want to piss her off

4172
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
or make her hate you

4173
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
that's why it's bad

4174
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I know who do a bunch of stuff

4175
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
their

4176
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
kind of thing is they just think that the character design

4177
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
is really cute and they don't really

4178
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
have attention to jaden himself at all

4179
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
so like there's not necessarily any

4180
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
problem

4181
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
for the artist

4182
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
they're like looting

4183
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
really cute simple character designs

4184
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
and they drew a bunch of stuff

4185
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
and art is pretty good

4186
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I'll say

4187
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
the reason I was conflicted in the first place

4188
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
was because the art I had found

4189
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
was very good and I was like damn

4190
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I don't know whether I'm allowed

4191
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
but then again nobody cares

4192
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
really nobody's watching me or judging me

4193
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
so it's like I guess it doesn't really matter

4194
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
yeah that's my take

4195
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
that's my take as well

4196
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
hey we got another one

4197
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
fuck

4198
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
the forbidden

4199
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
good day and good tidings

4200
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
gentlemen

4201
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
today we hear a tale

4202
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
as old as time

4203
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
once more repeated

4204
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
and not too long ago

4205
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
within a cave that stretches

4206
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
deep below the surface

4207
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
into the crust of the earth

4208
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
there lie a book

4209
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
of legend

4210
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
it was known in centuries past

4211
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
as the necronomicon

4212
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
book of the dead

4213
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
and so it was

4214
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
that an unlikely party of four

4215
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
only two nights ago

4216
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
would gather around the grave

4217
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
of a fallen warlord

4218
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
clutching that

4219
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
olden text bound by human flesh

4220
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
did they speak words

4221
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
stricken from the Latin tongue

4222
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
long ago

4223
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
and the wind did cease

4224
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
and the night before silent

4225
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
there came a rumbling

4226
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
as a hand rose from that grave

4227
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
and a feared voice

4228
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
once more did speak

4229
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
go

4230
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
no

4231
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
no

4232
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
no

4233
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
return of samurai scroll

4234
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
okay

4235
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
until next time

4236
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
sayonara

4237
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
he got us, he's very good

4238
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
that samurai

4239
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
I'm like two episodes behind

4240
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
is this still going on every episode

4241
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
yes

4242
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
he's such a trickster god

4243
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
oh

4244
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
oh my god

4245
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
that was impressive

4246
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I don't know what he needs the scrolls for

4247
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
when he's got the necronomicon

4248
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
but

4249
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
here's why

4250
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000

4253
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
scrolls much older, much better

4254
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
necronomist scrolls

4255
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000

that i spent

4290
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
ages making

4291
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
i've come to realize now

4292
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
that you can't compare your friends to fast food restaurants

4293
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
just nonsense

4294
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
stupid ridiculous

4295
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
i already know that i'm in voice

4296
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
voice chill now

4297
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
when i die i know i'm going to hell as well

4298
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
and there's no repercussions

4299
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
for my sins

4300
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
the best i can do now is to go into a room alone

4301
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
and whip myself with cat tails

4302
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
so

4303
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
i'd like to

4304
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000

4305
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000

4307
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000

4309
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000

4310
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
i empathize with this man very much

4311
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
there have been so many times where i've submitted a voicemail

4312
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
and then immediately messaged nate

4313
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
and said stop delete it please

4314
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000

4315
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
it's a good thing

4316
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
i wasn't in charge at the time

4317
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
because

4318
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
i don't engage in such

4319
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
i don't negotiate with terrorists

4320
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
absolutely not

4321
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
oh god

4322
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000

4323
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
and then you're like what the fuck am i looking at

4324

4331
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
we're in limbo

4332
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000

4333
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000

4338
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
i'm like i'm empathizing

4339
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
i'm not convinced

4340
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
i think he's just clapping his cheeks

4341
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
i need some video evidence

4342
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000

4343
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000

4344
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
i mean that too

4345
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
everyone's fine

4346
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
we need video evidence

4347
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
of something else

4348
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
something whatever it is

4349
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
either way we wanna see it

4350
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
we're hungry for anything

4351
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
next one

4352
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
aka the untitled abridger

4353
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
all right if donald trump

4354
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
dies of covid does that mean i don't

4355
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
have to vote for biden anymore

4356
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
oh yeah that's a thing

4357
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
they'll just run pence

4358
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
but i mean

4359
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
he won't win

4360
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
i don't know kinda

4361
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
i guess

4362
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
they'll just keep trump alive in a robot body

4363
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
it'll be like

4364
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
future armor

4365
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
put his head in a jar

4366
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
i think they've made that technology right now

4367
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
and then he'll be president forever

4368
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
um i mean

4369
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
that's literally already the case

4370
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
well the head in the jar thing

4371
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
no him being a robot i mean

4372
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
i don't know it's pretty real to me

4373
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
did you see

4374
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
okay there was a picture

4375
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
of him i guess at the debate

4376
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
and like you see him from the side

4377
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
and like there's like a part in his hair

4378
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
on the side of his head

4379
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
and like there's a piece

4380
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
of his head that looks weird almost like it's made of

4381
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
like metal or something

4382
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
um wait

4383
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
i want to see the image because i don't know what you mean

4384
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000

4386
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
it was floating around twitter

4387
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
the other day

4388
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
it was just like a weird

4389
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000

explanation

4392
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
for what it is

4393
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
i'd love for the image

4394
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
to be like an obvious

4395
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
photoshop of him with like a like a nuclear

4396
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
rocket

4397
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
stuck to his head or something

4398
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
no it's it's like um

4399
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
it was like a patch of some

4400
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
like didn't really look like metal it was kind of brownish

4401
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
just looked like solid like plastic

4402
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
maybe it didn't have any like details

4403
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
on it

4404
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
but it was like just the

4405
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
fuck i can't find it and i don't know what to google

4406
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
in order to find it maybe that's his brain handle

4407
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
i don't know

4408
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
it's it's it's your brain force

4409
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
you turn the thing and you speak

4410
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
trump

4411
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
head implant will i find anything there it is

4412
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
whoa here it is head implant

4413
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
okay this this is just a detail

4414
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
photo

4415
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
but um copy image

4416
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
this is what it looked like

4417
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
okay it seems like it might be

4418
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
well yeah it doesn't seem like

4419
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
anyone really figured it out but it might be a bone

4420
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
like a bone implant hearing aid of

4421
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
some kind

4422
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
he's an old man maybe a hearing aid

4423
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
i don't know what that is that does look

4424
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
like a cyborg like

4425
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
like iron hatch that you open

4426
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
and like plug the

4427
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
it looks like you could like open it up

4428
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
and there's like a little plug

4429
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
but it looks yeah it looks

4430
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
like bone it looks it looks very unpleasant

4431
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
looking i don't like it

4432
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
but like yeah in

4433
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
in in humans is

4434
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
fucking it

4435
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
yeah this is like the least

4436
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
flattering image of a person you could ever have

4437
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
is like the ear center stage

4438
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
just the corner of the eye off the side

4439
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
it is it's gross

4440
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
it's gross to be a brain in a skeleton

4441
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
in a flesh body

4442
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
uh

4443
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
yeah bone implant hearing aids seems to

4444
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
be a pretty adequate explanation

4445
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
that's that's that's what i'm going to go

4446
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
with uh for the time- okay so mystery

4447
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
solved but uh

4448
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
yeah but gross but he's already a cyborg

4449
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
so you're correct

4450
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
lol

4451
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
okay and next the voicemail

4452
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
notsamurai.m bracelet

4453
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Really?

4454
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Sceptical To Say The least

4455
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I

4456
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:48,560
Don't know man. I I enjoy what's going on right now. It's here. It's nice to hear you and

4457
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:55,000
Tom talk about your things once in a week, but I don't know. I feel like y'all are trying to kill PCV as a brand

4458
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,160
by continuing forward can't hint

4459
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:01,880
maybe because of the cumulative drama of

4460
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:09,320
Everything, you know, Jesse ragequitted DeVue dropped off the face of the earth. I'm key monkey seven years ago face of the earth

4461
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:13,280
Mage went to dreamland and munchie became

4462
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:24,760
They you know y'all have a new show I don't like anime though. I don't I like y'all personalities. I grew up with y'all

4463
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,720
Kind of in a way over a couple years

4464
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:33,720
You know and I didn't get it. I didn't get munchies or Jesse's humor

4465
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:37,440
I do now I used to cringe at digi, but you know, I

4466
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:46,240
Appreciate her for her willingness to defend her principles on free speech, you know, I feel like you guys were my friends and

4467
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,400
Hearing what

4468
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:53,720
Me and probably the rest of us as the end of an era

4469
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,720
It's a little bit sad

4470
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:03,440
All right, sure. It's coming out a weird time too. I have a one-year-old son and a wife and

4471
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:08,200
Think I've ever have these things when I clicked on science you 101

4472
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
You have them now you're welcome

4473
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,680
I guess I did and that's what's happened and it's time-passing

4474
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,160
That's it man

4475
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,080
Yeah, sounds like it

4476
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:30,080
Well, I mean you can mourn like the past, but I thought I thought I really thought there was gonna be a punchline

4477
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:37,160
Yeah, I was thinking that but like he kept going. I mean sure like the the end of an era

4478
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:39,680
It's sad like people feel it sad. I

4479
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:43,120
I can't like

4480
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:49,200
Worry about that in the same way that other people do and also, you know, we were never your friends. That's the first

4481
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:57,560
Yeah, it's it's it was it we made like we did have discussions about like the dangers of like a

4482
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,040
What's it called?

4483
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:04,920
Parasocial relationships. I think he knows that I don't think sure I was saying

4484
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:09,600
Yeah, like that's how he feels about it and because he feels about it. He's like

4485
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:18,960
But I've heard and seen people say just end the show like what why should we end the show because you're feeling sad

4486
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:22,600
It's not yours. We're the guys making it

4487
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:28,480
Right because it's like different. I don't know. I mean I I liked like I

4488
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:33,320
Certainly got a lot more entertainment out of a lot of the older episodes, but it's still nice

4489
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:35,320
I still listen to it and enjoy it like

4490
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:45,120
Wow, wow, thanks. Well, thanks a lot. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, shut the fuck up

4491
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:47,560
the

4492
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:49,560
It's you know, it's

4493
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:58,960
It's felt it's it's hard for me to I felt like it's the end of an era so many times that I think like I've kind of just

4494
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,400
internalized the lesson that like

4495
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:10,320
Everything is change all the time the only constant is change. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's ever everything is the end of an era

4496
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:15,640
No, no, no, it's weird. It's weird to even be thinking about like like mage hasn't been on in like six months

4497
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:20,480
Davoo hasn't been on in like oh what like years like Jesse hasn't been on in like over a year

4498
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:24,000
You know, he was at rad con and that was like it. This is like. Oh, this is like past

4499
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,720
This is like over and done once you becoming a real boy. What does that even mean? I don't know this this tone of fine

4500
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:35,960
Out this took people talk about it with a tone of finality. Yeah, like today's the last time anything will ever happen

4501
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:42,760
But like nothing is ever final and and life has changed. I know I know it's a river the real

4502
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:48,320
That they're having is that like it doesn't it's not gonna bounce back and suddenly be like it was

4503
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:53,580
And they're coming to terms with the fact that it was past is the past this time

4504
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:58,740
Cuz like I don't know the PC views always had like a rotating cast of

4505
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:04,800
characters and some of them are just not coming back and they're just sort of coming to terms with that and I'm like, okay, I

4506
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:11,720
Simplifies before I don't understand. I don't know if I sympathize anymore. I feel like we've had enough of this

4507
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:18,760
I feel like this has gone on enough times. It's like, do you not get it yet? Do you not understand that nothing ever stays the same?

4508
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:23,560
Yeah, I mean, I don't like agree that like

4509
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:28,600
You know, I don't think that there's nothing to it

4510
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:34,440
I just think it's it's kind of an old meme at this point to be like tired of the way the Pope the show is

4511
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:41,480
Being sad about the end of an era like it's almost it's itself a meme that needs to die

4512
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:47,520
Man, yeah, I'm sad. I miss when you all reviewed pony

4513
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:50,280
Man go back to it. Please

4514
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:55,120
Yeah, we always joke about having to go back and it's like I

4515
02:17:56,360 --> 02:18:00,320
Think the thing that's getting me is that people aren't like

4516
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:04,280
You know, I don't know they seem actually distressed about this

4517
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:10,320
It was like people memeing about like, oh, we have to go back. It's like half ironic

4518
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:15,080
It's kind it's like our pony was really cool and and all that like it's an era that's gone

4519
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:19,160
We'll never have it back and it's silly, but it was fun and

4520
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,200
you know

4521
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:24,600
Previous PCP times

4522
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:27,960
Like it was a different flavor and it's like yeah, it's gone

4523
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,600
It's not gonna be exactly the same as it was

4524
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:38,520
But like people I don't seem to be able to like have a laugh about that. They don't they just seem sad and it's annoying. I

4525
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:42,080
Don't want to shit on this guy in specific too much

4526
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:48,240
I don't I'm not like bothered by him saying anything that he said, but but the the I shouldn't have said annoying

4527
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:54,560
It's not what I mean. Yeah, yeah, sure. Um, but um, I know what you mean the general

4528
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:59,480
Okay, like when we talk about like how we have to go back to the pony days when we're nostalgic for the pony days

4529
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:01,240
It's because I

4530
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:08,080
Mean it was it was um, I don't know like that was like an external circumstance that made things fun

4531
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:14,600
It was like a fun time to be like breaking into the to the YouTube sphere or whatever and then but like

4532
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:17,080
to say it now to say I

4533
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:25,880
Don't know if like you prefer how if you prefer the older episodes and newer episodes fair enough but to like

4534
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:30,240
To like want to go back like to ask to go back is

4535
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:34,680
To like in this case when you're talking about the PCP like what you mean is like

4536
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:41,000
Those people that that have like declined to be on the show anymore is like make them come back

4537
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,040
And it's like well, what how would you even do that?

4538
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:48,080
Like it kind of doesn't even make sense like your request is sort of nonsense when you really think about it

4539
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:52,840
Am I making sense here? Yeah, I mean, I'm just I feel like why would you wish?

4540
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:58,280
Why would you wish someone to do something that they have like made it expressly clear that they wish not to do?

4541
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:01,980
It's not even just that it's that but like

4542
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:08,800
Even if they do realize that, you know talking to us about it isn't going to get them force them to come back

4543
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:16,440
It's it's the it's the either they come back or you end the podcast because I don't like it now

4544
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:20,040
Oh, yeah, like I just don't get that like it feels almost

4545
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,800
Oh, yeah, that's entitled to say entitled. Yeah

4546
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:33,760
I don't know. No, I agree. I agree with that. It's very stupid very cringe. I don't know

4547
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:39,960
And I don't I don't want to be too mean to this specific voicemail or anything

4548
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:46,720
He's not like a big problem. He's not just a jumping I get for the I get worries coming from like I was I was a little sad

4549
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:50,440
When you guys stopped doing pony stuff and then I'm like, oh wait, the other stuff you're doing is cool

4550
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:56,720
And then I followed over and then I stopped doing pony stuff and it's like that was freeing like being away from it

4551
02:20:56,720 --> 02:21:00,360
Was actually the best decision I ever made and so yeah

4552
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:08,800
Yeah, munchy going off being a real boy, you know quote-unquote like I don't even I don't even I'm sure yeah

4553
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:13,480
I'm sure like it's really good for him bow and that's good if it is. I hope he's having a good time

4554
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:21,640
I mean, he's he's doing what he wants to do. Yeah, as it as is everyone else whether they choose to come on the show or not

4555
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:27,320
It's their own choice and do you not want them to like do as they wish

4556
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:31,000
Like whatever it is. It is what it is and

4557
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:35,200
Everyone is everyone is acting according to their own agency and

4558
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:41,320
Why would you have it any other way? Why why wish why wish for something else? What's the point?

4559
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:46,520
It's terrible stupid. It's like, okay, okay

4560
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:48,480
I feel like we've gone on too long about this

4561
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:54,840
But the last thing I say is the tone and like I actually really appreciated the comments in the last episode a lot of people really liked the cyber shell

4562
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:59,760
Episode they thought he was a good guest. They thought the conversation was entertaining a lot of a lot of positive comments

4563
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:03,520
That's fine, but on like some of the episodes that had that people have complained about

4564
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:10,720
The the the feeling that they are complaining at the people on the podcast about

4565
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:17,120
People choosing not to be on yeah, like it's like it's like like we're the ones like like it's our fault

4566
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:21,800
For the ones that chose not to be here like how it doesn't even make it doesn't make any sense

4567
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:26,920
But I guess there's no one else if they if they're not in the podcast

4568
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:32,800
You can't leave a comment at them. These only we're the only ones you can you can criticize because we're the only ones here

4569
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:36,000
I hate that so that I really hate that attitude

4570
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:40,200
Fuck you commenters

4571
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:48,080
Yeah, it's it's it's just like well, we talked about it enough next voicemail. Yeah, it's that's more than enough

4572
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:53,120
This one is morality free electric jamboree

4573
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:58,240
So the original voicemail about morality that I sent was in response to a discussion

4574
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:03,440
You guys were having where you're trying to find ways to like define or to describe a moral system

4575
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:07,880
I offered the terms of utilitarianism in like a goofy dumb way and then

4576
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:10,920
Elaborated on what I actually meant by that in the next week

4577
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:13,640
I was saying yet when taken to its logical conclusion

4578
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:19,820
Utilitarianism just means to look at the utility of actions on a case-by-case basis and make moral decisions based on that

4579
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,400
Tom last week said

4580
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:31,160
Basically that he agrees that that is a good way to describe how people think morally and then said that my original voicemail

4581
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:37,600
Was dumb because I was offering utilitarianism as a way to just like as that

4582
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:43,160
System but like the second voicemail was just a definition for the first voicemail

4583
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:45,160
So if you agree with the second you agree with the first

4584
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:47,560
also

4585
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:53,000
It was brought up like oh, I don't trust humans to be able to figure out the utility of each action and like

4586
02:23:53,560 --> 02:24:00,400
The human fallibility is not something specific to this way of thinking if that's a critique of every moral framework

4587
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:06,520
You could come up with that's like I'm not saying that this is something that that transcends the limitations of our minds

4588
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:09,280
This is just a responsible way to handle things

4589
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:15,480
And it's the way that people generally do handle things so I was accurate and it's a good like thing

4590
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:22,560
So everyone agrees. I am right all your disagreements are just different ways of saying you agree with me

4591
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:28,560
All right, I don't know that's a good. That's a pretty good dunk pretty good dunk on us

4592
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:33,880
I think I I haven't listened to this guy's voicemails, but I feel like

4593
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:41,760
Utilitarianism in this way of just finding the utility is useful some of the time but not all of the time

4594
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:47,280
Like I think what he's because like with the case like the Jaden animation

4595
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:51,240
I think you're falling into the trap that he described no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

4596
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:54,200
I'm saying that like for things like life and death

4597
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:59,960
Utility utilitarianism in terms of like maximizing the number of lives saved

4598
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:08,600
right? Is that how you would use that? But like on a smaller scale, on a smaller scale,

4599
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:14,400
I don't know, you can't like, let's say somebody tells a joke and somebody doesn't like it.

4600
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:23,300
Utilitarianism might end up with that person, like it's since it's only one person and more

4601
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:28,520
people than that person enjoyed the joke, then the joke should be said or it should be allowed

4602
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:35,440
or whatever. And it's a little more complex than that all the time. His first email was

4603
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:42,640
utilitarianism means like whatever causes the most utility. And me and Tom were like,

4604
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:48,520
yeah, but what is utility? How do you determine utility? His second one was like, yeah, what

4605
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:54,360
I'm saying is, I'm not proposing that like we use this as a universal like universally agreed

4606
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:58,400
upon yardstick to be applied across the board. The idea is that each situation should be

4607
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:03,640
judged in a case by case basis, but with the understanding that like what we are looking

4608
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:11,520
for is a resolution that maximizes utility. So he's saying, yeah, to me, that sounds

4609
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:17,800
interesting. I just don't know how I don't know what is like on a large scale and a small scale,

4610
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:22,880
what is utility? And like if we come up with two different examples, it's whatever you think

4611
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:30,160
it is. It's whatever you think it is. I mean, I don't know. Let's say something like a trigger

4612
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:37,080
warning or whatever. Somebody gets triggered by something, but most people don't. And it's

4613
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:42,600
they're fine with it. Should, you know, the warning be in place? I actually, I guess it's

4614
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:46,040
easy just to put a warning in place. I guess the thing would be like, if you don't like the

4615
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:51,240
warning, just ignore it. If, if, well, it's not, it's not about that. It's like, should you put a

4616
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:55,880
word in a thing? If one person will be upset and hundreds of thousands of people would not be

4617
02:26:55,880 --> 02:27:03,480
upset. Does utilitarianism have any like relevance there at all? Should you just not say it because

4618
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:11,640
there's anybody like like utility is like you're choosing the better of two options. And I don't

4619
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:16,840
know how you would like judge it in every situation. It feels like the word utility does not work in

4620
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:21,000
all those different things. I really think you're falling into the exact trap that he described,

4621
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:25,080
because I think I don't even know what he's saying. I don't know what utility means. Let me send

4622
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:30,600
another voicemail, send another three voicemails. No, what he's saying, what he is saying is that,

4623
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:36,160
yeah, you would just like that situation you describe, you would just have to look at it and

4624
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:41,160
make some sort of like calculus of like, okay, well, how many people will be triggered by this

4625
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:46,080
thing? How much distress will that cause them versus how much will, you know, including this

4626
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:50,520
element in the work, you know, improve its themes or improve its quality in a way that like is

4627
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:56,040
enjoyed by more people? Like, which, which does the negative outweigh the positive and just be

4628
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:59,080
like, well, I don't know, what do you think? Do you think it does? Do you think it doesn't? And

4629
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:04,920
like that's the, that's the decision making. I think it's not, yeah. It's very dependent on the

4630
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:11,240
whims of the society that you're in too. Like if you have a society that really hates gay people,

4631
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:16,840
then maybe it's more utility to just kill the gays because then you make more people happy if it's

4632
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:23,560
only a few, right? I don't agree with that. I think, I think, I think the thing I'm having trouble

4633
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:30,280
with is like, when it comes to like an individual, you know, you think of a situation, you're like,

4634
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:39,000
okay, what is the, the most utility you can get out of this? It sort of is so wide ranging that

4635
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,120
the term has no meaning whatsoever. It really just is do whatever you feel like it just means

4636
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:48,440
whatever you think is good. Yeah. So therefore it is a completely useless term. I don't know why

4637
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:56,840
it's even being used in such a like a, like a wide way. It's, I mean, I guess I agree in that if

4638
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:04,440
you're going to be like, yeah, my system, my moral system is utility, utilitarianism, by which I mean

4639
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:12,840
that I do things that I think will have outcomes that I feel are good. And like, yeah, I guess that

4640
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:17,960
is too, you haven't really answered that question. That's why I mean, the thing I was talking about,

4641
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:21,800
I think you've convinced me that it is a little overly broad. Yeah, like, like the thing I was

4642
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:28,840
talking about, I think, before a couple of weeks ago was that it morality is, it's impossible to

4643
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:34,600
have one rule that fits everything. And having multiple different specific rules for every

4644
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:40,680
possible eventuality cannot have a word single, like a single concept applied to all of them. So

4645
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:49,000
it's like, ah, fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it. It's all just, it's all opinion anyway, at the end of the

4646
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:59,320
day. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, based. Next one. Here we go. Oh, squad Zilla. Hey, Tom, I just wanted to know

4647
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:05,720
that you have some competition on the Godzilla podcast front by none other than Maddox. He has

4648
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:12,200
a Godzilla podcast called Godzilla versus podcast zero. Just thought that was pretty fucking funny.

4649
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:20,120
Godzilla versus podcast zero. Is that like a theme podcast or just an episode of a Maddox podcast?

4650
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:29,160
Sounds like an episode. No, it's um, Hailey Mancini and Maddox rules. No, it's a it's an entire podcast

4651
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:36,920
about Godzilla starring Maddox and this other, this Hailey person. Kill it. What the fuck? Okay,

4652
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:42,760
that's weird. That's funny. Did they know about this? Uh, it's been going since February of last

4653
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:46,920
year. You should feud. You should, you should fight. You should call them out. They should

4654
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:52,280
definitely start beef. They should definitely start beef with Maddox. I mean, in fact, they

4655
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:57,000
should sue Maddox for stealing their ideas. I'm going to be honest. I don't know where this podcast

4656
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:05,400
is located. Yeah, I, I see there's a Twitter account, but I, I certainly don't see a podcast.

4657
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:10,920
I can't find like where it is in space. I'm not, I'm not, I'm getting a little lost looking for it,

4658
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:17,240
to be honest. Squadzilla, though, I can find easily. That's, that's right there. That's imminent.

4659
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:27,960
Yeah. Immediate, tangible. Uh, uh, fuck. Yeah. Okay. Funny, funny shit. Here we go. From Tony

4660
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:35,960
again. Tony again. Yo, Tony again here. I actually have something to say this time. I appreciate

4661
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:42,360
how at the end of the Tales Get Strolled video, when you're talking about gender pronouns and crap

4662
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:51,240
like that, that you somehow managed to like circle around and independently discover the idea of

4663
02:31:51,240 --> 02:32:02,600
gender abolitionism and hell yeah, brothers. Fuck pronouns. Don't have them. Fuck gender roles.

4664
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:09,320
Don't have them. Fuck gendered expectations. Don't have them. If I see a person walking down the

4665
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:19,800
street, I shouldn't assume that they should look a certain way. That's weird. You say that I independently

4666
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:25,720
arrived at it, but like, no, I've, I, I think I probably wouldn't describe myself as a gender

4667
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:32,680
abolitionist for a while now. I think we've all had that even before Nate left. Nate, I remember

4668
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:37,560
having a conversation about gender and he was like, yeah, like we shouldn't, it doesn't necessarily

4669
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:43,480
need to have all of the, the, the stereotypes enforced. It's, it's all arbitrary. And we all agree

4670
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:51,240
with that. It's just like, I think a little like real, like it's a, it's a, it's a fanciful idea

4671
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:57,880
that is hard to implement. And it's, it's just sort of like easier to play along with, you know,

4672
02:32:57,880 --> 02:33:05,000
if you, if you decide that you like wearing makeup and wearing dresses and having long hair and,

4673
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:10,920
and all that, then I guess it's easier to just call yourself a female because that's what people

4674
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:18,280
expect. And it, it's easy. It just smooths things over. I don't agree with that. No, I mean, I, I,

4675
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:22,680
I agree. I agree that you should be able if, and only if you want to call yourself a female

4676
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:26,680
irrespective of whether you like makeup or whatever. Sure. Sure. I mean, I feel like I,

4677
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:31,960
I would want to do that because it fits with everything else. Like I like, I like people

4678
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:39,960
calling me. Yeah. I mean, I can understand if the way you are is more in line with what

4679
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:45,640
is society expected of the female species. I understand that like, maybe it's,

4680
02:33:45,640 --> 02:33:52,120
that makes it more comfortable for you or whatever to do that. Yeah. It's, it's, it's because I

4681
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:57,640
understand what you're saying. I grew up in a society and these expectations are like burned

4682
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:04,840
into my brain that I can't easily just completely forget them. But I do agree that like, it would

4683
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:12,280
be better to not have them in any way at all. Like you should teach kids that it doesn't matter.

4684
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:18,840
And then maybe they won't have as much of like a, a feeling about it. And it wouldn't be an issue

4685
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:24,200
in the future. It'd be the most based. Yes. It'd be the most possible, the most based we could,

4686
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:36,280
we could get on a scale of cringe to base. Okay. Sick. Next one. Digimon Fox. Yeah.

4687
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:43,960
Well, we're talking about Digimon on the last episode. And I am a Digimon fanatic. I've watched

4688
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:51,240
literally every series, like twice, even the shit ones, even season six. And I just want to say

4689
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:57,240
Tamer's easily the best one. But Tom brought up that, I think Hercules Kabu Teriman wasn't shown

4690
02:34:57,240 --> 02:35:02,440
and he is an idiot for that. Because Hercules Kabu Teriman and all the original season one cast,

4691
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:11,880
mega evolutions were shown in Digimon Try the movie series. You fool. You absolute moron. Also,

4692
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:19,480
Digimon Adventure 2020 Tom is back. It's airing again. And you should watch it because it's

4693
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:25,640
really fucking good. It's just real good. It's fucking sick. And you should watch it. And Digimon

4694
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:30,840
is sick. And then you were talking about Digimon. It's the best thing ever. Thank you. I'm glad

4695
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:37,560
that this this guy got to flex his nerd knowledge about Digimon. I bet he doesn't get opportunities

4696
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:44,280
to do that often to dunk on someone. I was a Digimon boy growing up, but I wasn't super into it.

4697
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:52,440
Yeah, I was into the first series. And then I fell off it after they replaced the main cast.

4698
02:35:52,440 --> 02:36:00,760
I had the VHS of the first three episodes of Digimon. And I was annoyed because a VHS only

4699
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:04,840
had three episodes. I was like, damn, how many VHSes am I going to have to buy? There's too much.

4700
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:11,720
Fuck this. And I never tried to get any more. I saw Tamer's on TV and it was cool. My parents

4701
02:36:11,720 --> 02:36:18,360
bought a Digimon world for the PS1. And I think this was a discussion on the PCP recently

4702
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:23,480
that your Digimon will take giant shits on the floor and you have to scold them for it.

4703
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:28,840
No, you just clean them up, right? You can clean them up and then you have to yell at them

4704
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:32,280
so that they don't do it again. And there's also a giant poop Digimon. Where else are they going

4705
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:49,160
to shit? I don't know. I don't remember. I talked about Digital Dream, the guy with a couple

4706
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:57,160
thousand subscribers. And I don't know if I specified, but I watched tutorials on him on how

4707
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:05,160
basically to digivolve your Digimon in the latest release of the Cyber Pet or whatever

4708
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:15,240
they're called, Digital Pets. And it's really funny that the screen is so small. The biggest your

4709
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:26,200
Digimon can be is 10 pixels high, 12 pixels high or whatever. And so you got small ones

4710
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:29,800
just a little blob. Then you got bigger ones and then you got ones that fill up the screen,

4711
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:33,800
but even ones that fill up the screen or maybe just like a little six foot tall Agumon. But

4712
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:42,920
then you got like Exo fucking Galaxy Super Novemon or whatever that is a fucking cosmic.

4713
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:50,040
Yeah, that's like 50,000 feet tall and contains the entire universe within itself. And it's the

4714
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:57,000
same like 12 pixels high. It looks identical. Yeah, I was like trying to strategize like which

4715
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,920
one of these would I want to go for? Like which would be the most powerful base base?

4716
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:12,120
They only have a Digimon thing. I know recently what I've seen is the Pokemon have good women.

4717
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:17,800
They do. I think they're pretty good sometimes. And I saw this character and I thought cute.

4718
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:21,960
I like them. That's a Digimon girl. I don't know her name. That's a Digimon girl. Yeah,

4719
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:26,120
she's from like a new game. It's pretty cute. But it's pretty cute. Looks like a cop to me.

4720
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:32,360
Yeah. No, no, she's like it looks like an airline. She looks like she works for an airline.

4721
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:36,600
She looks like she works as a receptionist and she hates you for asking questions. Okay,

4722
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:44,120
I found their name like Dotte Makiko or something. It's like it says like Cyber Sleuth. So I guess

4723
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:47,960
she's like an investigator. I don't know what's going on. But a good character. Okay, I guess

4724
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:53,080
she might be a little bit of a cop. Might be a little bit of a cop then. I like that she's mad

4725
02:38:53,080 --> 02:39:01,160
at you. That's good. Yeah, she's always pissed off, which is epic. I looked at Digital Dream again

4726
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:08,840
yesterday and his newest video is a like Digimon fan song called like it's like a Halloween cover

4727
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:13,960
of the Monster Mash, but it's like the with the lyrics changed to be about Digimon. Oh, dude. But

4728
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:21,240
it's kind of good. Like it's like a hard rock cover with like electric guitars and drums and

4729
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:28,360
shit. And like it's like it's like well produced and kind of good, you know, for what if you can

4730
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:35,560
accept the absurd premise. He executed it with a plum. I just think it's very funny. Everyone

4731
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:41,640
goes subscribe to Digital Dream. That guy's sick. Yeah, don't subscribe to Regular Dream. He sucks.

4732
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:48,440
Yeah. No, fuck that guy. Like there's some guy called Regular Dream who's like got like

4733
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:52,520
hundreds of thousands of followers. You're like, nah, nah, nah. Hey guys, I just had another dream.

4734
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:58,920
Gonna take a make a vlog about it. I'm talking about fucking Minecraft YouTuber Dream, who's

4735
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:03,960
actually kind of good videos, actually. But is there actually someone? Yeah, I didn't know.

4736
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:08,360
He like does, he like speeds run. He's speed runs Minecraft, all his friends try to kill him,

4737
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:13,640
and it's genuinely really exciting videos. And he's he's too good. He's too good at the game.

4738
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:20,200
But everyone knows it's too popular. We can't talk about him. That's stupid. No, no, no, no. He'll

4739
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:25,080
kill us. He will send his lawyers after us to kill us. We're basically by talking about him,

4740
02:40:25,080 --> 02:40:29,800
we're making the rich richer. We shouldn't do that. Damn it. And shut the hell is our edit out.

4741
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:35,880
Sleep it. No, don't. No, I don't believe. Oh, I love I love I love this.

02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:55,560
about a necronomical, he steal, scroll right from the end of pocket.

4745
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:59,720
It can't be true. What do you keep in your pocket, Ben?

4746
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:06,360
From my scrolls. Wait, where are those fucking scrolls? No, what am I gonna wipe my ass with now?

4750
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:41,320
And for that brief moment, I was inside your house with your girlfriend.

4751
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:47,240
In that moment, I was with you and it was great honor.

02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:12,360
On the Samurai looking like a snack. You can be my girlfriend, Samurai.

4756

This is what it looks like. This is what the album cover looks like.

4784
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:43,080
Oh, it is. It's, it's the, it's the, the band that Kezzy likes. It's another Kezzy.

4785
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:46,920
It is, yes. Oh right. You could, you could put the Goatsey hands on that, pulling it open. That

4786
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:52,280
could work. Oh, dude, it's gay primario. Let me tell you a story about Goatsey.

4787
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:59,320
Yeah. I, well, it's not really. There's a, there's a, there's a bagel shop down my street.

4788
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:08,280
Oh no. It's called, and their logo, their logo is a, no, no. Their logo is like a cartoon girl.

4789
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:11,720
It's like, it's like a bust. You know, it's like from like the, the, the shoulders up.

4790
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:15,960
Yeah. But she's holding a bagel and looking at it, but she's holding it with both hands

4791
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:20,520
in a way that kind of looks like, you know, she's goat seeing it. She's grabbing that

4792
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:26,440
Pona. Oh my God. Basically. What is the brand called? Could we Google it?

4793
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:34,360
It's called, um, I'd rather not say it because it's like close to my, well, well, I'll, I'll put it

4794
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:41,800
in the chat. Okay. I don't know if they, I don't know if like there's chains of it. I haven't heard

4795
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:47,720
of it, but no, I think there's, it's just one. It's like in my, it's, I mean, I've said that,

4796
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:51,400
like, I've said more or less where I lived before. If someone wanted a fucking piece,

4797
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:55,160
it's called Goldilocks. I've already said that I live near Tufts University. So like,

4798
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:58,360
yeah, there's a, there's a bagel place in my neighborhood called Goldilocks.

4799
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:02,600
I didn't know you lived near there. Oh, I'll see you soon.

4800
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:12,840
It's true. It's so fuck. Um, so, um, yeah, but, uh, do they have the, yeah. So you, so you see

4801
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:18,280
the resemblance, right? I didn't realize her face would look so derpy. I was thinking of like a

4802
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:25,160
Wendy's girl. Give, it kind of looks like your art style a little bit. It does. Not gonna lie.

4803
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:31,800
A little bit. Yeah. A little bit. You got to draw her, Gib. You got to put her in a comic. Oh, no.

4804
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:39,400
Um, but the story is I was walking by on the way to the post office to send off some more copies

4805
02:47:39,400 --> 02:47:47,560
of Vapors 2 available now on my Twitter feed. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. And, uh, and they, um,

4806
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:52,760
and on my way back on the way there, I was, I was, I walked by them and they were playing music

4807
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:56,040
inside and I heard a couple of notes that I recognized. I was like, wait a minute, wait,

4808
02:47:56,040 --> 02:48:00,040
what is that? What is it? What is that song? What is this? Is that like a Disney musical? Is that

4809
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:03,560
like from a movie or something? Like, why do I recognize that? That's so familiar. And I went

4810
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:07,480
back and I listened and I realized, no, they're playing, they were playing bad religion. They

4811
02:48:07,480 --> 02:48:11,960
were playing like old, an old bad religion song from like one of their like earlier albums. And

4812
02:48:11,960 --> 02:48:18,040
I was like, oh, fuck yeah. These guys are old school punks. So I went and I delivered my shit

4813
02:48:18,040 --> 02:48:22,680
and on the way back, I was like, you know what? I don't even want bagels. I wouldn't eat them

4814
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:26,520
because they're not keto, but I'm going to just buy like a dozen bagels from these people and just

4815
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:31,080
give them my housemates because like, fuck it, have them, have some, because I want to give them

4816
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:37,080
my business because they like a band that I like. And uh, but I, but I went up to the door and I

4817
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:41,800
rang and like they didn't answer. I think they're doing some weird thing with like because of COVID.

4818
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:45,880
I think they're like, they're open for like, you have to like call ahead of time and order

4819
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:51,800
or something. I don't know if they do just like, yeah. So I didn't, I was not able to complete

4820
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:58,760
the transaction. Darn. But, but I tried. Ripperoni. I'll maybe, maybe in the future I will, Lamal.

4821
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:09,080
Uh, yeah. Cool. So, uh, that's that voicemail. Where's the next voicemail? How many more do we have?

4822
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:16,520
Yeah. How many? Uh, like eight. Oh my God. Okay. We're most of the way through. Okay. Uh, part one,

4823
02:49:16,520 --> 02:49:26,200
let's look, we need a direct democracy and the problem is like representative democracies, right?

4824
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:32,520
They, they don't like the reason why they exist is because of two reasons. One, because direct

4825
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:40,440
democracy used to be impractical before the digital age, for the internet age. And number two, because

4826
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:46,360
if you have like a politician, they're expected to know about political things. You know what I mean?

4827
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:52,200
And like, you can't expect the average person to know everything. Well, you can, but they won't.

4828
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:58,680
And the problem with direct democracy is that the average person is retarded, like really dumb.

4829
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:04,920
Like the average person doesn't care about anything and they're stupid. It really just

4830
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:10,440
open your eyes and you'll see it. Uh, but the thing is like, you think the solution, right? You only

4831
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:16,920
let smart people vote, right? And then you'd be like, well, how do you define a smart person?

4832
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:22,040
Smart person, right? Is it because there are people who are very intelligent, who would be

4833
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:27,560
extremely unknowledgeable and would make poor decisions. So I guess you'd have to test their

4834
02:50:27,560 --> 02:50:33,480
knowledge, but you'd also have to like make sure they're not like really dumb and would just come

4835
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:39,160
to the wrong conclusion. And, you know, maybe the solution to that is to simply only take votes from

4836
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:44,520
a intelligent group of people or only take votes from the most intelligent group of people. For

4837
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:54,680
example, white males. Yeah, we got there. We got there. Woo. Uh, uh, was that ironic? Was that

4838
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:58,760
like, was the point there that like, wait, was the point that we actually do need a direct

4839
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:06,040
democracy or was that the joke that we, that it would be stupid? Uh, I think I mean, I feel like

4840
02:51:06,040 --> 02:51:11,320
there was a, like an implication that you could technically do a direct democracy on your phones.

4841
02:51:11,320 --> 02:51:17,640
Vote now with your phones. Uh, if, if there was like, like live stream Senate man is like, all

4842
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:24,680
right, we're going to vote on, um, this thing and then vote now with your phones. Do you like it?

4843
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:29,880
Do you hate it? And then everyone who gives a shit will use the app, whether they're stupid or not.

4844
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:38,200
And then we'll know. I think that could work. Well, we can find out who's stupid by how they

4845
02:51:38,200 --> 02:51:44,520
vote. Is there, is it so then kill them? That was called part one. Is there a part two? Uh,

4846
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:54,440
no. Okay. Thank God. Maybe. Yeah, I agree. Um, that's, that's plenty. Oh, wait, I want to say,

4847
02:51:54,440 --> 02:52:01,640
I saw a great tweet. I saw a great tweet today from my boy on Twitter. Posadas trap God. Um,

4848
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:09,000
uh, and, uh, wait, what's his name? Well, he goes by, he goes by Aaron Dolphin emoji now,

4849
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:14,840
whatever. Posadas trap God with no O on the trap God. He said, uh, he said, uh, uh,

4850
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:21,640
said democratic socialism is, well, he said it was an oxymoron, but he meant redundant. He said

4851
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:27,000
democratic socialism is redundant because socialism is inherently democratic. And you know what? He's

4852
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:31,560
fucking right. That's your education. That's everyone's fucking anarchist education, uh,

4853
02:52:31,560 --> 02:52:35,320
for this episode. That's me going on my political run. I don't like everybody on subs. Everybody

4854
02:52:35,320 --> 02:52:41,800
unsubscribe. Um, I am, I am being messaged, uh, frantically that we, we got to go to the store

4855
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:48,040
because it's going to close. Uh, okay. We ran too long. I'm sorry. It's our, it's on us. It's on

4856
02:52:48,040 --> 02:52:52,440
us. We've got like a couple more. It's right. Uh, what happens with foes? Are you going to try

4857
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:57,640
and do them yourself or next week or no, there's no way we could, we could bear the burden of doing

4858
02:52:57,640 --> 02:53:02,280
we have to die. We must, we must soldier on. We must listen to the last seven voicemails. I'm

4859
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:07,000
sorry. We have no choice. There's no alternative. There's no way. If only there was some way

4860
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:13,320
we could cease to do it, but we cannot. Okay. I'm sorry. Oblivion. It was great having you on.

4861
02:53:14,360 --> 02:53:20,600
Yes. Thank you for coming on. Thanks for being a guest, buddy. Thanks for having me, uh, be gay.

4862
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:27,240
It's good. Uh, um, everybody, I mean, everybody subscribed to oblivion fall. It's on YouTube.

4863
02:53:27,800 --> 02:53:33,000
Yeah. Or the after dark. That's the big one now. Like my secondary channel, like, yeah, I put

4864
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:39,080
comzone on there when it had a hundred subscribers. Now it has 60,000 and it surpassed my main. So

4865
02:53:39,080 --> 02:53:45,880
I'll go to maybe rebrand. I don't know what's going to happen, but, uh, cool. Oh yeah. Go check out.

4866
02:53:45,880 --> 02:53:51,800

4869
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:07,560
Thank you. Thank you for being on. Yeah, you're, you're welcome. And this is fyi. The last time I

4870
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:13,560
was on a podcast also had to leave early because of going to the store. That was a podcast with

4871
02:54:13,800 --> 02:54:17,400
the store. That was a podcast with A and Y and keyframe. If you remember those names.

4872
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:22,680
I remember A and Y and keyframe. Wait, when was the hell long ago? That was probably like 20 years

4873
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:27,960
ago. Well, that podcast was like two years ago. I mean, even two years ago was past the, was past

4874
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:33,640
the heyday. Oh yeah. I was out of, I was out of the community, but he escaped with me. He also

4875
02:54:33,640 --> 02:54:42,520
works at a DA games. So yeah. Oh, you are. Yeah. I, I have, I have, I see, I see keyframe.

4876
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:46,600
I'll see a tweet of hers like every once in a while. She's like, I don't know. I'm like

4877
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:51,640
peripherally aware of keyframe and everyone I'm like, huh, so she got like a real job,

4878
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:57,000
huh? That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy shit. She, she even, uh, the backgrounds for the

4879
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:04,040
cuphead animation, the real big one. Uh, those are real, uh, physical watercolor paintings that

4880
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:12,680
key did. So. Oh wow. Yeah. Fancy. Well, I guess that's, that's a very, I guess, I guess that's the

4881
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:22,280
podcast. I guess that's the podcast. Bye. Bye. See ya. Okay. Next one is called society. Three,

4882
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:29,000
two, one, go. I think we should all, we should all mature as a species. We should stop pretending

4883
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:34,280
that memes need to be confined to the internet. We need to use memes in real life. Yeah. Based,

4884
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:43,720
based, cringe, cuck, say, cuck, cringe, cuck, based, cringe, cuck, based, cringe, cuck. Everybody,

4885
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:50,760
everybody get hype for based cringe cuck. I can't fucking. I can't do it. You will,

4886
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:56,440
you will now. I say based in real life. That's okay. I say based in real life. I,

4887
02:55:57,240 --> 02:56:02,920
I would say, well, not in every company, but I would say co-cro-wish in real life. I would call

4888
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:11,960
something my co-cro-wish. You're my co-cro-bitch. No. I cannot wait for the next time I get the

4889
02:56:11,960 --> 02:56:17,560
opportunity to embarrass myself and then, and then flawlessly recover by saying, I'm just being cool.

4890
02:56:18,120 --> 02:56:24,920
That's going to be a hell of a time. I've never, I, I never think to, I, I think it's just like

4891
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:30,280
when I say something embarrassing, I don't really realize that it was embarrassing. And then by

4892
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:36,360
the time I could have said something, someone else's like, I don't know, the awkward silence is set in.

4893
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:40,920
And so I stumble. I won't get. Like I don't really get the good opportunity to say,

4894
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:44,200
hey, I'm just being cool, like, like in a retaliatory sort of way.

4895
02:56:45,480 --> 02:56:51,240
I get embarrassed when I'm talking sometimes, but like, I don't know if it's always about things

4896
02:56:51,240 --> 02:56:55,480
that are genuinely embarrassing. And I think that maybe I don't notice when I say things that are

4897
02:56:55,480 --> 02:57:00,520
genuinely embarrassing. So I think there would probably be times when I would say I'm just being

4898
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:05,320
cool, but it would be in a context where like, I didn't, I thought that I needed to say it,

4899
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:09,320
but it didn't really need to be said. And like, it would have been better somewhere else.

4900
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:15,960
It's true. You got to have a real, you really got to have a high self-awareness stat to know

4901
02:57:15,960 --> 02:57:21,000
exactly when to employ it. You've got to like, hold it in your back pocket as like a safety

4902
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:25,720
measure when you are like, pretty sure that the people in your company are not going to like

4903
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:32,200
the thing you're about to say. Yeah, yeah, emergencies only. Yeah. Like, do these people,

4904
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:37,480
do these people like this kind of humor? I don't know. I'll just say I'll be, I'm being cool in

4905
02:57:37,560 --> 02:57:42,840
case. I'll just say, I just, I got a really, oh man, kind of really funny racist thing I want to

4906
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:47,800
say, but like, are these people racist? Well, if they're not, I just say I'm being cool afterwards.

4907
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:53,720
That's what it's for. That's secretly what it's for. Ah, shit. You know what? Don't use it anymore.

4908
02:57:54,280 --> 02:57:58,760
Don't use the, don't use it. It's not a trick. You're not allowed to. It's a PCP dog whistle.

4909
02:57:59,640 --> 02:58:09,400
It is a PCP dog whistle. It is though. Okay, next one. Anon moose PCP loyalist. Three, two, one, go.

4910
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:15,720
Ben, the saint, you claim nothing is happening behind the scenes, but that's exactly what someone

4911
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:21,480
who was hiding something would say. Your move cowboy. What do you think?

4912
02:58:21,880 --> 02:58:29,960
Uh, he's right. Everything is happening behind the scenes. In fact, there is no the front of the

4913
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:38,680
scenes. It's like a big Rube Goldberg machine back here, back here in the land of inside baseball.

4914
02:58:39,640 --> 02:58:47,240
Rube gold boy. Moving, moving parts, moving pieces, big, the likes of which you've never seen

4915
02:58:48,040 --> 02:58:54,440
cosmic powers outstripping everything. If you think about it, the entire universe

4916
02:58:54,440 --> 02:59:00,280
is behind a scene that we are not privy to. There's like it like outside the universe. There's like a

4917
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:08,600
curtain and behind the curtain is us. So everything's behind the scenes. Nothing will ever be on the

4918
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:16,680
scene. Oh my God. And that means, and that therefore, if you say that nothing's happening

4919
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:27,880
behind the scenes, then you mean everything is happening in the universe. Yes. Yes. Okay, next

4920
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:35,320
voicemail. Oh, we got anon moose PCP loyalist PS post script, I guess. Three, two, one, go.

4921
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:40,680
Also about three, the nipple like now women are cringe dude, hippo and digi have been better women

4922
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:44,360
than like most women while you're there with you know, I don't know what you mean.

4923
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:48,680
They're better women than most. Is that what he says? Is he saying, is that because you,

4924
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:55,800
you two don't show the nipple? Is the implication that most women do show the nipple and it's bad?

4925
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:00,440
I'll take the compliment. I don't even know what he meant really, but yes. No,

4926
03:00:01,400 --> 03:00:05,880
I don't understand this guy. I don't understand. I don't understand what this guy is talking about.

4927
03:00:05,880 --> 03:00:11,160
If he says that I'm gooder than someone else, that's good. I like feeling superior. I'll take it.

4928
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:19,400
I'll take any compliment under any circumstances. Next one is going to be based. Ben is parentheses

4929
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:27,560
not a sexist. Wait, three, two, one, go. A man is allowed to beat his wife so long as it is no

4930
03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:35,640
thicker than his thumb. That is the origins of the saying rule of thumb. You could instead just say rule.

4931
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,720
Okay, I don't know why the music kicked in.

4932
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:49,720
You mean if the rod, if the rod was no thicker than his thumb, that's what is

4933
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:55,560
you're trying to say. Yeah, he's good. Only cowards beat their wife with a rod. Use your bare fists.

4934
03:00:56,520 --> 03:01:03,400
Yeah, if you keep you on your edge, you've got to be able to keep the marriage strong if you can beat

4935
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:10,760
your wife and a bare knuckle fist fight in a fair fight. That's what it takes. If you're using a rod,

4936
03:01:11,320 --> 03:01:19,320
you've given up. You better end up with blood on your knuckles after the beating or you're not a real man.

4937
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:26,200
Next one, next movie, that voicemail sucked. It wasn't even about me.

4938
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:30,760
I think it may have been in response to you saying rule of thumb sometime.

4939
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:33,240
Oh, did I?

4940
03:01:34,680 --> 03:01:40,280
Yeah, fuck it. It doesn't matter. No, it's terrible, terrible, terrible. Voice jail?

4941
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:45,800
Voice jail? No. For you, Ben St, for saying that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4942
03:01:45,800 --> 03:01:50,440
Okay, moving on moving on. No, no, we will we will not convene a vote on that question

4943
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:56,920
Next one if monsoon was retarded three two one go

4944
03:01:58,480 --> 03:02:04,160
You are the only one girl up on the killfields or is cruel being

4945
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:07,040
button thick teacher

4946
03:02:07,320 --> 03:02:08,840
final lesson

4947
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:10,840
Deeper than my psyche

4948
03:02:10,840 --> 03:02:12,440
this world

4949
03:02:12,440 --> 03:02:14,440
All this people are disease

4950
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:22,080
Free will it's myth. The legend is a joke. We're all pawns controlled by something greater

4951
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:25,720
Memes the DNA of the soul

4952
03:02:26,400 --> 03:02:28,400
the shape our will and

4953
03:02:28,640 --> 03:02:33,360
Our culture I think this is this metal or solid to pass on

4954
03:02:34,680 --> 03:02:41,960
Exposed someone to anger long enough monsoon. They'll learn to hate. I don't know if you come to Karen and they

4955
03:02:41,960 --> 03:02:48,200
Be spare. What is this all means? Oh, that's that like first gun five major

4956
03:02:49,360 --> 03:02:51,360
Wean blows rain falls

4957
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:57,760
I'm skipping a fun. No, I'm done. No, no more. This sucks. Fuck it. Thanks for the voicemail idiot

4958

Reckon your rat about me. I mean, I knew something was off after the Patriots

4960

Nah, that sucks. Nah, you fucking piece. Let's take it. Let's spend 15 minutes talking about how shitty all our fans know

4961
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:28,320

A little bit there's no joke this the joke is just what if I read

4966
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:07,040
Dialogue in like a terrible voice that you can't understand

4967
03:04:07,640 --> 03:04:14,120
Okay, no more no more. I'm putting an end to it and I'm putting an end to this episode of the pro
