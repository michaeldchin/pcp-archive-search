00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,800
the best guy ever. And shuffling my deck, shuffling my deck, here's your card. Ooh, that's a loser.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Gibbontake.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,360
What did I do to deserve this?

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,120
Oh, you were a bum knee. Welcome, Tom Oliver.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Time to crack open a new can of PCP. It's gonna be a good day.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Indeed.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
I thought that was the sound of your bones cracking.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,720
Or did I cut out there? Oh no, oh no. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm Ben Saint, and I'm having

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,520
headphone troubles back with you in a hot sec.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,120
It's the Joker, baby. There he is. You drew the Joker and you lose.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,520
Only the most professional. Probably putting the pro in the Pro Crastinators Podcast today,

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
everybody.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Little dud. Sorry, everybody. PokÃ©mon, politics, who knows what we'll get up to this episode.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Band. Band from this discussion for life.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,520
No. Hey, I've got, yeah, you got something to get me.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Well, there's the big issue of the copper, the copper field, the Children's Online Privacy

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Protection Act.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Oh yeah, that guy.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,520
That Big Bejesus that's going on.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
I don't know many facts. I don't know many facts.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I saw a lot of scares.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I saw Innuendo Studio, no, not Innuendo Studio. I saw Folding Ideas video about it. Basically,

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,520
YouTube is a liar and claims that users are more responsible than they actually are, but

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,520
it's still a problem because YouTube will probably impose penalties on users.

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Well, hang on. Isn't that, isn't the idea that it's not YouTube, but it's, it's like

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
outside of YouTube, like the state of California.

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
That's the lie.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
That's the lie.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Wait, what about California?

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Well, I just thought the copper was like a California state law.

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
No, it's a federal law from the FTC.

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Yeah, it applies to all things.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,520
It's been on the book since 1998, and they refresh it every 10 years or so, but I guess

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,520
due to like public outcry, due to some shit with YouTube, they're doing it early.

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,520
All right, here's, I watched a couple videos on it. I watched some guy who I don't know

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
who said he's a lawyer. He seemed very lawyer-y.

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
He talked about the legal side of it.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I also watched Matt Petz.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Was it legal, legal? Sponsored by Indochino?

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
I don't think it was. I think it was a different one.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
He would be sponsored by Indochino, that dapper fuck.

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,520
There's a whole like social media lawyer segment of YouTube now.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Indeed.

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Yeah.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,520
But yeah, there was the guy talking about law, and also I watched Matt Petz cry video

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
about it, where he almost cried.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Wait, really?

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Really?

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
No, fuck.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
What a fucking bitch.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
That's despicable.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
It's not like, it's not like he doesn't do that.

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I hate a man who cries.

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
It's not like he doesn't do that usually.

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Like he's got a little bit of glistening in his eyes.

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,520
When his editor died, it was called for.

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Yes.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,520
When fucking Kyla's coming out, he'd fuck you.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Well, I'm not really...

61
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,520
I kind of like mixed the other video less respectful in going there.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Well, it wasn't like weeping. It was just like, I could see glistening in his eyes.

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Like he had been like tear-y or something.

64
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Oh, his eyes are always glistening.

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I assume that he feels this way because he feels his work is like potentially in jeopardy.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Yes.

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
It may, you know, okay.

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,520
All right, so from what I gather, the copper had turned a blind eye to YouTube for the

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,520
most part, because this is the funniest part, so I'll start with that.

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
I'm ready to laugh.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,520
YouTube has the thing where you have to be 13 years or over in order to use the site,

72
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,520
and that has been part of the YouTube terms of services, and that's all that jazz says,

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
and that is copper compliant.

74
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,520
So YouTube was actually doing the right thing.

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:04:02,520
The thing is copper or the FTC rather clued into the fact that YouTube was knowingly targeting

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:09,520
children because they were bragging about it in media events with shareholders and business

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
people.

78
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,520
It's like YouTube is the number one place for people 6 to 12.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Little babies with a child brain.

80
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,520
So YouTube basically fucked themselves and everyone else over by bragging about how much

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,520
money they were making off of these child viewers that they weren't supposed to be allowed.

82
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
YouTube was just fucking these children.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
The problem is data collection, right?

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
The specific problem is the collection of data from kids under 13.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:46,520
The collection of data of children under 13 is for various reasons like not good, and

86
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,520
the advertising relies on that data so that they can show targeted ads which are much

87
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,520
more CPM, click through, whatever thing.

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Can I cut in for a moment?

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah, that's what I understood the main issue to be.

90
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
So when I saw this, I immediately went in.

91
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
I went to all my channels.

92
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
I set them to not for kids.

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,520
And I am aware that I personally do no data collection of any kind.

94
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,520
So my wonder is just like, am I really in any danger considering I have not?

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,520
No, not from the law, but maybe from YouTube.

96
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,520
The thing was, this is where the lawyer guy explained it, and he had an update video where

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,520
he allegedly got a call from someone in YouTube who couldn't divulge his name for fear of

98
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
retribution.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
John YouTube himself.

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
John YouTube, the whistleblower.

101
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Called in to explain secret facts.

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:51,520
The basic gist is that the law has, in the FTC, it explains that if something is for

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,520
adults, geared towards adults, it has adult themes, that is nothing to do with copper.

104
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,520
But if it's aimed at children, and it's for children, and it's all of that stuff, then

105
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:12,520
your video, if it is collecting data, i.e. monetized, you are liable to get, I don't

106
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:21,520
know the terminology, but you could get fined $42,000 at least per video, per infringement.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,520
That's what YouTube is telling everyone.

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
It's either for adults or it's for kids.

109
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,520
There's everybody who is upset and concerned, like Matt Pat, like Arlo, who have child-friendly

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,520
aspects to their videos, but aren't entirely child-based.

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,520
They are not talking to children, they are talking to people.

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
They are talking to everyone who would be interested.

113
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Adults like Matt Pat, like myself, I enjoy those videos, they're silly, you could say

114
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,520
what you like about them, but they are very much also a huge kid demographic thing.

115
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,520
They're all ages, all ages, which includes kids.

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,520
YouTube did not divulge that in the FTC there is a case for both, there is a middle ground

117
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,520
in the FTC rules that says if you're targeting a general audience and it happens to appeal

118
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
to kids, you're not actually infringing.

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
You're not targeting kids.

120
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,520
You're not targeting kids, you're not doing a frozen Elsa Funko Pop unboxing video.

121
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,520
You're not trying to prey upon the easy clicks of children who don't know what they're doing.

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
You are making videos that children may or may not enjoy.

123
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,520
So if you're like, you swear sometimes, but you also make fun videos that anyone can enjoy,

124
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:57,520
you're not actually at risk in terms of the FTC, but the thing is YouTube didn't tell people that

125
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,520
because allegedly, because of this secret phone man, that I mean, I don't know, maybe it's true.

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Seems true because YouTube is a company and they don't want to let this information out,

127
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:20,520
is that it would be bad for them monetarily to allow people to not, like they make it black and white.

128
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:29,520
It's either for adults or it's for kids and they want people, I guess, to set it for kids just in case.

129
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Because the kid market seems so lucrative and I know that the most profitable channel on YouTube is this.

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Nobody will get money from kids' content going forward.

131
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,520
If you are a Spider-Man Elsa video channel man, you going forward will not get money.

132
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
That is just how it is.

133
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Sorry, don't you get ads, but it's just not targeted ads anymore?

134
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Yeah, but it's like 2% of the income is targeted ads.

135
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,520
YouTube is the one collecting data, not users.

136
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:08,520
YouTube is basically trying to pass the responsibility for this onto content creators, which is just stupid.

137
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,520
It's just them shamelessly trying not to suffer consequences for things they did wrong.

138
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
And want to continue to do wrong.

139
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
They've already paid $170 million in fines.

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,520
They've paid a huge big lawsuit settlement fine thing already.

141
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:31,520
They've given money, but it is in their best interest to make sure that this could not ever possibly happen again.

142
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:39,520
So they are making it black and white in order to confuse creators and make them scared so that they will set their channel to kids

143
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:49,520
so that they'll lose out on monetization, but they will guarantee that they won't get fined for thousands of dollars suddenly out of nowhere.

144
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Supposedly, even if you set your channel to my content is not for kids, the algorithm might decide that that's just wrong.

145
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:07,520
The algorithm might theoretically pick up on song keywords and images and stuff and be like, this is kid entertainment.

146
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,520
This is unacceptable for targeted advertisement.

147
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:21,520
On the one hand, I don't know if YouTube has any intention of making sure...

148
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,520
YouTube doesn't really care about all this.

149
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,520
If they can get away with not doing anything, they will.

150
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,520
The FTC is the one who's going to be scouring through YouTube to find offending videos and they are working with YouTube to make it happen.

151
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:48,520
But YouTube has no reason, aside from general compliance, to make a bot and AI that finds all of the kid videos and gets them fined for thousands of dollars because that's just bad PR.

152
00:10:48,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I believe that they did do that. They're not looking to find themselves, but they're looking to mark content as kid content and de-target ads from it.

153
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Or something.

154
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,520
There's lots of stuff we don't know because it's YouTube and they're not going to tell us anything.

155
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm looking at my analytics right now on the YouTube studio thing.

156
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:20,520
We all know that every kid lies to get onto YouTube and just says their age is older than it actually is or whatever.

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:34,520
My audience is 80% 18-34 and the 13-17 is just under 7% and I set my challenge to adult and I know that the content is not catered to kids.

158
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Theoretically, you could potentially make an argument that anime is inherently childish and I'm probably going to make a video about Pokemon and other things.

159
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I could see an argument, but I think I could win that argument.

160
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I personally feel very little danger for something like this.

161
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I saw the internet historian, he made a tweet thread basically saying this isn't something to worry about for most people who aren't on the borderline.

162
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:09,520
But I do feel for people like Arlo and MatPat to a degree who are forced into this uncomfortable position of forcing to choose.

163
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:17,520
They're only forced into that position because YouTube wanted to do that. They aren't actually in violation of anything.

164
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
No.

165
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,520
To be slightly fair to YouTube, it's like YouTube set up this system.

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,520
We should at least examine the other side of the argument, which is just that YouTube set up a system where these creators do benefit.

167
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:37,520
If YouTube's able to milk more money out of these kids, people with a kid audience to any degree have been benefiting from that.

168
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,520
It literally doesn't matter because it's not about who benefits, it's about the collection of data, which only YouTube does.

169
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
That data is used to serve ads which makes more money, right?

170
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Yes, by YouTube. And they could choose not to do that, but they won't.

171
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,520
They're just going to pass the buck onto creators and say that it's their problem, whether the data they're collecting is from kids or not.

172
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
There has been some benefit to the creators from this.

173
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,520
It literally isn't unrelated to the question at hand.

174
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I don't think, I mean, they have in fact gained more money through this system.

175
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,520
That makes, that is not what the question is.

176
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Well, okay, if you want to talk about something else, fair enough.

177
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:21,520
I want to talk about Kappa, which is not about who's getting money, it's about collection of data.

178
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
I mean, I agree.

179
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,520
What Nate's trying to say, I think, is that because YouTube for so long has not been in compliance with Kappa,

180
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,520
there's an entire market that's sprung up around making money off of children.

181
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,520
And even if someone like Arlo has been benefiting from that indirectly because these children...

182
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,520
I don't know if that's true. I don't think Arlo's videos are not the kind of thing we're talking about.

183
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,520
I have the mind of a child. And when I see Arlo, I go buck wild.

184
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
It's just what it is.

185
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Arlo is a...

186
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Well, of course.

187
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Arlo's done nothing wrong.

188
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,520
But it's just that Arlo can attract a younger audience because of the nature of his content.

189
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Okay, but Arlo's not who we're talking about.

190
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,520
We're talking about Spider-Man and Elsa pregnancy videos.

191
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Right, no, that's the problem.

192
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,520
But I'm just saying there's some crossover, right?

193
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Maybe, but what's the what?

194
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,520
That's just saying that he's probably going to lose some money from this.

195
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Presumably.

196
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I mean, maybe, I guess, yeah.

197
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,520
But not because the law says he ought to, but because YouTube...

198
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,520
No, because YouTube's system has allowed this wrong thing to happen.

199
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,520
And there are people who ride the line like Arlo, who are probably making some extra money

200
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
because of that data collection those targeted ads to younger users.

201
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Yeah, and I'm not saying he's at fault or anything.

202
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,520
It's just an unfortunate side effect of YouTube's continued lack of integrity.

203
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Which is a long story history.

204
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:04,520
The thing is, is this lawyer thing with this third like middle ground option in the law

205
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,520
that says you're exempt if, basically says you're exempt if it's a general audience,

206
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,520
means that people like Arlo and MatPat should not be affected at all,

207
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,520
but they have no option to do the middle ground thing.

208
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Yes, yes.

209
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Which is annoying and shady and that sucks.

210
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,520
But I feel like generally this means that most people who are not Spider-Man Elsa will be okay.

211
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,520
And furthermore, getting to the point where the fines would go out,

212
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
it's going to be...

213
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,520
That is not going to be a YouTube...

214
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:48,520
YouTube might use bots and AI to flag the videos as infringing on kids, whatever.

215
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Like it's kids, but it's not listed as for kids.

216
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
They've decided that it's for kids.

217
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,520
And then the FTC gets a list of these things and they go out and then they look at them with people

218
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,520
because they're going to have to make actual fines to actual people.

219
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,520
And they can't, it's going to be expensive if they lose.

220
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Like if this goes to court and they lose because they trusted Google YouTube AI to tell them the truth.

221
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,520
They have to, they should.

222
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Gabe, is this the video by the way?

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm pretty sure that only YouTube itself and no, I don't think any individual creators are liable for anything.

224
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:37,520
No, but like the FTC, in the situation where there is a YouTuber who is profiting off of data collected from children,

225
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,520
the FTC has decided that the channel owner is liable for some reason.

226
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Like I assume it's like part of the YouTube settlement, like YouTube passed the buck over.

227
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
We'll give you this money.

228
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,520
I don't think FTC decided that, I think YouTube decided that.

229
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
YouTube decided, yeah, it was like part of whatever happened.

230
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
I don't actually know having looked into that.

231
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:08,520
And it's basically like extra legal is the idea that either creators are responsible and should be the ones to report themselves.

232
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,520
If you are not targeting kids specifically, you'll be fine, I think.

233
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Because the likelihood that you will actually get hit by a fine is so low if you have ground to stand on, which most people do.

234
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,520
I almost hope I get sued because then I'll get some of that sweet like GoFundMe internet drama money, you know,

235
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,520
and everyone will care about my channel and all those things will happen.

236
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,520
And I know I'll win. I know I will win if I'm sued for this.

237
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Well, yeah, I mean the thing is you know you'll win, which is why you won't get sued because the FTC is the one who has to do the suing.

238
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Unfortunately for me, that's the real discrimination. Maybe I want to get sued. That would be nice.

239
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Good life experience right there.

240
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I think the problem that started this entire thing, because like this is going through the traditional like YouTube drama life cycle of like

241
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,520
really fucking crazy fear mongering, everyone's terrified, radical changes, everyone with their hot takes,

242
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,520
and then all of a sudden like, oh, it's not that bad, you know, the typical way these things go.

243
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,520
But like the reason this one I think was like reacted to so harshly so quickly is that there's just like a video like of the head of the FTC,

244
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
like he did like some sort of like meeting about this and just straight up said,

245
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
That guy looks like a primo boomer.

246
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Yeah, like the typical boomer of just being like, we're coming for you guys.

247
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,520
We have the technology. We're going to take down as many as possible.

248
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
He just wishes he was like in the CIA talking about terrorism, but he's not.

249
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Instead of like everyone on YouTube imagining that this could possibly happen,

250
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,520
like the dude in charge was saying it was going to happen.

251
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,520
So it was kind of a weird thing to do, I guess, because it definitely alarmed a lot of myself.

252
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Well, this is pretty fucked.

253
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
This is concerning for some people. I get it.

254
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
When any new thing appears to present, it's not actually new, but like when a new thing appears

255
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,520
and could potentially threaten your entire existence as like a creator, like I'm sure MatPat feels obviously that's scary.

256
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,520
But I feel like, I mean, maybe I've just been desensitized, but like how many of these fucking issues happen

257
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,520
that ultimately just peter out and like nothing important comes of them?

258
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Well, I mean, MatPat's not fucking over anybody. He'll probably be fine.

259
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:28,520
I mean, there's, again, like really convinced that there is literally zero liability on any creator's account here,

260
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
and it's all YouTube or whatever.

261
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I mean, I believe that, but it just seems, yeah.

262
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I don't think anyone's going to be hurt.

263
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,520
I mean, there's going to be people who get their shit demonetized.

264
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I was a little like worried at one point because, you know, my Give and Take channel has pony videos on them.

265
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Not all of them are, some of them are analysis, and that's, you know, that's obvious.

266
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Like, children aren't supposed to understand this sort of depth talking about fucking show.

267
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Yeah, but I've seen a couple of documentaries that reveal that the true audience is adult men.

268
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
I think we all know that.

269
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Have you heard about this My Little Pony thing?

270
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
It's not just for little girls anymore.

271
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
No, no, sir. No, no.

272
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
No, in fact, it is manly, and I'm a man, you see.

273
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,520
No, but like also, I've made those pony compilations earlier than that,

274
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,520
which are just like a series of clips from the show.

275
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,520
They've all been demonetized recently.

276
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Some of them had survived up to this point, but then they finally got God by Hasbro.

277
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,520
But those are like, you could argue that those are just for kids.

278
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I didn't intend for that.

279
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,520
It seems to me like Arlo-esque in that, incidentally, I could definitely see kids enjoying them,

280
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
but they're not specifically targeting kids.

281
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,520
But they're not like, I mean, they were specifically targeting bronies.

282
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,520
That's what my defense would be, and it's like, what's a bronie?

283
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I'd have to explain that in court, like, oh my God, oh my God.

284
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
I've got a documentary to show you.

285
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,520
I've got a documentary to show you.

286
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
You know, my point before about how I suspect no one will be harmed.

287
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,520
So the one way that I think that might not be true is, okay, occasionally with YouTube,

288
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,520
things don't go exactly as they're intended to.

289
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,520
And this reminds me of how just recently, actually, like a few minutes before this very podcast began,

290
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,520
a new video was uploaded to one CGP Gray's channel, and I think I have it right here,

291
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:40,520
where CGP Gray was fucking locked out of his main channel for allegedly impersonating Dun Dun Dun himself,

292
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
is what YouTube thought was happening.

293
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
They were like, you're not CGP Gray.

294
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,520
You're like a spammer or like a bot account or something.

295
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
And he had to like fight to get it back.

296
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
And he won, which is why there's this new video and the other one, which is probably delayed,

297
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
until this issue was resolved.

298
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,520
It took him like over the weekend or something.

299
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,520
But so the issue is, things don't always work like exactly as they were supposed to.

300
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Sometimes a couple of things fall through the cracks, and that's not so good.

301
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
And the algorithm ain't perfect.

302
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
I know, imagine that.

303
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,520
So in that sense, perhaps there are things to be at least like aware of and concerned is,

304
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,520
we're going to institute new restrictions, new demotization criteria,

305
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,520
and they don't have the best track record of applying that shit exactly where and when it should be.

306
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,520
So on that basis, perhaps it's a more urgent concern.

307
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
That's understandable.

308
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,520
The whole thing, I was wearing into like, at first I was like,

309
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
there's no way that people are actually going to get fines that big.

310
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
And then I looked into it and I was a little scared for a second.

311
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Then I looked into it more and it was fine.

312
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,520
But I kind of wish, like deep down, I kind of wish that it was like the YouTube ending disaster

313
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,520
that is everyone on January 1st, everyone gets a million fines.

314
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
So they have to turn off all their channels and everyone leaves.

315
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
You guys are just in a black pill mode.

316
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Just wants it all to burn.

317
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:09,520
I kind of would have, like it would have been the saving grace of the whole thing,

318
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
is the knowledge that YouTube is finally fucking killed.

319
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Fuck you.

320
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
And you know what that reminds me?

321
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,520
The kind of the other point of CGPK's video was that like guys at any moment,

322
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
YouTube can ban us, can deal with, like this guy's got four million subscribers.

323
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
At any moment, YouTube can just decide arbitrarily,

324
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,520
they add more and more clauses when they can just decide

325
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
if they don't want you anymore and whatnot.

326
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
He's like, but you know what still fucking works?

327
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Email lists, baby.

328
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Email lists are the way to go to make sure.

329
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I know you've got your email list, Gib.

330
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,520
I just now went to my monetization settings and I clicked it.

331
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
I never upload content for kids settings.

332
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Woo!

333
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Lives saved.

334
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,520
But Ben, you talked about Winnie the Pooh.

335
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Well, not to you.

336
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,520
If you're 13 or under, you stupid jerk.

337
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Get off my internet.

338
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Boomers, rise up.

339
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Imagine a future.

340
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,520
This is just some anti-zoomer propagandas that this is.

341
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Yeah, that's true.

342
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,520
We Zoomers deserved have ads served to us, catered to our specific needs.

343
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,520
It's fucked up, but they'll take that away from us.

344
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
That's how we exist.

345
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah, well, good luck to everybody out there.

346
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
It's a jungle out there.

347
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Everybody should make their own website and email list anyway,

348
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
because it's just better.

349
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,520
But the effort, ooh, the more than zero effort that requires.

350
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Ooh, Ungabunga, Ungabunga.

351
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Oh, man.

352
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Think about my email.

353
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
Never, never, never.

354
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Speaking of websites that I own,

355
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,520
which is my website, apsadventures.site,

356
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
the name sucks.

357
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I've been trying to think of a better name for months, for years.

358
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Gibbentake.com, Hippocrite.com.

359
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,520
I guess Gibbentake.com might do it.

360
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
It hurt to have both.

361
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
We did it, guys. We figured it out.

362
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Fine, I guess that wasn't...

363
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I'd say it's the most well-known branding name of you, perhaps,

364
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,520
except maybe Hippocrite, but slightly different thing there.

365
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,520
Yeah, the only thing I was thinking about with Gibbentake...

366
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Did you buy content.com, which redirects to our YouTube,

367
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,520
for like 20 bucks for a year, so that, you know, not too expensive.

368
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh, no, no, it's not the expense that I'm thinking of.

369
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
It's just like the name. I wanted a name.

370
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
20 bucks for a year, that's a fucking deal.

371
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah, I mean, how many people wanted...

372
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
It cost me like $10 a month.

373
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,520
How many people wanted can-tent, I guess, spelled fucked up.

374
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Wait, no, no, wait, I'm paying for hosting,

375
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
so that's different.

376
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Never mind.

377
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
I wanted something...

378
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,520
I was trying to think of something that was,

379
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,520
one, unique and interesting and cool and stuff.

380
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Two, sort of explains what the hell it is before you click on it.

381
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Like, St. Comics, okay, it's a comic website about angels, I guess,

382
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
you know, from the name.

383
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
A good Catholic website, thank God.

384
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Yeah, and something that you couldn't actually misspell.

385
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Like, if you heard someone say it, there would be no way you could misspell it.

386
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Like, St. Comics, those are words.

387
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
You know how to spell those.

388
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,520
They're not comics with a CK and an X, as I recall, which was wise.

389
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,520
But fucking give and take, it's a pun, it's a play on words, it's give and take.

390
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,520
If you say that to someone, they're not immediately going to understand it's the monkey

391
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,520
and the act of taking something as a word.

392
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
So I was like, that might not be perfect.

393
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
I mean, phonetically, give and take.

394
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,520
I mean, people hear the joke, but I mean, the B's are very distinct.

395
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,520
I think it's a pretty decent one for recognizability of how to write it.

396
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,520
But then again, I've known you so long, maybe I'm a little biased in that.

397
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Yeah, Hippocrates similarly, like, the whole joke, not the whole joke,

398
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,520
but part of the joke is that it's like how people often misspell Hippocrite.

399
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Names are hard, guys.

400
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Marketing and shmarketing.

401
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I've been putting it off for a million years.

402
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,520
And also, I don't like the idea of like, porting over Bale-Japes in its entirety to a whole other website.

403
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Or, you know, whatever I would need to do to change the name.

404
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Couldn't you just copy the code?

405
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Like, just copy paste the whole thing.

406
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
You're using Google Sites, right?

407
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,520
No, no, I'm using WordPress's thing.

408
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Not free WordPress, the other one.

409
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,520
The real big boy WordPress.org?

410
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
The real WordPress, yes.

411
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
That's what the PCP website uses as well.

412
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,520
I've been uploading, so I've started uploading to Webtoon and Tapas.

413
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm kind of pushing Webtoon more because I feel like the audience is bigger there.

414
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,520
But at some point, I'll put Slime and Punishment up on St. Comics, just like as an archive.

415
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,520
But I've been putting it on Webtoon just because I feel like, not a lot of people,

416
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,520
but like some people will see it there and like, you know...

417
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Possibly the most dedicated fans, perhaps, if they're there?

418
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Maybe.

419
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Yeah, like, just because it's a public, it's like YouTube.

420
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
It's like YouTube for Web Comics.

421
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
And go visit my fucking site.

422
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Go search Bansain on webtoons.com.

423
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Subscribe, like all my shit.

424
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
It just passed a thousand likes on Slime and Punishment,

425
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,520
which means that now, when it's displayed, when you see a new update

426
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,520
on the little fucking new updates page, it doesn't just...

427
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
It actually tells you how...

428
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
It says like, this guy's actually got some fucking likes on his shit.

429
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Oh, that's nice.

430
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Like, oh yeah, I'm cool.

431
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
What's the... Is the currency devalued?

432
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
What's like a large number of likes or whatever to have on tabs?

433
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,520
I mean, if you're really big, you might have millions.

434
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Okay, fair enough.

435
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Fair enough.

436
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Homestuck?

437
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
No.

438
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Two likes.

439
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Nobody likes.

440
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
No, like...

441
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Zero likes and homestuck.

442
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Or, um...

443
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
I don't know.

444
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
God, I wish that were me.

445
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Yeah, I wish everyone was using Notify.me,

446
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,520
because it is the best thing in the world that nobody...

447
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Explain that, Tom.

448
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
I don't understand.

449
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Okay, so Notify.me is a website...

450
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Is a website slash app slash service,

451
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,520
and what you do is you can make an account on Notify.me,

452
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,520
and you can plug in any source you want,

453
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
and people can subscribe to you on Notify.me,

454
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
and every time you upload anything anywhere,

455
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
it sends your subscribers a notification.

456
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,520
So instead of having to be like,

457
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Oh, I have to be on YouTube,

458
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
because that's where everybody is.

459
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
If everybody just used Notify.me,

460
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
you could just post on your website,

461
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
a notification that you posted something on your website,

462
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
on their Notify app,

463
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
and then they could see it there.

464
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Oh, so they have to download Notify.

465
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Correct.

466
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,520
It's a platform specifically just to have notifications.

467
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,520
It's basically pulling the notifications out of an app,

468
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
out of individual apps,

469
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
like, oh, I gotta get my YouTube notifications

470
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
and my Twitter notifications.

471
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
It's putting them all in one thing.

472
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
So you get notifications of people, not of services.

473
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I mean, I would love it if everything was kind of on there,

474
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
and it kind of reminds me a little bit of, like,

475
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Dick's Masterson made New Project 2,

476
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
which is just Patreon with no...

477
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,520
It actually takes zero fees from what I understand,

478
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
so it actually would be preferable.

479
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
It takes a small transaction fee for the bank.

480
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
For bank fees.

481
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
I mean, yeah, that's understandable,

482
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
but I mean, Patreon takes, I believe, a 5% cut.

483
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Slightly more, if I remember.

484
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
I think it's like 9%.

485
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Is it? I haven't checked in a while.

486
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
90%.

487
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
No, maybe it's not 9%.

488
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
I know they changed their terms.

489
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I think it used to be 5, and then they changed their terms.

490
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
But, like, we have an old Patreon,

491
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
so it got grandfathered into the, like,

492
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
we keep the 5% or something.

493
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't fucking know.

494
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
But, like, that...

495
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Patreon has all these facsimiles of, like,

496
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
vestigial social media stuff

497
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
that doesn't matter, and who cares,

498
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
and I just want a bank transaction on a place

499
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
that won't kick me off,

500
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
which I am not convinced Patreon will never do to us,

501
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
or any of us individually.

502
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
So just a neutral platform

503
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
that just does nothing would be nice.

504
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Yeah, like one of these generic...

505
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
As generic as possible, please.

506
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,520
No coming down on any side of any issue.

507
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Just transact.

508
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
That would be my preference, but...

509
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Hey, what you gonna do?

510
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,520
I mean, I love minimalist,

511
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
like, no bells and whistles,

512
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,520
no distraction bullshit on websites,

513
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
which is why most social media websites are annoying.

514
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,520
They've always got things they want you to look at,

515
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,520
and advertisements, and clickity-clackity things

516
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
all over the place.

517
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
And then every normal website

518
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
that is owned by some company has, you know,

519
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
100,000 things you have to click on

520
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
before you can see anything,

521
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
and then you also have to turn your ad blocker off,

522
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
and it's just, like, this is unsatisfying.

523
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I hate the internet. It's not good anymore.

524
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I just want a blank page with text on it that I can read.

525
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
You know, I think that this kind of, I don't know,

526
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,520
this, like, social media-esque bubble,

527
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
I think it will eventually burst,

528
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
and I think that we will see a return

529
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,520
to rote functionality one day,

530
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
where people will be like, it's just a basic shit.

531
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I don't think it will ever return to anything.

532
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
I think what's gonna happen is that the social media bubble

533
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
is going to become an entirely normie thing,

534
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
and then everyone who's cool

535
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,520
will be not doing it anymore.

536
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Like, they'll have to log on to Twitter for work.

537
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Yeah.

538
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
God, I can't wait for the, what is it,

539
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
the social credit score.

540
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Please, I want my tweets to be evaluated

541
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,520
for their affiliation to the one-party system

542
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
that we have. Oh, God, please.

543
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I want to rake up the points.

544
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Imagine if we made social, oh, God,

545
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,520
my peach fucking amiibo just fell,

546
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
but that's all right.

547
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Speaking of social credit,

548
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
what was I fucking saying?

549
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I want to gamify political ranking in the country

550
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
because I will then win.

551
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I will then get the high score.

552
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
But right now, it's just some bullshit about it.

553
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Wait, gamify in what way?

554
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
What would you suggest?

555
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
If there's a number value attached

556
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,520
to how many things I'm allowed to do socially,

557
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
like in China, if you do certain things

558
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
and you have a loan of social credit score,

559
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,520
I could be off about this, but as I understood it,

560
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
you can't take the train

561
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
to travel between cities or something.

562
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
You just aren't allowed to do that.

563
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,520
And I don't know what mechanisms you have to change it.

564
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Maybe you can go give yourself 100 lashes

565
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
or go right on the chalkboard.

566
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I believe in the state,

567
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
something like that over and over.

568
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
I want that. I'll be in there every day,

569
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
scribbling on my chalkboard.

570
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
You can go kill Hong Kong protesters

571
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,520
and you get points for everyone you take down.

572
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Headshots count for extra 50 points.

573
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Oh, my God, this is it.

574
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
It's like death race.

575
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,520
I was going to say, they let you log into a video game,

576
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,520
but it's like a drone control video game

577
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,520
and you log in to go mow down Hong Kong protesters

578
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
to up your credit score.

579
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Now, that's the kind of shit I'm talking about.

580
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,520
It's like that thing in standalone complex, I think.

581
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
I think I saw a Digi video where they made a video game

582
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,520
and it controls a robot that goes and kills people

583
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
and the kids don't realize that's what's happening.

584
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,520
I don't remember that in standalone comics.

585
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Wait, was it Psycho Pass Season 2?

586
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
It was something bad.

587
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I would guess that Psycho Pass.

588
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Yeah, that is Psycho Pass.

589
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
That's funny because I was totally afraid.

590
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,520
I was almost revealed as a ghost on the shelf fraud just now.

591
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
That was a close one.

592
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
I've never seen that fucking show.

593
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
I only know it because of Digi talking about that show,

594
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
but I thought I had seen it.

595
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
I was like, oh yeah, that was totally standalone complex.

596
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I remember the whole thing.

597
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,520
The thing is, Nate, if this comes to pass

598
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
and it will be just like anything else

599
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
YouTube slash the internet does,

600
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
where the rules will be an algorithm

601
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
and we will not know what it is.

602
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
So we'll have to reverse engineer how the fuck

603
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
we even got our social credit score

604
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,520
and how to make it better and it'll be a nightmare.

605
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,520
It reminds me of how Matt Pat was so convinced early on

606
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
because Matt Pat originally came to YouTube

607
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
from like he worked for an MSM

608
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
or whatever the fuck they're called

609
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
streaming, so he felt he had an understanding

610
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
of how things were going to work.

611
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,520
He made a video once about how he was convinced

612
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
PewDiePie had gotten so popular,

613
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
but PewDiePie has many times come out

614
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
and been like, this is complete bullshit

615
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
and is not true.

616
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
I forget exactly why he was convinced of that,

617
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,520
but I remember thinking that seemed reasonable.

618
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
So I don't know which of those two guys are right,

619
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
but they definitely don't agree

620
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
and one of them's got to be kind of right

621
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
more than the other, I'd assume.

622
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Matt Pat talked about how PewDiePie was saying

623
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
that it was bullshit and he said,

624
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
you know, I did get some things wrong.

625
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
I'm not interested in the drama,

626
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,520
but on this point of order, as Tom's saying,

627
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
we have to kind of figure out how the systems work

628
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
because we are not told deliberately so.

629
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
They want to keep things mysterious,

630
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,520
maybe for the illusion of naturality

631
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
in the system or something.

632
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
I think it's just because if everyone knows

633
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
how the algorithm works,

634
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
everyone will just game it instead of like,

635
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
just make content.

636
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
There's this back and forth of just like,

637
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
you want to have a platform

638
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
that is serving the user,

639
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
but without being so transparent

640
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
that it's completely

641
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,520
disincentivizing natural content creation.

642
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
It's that everyone's just trying to game the system

643
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,520
because then the system is limiting expression

644
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
and not helping it, you know?

645
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
It's occurred to me recently on that front.

646
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
I have just continued making videos

647
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
and I recognize about this myself.

648
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
I've just basically assumed

649
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
that like, if I just keep doing it,

650
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
things will work out reasonably well.

651
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Like, I'm probably not being suppressed

652
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
in unfortunate ways.

653
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,520
I'm probably not like, totally wasting my time.

654
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
It'll probably work out, right?

655
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
I don't know that that's true,

656
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
but that's how I'm operating.

657
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
And I'm aware that like,

658
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
continuing to operate is basically assuming

659
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
that that is the case.

660
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
So like, I have culpability

661
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
in that I'm choosing to believe that, basically.

662
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
And it may not be true.

663
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
I may be making horrible mistakes

664
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
and wasting my time day in and day out,

665
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
but well, I guess I'll learn that one of these days,

666
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
maybe when I'm dead.

667
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
And God tells me so.

668
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
It's strange in particular,

669
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,520
your channel and its growth

670
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
has always, I guess, kind of confused me

671
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
because like, the meme has always been,

672
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
and we've mentioned it on this show before,

673
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
like once you hit 100k,

674
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
you get that extra boost.

675
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm hoping for that to happen.

676
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
And that like, didn't happen for your channel for some reason?

677
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
I completely flatlined it, 100,000 basically.

678
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
And I don't understand why that is happening,

679
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
because it's not like you've stopped making content.

680
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Like, oh, I hit 100k, time to hang up my hat.

681
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
You know, it's been very interesting

682
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
for me to look at the,

683
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
and maybe the videos are just worse,

684
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
that's definitely possible,

685
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
but like, for a time,

686
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
we were getting like, I don't know,

687
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
like easily between 30,000 to 50,000,

688
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
even over like 100,000 views,

689
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
and they're like, relatively lucky to clear 20,000.

690
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
And I just wonder,

691
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
is it just me, or did something change?

692
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
I mean, I'd be happy to

693
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
accept responsibility,

694
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
if I'm just making a worse product,

695
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
that's definitely possible,

696
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
but it doesn't seem like that.

697
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
I think it would be a mixture,

698
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
because I felt like,

699
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
your more recent wee aguas in the past

700
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
like, few months have been,

701
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
you know, like, they're alright.

702
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
They feel a little bloated

703
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
of talking going on in them,

704
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
especially like, the front-loading

705
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
upload, like, you talk about

706
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
what the thing is for a long time,

707
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
and then get to the interesting part,

708
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
like, near the middle and the end.

709
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
It's just that I don't feel that that's changed much

710
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
from how they used to be,

711
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
and I mean, that's the curious thing to me.

712
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm aware, I'm happy to take any criticisms,

713
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
and you know...

714
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
I mean, that's just my, like, the back of my head,

715
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
like, what am I thinking?

716
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Like, why was I happy about

717
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
just sort of, eh, I don't really understand.

718
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Well, you know, I have one other theory that relates to that,

719
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
which is just that the format has gotten

720
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
stale, kind of in general,

721
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
and that could explain it. Like, at first,

722
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
maybe the videos were better, maybe they weren't,

723
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
they were shorter when they first started,

724
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
but now people, like, one, they're bloated,

725
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
and two, maybe people are simply like,

726
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
eh, I get it, Nate talks about thing, whatever,

727
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
which is, you know, again, that could totally be

728
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
fair. We're all just still waiting

729
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
for the second video of Nate's channel,

730
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Best Anime Ever Goes On The Shell.

731
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
It will happen someday. I'm sure

732
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Nate will make a new video eventually.

733
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
It's only been, like, two years.

734
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
One of these days, one of these days,

735
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
we'll see a video from Nate.

736
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Why is he leaving us hanging? He doesn't make any videos.

737
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Oof. I'm doing my best, boys.

738
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
One day.

739
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Hey, uh, incidentally, left turn,

740
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
I've got an anecdote that I think

741
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
you lads will find amusing,

742
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
enjoyable, uh, perhaps

743
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
hilarious.

744
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Uh, let's, let's, let's, let's see what you think.

745
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
So, the other day, I was going to

746
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
the P.O. box to pick up my mail

747
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
for We Aguas, as it happens,

748
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
and I went and got my, got my couple of packages,

749
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
and I forget why.

750
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
There was, like, an issue with one or something.

751
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, I had to actually, I was paying for a renewal

752
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
to my, uh, P.O. box,

753
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
because it was, it was running out. Got to get six more months, whatever.

754
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
So, I had to go up to the counter to do this,

755
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
and so, me and, and Michelle happens to be with me,

756
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
because we were, she was driving somewhere, whatever.

757
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
And she's wearing her big bear coat.

758
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
It's like, uh, she gets compliments on it all the time.

759
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
It's, it's cute, it's furry, it's got a big bear face.

760
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
It's, uh, everybody loves it.

761
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Right? And she's actually, actually one time

762
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
we were in the airport, and

763
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
a woman just walked up and said,

764
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
hey, excuse me, I love your coat.

765
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Can I just buy it off you?

766
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
And Michelle said, I mean, you know,

767
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm a kind of cold, and the woman was like,

768
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I'll give you my coat, and I'll pay you for it.

769
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
It seemed like a, a well-off individual.

770
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
How good is this coat? I haven't seen this.

771
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
This really happened. I think she was only willing

772
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
to go up to, like, 50 bucks

773
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
and she would also trade her coat.

774
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Which is, it's not like this coat is, like,

775
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
so, like, valuable,

776
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
it just is cute, and I think on a whim

777
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
people like it. And she gets compliments all the time.

778
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
So, in this case.

779
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
If you want to, you want to make a proposition like that,

780
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
you gotta have more money to throw around than 50 bucks.

781
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
To buy the coat off their back, I mean, yeah,

782
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
for sure. We're talking, we're talking, like,

783
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
like, 50K, maybe.

784
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
I mean, Michelle skinned

785
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
this bear herself. She wrestled it,

786
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
she defeated it in combat, you know,

787
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
it was at least $75.

788
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I'd say so.

789
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
So, Michelle's, whatever,

790
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
she's wearing this coat, we walk into the counter,

791
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
and I'm buying the renewal for the P.O. Box.

792
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
And the lady, it's like this nice black lady

793
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
I see all the time. She, she just says to us,

794
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
she's like, oh, you know, hey, nice to see you again.

795
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
I'm like, hey, what's going on? She's like, oh, I,

796
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
I love your coat, she says to Michelle.

797
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
And she's like, oh, thank you, thank you,

798
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
getting one of these compliments. And she's like,

799
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
you know what that reminds me of?

800
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
My son's, like, my son has.

801
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
And we're like, okay, that's interesting.

802
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
She's like, yeah, you know,

803
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
except his doesn't have the face on it

804
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
in that same spot, she had, like, the hood back.

805
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
He's like, yeah, his has, like, a tail on it

806
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
instead.

807
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Interesting, interesting.

808
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
And then she's like, yeah, you know,

809
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
he was wearing it at this thing called,

810
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
I swear to God, this is true,

811
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Anthrocon, or like, something like that.

812
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
And I mean, we're just,

813
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
we're just looking at each other.

814
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
And we are thinking to ourselves, oh,

815
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
oh no. And you know Michelle,

816
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Michelle hates the furries.

817
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
She wants the full genocide of the

818
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
furries. So Michelle

819
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
is not pleased

820
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
to be compared to an Anthrocon.

821
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
So this whole time, maybe that lady who came

822
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
up to buy it was like a furry

823
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
and they were looking for that sort of coat.

824
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
She was on her way to Anthrocon and she needed

825
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
a costume, she forgot hers at home.

826
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
So like, as we're leaving, she's like,

827
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,520
yeah, you know, it looks great on you,

828
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,520
but you know, I don't know about my sons,

829
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
like it's a little weird for like a 30-year-old man

830
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
to be wearing a fuzzy bear outfit,

831
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
but hey, he's my son, so I love him.

832
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
And we're like, thank you, ma'am,

833
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
thank you, ma'am, for this information.

834
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Have a wonderful day. And we

835
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
turned 360 degrees and walked out.

836
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
And so Michelle

837
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
was just reeling from the realization

838
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
that maybe Michelle

839
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Tobin is a little closer to the furry

840
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
community than she would like to believe.

841
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
You know, she's real cozy with Cassie

842
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
and she's seeing some red flags

843
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
trying to recover from the mental trauma.

844
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
So this coat has like a

845
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
bare head?

846
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
I will have to get a picture and put it in the show notes,

847
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
but it's just like a tan

848
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
furry-looking coat

849
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
and the hood that you can put up over your face

850
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
just as kind of like a cutesy sort of

851
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Japanese-looking bear face

852
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
on the hood. Is it like the end of Midsommar?

853
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Yes, identical to the ending of Midsommar.

854
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
I just watched Midsommar

855
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
yesterday or two days ago

856
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
because I was supposed to discuss it with

857
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Mumki and Florian on Is It Kino?

858
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
And then Mumki just... No, Mumki

859
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
just like, he's just like

860
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
too busy. I didn't

861
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
like one day before

862
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
we're supposed to do it,

863
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,520
he just puts in our group chat

864
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
like, eh, you know,

865
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
I don't have the time to do Is It Kino

866
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
or watch any of the movies.

867
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Well, at least he gave you a day warning, I guess,

868
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
but still an unfortunate. Well, yeah, the day before.

869
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
I had already gone

870
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
and watched, like, all the shit.

871
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Was there more than one?

872
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Yeah, there was.

873
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Because I said, I wanted... Mumki, Mumki.

874
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
He was like, pick a

875
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
pick a thing, pick like an underrated movie

876
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,520
you want to talk about. And I was like,

877
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
Turbo Kid, 100%

878
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
Turbo Kid. Oh, right, right, yeah, yeah.

879
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,520
And they were like, okay, cool, we'll watch

880
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Turbo Kid. And then, like, later on

881
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
in the week, Florian is like

882
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
he's like, hey, have you seen

883
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
some movie? It was like some

884
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
new movie with Christian Bale. And I'm like,

885
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
no? And he's like, we're going to talk about that too.

886
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
And I'm like, I gotta

887
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
go to the theater and watch a movie?

888
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
I thought we paid him money too.

889
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Well, I didn't. I skipped out.

890
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
And then I was like, and then he's like, okay,

891
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,520
we're also going to talk about the New Rick and Morty

892
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,520
and Midsommar. And I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ.

893
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
A lot of things, a lot of things.

894
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
I don't want to do any of those, but I did.

895
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
I did watch the New Rick and Morty

896
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
and I did watch Midsommar just for this.

897
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
I didn't get to watch whatever this Christian Bale

898
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,520
film is. And I don't really want to,

899
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
but whatever.

900
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
Yeah. And then it gets

901
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,520
fucking postponed indefinitely

902
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
on my ass.

903
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,520
I can't believe you would come out here

904
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
and make a straight-up drama video

905
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
against one, Monkey Jones.

906
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,520
It's never been done before, as I understand it.

907
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
And you are breaking new ground here

908
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
by exposing him as the hack-fraud

909
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,520
canceler of plans. A real Indian giver

910
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
of, you know. That full little baby

911
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
needs all the defense he can get.

912
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
Mmm.

913
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,520
I'm just the guy to give it.

914
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Well, I made that just the way.

915
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
Well, I was until now.

916
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,520
I really would have wanted to watch that, though.

917
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
I've never seen it. I've never seen

918
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Izakino. It's just never been a thing

919
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,520
I wanted to look at. No. Oh, I watched,

920
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
I remember feeling, I was, I will

921
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
stent me and Asperger are like

922
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,520
bosom buddies over our love

923
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,520
of law-abiding citizens

924
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
starring Russell Crowe.

925
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
Yeah, Russell Crowe. Is that true?

926
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Absolutely. Absolutely.

927
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Okay. I mean, we never

928
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
spoke about it, but he did love that movie

929
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,520
and I also love that movie.

930
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
I have never seen law-abiding citizens.

931
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
It's based.

932
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Okay. All right. Pretty epic.

933
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
That's all there is to it, Ben. It's frankly, it's based.

934
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
Okay. Well, I mean, you can't

935
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
argue with quality. You know, I mean, it's about

936
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,520
a man. It's about a man going to any

937
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,520
lengths to get revenge for his

938
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
significant other, his wife in this case,

939
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,520
being, let's just say,

940
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,520
manhandled a bit negatively, and we all

941
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
know how Asperger feels about those things.

942
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,520
He won't have that. Oh boy.

943
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Yeah, okay.

944
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,520
Let's, let's, okay.

945
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,520
Okay.

946
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Nobody knows what you're talking about.

947
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,520
That'll never get old. Should we cut this

948
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,520
part? No, why? That's fine.

949
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
I mean, is it not okay to make jokes

950
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
about a man who actually, you know,

951
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,520
laid his hands upon another?

952
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
It's kind of, all right. All right. Let's move

953
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,520
on. Okay. All right. I'm uncomfortable.

954
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
But it's pretty funny.

955
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
I'm very comfortable. But anyway. Okay, cool.

956
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
That's, did I have another thing? Oh,

957
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
you know what? Small baby little anecdote

958
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
here. I was just driving to pick up Michelle

959
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
from work, and on an overpass I

960
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
drove under. Simply the words.

961
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Now, it's just, it's rare for me to see

962
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
what, to me, was basically a meme,

963
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
but this made it more real in my mind.

964
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
Just on this overpass was spray

965
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
painted the words, you know, in Cincinnati, Ohio,

966
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
out here in the Midwest doing bullshit.

967
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,520
Just the words, Epstein didn't kill himself.

968
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,520
Written on a bridge

969
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
in real life. Good, good for that.

970
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
Like everyone we've seen. Good for that bridge.

971
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Good job. It's, you know, I mean,

972
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
it just makes me reflect on how, like,

973
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,520
oh, this isn't just funny internet memes.

974
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
This is things that, like, kind of the real world

975
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
probably gives a shit about, which

976
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
is totally fair.

977
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
Oopsie-doopsy. There we go again.

978
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,520
I found myself, like, I was listening

979
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
to the news in the background, and

980
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
they were saying something about, there was, like,

981
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Prince Andrew,

982
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
son of Prince, not son,

983
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
a brother to Prince Charles,

984
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
the least, the less

985
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,520
cool Prince

986
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
son of the Queen. I thought he was the Queen's favorite, though.

987
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
I heard he was her favorite. I don't know if I can read it.

988
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
I've never fucking heard of this guy. Prince Charles

989
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
is always in the news. Prince Andrew is not.

990
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Prince Andrew has, like,

991
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
like,

992
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
like a suspiciously close

993
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,520
friendship with Jeffrey Epstein,

994
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,520
and there was an interview where he was

995
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
talking about stuff, and he was like,

996
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
huh, what's going on?

997
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
That was a rough one.

998
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
But anyway, they were talking about Jeffrey Epstein

999
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,520
on the news, and they were saying

1000
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Epstein, who hung himself in his

1001
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Prince style. Oh, come on now, guys.

1002
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
And I just, like, it was

1003
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
an unconscious reaction. I was like, no, he didn't.

1004
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
Like, I just said that.

1005
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
No, he didn't. Like, it wasn't a meme.

1006
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
I wasn't trying to be funny. It was like, oh, yeah,

1007
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
I guess it's true.

1008
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
I said it without thinking about it.

1009
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,520
Oh, you know what I heard about? I heard that

1010
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,520
one Steven Crowder, who I'm sure everybody here

1011
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,520
loves intensely, is going

1012
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
to do a show where he's going

1013
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,520
to attempt to snap his own

1014
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,520
spine in the ways

1015
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
that it's been reported that Epstein

1016
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
did, and I don't know,

1017
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,520
he says he's doing a live stream or something. He's going to put, like,

1018
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
a gauge around his neck

1019
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,520
and attempt to gauge

1020
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,520
how much force is being applied as he, like,

1021
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,520
you know, ties himself up and, like, jumps

1022
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
off a bunk bed that, like, they've constructed

1023
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
for this. This sounds like a

1024
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
liberal's wet dream, because, like, on the one

1025
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
hand, you can either prove that Epstein didn't kill

1026
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
himself, or Steven Crowder

1027
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
will die. We could all get

1028
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
behind this one.

1029
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Hmm.

1030
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
I'm coming around. You know, it does

1031
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
make me feel warm to see

1032
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
how everybody is on this

1033
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
bullshit about how Epstein definitely

1034
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,520
didn't. I mean, Epstein just committing

1035
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,520
suicide. Woopsie-doopsie is not the full

1036
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,520
story. We're all, we're all

1037
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,520
seeing it right now. We should cross the aisle and be

1038
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
bipartisan and just run the corpse of

1039
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
Jeffrey Epstein for president in 2020.

1040
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
The one man you can trust

1041
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,520
to not kill himself

1042
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,520
in office. It's, I mean,

1043
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
it's still sort of sad, though. Like, it's a

1044
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,520
meme, and it can be spread as a

1045
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,520
meme, and people can say it and spray paint it

1046
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
everywhere, but, like,

1047
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,520
nobody actually has any information on who

1048
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
did cover it up. They did

1049
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
their job correctly. Nobody has any leads.

1050
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
You didn't kill himself, and we can't

1051
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,520
prove who it was. And I'll happily

1052
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,520
say, as I always do, like, it is

1053
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
fear. I think there are conspiracies,

1054
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
like, I don't know, like, there are versions

1055
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
of the tale where Epstein was, like,

1056
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
pressured or convinced to

1057
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
in some ways, like, kill himself

1058
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,520
in some ways.

1059
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
Kill himself. I mean, I guess

1060
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,520
I know what you mean. There are

1061
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,520
things that, there are levers that can be pulled to make

1062
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,520
someone commit suicide because, like, worse things

1063
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
will be done to, I don't know, people they love

1064
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,520
or they're, like, things like that.

1065
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
I'm pretty sure if you're forced

1066
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
to kill yourself, it's not actually suicide

1067
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,520
anymore.

1068
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,520
You know, that's, legally speaking, you might be right.

1069
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,520
You might be right. But,

1070
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
like, it's just,

1071
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,520
I'm just so

1072
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
disappointed by the

1073
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
lack of, what's the word,

1074
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
credulity, or incredulity

1075
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,520
by, you know, many people

1076
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
who just report it as fact. Like, yeah,

1077
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,520
it definitely killed himself. I mean, the mainstream

1078
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,520
media is obviously just going to step in line

1079
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,520
and say what they need to say, and

1080
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
there's no chance of it. What do they even gain?

1081
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,520
But everyone is, like,

1082
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
this is, we don't believe you.

1083
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
Well, that's the thing. That's the thing is, like,

1084
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,520
the people who orchestrated

1085
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
his murder,

1086
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,520
and who can manipulate the media

1087
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
into saying for sure that, you know,

1088
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
not even trying to look into it, like, you can't

1089
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
report on, you can't, any of your journalists

1090
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
who want to go nosing around, tell them to stop.

1091
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,520
Experiency theorists, madmen,

1092
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,520
like, somebody or some group of people

1093
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
just have the power to do that, and that's

1094
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
sucks.

1095
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
I mean, we just, we need our

1096
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,520
boy, we need our lord and savior, Alex Jones,

1097
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,520
to get involved and really start

1098
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
getting to the bottom of this mystery.

1099
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
I want to see

1100
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,520
Alex Jones snapping necks and be like, no, it required

1101
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,520
more force than it took to do Epstein.

1102
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,520
Let me tell you,

1103
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,520
have you guys seen that wonderful image of him

1104
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
on, like, his male vitality

1105
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,520
supplement or whatever, where it's before and after

1106
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,520
him, with his, like, you know, fat

1107
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
man, what's the word, like, dad bod,

1108
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
and then, like, after one month,

1109
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
and after one month of using it, it's

1110
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,520
just him, he looks exactly the same,

1111
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,520
but significantly redder.

1112
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Like, his whole body

1113
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
is just glowing with

1114
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
male vitality.

1115
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,520
And he tells that.

1116
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,520
I love all those

1117
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,520
memes where it's that video

1118
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,520
of him, like, pointing someone like, hey, you.

1119
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
It's like a Pokemon using overheat or something like that.

1120
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
I love

1121
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
all those memes where it's, like, the video of

1122
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,520
him, like, pointing at someone's like, hey,

1123
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
you, fuck you, and he starts running towards

1124
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
them, but it's like, come out and put on

1125
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
game footage.

1126
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
Like, there was a Minecraft one where a creeper blew him up.

1127
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,520
Yeah, I've seen that one.

1128
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,520
Or actually, you know, a better comparison is, like,

1129
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,520
it's like Regigigas with, like, slow

1130
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
start, where for three turns

1131
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,520
he's just a normal mortal man, but on

1132
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
turn four, he's at full capacity

1133
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,520
and he's sprinting at you as

1134
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,520
Regigigas.

1135
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
Oh my god, here comes the super

1136
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Alex Jones.

1137
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
I love Pokemon. Let's talk about Pokemon.

1138
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,520
That's a great idea.

1139
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,520
We can talk about Pokemon and politics through the lens

1140
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,520
of Alex Jones.

1141
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,520
It all comes together.

1142
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,520
Oof, beat the game.

1143
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,520
It was good. I had a fun time.

1144
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,520
No, no, it was a joke, Nate. We don't actually

1145
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
know about Pokemon.

1146
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,520
Go watch the new content episode, Me and Did You

1147
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Produced, where we go into it at length

1148
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
in a, what's the word, separate but equal

1149
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,520
podcast to the PCP.

1150
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,520
Just for Pokemon discussion.

1151
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,520
Oh, yeah, speaking of.

1152
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,520
We have three-fifths of a podcast, I'd say.

1153
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,520
You're going to do new Rickstee Minutes?

1154
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
Oh, that's the next one coming up. Yep, we're definitely

1155
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,520
doing new Rickstee Minutes.

1156
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,520
Cool. Has there been another Rick and Woody since

1157
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
the first one came out?

1158
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
I think three episodes are out now, I believe.

1159
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,520
At least two.

1160
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
I'll give you the short version on episode one,

1161
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
which is the one I've seen so far.

1162
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
It was good, bordering on great,

1163
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
but not amazing.

1164
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
And I'm looking forward to see if it gets

1165
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,520
better or worse or, I don't know.

1166
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Well, what to say? I liked it.

1167
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
It was fun. Yeah, that was good.

1168
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
It was fun and it was still Rick and Woody, so.

1169
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,520
It was. I was not majorly disappointed at all.

1170
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,520
Fuck yeah.

1171
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,520
Fuck yeah.

1172
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
I saw premiere and I saw episode two

1173
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
and I thought the second episode was

1174
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,520
pretty mediocre, but the premiere was

1175
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520
pretty good. That's the opposite

1176
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,520
of what I was hoping for. I was hoping it would

1177
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,520
ramp up as it keeps going.

1178
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,520
I've watched any of them. I've just been watching

1179
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,520
Beastars and The Mandalorian, which are both

1180
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
fucking sick.

1181
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,520
Oh shit, have you got

1182
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
Didney Plurps? No, I have

1183
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
the Leetx.to,

1184
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
my favorite streaming service.

1185
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
Everything's there. Leetx?

1186
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Leetx.to.

1187
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,520
You guys heard about Leetx.to?

1188
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Is that legal? Is that legal?

1189
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Monkey showed me this app and maybe I shouldn't

1190
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,520
talk about it publicly, but here I am.

1191
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,520
It's called TTV

1192
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,520
and it just gets everything.

1193
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,520
That sounds good.

1194
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
I couldn't find any

1195
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
rips of Rick and Morty

1196
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
through Googling

1197
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,520
and I'm like, hey monkey, where do I see it?

1198
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
And he tells me about this app called

1199
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,520
tea.tv

1200
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
and I just get on there and I type

1201
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,520
in Rick and Morty season four

1202
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,520
and in zero time

1203
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,520
there's like, you know, 50 different

1204
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,520
file versions of the

1205
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,520
new episodes

1206
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,520
and he just finds

1207
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
anything on there for free.

1208
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Do you have to torrent him or are they streaming there?

1209
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,520
Well, I downloaded it to my phone.

1210
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
They were streaming but I downloaded it

1211
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,520
because it was, you know,

1212
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,520
the phone wouldn't sputter or lag or anything

1213
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,520
and so I don't know.

1214
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,520
That seems pretty cool.

1215
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,520
Seems like it worked

1216
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
as intended.

1217
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
Fuck the police.

1218
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Hear that knock on your door?

1219
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,520
That's the police. They're listening

1220
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,520
to this podcast right now. They're coming for you.

1221
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Oh, you know, the other day

1222
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,520
I made a bit of a cheeky tweet

1223
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
as

1224
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,520
like it was a Nintendo put out

1225
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
a tweet that was like, hey

1226
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
it's like the 15 year anniversary

1227
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,520
of the Nintendo DS.

1228
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,520
Name some of your favorite games

1229
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
and I as an epic meme lord

1230
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
tweeted out, like I retweeted

1231
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,520
that and said, what was it, like

1232
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
the homebrew channel.

1233
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,520
It was an excellent game. Really had a lot of fun

1234
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
with that one or something.

1235
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,520
And full disc, I think actually

1236
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,520
I think Keyblade's spirit, that mother fucker

1237
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
said like, wasn't it actually on the 3DS

1238
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,520
the homebrew channel? But you know what the fuck I mean

1239
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
my R4 card, my Ace card 2Y

1240
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,520
I almost said it but I was like

1241
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
don't let it get out of your skin, Nate.

1242
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,520
I won't, damn you Keyblade. Now I'm mad.

1243
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Don't play on my DS.

1244
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,520
I won't immediately

1245
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,520
let you get out of your skin.

1246
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Two multiplayer.

1247
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
I mean I played, I emulated a bunch of stuff

1248
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
I played a million games

1249
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
I think I actually played

1250
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,520
ironically, I played Mother 3

1251
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
on my PSP

1252
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,520
emulating it on there instead.

1253
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
But it was a wonderful time and it was a great

1254
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
PSP was a great concept. They had a great

1255
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,520
art app for the DS on DS Homebrew

1256
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,520
called Colors. And it was crazy

1257
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,520
because the screen on the DS

1258
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,520
has pressure sensitivity. So this art

1259
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
program was basically just turned your DS

1260
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,520
into a tiny little Waycom tablet.

1261
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,520
I did a bunch of art projects in college

1262
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,520
on my DS because I was too lazy

1263
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
to get up and go to my computer.

1264
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,520
I don't blame you.

1265
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,520
That's sick. That's sick.

1266
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,520
I'll picto chat will always be in my heart

1267
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,520
and I'll never forget it. Greatest app of all time.

1268
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,520
Press effort DS.

1269
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,520
You guys know who Jennifer Diane

1270
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
writes is? Or maybe Reitz

1271
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,520
I think it's Reitz. I don't think so.

1272
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,520
She is a lol cow

1273
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
She is like an old

1274
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,520
past meme of a lol cow.

1275
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
And I've mentioned her one or two times

1276
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,520
because coincidentally

1277
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,520
I used to post on the same

1278
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
spore forums as her

1279
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
in the lead up to the release of Spore

1280
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
I was on this forum called Gaming Steve

1281
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,520
which was

1282
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,520
one of the places where

1283
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,520
it had one of the most

1284
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,520
active spore fan communities

1285
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,520
because we were all really hyped

1286
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
for spore. It was going to be a game changer.

1287
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,520
All of the stray.

1288
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,520
You were. I remember that.

1289
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
And there was a poster on there called

1290
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Jennifer Diane writes and it turned out

1291
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
she was kind of a famous lol cow

1292
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,520
and I didn't know it at the time

1293
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
but she was active there

1294
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,520
and I went and I read

1295
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
one of her old webcomics yesterday

1296
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,520
it took me like all day

1297
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
the comic was called

1298
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
Unicorn Jelly

1299
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
and it's really funny

1300
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,520
it gets kind of good

1301
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,520
but it's like

1302
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,520
she's lecture worthy

1303
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
maybe not specifically Unicorn Jelly

1304
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,520
but maybe just all of her

1305
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,520
comics together

1306
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,520
because I mean

1307
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
Unicorn Jelly is pretty complicated

1308
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
but it's mostly complicated

1309
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
and she puts

1310
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
there's all this lore

1311
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
there's a whole science

1312
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,520
of how that universe works

1313
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
I feel like the story is almost just a vehicle

1314
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,520
for her to come up with weird sci-fi concepts

1315
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,520
of how gravity

1316
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,520
works through a completely different mechanism

1317
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
in this world and how

1318
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520
the universe is structured in a completely different way

1319
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,520
and it's based on different fundamental

1320
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,520
physics laws and stuff

1321
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,520
and I don't know

1322
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,520
the art style is really funny

1323
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,520
because there will be really big

1324
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,520
pretty detailed

1325
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,520
scenery shots that you can

1326
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
tell a lot of effort went into

1327
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,520
and that actually sometimes looks pretty cool

1328
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,520
but then the actual character art

1329
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,520
looks like I think

1330
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,520
the whole thing was drawn with a mouse

1331
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,520
and like the art

1332
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
the character art is like super bad

1333
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
sometimes

1334
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,520
most of the time

1335
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
it's like mushy, pseudo, anime

1336
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,520
like Dominic Deegan

1337
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,520
I like the design, I just googled it

1338
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Unicorn Jelly Him Herbs herself

1339
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
looks cute, it's a cute design

1340
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,520
you mean the jelly itself?

1341
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,520
yeah sure

1342
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,520
which I assume is the main character

1343
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
basically not at all

1344
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,520
okay I mean there are things

1345
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
that the Unicorn, it's a uni

1346
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,520
there are things that uni does

1347
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,520
and like uni is in the story

1348
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,520
through most of it but like

1349
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,520
he, I think it's a he

1350
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,520
is definitely not the main character

1351
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,520
it's the main characters are basically

1352
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,520
his adoptive mother

1353
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,520
who is like a witch

1354
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
who is just like shit at magic

1355
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,520
well it's not even that she's shit at magic

1356
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
and it's a problem

1357
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
she's a witch but like she literally does

1358
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,520
no magic over the course, she just doesn't engage with it

1359
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
it's like not important

1360
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,520
and then

1361
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,520
her like adoptive

1362
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,520
daughter who is actually like

1363
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,520
a human girl who gets in

1364
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
early on she gets like infected with like a crystal

1365
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,520
disease

1366
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,520
and like the magic of uni

1367
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520

1370
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,520
in her body and they're like in her brain

1371
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,520
and they turn her into like a super computer

1372
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,520
girl kind of

1373
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,520

1374
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,520

1382
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,520

1389
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,520
as a film noir side story

1390
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,520
that takes place in the same universe

1391
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,520
to save her follows an alternate version

1392
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
KY

1393
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,520
and a cast of familiar faces as they seek

1394
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,520
a mysterious goal while traveling among many different

1395
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,520
alternate versions of the universe

1470
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,520
like when she like when she was making

1471
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,520
unicorn jelly she was like 43

1472
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,520
what some of us bloom a little bit later

1473
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,520

1474
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,520
her stride and that was in like 2002

1475
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,520
so that's like seven yeah she's

1476
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,520
like 60 oh

1477
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,520
well

1478
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,520
I think I don't know if she's online anymore

1479
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,520
I think she might have retired from the limelight

1480
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,520
damn I couldn't blame her unicorn jelly

1481
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,520
I've used up three mice so far

1482
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,520
I guess I am pretty hard on mice

1483
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,520
the mouse I like is a Microsoft

1484
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,520
Intellipoint so she draws

1485
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,520
the mouse there's a

1486
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,520
whole page there's a whole page about how

1487
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,520
unicorn jelly is created and it's just a wall

1488
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,520
of text about how she uses a mouse do you

1489
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,520
think it'd be possible to like actually

1490
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,520
acquire skill at drawing with a mouse

1491
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,520
maybe the sensitivity or something

1492
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
there's there's definitely people who draw

1493
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,520

1542
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,520
I mean I think it goes without saying

1543
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,520
that unicorn jelly is canon to um

1544
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,520

1551
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,520
instead of planets like the whole universe

1552
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,520
is full of air and there aren't planets

1553
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,520
there are these big triangular plates called world

1554
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,520
plates that are just like

1555
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,520
formed into this big like a serpentski

1556
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,520
triangle formation

1557
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
just like in space

1558
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
and they have to go from one to another

1559
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,520
to escape like a storm that is like destroying

1560
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,520
uh plates

1561
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,520
and it's gonna fucking wreck their home world

1562
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,520
but like but like the native

1563
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,520
life on all the non-human

1564
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,520
native life on all these other worlds

1565
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,520
is like crystal in life

1566
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520

1567
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,520
uh crystal crystal light well there's

but with like shittily pasted like twitter

01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,520

1679
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,520
there's no doubt about it

1680
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,520
dammit

1681
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,520
I know there are other

1682
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,520
jdr comics

1683
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,520
I can't remember any of them right now

1684
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,520
but a lot of them do involve

1685
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,520
like slime or jelly

1686
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,520
she definitely has

1687
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,520
she's got the soul of a slime boy in her heart

1688
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,520
she definitely has a certain

1689
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
affinity for that

1690
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,520
I think those crystals that populate her world

1691
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,520
they have to be podrans right

1692
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,520
oh yes pastel defender heliotrope

1693
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
that's the other one

1694
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,520
which

1695
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,520
okay well obviously I have to read it

1696
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,520
I think those are the two main ones

1697
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
is unicorn jelly and pastel defender heliotrope

1698
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,520
I'm opening that right now

1699
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,520
sounds great report back with results

1700
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,520
Ben says nothing for the rest of the podcast

1701
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,520
just enamored by this new story

1702
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,520
and apparently this one ran for

1703
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,520
another like four years after

1704
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,520
from 2004 to 2008

1705
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,520
so after unicorn jelly

1706
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,520
the work output is impressive

1707
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,520
especially

1708
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,520
she put out a comic like every weekday

1709
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,520
and some of them are

1710
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,520
like they start out as

1711
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,520
just like three panel strips but like some of them

1712
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,520
are like big like splash pages

1713
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,520
there are some that are like 12 panels

1714
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,520
or more

1715
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,520
the work effort is admirable

1716
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,520
this is the thing I genuinely

1717
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,520
have come around a bit on like

1718
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,520
christine weston chandler

1719
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,520
that is, say what you want

1720
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,520
about her and her work

1721
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,520
her art skill

1722
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,520
you're like her skill level

1723
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
you can criticize all you want

1724
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,520
but she has put out a lot of work

1725
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,520
and like she has clearly

1726
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,520
there's time put in there

1727
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,520
and you have to respect that

1728
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
there was a video or a vlog I wanted to make

1729
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,520
at some point saying christ chan is a better artist

1730
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,520
than you because christ chan actually

1731
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,520
I like that

1732
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,520
that's a really light of fire under somebody

1733
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,520
you can be as good as you want

1734
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
but if you don't produce anything

1735
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,520
cause like there was a definition of art

1736
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,520
that was on like a youtube video that I found really interesting

1737
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,520
this was by simon cynic saying like

1738
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,520
if you are a master craftsman

1739
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,520
at like your chosen art but you don't share it

1740
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,520
with anybody it's not art you're just a crafts person

1741
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,520
to be an artist you have to publish something

1742
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,520
and in that regard I think

1743
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,520
the point is that like christ chan is obviously a better artist

1744
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,520
than like 99% of people that don't actually

1745
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,520
produce anything

1746
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,520
that's super good

1747
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,520
and a great take that I will defend

1748
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,520
that's a very excellent youtube clickbait title

1749
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,520
there's no doubt in my mind

1750
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,520
that's been brewing for a few months

1751
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,520
in the old noggin

1752
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,520
cause I'm waging a silent war against art culture

1753
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,520
cause I hate it

1754
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
as Nate knows

1755
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,520
and saw the opening sale

1756
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,520
make art culture great again boys

1757
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,520
what is art culture

1758
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,520
a bunch of whining

1759
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,520
entitled babies

1760
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,520
for constantly on the internet

1761
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,520
being like sorry for themselves

1762
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,520
instead of like making their lives better

1763
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,520
and I hate it

1764
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,520
I'm making things

1765
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,520
I'm making things every day

1766
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,520
I got really close

1767
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,520
to like finishing

1768
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,520
the sketches

1769
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,520
of this one comic

1770
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,520
that I've been working on for a while

1771
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,520
and the sketching part

1772
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,520
is the hardest part

1773
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,520
getting everything laid out

1774
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,520
on where the character is

1775
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,520
where the speech bubble is going

1776
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,520
and how to go from one panel to the next

1777
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,520
in a cool way

1778
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,520
so that it works

1779
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,520
I'm stuck right at the end

1780
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,520
cause I didn't write exactly what happens

1781
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,520
right at the end

1782
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,520
it sucks so much

1783
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,520
if there's any lesson to learn here

1784
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,520
it's to do

1785
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,520
as much pre-production

1786
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,520
as possible

1787
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,520
and early along as possible

1788
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
like write down

1789
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,520
a description of what you think the panel should look like

1790
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,520
even

1791
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,520
because then when it comes to drawing

1792
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,520
one wrong line or a wrong pose

1793
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,520
takes a lot longer than

1794
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,520
typing the pose that you want

1795
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,520
wait so what

1796
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,520
what are you stuck on exactly

1797
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,520
let me just make sure I understand exactly what you mean

1798
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,520
I'm right at the end of this thing

1799
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,520
but the thing is I had a script

1800
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
I wrote up a script for

1801
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,520
what happens in the comic

1802
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,520
and this last bit

1803
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,520
it doesn't have

1804
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,520
there was a complication

1805
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,520
I had to add something in

1806
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,520
it's just sort of ruining the flow

1807
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,520
and I don't know how to reconcile it

1808
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,520
I'm only like 3 or 4 pages away from it being done

1809
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,520
it's like 80 something pages long

1810
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,520
awesome

1811
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,520
so it's like

1812
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,520
that reminds me

1813
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,520
when I'm making

1814
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,520
slime and punishment

1815
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,520
and slime and punishment

1816
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,520
I had a couple of

1817
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,520
I guess none of them are

1818
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,520
necessarily the ending

1819
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,520
but I had a couple of scenes

1820
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,520
this will conclude in this way

1821
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,520
I had

1822
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,520
the big moments in mind

1823
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,520
and everything else is about

1824
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,520
setting up and building

1825
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,520
towards making those conclusions happen

1826
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,520
so I kind of know the endings

1827
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,520
and I

1828
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,520
because then shit happened on twitter

1829
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,520
and Christine

1830
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,520
responded to stuff

1831
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,520
some people on twitter

1832
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,520
trolls mostly were saying

1833
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Ben don't listen to her

1834
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,520
don't do what she wants

1835
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,520
this is your comic

1836
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,520
it's true

1837
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,520
but the thing is that I find it

1838
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,520
satisfying and a cool creative

1839
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,520
exercise

1840
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,520
to build chris's input

1841
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
for her character into the story

1842
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,520
the character should do what she would do

1843
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,520
so I find it a cool challenge

1844
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,520
and it's

1845
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,520
valuable to me

1846
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,520
to be like how can I

1847
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,520
accommodate this

1848
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,520
into the story

1849
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,520
the things that are going to happen

1850
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,520
are still going to happen

1851
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,520
I'm working on a

1852
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,520
detour now where phantom horn goes to the alpha timeline

1853
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,520
to accomplish

1854
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,520
some weird

1855
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,520
shit

1856
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,520
that chris made up

1857
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,520
that she wants to happen in the alpha timeline

1858
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,520
and it's really strange and funny

1859
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,520
so that's another reason

1860
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,520
it would be funny

1861
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,520
this is so fucking bizarre

1862
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,520
I just want to include it

1863
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,520
I know we've talked about this before

1864
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
but the one thing I'm most disappointed by

1865
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,520
with Christine

1866
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,520
is her insistence

1867
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,520
on the fact that phantom has

1868
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,520
obtained his horn

1869
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,520
his arc is over

1870
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,520
that ruins the character to do that

1871
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,520
yes it is a nightmare

1872
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,520
it is an absolute fucking nightmare

1873
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,520
but you know what

1874
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,520
we live in a multiverse

1875
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,520
of infinite possibilities

1876
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,520
I can't sit here and tell you that such a thing

1877
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,520
could never happen

1878
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,520
I can't do that

1879
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,520
however I can

1880
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,520
correct this little

1881
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,520
there's nothing to stop

1882
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,520
this horn from

1883
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,520
rotting or something

1884
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,520
corrupting and having to be so sawn off

1885
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,520
otherwise he dies

1886
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,520
I mean something must be done

1887
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,520
something will be done

1888
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,520
on earth as it is in heaven

1889
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,520
as above so below

1890
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,520
by the way

1891
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,520
speaking of artistic integrity

1892
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,520
I just wanted to say that

1893
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,520
for the last bonus pcb episode we did

1894
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,520
we did like a game development one

1895
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,520
and a lot of us talked about our projects

1896
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,520
and stuff and you should definitely go listen to the one

1897
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,520
because that was a great episode

1898
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,520
$5 patreon.com slash the procrastinators

1899
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,520
32 full fucking bonus episodes now

1900
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,520
Jesus Christ what a deal

1901
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,520
and I wanted to say that

1902
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,520
I talked to you guys a bunch

1903
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,520
about the game that I've been working on

1904
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,520
for years

1905
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,520
we worked on it for several months

1906
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
before I started doing YouTube

1907
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,520
and we produced art assets

1908
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,520
and I showed a bunch of that stuff

1909
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,520
but I didn't have a working demo of the game

1910
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,520
but just because I so wanted to

1911
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,520
I spent like a full day

1912
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,520
opening up my old laptop where I've been working

1913
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,520
on that game trying to run the game

1914
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,520
trying to get an exportable exe file

1915
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,520
that I could share and I couldn't do it

1916
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,520
but so I went back

1917
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,520
and I fixed some broken things

1918
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,520
and made like a working developer

1919
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,520
version of the game and was able to

1920
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,520
export it so it works as intended

1921
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,520
on like window systems

1922
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,520
and that's going to be attached to the

1923
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,520
episodes so people can play the one

1924
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,520
basic ass level that exists without any animations

1925
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,520
like the basic functionality

1926
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,520
worked pretty cool

1927
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,520
and I loved doing it and it made me

1928
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,520
be like oh maybe I could like work on this game

1929
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,520
again it's like really fun and really good

1930
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,520
do it so maybe I

1931
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,520
fucking will dude maybe I fucking will

1932
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,520
become more than a YouTuber become someone

1933
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,520
of actual value

1934
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,520
maybe I can do both maybe I can be a value

1935
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,520
person and value less person

1936
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,520
at the same time I gotta just add a link to my

1937
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,520
old vlog uh analysis where creativity

1938
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
goes to die so it would be inspired

1939
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,520
hey you're not wrong I mean that's why

1940
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,520
I like red letter media because like all along

1941
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,520
they're also like occasionally

1942
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,520
just like make a movie right and that's like

1943
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,520
money where their mouth is

1944
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,520
and I respect that greatly um

1945
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,520
but like I loved it so much

1946
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,520
I feel I'm gonna keep that exclusive

1947
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,520
to the bonus episode but I gotta tell you

1948
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,520
I really want to release it to like

1949
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,520
the public at large because I like it so much

1950
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,520
and I want people to see it so maybe

1951
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,520
we'll consider that a limited time restriction

1952
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,520
to the bonus episode and then afterward

1953
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,520
I'll uh I'll let the boys out there

1954
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,520
just force yourself to release it to the public

1955
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,520
in a in a further developed

1956
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,520
state well sensor every

1957
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,520
asset in the game and it's only available

1958
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
on the bonus episode

1959
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,520
I could do that oh it felt so good

1960
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,520
programming like like I mean I worked

1961
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,520
for years as a programmer and it could

1962
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,520
feel satisfying but I mean that was

1963
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,520
you know whatever it is that's work it's a job

1964
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,520
not that interesting but like you're working on your project

1965
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,520
and then you get it working and you get

1966
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,520
an exportable exe the first people can

1967
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,520
play oh it feels good oh it feels

1968
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,520
real good so uh it's

1969
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,520
good stuff and I believe I did in fact make

1970
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,520
those sprites and I feel real good about them

1971
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,520
I love them and uh they're not animated

1972
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,520
as there's there's a gift that

1973
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
Gib produced of the little animation

1974
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
in the bonus episode so that go look at that

1975
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,520
to see what it would look like if

1976
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,520
QT base drop

1977
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,520
as I've decided to call her from that episode

1978
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,520
get Quentin Tarantino

1979
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,520
base drop that's her full name Quentin Tarantino

1980
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,520
base drop her full name

1981
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
so it has been decreed um

1982
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,520
anyway good good good stuff good stuff go watch

1983
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,520
that episode um

1984
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,520
uh it was voice mails voice mails

1985
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,520
I think I think it's time

1986
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,520
well you got something else good well I had

1987
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,520
just like a I've been cleaning

1988
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,520
out my room no no I think we got it now I think

1989
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,520
we're going to have to move along

1990
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,520
but the room situation

1991
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,520
well just clean out my room and I was

1992
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,520
finding uh

1993
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,520
stacks upon stacks of lined

1994
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
paper and and and

1995
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
yes stacks of of of

1996
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,520
paper money that is oh yeah

1997
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,520
no uh lined paper and like a scroll

1998
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,520
of paper and all of this

1999
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,520
unused um you know just

2000
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
sitting there like blank paper

2001
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
huge amounts of it um

2002
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,520
all these notebooks and stuff and I'm

2003
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,520
looking at them and I want to draw

2004
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,520
on them but I don't also

2005
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,520
want to draw on them because uh

2006
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,520
drawing sucks and it's

2007
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,520
it's bad have you been drawing a lot in your

2008
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,520
in your comic and stuff yeah

2009
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,520
it's online it's on the

2010
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,520
the on the the internet

2011
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,520
super highway the I mean the

2012
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,520
tablet right so like

2013
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,520
so like I've got all this

2014
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,520
paper and I don't know what to do with it like if I fill

2015
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
it up with stuff if I need to use it anywhere

2016
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
I'll have to scan it or take a picture and that's

2017
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,520
a fucking taking a picture is easy though right

2018
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
I mean you could you know it's just an extra

2019
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,520
little yeah but it's

2020
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,520
scanning it in is like if

2021
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,520
if I wanted to actually use it for something

2022
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,520
I would need to do that when I

2023
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,520
did the like because

2024
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,520
the first

2025
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,520
the first of vapor's chapter I like sketched

2026
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,520
in pencil and scanned it in

2027
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,520
and it was such a nightmare because I drew

2028
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
it on big paper and

2029
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,520
it was too big for the scanner so

2030
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,520
I had to take like four I had to like scan

2031
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,520
for like four different angles and then

2032
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,520
combine the four scans into

2033
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,520
one image and like remove

2034
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,520
like imperfections from the scanning yeah

2035
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,520
yeah yeah basically it'll

2036
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
solve all your problems what is that Tom

2037
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,520
down what is down with the app your phone

2038
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,520
called cam scanner yeah take it open up

2039
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,520
it works just like a camera you take

2040
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,520
a photo of the page and it detects

2041
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,520
the corners of the paper and you can manually

2042
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,520
just them if need be and then it

2043
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,520
it adjusts the

2044
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,520
perspective so it's flat like it was in a camera

2045
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,520
like a scanner bed and then does some

2046
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,520
post-processing to clean up the image and

2047
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
then you can save it anywhere and then it's like your phone

2048
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,520
scanned it and you don't have to worry about

2049
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,520
finangling with a scanner anything it's way faster

2050
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,520
it's way easier I found

2051
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,520
an incredibly helpful thing because I was

2052
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
porting I was reformatting

2053
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,520
slime and punishment for to plastic and web

2054
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,520
tune and it was such a nightmare because

2055
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,520
every like it's hundreds of images like

2056
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,520
300 something images and

2057
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,520
I had to go into each one like

2058
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,520
like resize it basically

2059
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,520
and like sit and like export right

2060
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,520
and and it was really annoying and

2061
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,520
someone on some form

2062
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,520
or something I found there someone had

2063
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,520
just made like a widget online

2064
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,520
that you can it specifically

2065
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,520
for to plastic and webtoon you can just like

2066
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,520
select images and it will just like spit out

2067
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,520
a resized version at the correct

2068
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,520
and you can do it with whole batches of them

2069
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,520
and it saved me hours

2070
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,520
overjoyed it was

2071
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,520
called crappie

2072
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,520
and that's it

2073
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,520
do you think it's worth putting bell

2074
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,520
jpe through that yes

2075
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,520
because why not well the

2076
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,520
only thing is there's all the text underneath

2077
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,520
the images and also the gifts

2078
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,520
and stuff it would be like

2079
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,520
yeah they'd take gifts

2080
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,520
I don't

2081
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,520
okay I know webtoon doesn't

2082
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,520
which is why I haven't put

2083
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,520
what's I have a beast

2084
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,520
be escapades

2085
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,520
because be escapades was lots of gifts and I know

2086
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,520
web tapas I don't

2087
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,520
think so but maybe webtoon

2088
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,520
no webtoon will but you have

2089
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,520
to be like a featured creator

2090
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,520
or like it's some it's some fucking bullshit

2091
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,520
class class system

2092
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,520
or shit it's bad

2093
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520
yeah so

2094
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,520
it's the problem with being interesting

2095
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,520
all the rules fair time

2096
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,520
that's your answer for everything Tom

2097
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,520
it's the right way to go

2098
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,520
I mean I agree that

2099
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,520
yeah it's good to have a website but there's no pre

2100
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,520
existing audience there right so why can't

2101
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,520
you can't reach people through your website

2102
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,520
like everybody like where all

2103
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,520
of us like fucking pleb creators

2104
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,520
online right we're all like using

2105
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,520
Twitter and we're using YouTube and every time

2106
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,520
YouTube or Twitter changes we all

2107
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,520
bitch piss and moan about how bad it is and how we're

2108
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,520
getting fucked but like if you look

2109
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,520
at actual brands like real companies

2110
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,520
like businesses that like understand like how

2111
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,520
the world works unlike us

2112
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,520
none of them do that

2113
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,520
all of them use Facebook and

2114
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,520
YouTube and Twitter as advertising platforms

2115
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,520
to push you to their website

2116
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,520
and get you on their email list so they can

2117
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,520
stay in contact with you one-on-one and not to compete

2118
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,520
with all the noise of social media

2119
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,520
that's like good enough for Coca-Cola

2120
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,520
it should be the de facto

2121
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,520
model we're all just too lazy to put in the work

2122
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,520
to actually build a proper platform the way

2123
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,520
like regular companies would do it because it is

2124
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,520
more effective it's a snow it's a snowflake

2125
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,520
no snowflake blames itself for the

2126
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,520
Blizzard it's kind of like no snowflake

2127
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,520
no individual like Twitter artist or whatever

2128
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,520
will want to bear

2129
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
the full brunt of you know creating a new

2130
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,520
thing so there's a lot of inertia there I would imagine

2131
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,520
you don't you don't even just just make a website

2132
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,520
it's not hard yeah

2133
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,520
Squarespace this episode of the

2134
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,520
Procrastin's podcast brought to you by Squarespace

2135
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,520
Squarespace is the excellent

2136
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,520
just go make your website on Squarespace

2137
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,520
it fucking should be god damn it

2138
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,520
Huell, call me back, sponsor me

2139
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,520
for Christ's sake I still get

2140
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,520
Huell residuals every now and then it gets

2141
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,520
I was saying someone use someone use your code for

2142
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,520
Huell here's $15 you gotta

2143
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,520
talk about that after I gotta fucking at least

2144
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,520
get that shit gone I don't fucking know

2145
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,520
yeah all right we'll speak afterward

2146
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
by the way

2147
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,520
Gibb I was gonna say to your point

2148
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,520
about like wanting to draw in a notebook

2149
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,520
I assume because you like that

2150
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,520
tactile I don't know sense or something

2151
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,520
I've been what I've been doing the content

2152
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,520
episodes with Digi I'll generally

2153
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,520
either I'll write notes

2154
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,520
on my whiteboard to like visually read so

2155
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,520
it's easy to have you know know what I'm gonna say

2156
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,520
or I'll write in my in like a physical notebook

2157
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,520
I have this nice red notebook for my

2158
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,520
old college days and I opened it up and I actually

2159
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,520
just like finished filled up the last

2160
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,520
available page and I couldn't help but

2161
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,520
notice that like this originally was a

2162
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,520
Japanese like learning notebook

2163
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,520
I was using and it's just filled with page

2164
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,520
after page after page of me

2165
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,520
doing exercises and like just repeating

2166
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,520
kanji and repeating hiragana

2167
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,520
and like repeating vocabulary words

2168
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,520
because I would just endlessly write those over

2169
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,520
and over in the book to learn them

2170
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,520
and it it maybe just feel like

2171
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,520
I mean this is different from what you were talking about

2172
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,520
I was just like ooh I really liked learning Japanese

2173
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,520
that's another thing I should you know actively do

2174
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,520
day to day which I have

2175
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,520
definitely been lazy on most I've done is like follow

2176
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,520
a bunch of learn Japanese Twitter accounts

2177
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,520
so I'm at least bombarded by a couple

2178
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,520
of words every day but it's certainly not

2179
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,520
enough one day one day

2180
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,520
man I do

2181
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,520
like seeing some of these half

2182
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,520
filled up books with like

2183
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,520
years old like

2184
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,520
like this one of

2185
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,520
these has like physics

2186
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,520
homework things and then like

2187
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,520
on another page it's like

2188
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,520
um ideas for

2189
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
a Super Mario World of Warcraft

2190
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,520
RPG MMO

2191
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,520
where you can you can choose the faction you can

2192
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,520
be like a goomba and you can level up and get

2193
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,520
goomba equipment and run

2194
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,520
around in a field

2195
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,520
I thought it was such a sick idea

2196
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,520
and and then there's like

2197
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,520
like other game things I want to do

2198
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,520
and then like spreadsheets I was

2199
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,520
trying to write up for

2200
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,520
for keeping track of my actual World of

2201
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,520
Warcraft crafting

2202
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,520
bullshit it's nice looking back

2203
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,520
at all these stupid things I was

2204
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,520
they cared about

2205
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,520
you know just for some reason that just reminds me

2206
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,520
of there's a game that came out

2207
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,520
relatively recently that

2208
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,520
it was a total indie like Kickstarter game

2209
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,520
or something and it's it's

2210
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,520
literally exactly like Paper Mario

2211
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,520
so it's like filling the niche of the

2212
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,520
classic Paper Mario and like thousand

2213
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,520
year door game it's supposed to be like it's

2214
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,520
exactly like them but

2215
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,520
it's got the same papercraft design but it's just about

2216
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,520
like bugs it's kind of like Hollow Knight

2217
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,520
meets uh Paper Mario

2218
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
and it looks wonderful but I just

2219
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,520
haven't investigated whether it's good or not

2220
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,520
what's it called you know I cannot

2221
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,520
fucking remember I'm gonna Google it now

2222
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,520
and see if I can figure it out

2223
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,520
but it looks super good

2224
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,520
hang on Paper Mario

2225
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,520
it's called

2226
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,520
Bug Fables that's the one

2227
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,520
an exploration RPG full of bugs

2228
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
on Indiegogo it was funded

2229
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,520
man I really hope it doesn't launch with bugs

2230
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,520
oh yeah it is just Paper Mario

2231
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,520
and you know what

2232
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,520
I fucking loved Paper Mario 1

2233
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,520
and 2 especially

2234
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,520
so I like it's an RPG

2235
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,520
it looks great I think like the battle

2236
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,520
system in Paper Mario was like one of my

2237
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:08,520
favorites ever so I should

2238
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,520

01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,520
voicemails just send good voicemails

2279
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,520
that's all it's not complicated

2280
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,520
why how could it

2281
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,520
how could it how could it be like

2282
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,520
confused it's never about

2283
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,520
I don't know I don't

2284
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,520
fucking know maybe because some people

2285
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,520
feel they need to I mean voicemail god's the only one

2286
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,520
who does this who feels the need to like

2287
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,520
it's oh it's like a reggae guy's slow start

2288
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,520
like the first three voicemails those are a

2289
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,520
throwaway go to metaphor

2290
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,520
reggae guys is everything to me this

2291
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,520

01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,520
Alex Jones podcast and then

2293
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,520

2294
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,520

2295
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,520
tell ya that's Bernie for you in a nutshell

2296
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,520
he's slow to go

2297
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,520
10 reggae giggas is up on stage

2298
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,520
okay now let's let's get serious and I'm

2299
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,520

221711

2302
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,520
calling in and presumably

2303
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,520
he's got the hottest of takes

2304
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,520
let's see what he has to say and

2305
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,520
go do you guys

2306
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,520
like shadow the hedgehog

2307
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,520
from the sonic video game

2308
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,520
series

2309
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,520
oh right

2310
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
that's the whole voicemail

2311
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,520
yeah the whole answer is no

2312
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,520
no it's yes

2313
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,520
the game was fucking hilarious

2314
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,520
he's like

2315
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
so cool

2316
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,520
he's so cool you see

2317
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,520
he has a gun and sick roller skates

2318
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,520
I've never played a sonic game in my entire life

2319
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,520
really

2320
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,520
play shadow the hedgehog as your first

2321
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,520
sonic game

2322
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,520
it's a little bit of like sonic

2323
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,520
and knuckles

2324
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,520
let me convince you in one sentence

2325
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,520
shadow is absolutely a killer

2326
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,520
that's true

2327
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,520
that's so true

2328
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,520
I mean killer is very much a shadow the hedgehog

2329
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,520
I understand the man

2330
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,520
can anyone really

2331
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,520
understand the man

2332
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,520
the hedgehog

2333
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,520
you don't understand the man at all

2334
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,520
actually I was just watching

2335
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,520
I was just watching

2336
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,520
a bunch of sonic adventure videos

2337
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,520
by a guy called the black hooded gamer

2338
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,520
I don't know why

2339
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,520
they got recommended to me

2340
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,520
I watched a bunch of several hour long videos

2341
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,520
he made explaining the appeal of sonic adventure

2342
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,520
and sonic adventure 2

2343
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,520
I know everything about

2344
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,520
sonic adventure

2345
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,520
and I don't know why

2346
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,520
I played the fucking sonic adventure 2 back in the day

2347
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,520
it was sick

2348
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,520
I saw a unate play

2349
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,520
I played a bit

2350
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,520
all I want for Christmas

2351
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,520
in my stocking

2352
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,520
is the

2353
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,520
hypocrite ghost in the shell video

2354
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,520
of shadow the hedgehog

2355
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,520
that's all I want one day

2356
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,520
please let it happen

2357
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,520
oh a review of shadow the hedgehog

2358
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,520
yes I want the deep lore

2359
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,520
I want all the memes

2360
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,520
I don't know the deep lore

2361
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,520
he's got a gun that's pretty deep

2362
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,520
he's the gun girl of shadow the hedgehog

2363
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,520
what more do you need

2364
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,520
sonic lore would make a good lecture

2365
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,520
I mean that's definitely true

2366
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,520
but are any of us qualified

2367
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,520
you'd have to like

2368
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,520
the comic should be their own lecture by itself

2369
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,520
there's like a fucking 40 year history

2370
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,520
like 40 year canon to that at this point

2371
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,520
I mean that's a great idea

2372
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,520
but none of us

2373
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,520
currently have expertise

2374
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,520
just do a shadow the hedgehog lecture

2375
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,520
just take the one man

2376
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,520
break down his narrative

2377
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,520
him making out with that girl

2378
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,520
the hedgehog lecture

2379
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,520
or his shadow the hedgehog doing a lecture

2380
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,520
dressed as a hedgehog

2381
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
for the lecture please

2382
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,520
which is basically just a Ryuko costume

2383
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,520
just wear that and

2384
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,520
have a gun instead of a sword

2385
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,520
that works

2386
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:08,520
okay next voicemail

2387
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,520
let me see what do we got this

2388
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,520
oh right this was like a weird one

2389
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,520
I think this was a Welsh guy

2390
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,520
and it was Talys in Ap Gruffind

2391
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,520
from McNeilith

2392
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,520
or something

2393
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,520
I don't know it's some Welsh bullshit

2394
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,520
we know how we feel about those

2395
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,520
let's give him a chance here

2396
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,520
oh yeah we hate them I guess

2397
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,520
of course is banning McDonald's

2398
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,520
McDonald's is a scourge on health

2399
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,520
nationwide and it must be stopped

2400
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,520
Clyde Cymru will not rest

2401
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,520
until Ronald McDonald himself

2402
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,520
is hanging in Penderean Square

2403
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,520
for treason

2404
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,520
I think we can all agree that this policy

2405
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,520
is for the best

2406
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,520
number two all education will be done

2407
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,520
in the medium of Welsh

2408
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,520
English speaking children must be taken

2409
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,520
from their biological parents at a young age

2410
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,520
and re-homed in state run

2411
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,520
parties to revive the original town

2412
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,520
of the Britons

2413
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,520
half of the course really

2414
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,520
number three a plan titled simply

2415
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,520
get fucked New Zealand you fucking

2416
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,520
rems

2417
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,520
this plan is essential for the party's aims

2418
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,520
it seeks to rename the town of

2419
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,520
planfirepultwingelcogeirachwindrobol

2420
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,520
and dsiliogogogog to be

2421
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,520
even longer

2422
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,520
we only really want to do this because

2423
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,520
New Zealand apparently has the longest place

2424
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,520
name in the world but I think we can do better

2425
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,520
anyway I think I've made myself very clear

2426
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,520
and I'm glad to have shown you the light

2427
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,520
Diolch yn fawr

2428
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,520
the Welsh are not people

2429
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,520
I mean let's just say it they just don't qualify

2430
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,520
Welsh is a cool language

2431
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,520
I have seen

2432
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,520
me too

2433
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,520
I did see the Plaid Cymru

2434
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,520
Cymraeg

2435
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,520
a leader give a speech about

2436
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,520
Welsh stuff

2437
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,520
I do know what he is talking about

2438
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,520
unfortunately there is not a Plaid Cymru

2439
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,520
you know minister

2440
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,520
you'll have to write him in

2441
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
standing in my constituency

2442
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,520
so I wouldn't be able to vote for them

2443
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,520
even if I wanted to

2444
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,520
join the party and then

2445
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,520
just in my okay

2446
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,520
the Welsh I mean I like this idea of like

2447
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,520
Welsh infiltrators running in like

2448
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,520
I mean not just all of England but like

2449
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,520
all of Britain rather but in all of

2450
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,520
society worldwide

2451
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,520
to impose Welsh

2452
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,520
cultural hegemony

2453
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
or hegemony over all of society

2454
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,520
as we found the master race

2455
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,520
I'm convinced by their silly accent

2456
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,520
which is very pleasing to the ear

2457
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,520
yeah that's good thanks

2458
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,520
guys keep it coming I love the Welsh accent

2459
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,520
what can I say oh hey little welcome

2460
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,520
I'm a little bit old

2461
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,520
just the Blarney stone yeah there you go

2462
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,520
tell it to the Blarney stone smash it

2463
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,520
into face

2464
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,520
of political opponent

2465
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,520
alright here we go

2466
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,520
next up is oh thank god okay

2467
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,520
calling in is allegedly

2468
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,520
the first failure of Find Purpose

2469
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,520
November who somebody bought a shirt

2470
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,520
at least one person so

2471
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,520
they say that this is them

2472
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,520
I haven't checked if anyone else has bought some

2473
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,520
I know at least one so this could be them

2474
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,520
so let's hear their story

2475
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,520
okay go

2476
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,520
I'm here to claim my title as the first

2477
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
failure of Find Purpose November

2478
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,520
I'm like 90% sure

2479
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,520
that was the first person to buy the shirt

2480
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,520
so it's only right

2481
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,520
that I can also claim the title

2482
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,520
so here's reason number one

2483
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,520
why I'm the first failure

2484
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,520
of Find Purpose November

2485
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,520
it's over

2486
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,520
it's so fucking over

2487
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,520
you know what I do instead of like

2488
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,520
going outside or going to school

2489
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,520
or like working I stay inside

2490
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,520
all day playing

2491
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,520
motherfucking cookie clicker

2492
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,520
and it's a good game

2493
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,520
it's like a decent game it's like autistic

2494
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,520
there's a ton of tiff and I'm playing

2495
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,520
free fucking save files

2496
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,520
because that's how I am

2497
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,520
instead of like talking to people or like making connections

2498
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,520
I'm just clicking those fucking

2499
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,520
cookies

2500
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,520
so this not voice mail is long enough

2501
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,520
I'm gonna check back in with the other reasons

2502
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,520
why I'm the first

2503
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,520
failure of fucking Find

2504
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,520
fucking Purpose November

2505
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,520
I'm already convinced

2506
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,520
I have a question

2507
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,520
it sounds like they have a very clear and defined purpose

2508
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,520
like destroy cookie clicker

2509
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,520
like become the greatest at it

2510
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,520
they're working every day at it

2511
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,520
no there's no way to become the greatest

2512
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,520
everyone who plays cookie clicker for an extended period of time

2513
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,520
is the loser of cookie clicker

2514
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,520
it's an endless skinner box

2515
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,520
alright I just want to post an image

2516
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,520
your purpose has been defined

2517
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,520
their purpose is to play cookie clicker

2518
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,520
it's not like they're aimless they're not wondering what to do

2519
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,520
they know exactly what to do

2520
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,520
counterpoint I think that this person

2521
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,520
aspires to do better things

2522
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,520
than cookie clicker and they feel guilt

2523
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,520
at playing cookie clicker

2524
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,520
so they don't consider it their purpose

2525
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,520
they consider it a failure

2526
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,520
now if they has given up on everything else

2527
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,520
and only wanted to play cookie clicker

2528
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,520
that would be perhaps a different story

2529
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,520
but they feel avoid

2530
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,520
I had a bit of a cookie meltdown

2531
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,520
a few months ago

2532
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,520
where I was just doing that

2533
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,520
and I wasn't feeling anything

2534
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,520
feeling depressed

2535
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,520
but I managed to rage quit

2536
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,520
I'm going to post an image

2537
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,520
she will understand what this means

2538
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,520
and that thing right there

2539
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,520
is what caused me

2540
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,520
like I had tried to do this three times

2541
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,520
and this was the third failure

2542
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,520
to get the prestige level

2543
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,520
777

2544
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,520
777

2545
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,520
and I just got so mad

2546
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,520
it unlocks

2547
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,520
some special upgrades

2548
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,520
that you can buy that increase

2549
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,520
golden cookie bullshit

2550
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,520
and if you miss it you have to restart

2551
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,520
if you miss it you need to go for the next

2552
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,520
777

2553
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,520
10 times more

2554
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,520
so it was like

2555
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,520
I was so mad

2556
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,520
I missed it by one

2557
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,520
I was so careful

2558
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,520
but I think

2559
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,520
damn

2560
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,520
I was waiting it was going to take 20 minutes

2561
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,520
so I clicked the cookie once

2562
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,520
like I didn't need to call

2563
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,520
my cookie making

2564
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,520
I clicked it once

2565
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,520
and I think it was like a reindeer jumped in front of my click

2566
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,520
and I got a billion cookie

2567
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,520
well

2568
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,520
way more than that

2569
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,520
tiny amount

2570
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,520
it was so upsetting

2571
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520
that I luckily

2572
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520
using the ability of gamer rage

2573
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520
I broke the curse

2574
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,520
and I never want to go back

2575
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,520
I would say that it's a bad thing

2576
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,520
to get mad at video games

2577
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,520
I think not

2578
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,520
try getting mad

2579
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,520
try failing

2580
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,520
maybe this is the way to break the spell

2581
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,520
well ok next voicemail

2582
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,520
we've got a couple more here

2583
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,520
oh ok here we go

2584
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,520
we've got a business idea for Ben

2585
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,520
let's hear what he has

2586
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,520
alright this will be great

2587
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,520
hello PCP

2588
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,520
welcome to quick business ideas

2589
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,520
I'm your host Jeremy Zuma

2590
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
and today I've got the idea for Ben

2591
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,520
so just put two ad spaces

2592
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,520
on the side of samecomics.com

2593
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,520
and put a little note on the bottom

2594
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,520
be like

2595
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,520
please disable that ad block

2596
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,520
if you want to support me with my

2597
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,520
comic disc comics

2598
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,520
that's all

2599
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,520
see you in the next one

2600
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,520
great

2601
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,520
what do you think Ben? I think he's got big ideas

2602
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,520
just do that

2603
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,520
stick some ads in there

2604
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,520
and tell them to turn off ad block

2605
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,520
what a winning proposition

2606
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
let me see

2607
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,520
how many people

2608
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,520
I don't actively promote

2609
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,520
stcomics.com

2610
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,520
I've been doing stuff on webtoon

2611
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,520
trying to build a following on webtoon

2612
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,520
I don't know why

2613
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,520
why not

2614
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,520
let me see

2615
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,520
exactly how many people

2616
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,520
actually go to stcomics.com

2617
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
200,000

2618
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520

2619
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,520

01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,520
google analytics that's it

2624
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,520
google analytics

2625
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,520
when was the last time I even

2626
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,520

2631
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,520
I want to look at that

2632
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,520
I want to look at stcomics.com

2633
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,520
on the edge of my seat

2634
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,520
I'm dying

2635
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,520
no this is going to be good

2636
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,520
with anticipation I mean

2637
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,520
oh

2638
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,520
okay

2639
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,520
it looks like it's getting

2640
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,520
where do they come from

2641
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,520
but it's getting like 20

2642
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,520
ish users a day

2643
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,520
okay

2644
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,520
that's way more than I expected

2645
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,520
holy shit

2646
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,520
maybe people are coming back checking for updates

2647
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,520
oh my god

2648
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,520
in the last 28 days

2649
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,520
exactly 420 users bro

2650
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,520
oh shit

2651
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,520
here we go

2652
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,520
time to change the color of the website

2653
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,520
to be white and green

2654
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,520
or black and green

2655
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,520
I'm very shocked

2656
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,520
I kind of expected it to be like 4

2657
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,520
um

2658
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
yeah

2659
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,520
I know for a fact

2660
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,520
I just

2661
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,520
I just visited bell jpe the other day

2662
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,520
because I wanted to watch the

2663
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,520
the finale again

2664
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,520
because I

2665
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,520
because I'm kind of thinking about

2666
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,520
I'm kind of working on a

2667
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,520
little project

2668
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,520
is there going to be a fucking

2669
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,520
shut the fuck up

2670
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,520
you shut the fuck up

2671
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,520
you were the one who made the connection

2672
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,520
I was just asking a question

2673
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,520
yes the answer is yes there is going to be

2674
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,520
a dot dot dot

2675
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,520
yeah I'm going to make a little

2676
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,520
I'm going to make a little thing

2677
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,520
I wanted to draw some inspiration

2678
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,520
oh shit

2679
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,520
and again I was

2680
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,520
I was like oh my god this is so much work

2681
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,520
it won't

2682
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,520
it will not

2683
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,520
I won't put that much work into it

2684
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,520
no

2685
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,520
the quality of it

2686
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
is lessened by the

2687
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,520
length and stuff

2688
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,520
the amount of stuff I tried to put into that

2689
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
I wanted it to be even longer

2690
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,520
it's not that it's too long

2691
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,520
I had just forgotten how many frames

2692
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,520
there are

2693
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,520
a lot of it is like animated animated

2694
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,520
instead of just like

2695
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,520
I plan on using all the shortcuts I can

2696
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,520
and just using tweens

2697
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,520
really that's the smart thing to do

2698
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,520
that's what you should do

2699
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,520
really yeah

2700
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,520
it doesn't make much of a difference

2701
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,520
for it to be like animated

2702
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,520
I just I don't really

2703
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,520
understand like flash

2704
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,520
or like

2705
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,520
tweens and stuff and I could learn but I just

2706
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
I know how to draw frame by frame stuff

2707
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
be like me and animate in Sony Vegas

2708
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,520
and import all your images

2709
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,520
one at a time you know move to the next frame

2710
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,520
drop in the new clip

2711
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,520
easy peasy

2712
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
it's the best frame by frame

2713
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,520
you still need to draw them if they're drawn

2714
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,520
no you can stretch and skew

2715
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,520
on the screen

2716
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,520
yes you just rotate it

2717
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,520
that's the way

2718
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,520
rotation solves everything

2719
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,520
okay let's cover our tracks

2720
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,520
let's get out of here and no one follow

2721
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,520
to these mysterious things we're discussing

2722
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,520
and go to

2723
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,520
here's a voicemail called

2724
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,520
don't say stupid shit about VR

2725
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,520
this episode okay

2726
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,520
we'll see if that happens

2727
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,520
I don't know when you guys record but I'm hoping

2728
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,520
I can get this before you record for next week

2729
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,520
because the new Half-Life game was just

2730
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,520
announced

2731
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,520
but I wanted to clear up some misconceptions

2732
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,520
about VR in the new game

2733
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,520
before you guys say any stupid

2734
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,520
uninformed bullshit

2735
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,520
first VR is not

2736
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,520
expensive anymore you can get a windows mix

2737
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,520
reality headset which can play the game

2738
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,520
for under $200

2739
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,520
it comes with motion controllers

2740
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,520
and it's a full room scale

2741
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,520
experience with little compromise

2742
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,520
it does not require

2743
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,520
high-end hardware anymore

2744
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
you can play VR games

2745
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,520
on low to mid-range hardware

2746
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,520
now and the new Half-Life game

2747
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,520
does require 12 gigabytes of RAM

2748
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,520
but you can play it on a GTX

2749
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,520
1060 or an RX 5

2750
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,520
alright

2751
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,520
the new game VR only is

2752
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,520
not arbitrary and it's not

2753
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,520
meant to sell index headsets because

2754
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,520
as I said you can play it with windows mix reality

2755
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,520
and there are many

2756
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,520
many things in VR

2757
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,520
which cannot be translated to a mouse

2758
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,520
and keyboard and people may be

2759
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,520
disappointed but urban environments

2760
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,520
like in city 17 would be much better

2761
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,520
than outdoor wide environments

2762
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,520
than the Arctic which Half-Life 3

2763
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,520
would take place in

2764
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,520
don't say anything stupid or I'm gonna die

2765
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,520
I like it

2766
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,520
I apologize for all the stupid things I meant to say

2767
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,520
here's my fucking hot take

2768
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,520
Half-Life's gay and it sucks

2769
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,520
all games are gay

2770
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,520
wait the new one

2771
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,520
sorry this is dumb the new game

2772
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,520
is not Half-Life 3

2773
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,520
it's Half-Life something

2774
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,520
something

2775
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,520
Half-Life's Alex is a VR

2776
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,520
I can't remember I think I never beat

2777
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,520
episode 2 because the last thing

2778
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,520
that you have to do

2779
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,520
is like a tower defense game

2780
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
kind of where there's the big striders

2781
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,520
coming and you go to drive around

2782
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,520
in your buggy and get these bombs

2783
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,520
and shoot the bombs up so they stick on the stride

2784
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,520
and then shoot the bombs on the stride

2785
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,520
the so and so device

2786
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,520
I lost once

2787
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,520
and I was like this is never gonna fucking

2788
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,520
happen

2789
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,520
you played through the entirety of

2790
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,520
Half-Life 2

2791
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,520
episode 1 and episode 2 and then you got to the

2792
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,520
final boss and we're like

2793
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,520
too hard that happens sometimes

2794
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,520
I don't

2795
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,520
really like first person shooters

2796
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,520
but Half-Life is a big game

2797
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,520
I only played it like the other

2798
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,520
like last year

2799
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,520
I never beat any of them

2800
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,520
I played it when it was

2801
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,520
not new but like

2802
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,520
I played it in the days of the orange box

2803
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,520
I think I played it then too

2804
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,520
yeah

2805
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,520
the thing that came out

2806
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,520
is like

2807
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,520
I haven't really seen

2808
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,520
much of people's reactions to it

2809
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,520
aside from Jim Sterling talking about it

2810
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,520
and saying he has trouble

2811
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,520
with VR a lot

2812
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,520
so that's a problem for him accessibility

2813
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,520
or whatever

2814
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,520
yo let me

2815
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,520
it's a game I don't know

2816
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,520
this is the thing about VR games

2817
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,520
first of all investing $200

2818
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,520
to get into VR in general

2819
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,520
I mean that's less than a console

2820
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,520
it is less than a console that's true

2821
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,520
but the reason why I'm skeptical isn't really

2822
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,520
that I don't think I could potentially get

2823
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,520
my money's worth in terms of

2824
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,520
VR games

2825
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,520
the thing is that I'm extremely suspicious

2826
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,520
of VR games

2827
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,520
as games that are worth my time

2828
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,520
in general

2829
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,520
I'm looking at this game

2830
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,520
are games actually good

2831
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,520
there are some games that are good

2832
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,520
my brother has bought a VR headset

2833
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,520
for use in developing VR games

2834
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,520
and I've tried it

2835
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,520
and it is

2836
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,520
the gimmick

2837
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,520
of being in a real place

2838
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,520
when you come down and there you are

2839
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,520
I played this game

2840
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,520
which is basically just like

2841
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,520
a

2842
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,520
hang out

2843
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,520
like a quest

2844
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,520
it's very cute

2845
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,520
and you're just sort of in a place

2846
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
where there's cute animals

2847
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,520
and you move around and you pick up things

2848
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,520
and you can craft items

2849
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,520
and it's very chill

2850
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
normally a game like that

2851
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
I would turn on

2852
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
but

2853
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,520
the fact that it is there

2854
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,520
in front of you

2855
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,520
you can pick up the bird that's tweeting

2856
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,520
and you can rotate it around your hand

2857
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,520
these controllers he has

2858
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,520
I think it's the new Vive

2859
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,520
it is so satisfying

2860
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,520
just to experience

2861
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,520
being in the 3D world

2862
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
I feel like

2863
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,520
they don't have to impress you

2864
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,520
as much as other games do

2865
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,520
in order to be as impressive

2866
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,520
you know I do know what you mean

2867
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,520
you're absolutely right

2868
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,520
there's definitely some unique strengths that VR has

2869
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,520
for this very trailer

2870
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,520
that is in the description for Half-Life Alex

2871
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,520
at 55 seconds

2872
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,520
there's a little clip where

2873
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,520
the guy leans over, he looks through an area

2874
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
he sees a couple combine soldiers

2875
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,520
and then what happens

2876
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,520
the problem is I don't believe that this is going to be the game

2877
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,520
or it's going to be as intense as it looks

2878
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,520
he sees the soldiers

2879
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,520
he leans over to a bookshelf

2880
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,520
of items aside to reveal there are bullets behind it

2881
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,520
he then like picks them up

2882
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,520
like clearly using a VR handy

2883
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,520
reaches over, grabs it

2884
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,520
opens the gun, puts the bullet

2885
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,520
in the gun, then lowers the thing

2886
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
cocks it and then turns around

2887
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,520
and shoots a combine who has just noticed him

2888
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,520
I do not believe

2889
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,520
that the game is

2890
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,520
like going to

2891
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,520
in a high-paced, satisfying way

2892
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,520
expect you to do all those things

2893
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,520
in such rapid succession

2894
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,520
I think they're presenting

2895
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,520
basically a falsehood in this trailer

2896
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,520
because I do not believe

2897
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,520
I saw that as well, I didn't think that

2898
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,520
because I've used these sorts of controllers

2899
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,520
a little bit

2900
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,520
they're kind of bulky

2901
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,520
and they sort of wrap around your hand

2902
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,520
if you were trying to do that with your actual hands

2903
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
you'd knock the controllers against each other

2904
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,520
I feel like some of that must have been like an animation

2905
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,520
like the reloading and the cocking

2906
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,520
was just probably him pressing a button

2907
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,520
to get it loaded

2908
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,520
see, I felt a little bit manipulated

2909
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,520
maybe you're right, but because it's VR

2910
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,520
I feel like at least this trailer

2911
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
is giving false hope

2912
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,520
for the things you can do

2913
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,520
it's this intellectual cap

2914
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,520
of functionality

2915
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,520
that I'm thinking about lately

2916
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,520
I know that things are only going to get so complex

2917
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,520
and there's a shot right after that

2918
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,520
where a bunch of combined soldiers come up to you

2919
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,520
and there's an animation

2920
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,520
of these two hands going up like you're surrendering

2921
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,520
and when I first watched that

2922
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,520
I thought to myself like

2923
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,520
is the game trying to make me believe

2924
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,520
that soldiers will respond to you

2925
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
but if you put your hands up in VR

2926
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,520
they'll know you're surrendering and they won't shoot you

2927
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,520
I feel like that's what it's like hinting

2928
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
but there's no way

2929
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,520
there's no way

2930
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,520
there's not no way but

2931
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,520
I don't believe that the complexity is there

2932
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,520
the behavior patterns are going to be that

2933
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,520
it's got to be a cutscene

2934
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,520
the complexity, that is possible to do

2935
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,520
but I feel like

2936
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,520
I just don't think we're there yet

2937
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,520
I feel like that

2938
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,520
a thing like that is something that will happen

2939
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,520
like 80% of the time

2940
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,520
and sometimes you put your hands up and they don't respond

2941
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,520
that's going to 80% failure

2942
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,520
80% success rate

2943
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,520
like any motion control thing

2944
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,520
the thing is though

2945
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,520
I'm in the position where I could

2946
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,520
buy the game because I already have

2947
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,520
the access to a headset

2948
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,520
it's a pretty good headset and controllers

2949
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,520
but I'm not interested

2950
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,520
really in the conclusion to the Half-Life saga

2951
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,520
because

2952
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:32,520
I don't really give a shit

2953
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,520
but

2954
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,520
I don't think

2955
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,520
your reservations

2956
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,520
if you're interested in

2957
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,520
playing this game

2958
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,520
for learning about what happens next in Half-Life

2959
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
then I don't think it's going to be a massive disappointment

2960
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,520
like you're imagining

2961
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,520
most trailers

2962
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:52,520
show up the best bits

2963
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,520
of all the games they're from

2964
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
typically trusted to be exactly this way

2965
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,520
or exactly that

2966
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,520
and there's no way for you to

2967
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,520
truly experience what it will feel like

2968
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,520
because you don't have a headset

2969
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,520
by watching

2970
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,520
but by watching

2971
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,520
like a 2D version of the thing

2972
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,520
it won't feel the same if you watch a trailer

2973
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,520
or if you watch someone's Let's Play

2974
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,520
so like there's always

2975
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,520
a bit of like gamble

2976
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,520
in buying a VR game in that sense

2977
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
I mean it looks

2978
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,520
pretty good

2979
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,520
I mean what's the best VR game ever made

2980
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
I would bet it's significantly less complex

2981
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,520
than what's being showed off in this trailer

2982
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,520
people really like Superhot

2983
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,520
that's a pretty Superhot game

2984
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,520
and that game is way less complex than the one

2985
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,520
reloading animation that you do

2986
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,520
in this very trailer

2987
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,520
and maybe it's a button but it's clearly designed

2988
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,520
in this trailer to make it look like you're doing this stuff

2989
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,520
in VR

2990
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,520
at least for that reloading section

2991
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,520
I mean is that going to

2992
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
like

2993
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,520
if the reloading is like

2994
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,520
not as complex as you would like

2995
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,520
are you going to like throw your controller down

2996
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,520
like fuck this shit storm out

2997
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,520
what I will be is mad that they did

2998
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,520
basically false advertising

2999
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,520
because it clearly looks like that's

3000
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,520
I mean I know it's complicated

3001
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,520
it's hard to tell what is being promised and what isn't

3002
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
but like looking at this

3003
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,520
my instincts first told me

3004
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,520
that's what's being presented here

3005
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,520
and I'm relatively savvy on these things

3006
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,520
but I don't think it's going to be easy

3007
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,520
to think that this is kind of an intentional sequence

3008
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,520
maybe it's just a fucking cutscene

3009
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,520
I guess

3010
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,520
but then like this is a VR game

3011
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
why are we showing off cutscenes

3012
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
alright

3013
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
you're making a lot of assumptions

3014
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,520
I'm not saying it's definitely like this

3015
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,520
I understand your reservations

3016
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
but like I don't think

3017
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
I don't think they're

3018
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,520
like if you think that this could be

3019
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,520
like bullshit

3020
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,520
you're not over your eyes

3021
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,520
you are able to be like more cynical about it

3022
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,520
and then

3023
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,520
I'd say realistic

3024
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,520
you're arguing from

3025
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,520
no no no I'm arguing like

3026
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,520
I'm saying that you're arguing

3027
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
that the trailer is false advertising

3028
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,520
even though you've

3029
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,520
like quote unquote seen through it

3030
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,520
so it doesn't affect you specifically

3031
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,520
it is like a thing saying how dare they do

3032
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
false advertising

3033
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
but for you you see for what it truly is

3034
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,520
your purchasing decision is not like

3035
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,520
you're not being manipulated

3036
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,520
because you saw through it

3037
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,520
there's a grey area here

3038
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,520
like I'm aware that

3039
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,520
they didn't like specifically say

3040
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,520
these are the exact things that you will physically do

3041
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,520
with your hands in the game

3042
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,520
they simply showed off some scenes

3043
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,520
and we can draw our own conclusions from that

3044
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
does it look good to you?

3045
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,520
I think some people

3046
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,520
here's what I fear

3047
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,520
I think some people will see that

3048
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,520
and they'll think to themselves

3049
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,520
wow I'm gonna be able to do that in VR

3050
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,520
like look how technical and complex that is

3051
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
VR sure has advanced

3052
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,520
and I think that they will be disappointed

3053
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,520
if they expect that

3054
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
what exactly is the thing that is like supposed to be

3055
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
like too complex

3056
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,520
look at 55 seconds in this trailer here

3057
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,520
and there's just a little animation of a guy

3058
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,520
like doing a reload that involves several steps

3059
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,520
of him like finding ammo

3060
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
behind a thing

3061
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,520
like shooting out the old casing

3062
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,520
like sticking it in the gun

3063
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,520
lowering the hammer or the barrel or whatever

3064
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,520
and then cocking it and then turning around

3065
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:18,520
and shooting a guy

3066
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,520
like that to me looks like it's supposed to be gameplay

3067
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,520
but I don't believe that the game

3068
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,520
is actually going to expect to do those things

3069
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,520
I mean it looks like it could just be an animation playing

3070
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,520
um

3071
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,520
I mean yeah it could be

3072
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
but I don't know why is the game like

3073
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,520
like playing itself like finding ammo for you

3074
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,520
in a cutscene

3075
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,520
I don't know

3076
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
a container

3077
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
was there a button that loots item, reloads gun

3078
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,520
and shoots enemy for you

3079
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,520
it doesn't claim that there is or isn't

3080
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,520
well yeah

3081
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,520
I just think it's a stretch to like

3082
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,520
go straight to the false advertising thing

3083
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,520
like you can say you want to learn

3084
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,520
do not say that Nate is putting the big red stamp

3085
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,520
false advertising how clear do I have to be

3086
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,520
there is a fucking gray area

3087
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,520
that I've been saying repeatedly

3088
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,520
is what I'm trying to establish here

3089
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,520
and I think we're somewhere in there

3090
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,520
that's like no position of Nate

3091
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,520
what do you

3092
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,520
what do you think

3093
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,520
I don't know what's the problem

3094
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,520
I wish that they put at the bottom of the scene

3095
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,520
if it's a cutscene this is a cutscene

3096
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,520
not gameplay

3097
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,520
I don't think it is a cutscene

3098
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,520
I suspect I'm not wrong

3099
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
about this

3100
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:28,520
it just looks like a canned animation

3101
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,520
would be

3102
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,520
no no in terms of what I need to say

3103
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,520
it looks like

3104
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,520
you know when you're playing a video game

3105
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,520
like a first person shooter you're running around

3106
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,520
shooting and then you hit X and it does

3107
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,520
a canned animation of reloading the gun

3108
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,520
this is such a context specific

3109
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,520
thing where he turns around

3110
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,520
to a bookshelf sweeps aside items

3111
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,520
discovers bullets

3112
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,520
reloads gun

3113
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,520
there might be a context specific animation

3114
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,520
for different places

3115
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,520
and why don't they have the context specific thing

3116
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,520
visible on screen as we know it will be in the final game

3117
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,520
because they always turn off UIs during gameplay

3118
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,520
reveals and that is fucking

3119
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,520
giving people false hope that it's going to be more

3120
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
complicated and impressive than it actually

3121
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
is they should present it as it's going

3122
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,520
to be in the real game

3123
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,520
Nate you're so close right now

3124
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
to coming to a realization

3125
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,520
about why capitalism is bad

3126
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,520
you are like on the cusp but I know

3127
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,520
you are you are right about

3128
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
to pivot and go right in the opposite direction

3129
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,520
but I want you to come back

3130
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
I have no time for this point yet again Ben

3131
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
let's move on and go over

3132
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,520
and go over that cliff

3133
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,520
and join me

3134
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,520
perhaps one day

3135
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,520
alright I mean

3136
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
the thing looks like it's just well rehearsed

3137
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,520
like a guy played

3138
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,520
the game he pushed the things the boxes

3139
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,520
to the side so you're saying

3140
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,520
it is gameplay it's like high level gameplay

3141
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,520
I'm saying it's a mixture of gameplay

3142
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,520
like when he opens the gun

3143
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,520
and he puts the bullets in

3144
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,520
like him holding the gun

3145
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,520
that looks like it's still like shaky

3146
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:00,520
it's being held by somebody

3147
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,520
and that's the gun opening

3148
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,520
and you know

3149
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,520
there are buttons on the controllers

3150
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,520
so what I'm assuming happens

3151
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,520
is that he's actually using his hand

3152
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,520
to push the boxes out of the way

3153
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,520
because you can just that simple physics calculation

3154
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,520
of like you know something impacting

3155
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,520
then when the bullets show up he probably hits

3156
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,520
a button and it plays a canned animation

3157
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,520
of picking up the bullets and reloading the gun

3158
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,520
he's still holding the gun in game

3159
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,520
but instead of like because you can't do that

3160
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,520
with the controllers it's just a button prompt

3161
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,520
and they animate it just like they would

3162
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,520
any other canned reloading animation

3163
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,520
it's literally at the other game

3164
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,520
why in a VR I mean okay

3165
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:38,520
you think that like the picking up of the bullet

3166
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,520
and all that stuff is part of a canned animation

3167
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,520
because like

3168
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,520
not the picking up the bullet but the reloading the gun

3169
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,520
I mean parts of it could be

3170
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,520
but I mean we see how fast and smooth

3171
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,520
he like picks up the bullet

3172
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,520
I mean that seems a little

3173
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,520
not what you're gonna get

3174
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,520
he has the bullet grasped in his

3175
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,520
fingers which is just seems like he's holding down the hold button

3176
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,520
even the reaching out could be

3177
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,520
a part of the animation like they could

3178
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
he could just be looking at the object

3179
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,520
and then

3180
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,520
you hit a button and the character reaches grabs the object

3181
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,520
and we don't know but like there's definitely

3182
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:12,520
like part of it

3183
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,520
as a canned animation but it's still technically

3184
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,520
gameplay because it's

3185
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,520
happening in the game when you're playing it it's just the

3186
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,520
the prescripted animation

3187
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,520
takes over at that point and like that's probably

3188
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,520
a good thing because if you're in the middle of a game

3189
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:26,520
even a VR game you probably

3190
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,520
like reloading manually

3191
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,520
one bullet at a time would be annoying

3192
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,520
and would take a lot of your focus away from the game

3193
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,520
like there's a level of abstraction

3194
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,520
a level of abstraction in games is

3195
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,520
important

3196
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,520
this is all why I feel this is going to be disappointing

3197
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,520
you know okay let's

3198
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,520
we can disagree on this all day

3199
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,520
well I mean of course it will be disappointing

3200
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:48,520
because every game trailer is designed

3201
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:50,520
to make the game look good

3202
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,520
and the real game is never

3203
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,520
looks quite like the trailer

3204
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:56,520
I mean it doesn't

3205
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,520
it never happens

3206
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,520
perhaps we just disagree on how much

3207
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,520
lower I think it's going to be vastly

3208
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,520
below what's being depicted here

3209
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:06,520
in terms of

3210
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:08,520
I have some faith in this game

3211
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,520
like maybe not being

3212
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,520
incredibly amazing or living up to the

3213
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,520
Half-Life pedigree but doing something to

3214
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,520
move VR forward to some degree

3215
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,520
is there some way we can put stakes on this

3216
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,520
because I would love to bet you guys

3217
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,520
I would love to do that

3218
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,520
I agree that it won't be

3219
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:26,520
like the trailer but I don't see why

3220
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,520
this one in particular is going to be

3221
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,520
particularly disappointing when

3222
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,520
just standard procedure is to polish up

3223
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,520
and show the best version of the thing

3224
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,520
and the game never lives up

3225
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,520
games never live up to their trailers

3226
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,520
what's different about this to me

3227
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,520
is that this seems to be marketed as

3228
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,520
an epic real big VR game

3229
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,520
and I'm definitely still

3230
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,520
skeptical of those

3231
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,520
what do you expect that to be

3232
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:52,520
I expect this to be just like

3233
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,520
a standard

3234
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,520
Half-Life campaign

3235
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,520
with VR controls

3236
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:00,520
I mean VR controls don't even have

3237
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:02,520
like good movement from what I understand

3238
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:04,520
they have like weird teleporting controls

3239
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,520
in like the latest stuff I've seen

3240
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,520
where you have to kind of like point your guy and then you work

3241
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,520
to a new spot

3242
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,520
maybe that's changed I don't know

3243
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:14,520
no no there's options for that

3244
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,520
people get motion sickness from

3245
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,520
from having the character

3246
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:20,520
move like with an analog stick

3247
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,520
so there's options

3248
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,520
for like zipping

3249
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:26,520
zapping all over the place it's also

3250
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,520
much easier to program like that

3251
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,520
sure

3252
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,520
but like it's definitely

3253
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,520
possible to have like a

3254
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:36,520
you have the two controllers in your hands

3255
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,520
and you imagine like a wee

3256
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,520
nunchuck like your thumb has

3257
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:42,520
the analog stick

3258
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,520
and then your other fingers are free to click buttons

3259
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,520
and rotate the stuff

3260
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,520
so like you can move

3261
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,520
with your left hand and hold the gun

3262
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,520
with your right and I can see it being possible

3263
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,520
I noticed that we don't actually see the player character

3264
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,520
moving anywhere in the game

3265
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:58,520
well we do in that thing that I've been playing

3266
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,520
over and over where he runs over to the shelf

3267
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,520
to get the bullets that's why I feel it's a canned animation

3268
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:04,520
that's the only time there's like movement

3269
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:06,520
and

3270
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,520
my issue with this scene is that it

3271
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,520
it felt to me like it's presented and even you guys

3272
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,520
have said it seems like part of it seems canned

3273
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,520
but maybe not all of it which makes me a little suspicious

3274
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,520
of but what's wrong with a canned animation

3275
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,520
that's just normal this is the normal

3276
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:20,520
video game what's different about it is that

3277
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,520
this is VR and that

3278
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,520
it's I feel like there could be false

3279
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,520
conclusions drawn which is I mean

3280
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,520
when I first watch this I was like wow look at all the

3281
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:30,520
this is literally my experience look at the amazing

3282
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,520
thing you push over away the

3283
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,520
stuff you pick up the bullet you load it then I was

3284
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:36,520
beginning to think like wait there's

3285
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:38,520
no way it's going to expect you to do these

3286
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,520
things there has to be something else going

3287
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,520
on so I mean I felt like I myself

3288
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,520
am an example of

3289
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,520
exactly the thing consumer not aware

3290
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:48,520
of the limitations of hardware

3291
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
yeah so here I am spreading

3292
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,520
so how would you got how what's the complaint

3293
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,520
here I am just stating what everyone should

3294
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,520
know right it shouldn't be

3295
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,520
as don't be impressed don't be impressed

3296
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,520
like every okay

3297
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,520
it's not

3298
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,520
it's not going to have one for one

3299
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,520
hand move obviously like that's

3300
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:08,520
impossible nobody can do that at this point

3301
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
I just

3302
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,520
if you if your opinion of

3303
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,520
this trailer is that wow everything I

3304
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,520
just watch was a one-to-one interaction

3305
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,520
in VR like

3306
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,520
I guess that's understandable but that's

3307
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,520
also like a complete like

3308
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,520
fault of your interpretation because the trailer

3309
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,520
is not implying that like you

3310
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,520
can argue that like the medium of VR

3311
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:30,520
promises that and so

3312
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:32,520
you can interpret it incorrectly that way

3313
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,520
but I don't think that that was

3314
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:36,520
implicitly the idea I think it was just

3315
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:38,520
hey you know Tom that's fair

3316
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,520
it's my goal as always

3317
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,520
my goal as always is just to keep

3318
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:44,520
people with with reasonable expectation

3319
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,520
so perhaps I've done too much on that

3320
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,520
front but that that is my goal

3321
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,520
for people to not be disappointed because

3322
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,520
I'm a little suspicious of this of this project

3323
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,520
specifically in terms of gameplay and nothing

3324
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:56,520
else I don't care about the story or anything at all

3325
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,520
well glad

3326
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,520
I feel like do exactly what it was

3327
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:02,520
warning us against doing

3328
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,520
yeah I would never have talked about it

3329
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,520
otherwise I just

3330
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
I am a little like confused

3331
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
about what

3332
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,520
like

3333
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,520
I generally

3334
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,520
can't remember if the goalposts

3335
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,520
switched a couple times

3336
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:20,520
in that argument

3337
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,520
like I feel like I agree

3338
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,520
with your point now that you've made it at the end

3339
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,520
but I wasn't agreeing

3340
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,520
with it earlier the conclusion

3341
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:30,520
that it is not one-to-one hand movement

3342
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,520
is true probably

3343
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,520
I remain in my initial position

3344
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,520
I feel like you're advocating for a consumer

3345
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,520
that doesn't exist someone who would

3346
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,520
look at this and think that this is like

3347
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:42,520
like perfect one-to-one

3348
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:44,520
well I mean some people are gonna be gonna be

3349
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,520
like wow

3350
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:48,520
it's gonna be way worse than that

3351
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:50,520
we I know this I know it's gonna be

3352
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,520
like it's so polished in the trailer

3353
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,520
like one-to-one we all know is impossible

3354
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,520
but is is I don't know 50%

3355
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,520
there even possible doubt it

3356
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,520
what do you mean one-to-one in what

3357
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,520
it's just the gameplay shown here

3358
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,520
is so

3359
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:06,520
like polished and good looking

3360
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,520
and I doubt it will get even a fucking

3361
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,520
like a tenth of the way to how things look

3362
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:12,520
in this trailer I don't understand

3363
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:14,520
I'm so mad like okay

3364
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,520
are you are you just talking about the reload animation

3365
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,520
I'm talking about we've been over this and we know

3366
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,520
we understand that it is a canned animation

3367
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,520
I mean I

3368
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,520
every every fight in the game

3369
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,520
every thing every piece of

3370
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,520
I mean you the character doesn't

3371
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:30,520
move at all so don't don't expect that

3372
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,520
I you know if they would have shown that

3373
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,520
if that's something that happens in the game

3374
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:36,520
the the hands up don't shoot thing obviously

3375
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:38,520
that's gonna be a canned animation so like how much

3376
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,520
impressive stuff really was there why are people excited

3377
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:42,520
for this I don't know it just looks like the same

3378
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:44,520
show I've seen a million times in a million VR games

3379
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,520
it's a fucking half-life game and it's in VR

3380
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
like what why wouldn't if you like

3381
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,520
half-life and or VR why wouldn't you

3382
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
like this as long as we can all agree

3383
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,520
that nothing impressive has happened here

3384
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,520
I think we could all agree

3385
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:58,520
it just looks like a fucking VR game

3386
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,520
I mean with a lot of money I'm genuinely

3387
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:02,520
confused like I feel like

3388
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,520
the goalposts have moved like 20 times

3389
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,520
like what are you

3390
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,520
I can't I can't

3391
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,520
my head around what your point is

3392
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,520
because every time

3393
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,520
any of us say anything you come up

3394
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,520
with a different thing that I

3395
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,520
I can't people in the comments

3396
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,520
people in the comics please explain

3397
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,520
like what was Nate initially

3398
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,520
saying and why am I confused now

3399
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,520
hopefully they will be

3400
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:28,520

3401
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,520

the power that's

3425
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,520

running out of social credits better earn some more

3439
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,520
well that was a

3440
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,520
palette cleanser when there was a

3441
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:50,520
there was a follow-up message from from riddle my ass

3442
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,520
Batman let's uh let's hear him out here we go

3443
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,520
happy Thanksgiving everybody riddle my

3444
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:58,520
ass Batman here thank you did you enjoy my

3445
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:00,520
singing I know you didn't

3446
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,520
that's why he's joking with you anyway

3447
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,520
now I was debating on what to get you

3448
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,520
for Christmas this year at first I thought

3449
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:08,520
I'd get to a gym membership

3450
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:10,520
but then I realized you'll never use

3451
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,520
it then I thought I'd get to a girlfriend

3452
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:14,520
and I realized you don't know how to use that

3453
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,520
so instead I decided on something simple

3454
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,520
I get to

3455
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,520
a new voicemail series

3456
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:22,520
that's right coming this Christmas a new

3457
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,520
300 part voicemail series

3458
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:26,520
wait I found the budget

3459
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,520
a new 10 part

3460
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,520
voicemail series

3461
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,520
with only voicemails per episode of the

3462
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:34,520
PCP for 10 weeks straight

3463
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,520
oh my god now you have a reason to watch the

3464
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:38,520
PCP again

3465
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:40,520
see you Christmas everybody

3466
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:42,520
same PCP time same PCP channel

3467
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,520
that's like a PCP

3468
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:46,520
or a Peter Griffin Christmas

3469
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,520
album with riddle my ass Batman

3470
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,520
you know

3471
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:52,520
I hope it's good

3472
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,520
he sent in another one that was too long

3473
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:56,520
and not great so I didn't play it

3474
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,520
riddle my ass Batman

3475
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,520
so maybe just pick the best

3476
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:02,520
of each of them and we can maybe pair this down a bit

3477
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,520
I think three voicemails

3478
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,520
of a song each time is a bit much

3479
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:08,520
maybe we can do

3480
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,520
one a week or something I don't know

3481
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:12,520
but there it is

3482
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,520
I'm looking forward to it nonetheless

3483
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,520
these songs always bring delay

3484
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,520
leave us wanting more

3485
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:20,520
keep us wanting more riddle my ass Batman

3486
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,520
oh incidentally we've got

3487
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,520
one last voicemail and this is from

3488
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,520
thems tapes

3489
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,520
number one thems tapes

3490
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,520
let's hear it

3491
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,520
mysterious

3492
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:38,520
it's hot

3493
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,520
why is it so hot

3494
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,520
I've been stuck in this desert for

3495
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,520
months and I still can't figure

3496
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:46,520
out why there is so much

3497
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,520
sand I'm so

3498
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,520
thirsty but no matter where I

3499
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,520
look I can't find a single drop

3500
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:54,520
of bloge to quench my

3501
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:56,520
thirst how did it come

3502
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,520
to this wow is my life

3503
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,520
like this things were

3504
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:02,520
supposed to be different after we killed

3505
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,520
munchy but it's only gotten

3506
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:06,520
worse I've been stranded

3507
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,520
out here for months and no one has

3508
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:10,520
come to help me I can't

3509
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:12,520
rely on them anymore

3510
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:14,520
of all of my own

3511
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:16,520
but

3512
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,520
there's one who could

3513
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,520
help me to answer my

3514
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,520
questions my burning snake

3515
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:24,520
questions however

3516
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,520
he is split in two

3517
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,520
one half in prison one

3518
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:30,520
half in goo what shall

3519
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:32,520
I do how can he

3520
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,520
uncover the secrets without

3521
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,520
access to the tapes

3522
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,520
the tapes

3523
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,520
surely one holds the secret

3524
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:42,520
to releasing his other half

3525
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:44,520
from prison and making

3526
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:46,520
him whole once again

3527
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:48,520
this is my mission this

3528
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,520
is my new character

3529
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,520
hooray

3530
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:56,520
them's tapes

3531
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:58,520
the lost tape archive

3532
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:00,520
perhaps is that

3533
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:02,520
well he said one half in prison

3534
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,520
the other half in goo

3535
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:06,520
hmm how mysterious what does that mean

3536
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:08,520
I don't know what that means

3537
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,520
probably but I don't

3538
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,520
uh

3539
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:14,520
slime stuff obviously

3540
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,520
is it goo is it Luigi

3541
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,520
does he hold the secrets

3542
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,520
I don't know I don't

3543
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:22,520
shit someone remind me about

3544
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,520
our own lore

3545
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,520
maybe them's tapes number two we'll call

3546
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:28,520
it next time and elucidate things for us

3547
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,520
but otherwise

3548
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:32,520
you know I'm glad

3549
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:34,520
you know I'm glad he's doing good

3550
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:36,520
out in the desert I'm glad he's

3551
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:38,520
fine without me

3552
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,520
a big bundle of snakes just rolling

3553
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,520
rolling rolling along

3554
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:44,520
good luck good luck out there

3555
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:46,520
all alone in their many

3556
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,520
all alone in their multitude

3557
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,520
what's

3558
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,520
