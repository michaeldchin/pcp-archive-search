00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,060
the best guy ever and I don't know what channel this video is going up on. We've got Ben

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:21,560
Saint over there. Yeah, we're still in this pickle here and this hacker pickle if you

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:29,320
know what I'm saying. And this ripple pickle. This ripple pickle. Gibbontake, Tom Oliver,

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,080
Yeah, I'm here and I'm sad. The usual reasons or anything? I'm sad about the hack. I'm talking

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,640
about the hack. I mean, I'm sad about everything. There's a coronavirus in Massachusetts. We're

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,920
all going to die, doom and gloom, blah, blah, blah, whatever. It's going to happen eventually.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,560
There's Munchy. I don't know if I have all the paperwork to be on this show. I mean,

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,200
I went to the DMV and I got a stamp. I don't know if it's the right stamp. I tried to talk

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,960
to the committee, but they wouldn't talk to me this ago. We wouldn't talk to mudbloods

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,560
like yourself. And I went down to the other DMV that one that doesn't have a hearsay officer

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
and they don't have the hearing officer. And I went over there and I said, Hey, can I have

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,240
the paperwork to be on the podcast? And they said, you're already recording the podcast

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,720
right now. And then they put me in handcuffs. And here I am. What do they have you guys

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,080
for? Like, how'd you get in here? Like, what's the problem with you?

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,120
They said, you're a part of the PCP die. And there I was. Hey, you're part of that cryptocurrency

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,480
like scam, like a live stream, right? Yeah, that's me. We have lost 1000 subscribers

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,440
from the PCP channel. Thanks. How many subscribers are you down? I dare. I dare not ask, but

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,280
I ask anyway. Great question, Tom. But on the best gaver channel now rebranding permanently

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,160
as Brad Garlinghouse, they have hidden the subscriber count. So I have no, I can guarantee

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,000
you. Well, I mean, yeah, I haven't actually checked social blade, but I know social blade.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,600
I mean, don't they not have access to like, you know, I don't know who knows. It's a mystery

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,840
to us all. Yeah, I don't know. I could check still going on. It's still like currently

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,240
happening. Yeah, obviously, he's still streaming every day. Are you not aware of this?

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,960
I haven't checked anything. Why don't we just all just spam YouTube like over and over and

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,400
over again? That I mean, well, at this point, I think, you know, it's been long enough that

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,320
I feel like they're not doing anything. It's been since about the 22nd or the 23rd is when

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,880
I noticed it. And I might have contact them as late as like the 24th or 25th overall. But

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:33,520
it's been, you know, about a solid week over a week. I think it's time to enforce mob rule.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,080
We need to just hashtag Twitter, destroy YouTube. You know, I'll tell you, everyone's

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,680
everyone says that YouTube only really responds to people like humiliating them on social

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,760
media. That's the only way I sexually respond to anyone. Someone humiliates me in public.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,320
Yeah, humiliation. I've been talking to a couple people who have had these issues or

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,760
people who follow them. And I have been informed that like just for example, I was telling you

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,040
guys before, but I'll tell the audience here that like, for your interest, there was a

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,280
guy with like a small following, maybe like a couple thousand or something who took eight

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,480
weeks to get restored, clearly because he's just, you know, not high on their priority

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,040
list. And then someone like Pogo with like many hundreds of thousands of subs apparently

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,560
took like a few days to like a week or something along these lines. And like, I don't even

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,120
know if they specifically, there was like a campaign with Pogo, but I think they just

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,520
were like, okay, this guy we should do something with because he matters. So like, I go, what

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,640
do you do? Music man, it doesn't matter. Are you high? I wish I was. I wish I was real. I

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,800
don't believe that. So I at this point, I'm, I don't like to do these things, but I'm left

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,760
with no alternative, but to think that like it's just about the pressure that's being

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,960
put on these people. And like the tickets exist. Like Google is apparently doing the things

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,640
they're passing them on to the internal team, whatever that means, but apparently the internal

47
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,320
team is not like actively fixing the problem yet. They're like in queue probably.

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,480
I really feel like it would only be a matter of a few button presses for them.

49
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,040
I feel strongly that that is the case as well. But like, so I have no alternative, but to

50
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,800
think that like, yeah, I mean, what exactly is the harm of getting everybody who listens

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,360
to this to spam at team YouTube with full authority, be polite, be respectful, but let

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,800
them know what the issue is. Cause this is what they're for, right? What's the harm in

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,800
doing so I, you know, go for it. I say, in fact, I call upon you that like at them on

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Twitter, team YouTube. Okay. So our current society is, is thus the following. Um, like

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,960
basically just like huge like tech bros from San Francisco and like San Jose can basically

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,120
just like, you know, completely ruin society with a click of a button with, with half an

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,160
a press they're released as a society. They create robots and algorithms to run their sites

58
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,800
for them so they can maximize suffering and minimize the amount of money they have to

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,480
pay people to oversee things. And then when it doesn't work, the only way to get it to

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,840
like, you know, the site to actually, you know, function in any way is to constantly

61
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,600
bombard them with bad PR. And that's the only way to do it. And they have just created

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,240
robots and do nothing for us. That really does seem to relatively accurately reflect

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,440
the current situation. I just think it's ridiculous that like YouTube has all these people on

64
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,000
their site, like making a living through their platform, but their pay is so bad that people

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,040
have to go to outside sources in order to make any money. And it is that part of the

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,840
equation that is actually lucrative for hackers to try and steal your shit, not through YouTube

67
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,280
itself, but through sponsorships, because that's the only way you can make money effectively

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,360
on YouTube now because of their draconian policies. It's just like multiple levels of

69
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,000
failure, which I find hilarious.

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,280
Bro, bro, why, why, why are you leaving? Do you didn't even smash your Acai bowl? I say

71
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,280
twirling in my mustache with my thick rimmed glasses to my tech, bro. He says, bro, I found

72
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,720
the best way to destroy society, dude. I just found a way to completely obliterate culture

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,320
forever. We can make this brand new hashtag, which minimizes the amount of people that

74
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
are able to hear about third world issues. And I can also brainwash people and make them

75
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,680
spend all their time addicted to social media. I found this brand new way to hack into a human's

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,040
physiology and make them completely addicted to retweeting things. Dude, that's so epic.

77
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,080
Dude, I'm dropping my Acai bowl too. Can we stop and get some more flannel shirts on the

78
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,760
way over there? Hell yeah, dude. Also, I sleep in my car on the Facebook campus. I don't have

79
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,360
a house.

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,240
That does sound great. Should we, should we unify this around a hashtag of some kind? What

81
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,160
about hashtag save the PCP? What do you think? Is that, is that good? Is that too dramatic?

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,720
How about hashtag do the PCP and then it's drug marketed? How about hashtag do your fucking

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:40,840
job? I'm concerned that they will restore best guy ever and maybe the PCP and like everything

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,880
else like Canton and T-Bap and stuff will just get ignored. I mean, certainly a possibility

85
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,120
or at least like take way longer. If they do worse, then why wouldn't they do all of them?

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
I don't know the answer to that. YouTube is high school. It's just a popularity contest. If

87
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,000
you're not big enough, they don't give a fuck. Yeah, I just feel like they will do one, they

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,640
will maybe restore like the biggest channel and then be like, Hey, we did it. And like you

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,400
should be great. You should be grateful that we did literally any part of our job. Thanks very

90
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,000
much. The way that I had to submit the tickets, it's like basically it seems by Google account.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,720
So like for example, on the PCP, I think the two channels that disappeared are the PCP and

92
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,400
the podcast, which was on like the PCP Google account as well. So like, I feel like if we get

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,640
the PCP back, probably as part of that conversation, we can we can fix the podcast as well. And the

94
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,440
same way, like my beachy channels, like a bunch of them got taken bestie boy and the live streams

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,440
one, like I can probably get them all back as a package deal. But T-Bap and content are on their

96
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,560
own. Those are on separate little Google accounts. I mean, maybe the fact that Digi's involved with,

97
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,000
you know, fucking T-Bap can help. Maybe once I actually get contact with like an internal person,

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,120
I can kind of be like, Hey, bro, kind of got a larger issue here. I would love to solve all these

99
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,880
at once. Maybe that'll happen. I don't know. I don't know. Literally, it would take someone at

100
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,120
like Google headquarters, like half an hour to just fix everything. I definitely think that's

101
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,680
correct. And that's being generous. Speaking of algorithms, completely. What's what's even the

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,200
word? Like putting like a boot on the throat of human endeavor. I was informed by close friend and

103
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,000
confidant and fellow occupier of space in the physical world, Kazi Snepp earlier today, of a

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,080
delicious, delicious, I've not like, so this person got a background check for their job. And the

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,320
company that he applied to ran a background check on him. They went through his entire Twitter and

106
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,480
made a report of every single tweet that he had liked with the word fucking it.

107
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,960
Liked? Yeah, I saw this. This was on r slash boring dystopia, which is an amazing sub-branded.

108
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,640
Did he get the job or something? I mean, what's the... I highly doubt it.

109
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,880
They counted it up. And the more fucks there were, the more likely he was to be high. Well,

110
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,040
they just, they had like different things like trig, like it was like, it's like, this is bad

111
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,800
because language is bad because alcohol is bad because all those things. This is exactly what

112
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,480
my mom warned me about when I was making Facebook posts like a decade ago about me at a party in

113
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,640
college holding a solo cup and being a silly boy. I'm assuming these are boomers who are

114
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,680
enacting these policies. So it makes me not surprised at all that the things our parents

115
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,480
that are now coming to pass as they are in charge of all the companies now. Okay, but, but I have

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,440
to pour cold water on everyone who's getting all hot and bothered about this. Sure. A report was

117
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,120
done on his Twitter, finding all the words with fuck. I need to know before I know how mad to get

118
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,320
exactly how that impacted his chances of getting, or was it simply a report about that? That is

119
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,000
irrelevant. That's fucked up. That has no relevance to the situation whatsoever. Of course it's

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,840
irrelevant. It doesn't matter. The fact that they're doing it at all is ridiculous.

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,560
To go through Facebook monitoring to make sure they don't say fuck.

122
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,640
This guy applied to a job and the company he was applying to did a background check on him,

123
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,080
went through his entire Twitter account and found all the questionable tweets that just had like

124
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,960
a swear in it or referenced alcohol in any form. That he had just liked. And just made a whole

125
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,840
print out and like said, these are all like flags. All right. Yes, that's very dystopian that they

126
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,160
looked that up. Okay, I totally agree. I totally agree. That's fair. But I'm also curious what the

127
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,960
next step was. Yeah, I am wondering like, did they get this report and look at it and be like,

128
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,720
oh, the computer's done something stupid. Maybe the boomers also said, well, obviously we don't

129
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,520
care about this. Why are you talking about getting a job at Facebook? It's not Facebook.

130
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,840
It's not Facebook. It's just some random company. In a hypothetical situation where there are two

131
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,080
candidates and they have the exact same credentials. It's like, hmm, which one do we pick?

132
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,520
Then tweets that they've liked with the word fucking, it might be the thing that people use

133
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,640
eventually to tip the balance. So I guess delete all your accounts.

134
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,960
Yeah, I mean, if you have two exactly equal applicants and one just says fuck more, you're

135
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,120
going to be like, well, that's not as good for my business as someone not saying fuck potentially.

136
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,760
So I'll just, you know, take the safer option. Who are these fucking alien like bug creatures?

137
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,920
They're like, oh, the people, if they know an employee of mine, you know, some like

138
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,040
janitor in one of my franchisees stores, if they said fuck one time on Twitter, that's going to

139
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,200
really hurt my brand. That's a bad representative of the company, dude. Bad representative of the

140
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,560
company. Get them out of here. The micromanaging is just sad. I can't imagine that this would

141
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,200
be in any way sustainable because of the amount of people that are on social media right now

142
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:48,280
that will need jobs in the near future. If like 700,000 people can't get a job because

143
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:55,080
they've said fuck on Twitter before, then what are the offices going to be filled with?

144
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,720
In 15 years or so, the millennials will be in that position, the boomers will be dead,

145
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,600
and this policy will go away because no one from our age demographic is going to think that's in

146
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,080
any way logical. And it'll just now that you can only get a job if you've said fuck on Twitter

147
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,520
before. Yeah, yeah, exactly. If you don't have pronouns in your bio, that's how you that's the

148
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,000
only way you can get a job. You know, perhaps social media is such an omnipresent force in

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,920
people's lives. And because you basically need like a Twitter account or at least a flirt with

150
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,200
Twitter for a while to have a a social standing in the current modern world. This means that if

151
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,800
you at all act, I'm going to say genuinely on social media whatsoever, and you anyway have your

152
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,480
real life persona tied to your internet persona, then this means that basically you have to perform

153
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,840
what 100% of the time, you know, existing as a human being online or off, you have to because

154
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,360
they have these such large degrees of like, you know, everything you do on the internet is completely,

155
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,400
you know, archive lockdown forever. You basically have to be performing from the day you fucking

156
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,800
start, you have to be like your parents just sit down with you and say like, Hey, Jimmy, look,

157
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,640
when you post on Twitter, make sure that this will be remembered forever, like every tweet you

158
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,960
ever like can be found and archives and your boss, big daddy, boss, monopoly bags will look that up

159
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,720
and use against you in a job application. So you've been well, hang on, that's the question.

160
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,240
Maybe there's a silver lining, not really silver lining, but maybe okay, because right now hiring

161
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,640
decisions right now still probably come down to a human being at the end of the day. So maybe we

162
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,000
can rely on our boomer heroes to get these reports and be like, Oh, you know, when I was young, I

163
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,720
was posting all my white nationalist propaganda too. So you know what, if the fact that you post a

164
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,440
couple of those, we'll let them off the hook this time. Maybe maybe there's no, again, it's not about

165
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,880
the job process part. It doesn't matter if like getting the job is not the bad thing here. The

166
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,040
fact that they even have access to this, the fact that keep in mind, this person gave them their

167
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,000
Twitter handle, they had to find it out, the company seek out the information, they seek out

168
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,280
this person's online account. The fact that these companies are so willing and able to look up

169
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,200
personal statements from years ago of people just because they want to be a fucking McDonald's cashier.

170
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,960
Ridiculous. I'm curious what this job was, what field it was in, you know, that would be perhaps

171
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,920
relevant, but I guess we don't know, whatever, doesn't matter, doesn't matter. Yeah, it's concerning.

172
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,560
It's not great, but like if you're an employer and you just like there's two buttons in front of

173
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,200
you, one is be willingly ignorant as to the private life of your of your potential employees,

174
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:41,000
when the other button is note a dystopian too much about them, be a morally upstanding character

175
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,800
in any way. You have a fiduciary responsibility as a business to try to pick the safest choice you

176
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,840
can. So like that is definitely not good for society, but business wise. There was a great

177
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:06,360
video by Philosophy Tube quite recently about data and data collection and stuff and he basically

178
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,640
argues with himself different characters playing about all of the different aspects of data collection

179
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,520
and how it's ruining society and how... Oh, are you talking about the Philosophy Tube video?

180
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,680
Yeah. Dammit, he just said that, Ben, listen. I'm sorry, this is really boring to me.

181
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,600
Well, it was a good video and you should all watch it if you like that conversation.

182
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,520
It's just called data and it ends with like a... Well, let's talk about it, but if you thought it

183
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,400
was interesting, don't just say go watch someone else's video. What was interesting about it?

184
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,800
Because it's so many fucking... All right, the cool part is... It's a conversation and it basically

185
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,720
shows every way that the conversation could possibly branch as they talk.

186
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,880
I don't care about the video, the way it's formatted. I care about what was said in that.

187
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,000
I mean, he's talking about like fucking problematic things that private corporations can

188
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
do with all this data that they're constantly collecting from you. The thing that I really

189
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,240
liked about the video was that from the perspective of the bouncer, he's just trying to do his job

190
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:13,720
and he constantly goes to that like, sorry, I just have to scan your ID and it boils down to

191
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,360
the ultimate point of, I know that all this data is ruining the world. I know it's destroying society.

192
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,000
I just don't want to think about it. I don't want to think. I just want to do my job and go home.

193
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,080
And that's where the video ends because ultimately that is the problem. People don't want to think

194
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,640
and the computers will do the thinking for them because life sucks and they don't want to have

195
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,640
to deal with all of that shit all the time. All right. I mean, there's only so much you

196
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,240
can put on any individual. Like if you're just in a system that just has these things in place,

197
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,040
like you kind of can't avoid using them. There needs to be, I don't know, some like higher level

198
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,600
thing, like a movement that's like, this is bad. We're going to stop using this through some mechanism.

199
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,440
I don't know. This guy needs a job. His job involves scanning people's IDs.

200
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,360
Yeah. Yeah. How can you blame him? Yeah. He could be, what's the word? He could rise above and be

201
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,960
like, no, I'm going to go and be gay instead for pay. I'll be gay for pay instead. That's the moral

202
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,880
choice. That's how we beat big data. Everybody's gonna go gay for pay. The new sleep type album,

203
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:28,520
gay for a pay day. But all that's going to change when they release the new gay bots

204
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,920
that will, you know, all gay men will lose their jobs. You're right. They're going to place this

205
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,520
out of the market. Dammit. I've been Boston of the fuck out, guys. I've really been so fucking

206
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,280
Massachusetts pill. It's really retarded. And I know everyone's like, oh my god, wow, the fucking

207
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,680
seven letter word or six letter word or how many letter words it is. Oh my god. He said it again,

208
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,160
wouldn't only shut the fuck up. And listen, I'm sorry, but fuck you. I'll never ship about it

209
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:01,000
because I've had strange and bizarre experiences and a like exponential Boston intake lately

210
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,760
for you see at my school. I have two courses basically dedicated to Boston in the terms of a

211
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,200
architecture class of the city of Boston, and then a like local activism class for the city of

212
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,960
Boston. I've been reading a Boston history book, which by the way, Ben, I gave you the pass for

213
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,160
the audible. You can log back. I have signed in and I opened that up this morning. I haven't

214
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,160
started listening. Yeah, I haven't started listening. And and I've been I've been just, I mean,

215
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,000
living here, obviously, I'm literally so fucking Massachusetts pill it hurts and I can't go back.

216
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,520
Our culture is not your fucking costume. It literally is. I literally want to paint my face.

217
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,040
I want a white face now.

218
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,800
Munchie is pulling a jauntron right now walking around dressed up like a pilgrim.

219
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,960
I wish I fucking was honestly. Dude, that book is so fucking crazy, Ben. The city

220
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,680
state of Boston. I recommend everyone Google search, Mark Peterson, city state of Boston,

221
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:05,480
because it has like a like a weird like, okay, so it has the history of New England from the

222
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,160
perspective, not of like Boston, the cradle of liberty, you know, oh, the famous American

223
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,320
Revolutionary site. Oh, you know, remember America? That happens later. This is just the

224
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,640
prelude to America. This is just like the first chapter of American history. It goes about it

225
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,320
from the perspective of the people actually at the time. And, you know, the decision they made

226
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:31,000
as a almost like a quasi independent colony, and the trials and tribulations, not of people

227
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,960
gunning to create the United States. That was not on anyone's mind. Yeah, no shit. Yeah. It was

228
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,040
for them to, you know, prosper as an independent city state, as the person says. And I love shit

229
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,640
like that. I love the best history is not the sort of, you know, popcorn, extra credits, like,

230
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,960
this happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this has

231
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,200
happened. And it's not even the like, oh, you get really into like the heroes and the villains.

232
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,880
No, it's a great narrative story. No, no, no. The best history is the kind of history that makes you

233
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,360
remember, oh, wait, nothing was like planned. Nothing was ever like, oh, I'm like, nothing ever

234
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,080
had to be the way it is. So much of history is just like, coincidentally, oh, you stumble into

235
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,320
something. Oh, just coincidentally, oh, because of these various, you know, very specific, hyper

236
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,840
specific circumstances. Oh, now Boston has just, you know, randomly happenstance happened to appeal

237
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,840
to other like, English colonies at that specific point in world history. And oh, blue America

238
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,920
happened, wasn't even planned, wasn't intentional, wasn't destined or anything. And that stuff is

239
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:41,960
just like on a moment to moment, human level, it's always something that sticks with me. And

240
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,240
there's like, dude, at any moment, like, like the things that are happening right now, at any moment

241
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,880
could blossom and change into something that I would have never imagined happening before and

242
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,360
could potentially have ramifications for a long time afterward, like think back to my own experiences,

243
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,560
like stuff that like changed my life forever, like let's say going to Bronicon and meeting

244
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,000
Digi Bro. At the time, I just like saw Digi Bro. And like, I talked to him for like five minutes,

245
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,760
but that like changed my, I'm recording this podcast because of that small change.

246
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,600
And it's cool. Hey, speaking of destiny,

247
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,000
this slide aside, I do have an aside here, which I think will entertain the peanut gallery,

248
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,080
which is that my my down so I live in a house in Cincinnati, obviously, and your downstairs

249
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,560
name more like your down soy neighbors fucking accurate. Yeah. So so I had a downstairs neighbor

250
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,720
directly below me. It was a single guy, he moved out recently, I think it was like the army or

251
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,520
something. And like new neighbors moved in. So I have not actually met the man possibly I've seen

252
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,720
a man and a woman moving around inside. So I don't know who lives there. That's the

253
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,760
generosity. I hope you're married. I got I hope so. Jesus, but cohabitation,

254
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,000
big problem in today's society. They're not going to have right now. Watch the YouTube video about

255
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,200
that. Last week, I mentioned a political juice. I watched a six hour video about the importance

256
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,560
of civil society. And he spends a lot of it being like, I don't know about all this premarital

257
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,320
cohabitation. I mean, one could potentially make a case that it might be like better or worse for

258
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,760
society to do. Okay, but either way, either way, my Okay, so so like when it was a single guy

259
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,160
living down there, at least because I knew that guy a little bit, like he had like the back door,

260
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,720
there's like a back door in the house, which I that's how I get in my house. And like his window

261
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,280
did not have a shade over it. So like, and I would see him like playing League of Legends or

262
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,120
something through that window, as I'm like out walking the dog or coming home from something

263
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,880
or whatever. And like he has a he has a there's a porch that goes up on the right, it branches

264
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,680
upstairs to my thing. And on the left, it branches sort of into that door into his apartment or

265
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,280
whatever. And so once in a while, I would just be a little curious, there's no shade, I would just

266
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,960
I take a step up or two right on his step, I would peer in and be like, Oh, he's playing League

267
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,960
of Legends. And then I dip out and then I would go up my stairs, being a little nosy, it's true.

268
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,480
But I just want to know what he's playing. It's these windows wide open. If he doesn't want me

269
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,040
looking in, get a shade. This isn't my problem. This is your problem. I see my neighbors TV

270
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,720
constantly playing Smash. There you go. Exactly the same shit kind of shit. Okay,

271
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,880
but that man has moved out and there are now new people person living there. So the other day,

272
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,720
and I looked at him and I was like, Oh, boy, can't wait to look in the window and see some more

273
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,640
League of Legends and you're looking and oh, my God, they're playing smite. What the fuck?

274
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,680
Well, so the other day, I'm just I'm walking session or something and I like I just I walk

275
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,640
up to him and I happen to notice just kind of through the window that where they used to be

276
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,160
like a desk with the old neighbor. Now there's like a couch and I'm like, Oh, that's that's

277
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,760
an interesting change. But okay, still no shades guys, you're going to make this like your living

278
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,440
room and no shades. Okay, that's fine. And I go upstairs. And then the other day, the other day,

279
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm thinking to myself, you know what, I don't know who the neighbors are, I should go introduce

280
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,520
myself sometime. I'll do that one of these days. But I'm coming home from something. I think I

281
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,960
just like dropped off Michelle at work or something. And I'm just walking in and I do my little, Oh,

282
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,560
you know, I'm just going to take a peek, see what's going on in there. And I step up on like

283
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,840
their side of the rail. For a good like three, four seconds, I'm standing there gazing directly

284
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,240
into this window, like getting the scene what's going it's like it's the middle of the night.

285
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,440
I know it's probably like 10pm or something. And I'm just standing there looking in at their

286
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,080
like couch and stuff. And then all of a sudden, like the focus of my eyes changes. And I realize

287
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,520
like one foot to the right of what I'm currently looking at, there is a woman sitting there looking

288
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:40,440
directly at me into her home. And I don't know if you guys have seen that vine where the girl

289
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,640
gets spooked by the possum, but I go like that. And I kind of dodge back and dodge downward.

290
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,440
And I run upstairs and hide and just hole up there. And now you can never introduce yourself.

291
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,320
I can never introduce myself. I mean, that's that's the full story. But like, I just knew,

292
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,240
man, that was not good. And I need to now, I need to definitely go give them like a pie or a bottle

293
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,280
of wine and be like, Hey, sorry about that. Just want to say hello. So your problem was

294
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,640
you panicked. You could have played it off as like you weren't actually paying attention.

295
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,280
I should have. I really should have. I okay, to be fair, I'm exaggerating a little bit exactly

296
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,320
how dramatic I kind of just step back quickly and then moved upstairs. But you know, it was it was

297
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,000
not ideal and I was even those subtle things. You've got to just like, just it's very, very

298
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,960
important split decisions happen in those situations. You failed the test, Nate.

299
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,120
That's when I learned what kind of a man I am. And it's a foolish, cowardly, panicky kind of man.

300
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,480
But I'll endeavor to rise above it. If only you were wearing your vampire Hunter D hat,

301
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,480
you could have just tipped it downward, blocked your eyes from view. You would have been safe.

302
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,280
What'd you say, Munchie? I think about the hours you could have spent playing League of Legends

303
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,840
with people and how well those hours would have been spent. And you know what, that's like my

304
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,440
old neighbor who lived down there, we would see he had like a little glass kind of porch that stuck

305
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,040
out like kind of in the middle of the driveway in the backyard. It doesn't matter. But like it's

306
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,000
another kind of like, like unshaded glass thing. There's a table there. I would see him with like

307
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,360
a bunch of, I guess his friends or contemporaries or whatever, gather around, I don't know, maybe once

308
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,640
a month or something and like play some tabletop game. And I don't really like tabletop games that

309
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,160
much. But I was like, I should have said hello to this man and like become, like me and Michelle

310
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,960
could have just gone and been paled around and been friends and stuff. But we never did. And then

311
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,320
he moved away. And I blew it. Don't be like me, everybody. Say hello to your neighbors. Buy like

312
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,760
a $1 fucking piece of bread or pie. Say hello. Give them as a warming present. Be friends.

313
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,080
Hello, Mr. Neighbor. Here's some Wonder Bread I purchased for you. Now, Queen Pieces James

314
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,880
are a slice of Wonder Bread. I would love to use you for your tabletop games, please.

315
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,200
I have one pallet of butter that I will also give you that you make smear on the bread.

316
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,800
Yeah. Unironically do that. Just go be friends and be nice and give gifts to people so then

317
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,640
you they'll like you. Yeah, it's better than being literally just like Stardew Valley. You just go

318
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,800
run around town with like a inventory full of eggs. Just give everyone one, just throw eggs

319
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:21,160
at people. Exactly, Ben. Egg for you. Egg for you. Everyone like egg.

320
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,600
In my experience. Yes, do that. I live in an urban hellscape,

321
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,920
but like the people who live in my house are generally pretty cool, it seems. So like,

322
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,800
get to know your neighbors. I mean, you literally know nothing about them and you've only stared

323
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,000
at them through windows. You remember that I got, you remember the time that I did Molly and then

324
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,840
knocked on my neighbor's door like, why aren't we friends? I mean, see, that's the wrong approach.

325
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,040
What a fucking moron. I also gazing through the window was also the wrong approach,

326
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,240
but there are good approaches to this sort of thing. If I had done what I did on some other day

327
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,880
and brought like a pie, then that would be fine. You'd make a friend for life. Everybody in the

328
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,200
voicemails are trying to ask us for advice on how to interact with like women or people in general.

329
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,720
Remember, this is the caliber of people you're talking to. Learn from our mistakes. This is what

330
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,400
we struggle with. Learn from our mistakes. This is, this is all fine. This is all fine.

331
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,280
What is this interest in brotherly love? I feel like this is like, I don't even, like,

332
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,000
this is so, people are not going to be able to relate to this because I think it's very

333
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,520
strange scenario to have your neighbors be someone you want to interact with in the modern world.

334
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,320
That's because the modern world is full of pussy ass, dumb ass, motherfucking bitches who think that

335
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,920
they can replace every relationship in their real life with like retarded online friendships

336
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,080
like this one I have with you guys. But really, you should actually get to know the people in

337
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,720
your immediate vicinity at least a little bit because it'll make your life, like I was saying,

338
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,640
I live in an urban hellscape and I don't know anyone and they're all scary potential murderers

339
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,960
or rapists on me. I mean, when Bernie Sanders gets elected and they institute the gulags and

340
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,800
come to take our guns away, like these are the people you're going to have to be like forming

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,320
a blockade on the street with to fight back against the federal government. Exactly. Exactly.

342
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,080
You better get those alliances sorted out now. It's funny you mentioned Tabletop because I started

343
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,840
playing D&D with one of my friends that I, from high school, he hit me up just like,

344
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,280
hey, I'm starting a D&D group because we've tried playing a couple times and I've really

345
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,040
panned out, but this time we've been going a couple of weeks and that's good. It gets me out of the

346
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,680
house and I'm like meeting people. But the weird thing is that like, he's like, all the people

347
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,880
we're playing with, they all are his work friends. So they're all just like talking about like,

348
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,800
isn't it crappy working for Comcast? And I'm just like, I don't understand any of this. And I feel

349
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,120
very odd. I think that more than anything else is that when, you know, the only people you can

350
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,280
potentially talk to all know each other on some level, such that the conversation is like,

351
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,480
almost 100%. Hey, do you remember that time where we did that thing? Oh yeah, let's talk about that

352
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,240
for 20 minutes. I don't have anything to say about these things. You gotta press through it.

353
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,800
These things can all be overcome with a little bit of grit. Oh, absolutely. I'm not like saying

354
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,960
it's like a total loss or anything. So I'm still going. I'm still having good time. But the problem

355
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,880
is just like, the vibes, you don't know what the vibes are. It's like, can I say retarded?

356
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,600
Because I will the character. That's every fucking day for me, Tom. That's literally every

357
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,040
conversation I have is I have to gauge, can I say retarded? And I wanted to make him like an

358
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:22,680
autistic retard. But nobody, I don't know the social cues. I don't know. Because my friend

359
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,320
is like a fucking like shit poster kind of guy who just like whatever. But like these people,

360
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,720
it's like, it's like his friend from work and his friend's wife. And I'm just like,

361
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,320
I don't know who any of you are. And I'm very afraid of being. You just, you just gotta swing

362
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,720
up in the door and say the n word. Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right. I gotta lay

363
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,920
down the baseline. It's true. It's true. What was I thinking? For real, like you gotta just like

364
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,440
say the things that you want to say, because all right, here are the two options for you.

365
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,600
Either be a little pussy bitch and don't say the things you want and get nothing out of the

366
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,320
relationship or say what you want and put them potentially hate you. And it doesn't even matter

367
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,440
because the, it's just where you're right back where you started. It doesn't even matter. It's

368
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,000
true. It's true. Losing these people as potential friends would not affect me in any way because

369
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,560
I don't care. It was like, it was like that legendary moment when I referred to PewDiePie

370
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:19,320
in my group of work friends as my nigga. And then their faces all fell and the total atmosphere

371
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,160
turned to mud right in front of me. And I learned what their boundary was. That's when I learned.

372
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,240
People in real life, they're not even fucking cool. You can't curate them. They're literally

373
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,760
pointless. All this shit about neighbors, all this shit about mean people. It's all stupid.

374
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,080
I mean, I don't need to go into why that I was really using that in a positive way. There was no,

375
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,600
yeah, I mean, you know what sucks like in situations like that though is that one or two

376
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,000
of them may have been okay with it, but they don't want to laugh along with you. Exactly.

377
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,560
Exactly. It's all fake. That is true. Everyone's fake. That's why you got to wait for after,

378
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,360
after that exchange, you know, in the cover of night on my work, you know, chat,

379
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,040
bot or whatever, I just get the word, just like the N word, just N word response from like one

380
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,480
of the co-workers who's trying to operate below enemy lines, behind enemy lines and, you know.

381
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,200
You just got to keep an eye on the one co-worker who just flashes through the okay sign and you

382
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,440
know that he's a fellow white supremacist. We found each other. Yes. Based. Now that's,

383
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,120
that's the good shit right there. Listen, there are so many people around you as a human being

384
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,640
and basically none of them matter to you. That doesn't mean that they're bad people. It doesn't mean

385
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,880
that they are NPCs that you have to mow down and get the extra high score with. It doesn't mean that

386
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,920
you have to sacrifice them for fuel and turn them into charcoal, but it does mean that like on the

387
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:45,720
internet, you can Google search group for spreading aids, get some bug catchers going on. It's great.

388
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,640
They call it the bug, bug, spreading. Bug chaser, bug chaser or whatever. Bug chasing,

389
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,720
that's the one. And that's great because you can now curate who you want to talk to. And you know,

390
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,760
of course, internet relationship is never going to be as full bodies, as robust as a real life

391
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,600
friendship, but it's better than real life friendships because most of them are born out

392
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,440
of convenience and most of the people you meet in real life suck because they aren't like you.

393
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,200
You want a good balance. You want a good balance of the people who you go with online.

394
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,080
My goal right now is to get more real life interactions. Now that I am able to walk and

395
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,720
move around again, I'm going to go out there and find people.

396
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,480
Tom, just get a fucking job, you idiot. Get a job. No, no, no, come on here.

397
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,320
They're going to look through my Twitter history and I'm never going to get hired anywhere. Are

398
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,680
you kidding me? Once in a while, once in a while, I do wonder if like, what if I just walk down the

399
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,000
street to like Whole Foods and was like, yeah, just let me be a cashier. Bro, they will do it

400
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
instantly and you will get $15 an hour. It is a good job. Like more just for something to do.

401
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm absolute. I have been looking for jobs unironically, but I just hate the idea. It feels

402
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,360
disgusting. It's not disgusting because then you can actually do what you want and you won't have

403
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,280
to turn your art into a commodity to sell. That's the only thing I was just talking about.

404
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,800
Literally the only reason that I'm even considering it is that I'm so sick of trying and

405
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,000
found to be marketable. I hate it with all my soul. Right now, the grass sure looks greener

406
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,560
on the side of having a job to earn money and then just doing your art separately.

407
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,000
The real question is, the question really boils down to who do I want to be a slave to,

408
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,680
the public or the boss? Because that's really the only options.

409
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,080
I mean, right now, nothing in my life is sacred. When I was, you know, part-time YouTuber,

410
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:34,840
the YouTubing was mostly sacred except for what I like owed to my patrons. But you can just,

411
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,320
you know, Darth Vader, I have changed the deal. Pray I do not alter it further, you know, whatever

412
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,440
the fuck it is. And with your, you can renegotiate at any time with your patrons and they can just

413
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,920
leave. So, but unless you're depending on that income to survive, which certainly changes your

414
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,200
priorities and whatnot. So I mean, well, one day, these days, I may or may not go back to having

415
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,320
a full-time job, but I heavily encourage anybody who's like having a tough time reaching their

416
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,920
financial goals to have a job and then do their art stuff on the side. I think the biggest problem

417
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,640
with getting a job would be almost all jobs require you working on weekends, which means I lose all

418
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,280
my PCP money, in which case I only probably end up making like an extra $200 or something.

419
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,400
Well, that's not nothing, though. Well, surely there's going to be some job that leaves, you know,

420
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,720
Sundays at this time free. I mean, one could negotiate that, I would think.

421
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,880
I'm going to get a job, a stack and shit. I'm going to get a job going out into the world and

422
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,880
finding a bunch of crap and I'm going to stack it real high, real tall. I'm going to say,

423
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,600
please pay me and then I'm going to stack some more shit and I'm going to get cars and stack those.

424
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,640
They say make the job that you want, right? So just go out there and stack stuff, guys.

425
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm going to stack some shit. I'm going to stack some shit and then the mother is like,

426
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,400
why are you stacking my children? You're like, I love to stack, please give me a $50.

427
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm acquiring skills, guys. No, you say to them in a completely serious voice, give me 15 quid.

428
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:15,560
Give me some quid. I still don't understand British currency. It's like pints and quid and

429
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,680
pints, there's quid, there's 5s, 10s, 10s. Bob's.

430
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:29,000
10 Bob is like a word and you use it to refer to. This is why we fucking threw your tea in the

431
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,760
ocean. Hey, can I have some 25 schmlorp, please? Can you just define for me a quid and a pence?

432
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:42,440
A quid is a quarter. No, a quid is a fucking pound. A pound is a $50 note.

433
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,000
No, no, no, no, a quid is a fan. A quid is a fan. A pence is a pound.

434
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Shut up, god damn it. You're not helping. All right, here's the easy way.

435
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm ready to learn. A pence is a scent. Yes. They sound similar. They're the same thing. 100 of

436
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,600
them makes a pound or a quid. Five quid, five Bob note is usually to refer to the note. I don't

437
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,880
know what Bob comes from. Bob's your uncle, probably. A five quid is a five Bob note.

438
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:24,760
Five pound note is for us a buck. And hippo, how many aspects of a shield can constitutes a quid?

439
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,360
How many shield parts do you get? Like does it take? Isn't there only one part to a shield?

440
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,160
No, there's very many parts to a shield. You have to assume the shield. It's five of something.

441
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:44,280
The coins, the British coins have at some point in history, they started doing a thing where

442
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,320
they have some section of a shield. And if you arrange the coins, they make a full shield image.

443
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,400
I don't know how many there are. I think it's just all of the coins have a bit of it.

444
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:03,480
Huh. That's not how we say it. That's not how we say it.

445
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,880
Munchies English accent, just perfect. Just flawless.

446
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,600
Hey, speaking of cultural sensitivity, we can't keep changing topics. We can't just keep, oh,

447
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,520
I say something. Okay, that's cool. All right, next topic. We can't just like pivot back and

448
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,040
forth. There's no conversation here. Wait, shut the fuck up. No, here, I have to say something.

449
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,480
All right, I'm going to make an argument for interacting with society, not because society

450
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,320
is good, but specifically because society is bad, but you're opposed if you think society is bad

451
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,760
because you haven't engaged with society yet. So, you know, oh, smash cut to me back in 1908.

452
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,400
And I was hanging out, you know, I was playing video games and I thought,

453
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,600
being a normie sure is like bad. I sure was told that by someone at some point in my life.

454
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,040
Hey, can you pass the fucking loop? Can you pass the fucking anal beads? Bro, I need my kick.

455
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,040
And so I've come here. I've ventured out into the land of the real world, many, you know, for a while

456
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,640
now. I'm still doing it. I'm on the golden road. I'm on the golden ratio right now. And now I have

457
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,360
such a clarity of mind. I'm in like a Buddhist, like monk state right now. And I can finally

458
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:11,480
understand like, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. Normies are bad, but I have actual

459
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,560
reasons to believe it now. Like I have actual like experiences and I can actually, you know,

460
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,640
give arguments and I can actually understand why people say that in the first place.

461
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm not building a pond because like, you know, I've only been the internet. I'm like,

462
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,160
the reason I hate normies is because I'm literally too anxious. I'm too anxious to go outside and

463
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,240
fucking talk to them because I'm a baby bitch. And I was told to hate them by people on YouTube

464
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,920
that I follow. And it's just, it just shows like a lack of moral character and lacks,

465
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,960
it shows a lack of convention because you're pairing what other people are saying. And you're

466
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,640
too anxious inside. By the way, if you have anxiety, I fucking hate you by the way. You

467
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,520
literally are like not trying hard enough. And you're only saying that you hate normies out of

468
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,040
fear. But once you actually, you know, interact with society, once you have a job or once you

469
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,000
go to school and once you're interacting with people in real life, then you will have the

470
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,640
legit ass opinion that normies are shit, but comma and space afterward.

471
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,200
That's fair. I mean, you shouldn't judge something to leave experience.

472
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,520
Speaking of real life, cool experiences. The, if you remember, I talked to a while ago about

473
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,720
the, the mission to walk in a straight line across the country of Wales, where that guy

474
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,360
with a GoPro on his head did that. Then he went back to making fucking

475
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,680
GeoGuessor videos, which sucked. And it was like, damn. But recently he has come back with an

476
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:31,960
incredible new and different adventure. He and his friend decided to try and get all the way

477
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:39,960
across Europe without using money to pay for transportation. And they would try to use as

478
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,360
many different modes of transportation as possible and talk to people to like, you know,

479
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,600
black their way through things and, and stuff like that. And he's got the whole series and it's

480
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,800
finished. And the doable, it sounds like a very doable thing to me. It's, it's a very doable

481
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,960
thing, but it's really doesn't, doesn't not spending money basically limit you to walking.

482
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:05,160
No, no, no. You can hitchhike people and like the things include sneaking onto trains and then

483
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,680
avoiding the ticket man hitchhiking. But I did that a bunch of times. They got some subscribers

484
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,840
to get them some kayaks and bikes for various portions of the trip. And a lot of wait, so

485
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,720
they can let other people buy them stuff. Well, I guess not buy them stuff. But like the point is,

486
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,560
I mean, it's worth it because kayaking is fun. Yeah, they went like through like this river

487
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,800
near the Alps and through Italy on these kayaks. And it was so cool. And, you know,

488
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,000
they would, they would slip on the land and eat off the land. And, you know, it was all very,

489
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,680
very interesting. And a lot of the cool interactions they had with random Europeans

490
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,560
was like some of the coolest and heartwarming stuff ever. It's, it, it made me realize that

491
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,000
as long as you are, you know, confident and nice, you can get people to do things for you.

492
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,240
We hear a lot of shit about how fucked up the world is, which is true.

493
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,720
Most people are good people and will just kind of be nice to you if you're nice to them. I

494
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,680
firmly believe this about the world. So I definitely recommend that whole series. It's very,

495
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,840
very good. But Gabe, I was just curious, what's the start and end point? Where did they start and

496
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:24,200
where did they end? Yeah, they started like Portugal and they go to like Russia, Ukraine or

497
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:33,000
Europe. It's like from, oh, what country is it? It's, I think, through either France or Italy.

498
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,320
I think it was near the Alps. They started somewhere there. But they got all the way over to

499
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,080
Bretislava in fucking, I can't remember the country's name, but Bretislava is a place.

500
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,920
Lithuanian or sometimes like, somewhere to the fucking east.

501
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,240
So it sounds like they were going south to north.

502
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,640
No, they were going sort of west to east-ish. I can't remember exactly.

503
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,280
Why would you start in Italy then? I don't fucking remember.

504
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,680
Because they're gay. They started in Portugal, those cows.

505
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,880
Yeah, it would be obvious.

506
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,480
Italy goes all the way up to the Alps. Maybe they started in Sicily or one of those,

507
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,160
you know, places down there, Florence or something. It would be very hard to start from Europe,

508
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,920
west to east, and start in Italy.

509
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,400
All right, whatever. I don't remember the actual country, but it doesn't matter.

510
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,440
It's a bad video, Gib. It's actually bad. That's the point.

511
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,200
The things that happen are really cool. And on the note of that, there's this other YouTuber,

512
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,760
I should find the, I can't remember his name at the moment, but he does train hopping videos.

513
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,280
Maybe I talked about this before. But basically, he is like the same sort of thing.

514
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,280
He's got a GoPro, but he's a complete criminal and he's got his face colored.

515
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:54,280
And basically, he goes on freight trains and hides inside them and knows how to illegally hop

516
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,480
on trains and avoid guards and he films it all. And there's such a freedom sort of

517
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,440
feeling you get from those. Because he has this hammock that he has to sleep in. He just finds,

518
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,040
like he climbs on top of a roof and hopes that nobody comes to see him. Because it's like,

519
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,080
nobody's going to go up there. So he just goes up on a roof and he makes a bed with a sleeping

520
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,200
bag. And then he goes back on the next train. He's trying to figure out which trains are going

521
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,720
what direction. And he's like, hops on the right train, avoids the guards. And then when the train

522
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,440
is in motion, he just climbs up the top because they have the little metal ladders. And he just

523
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,240
sort of surfs the train. He's got a GoPro on a stick and he's just sort of looking at the

524
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,920
beautiful scenery in the sunset. And he's just got the wind in his hair. And it's like the coolest

525
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,840
thing ever. What a life. Being free is really fucking epic, I think. You know what hippo,

526
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,520
that reminds me of a very liberating sort of feeling when you're in the physical world and

527
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:04,520
you are kinetically moving around the world. It's a very like, it's a revolution inside your

528
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,160
brain when you realize that you can jaywalk. And I don't mean jaywalking literally, although I do

529
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,120
mean jaywalking spiritually. When you realize that the rules and customs that you have been told

530
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:22,120
to abide by, you can just break them all the time and it doesn't matter. Bro, that's the main thing

531
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,240
that keeps when I was a shy young boy afraid to talk to girls, which it is still terrifying to do

532
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,040
to this day, no doubt about it. Like that right there, that social conditioning that like it's

533
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,640
not okay to just like say hello to someone was so beat into my brain, maybe entirely due to my own

534
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,800
retarded ass thinking and just watching anime all day. But then when I realized like, oh, it's

535
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,040
actually okay to do that and like say hello to people or whatever. Bit of a revolution, a bit

536
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:55,880
of a mind change. You can basically do like so much more than what people think is possible. Like

537
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,880
they have like very like hard ingrained like paths in front of them that they feel like they have

538
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,680
to abide by. But you can get away with like a bunch of like, I don't know, like illegal, literally

539
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:15,080
and socially things. Me and Ben held a slime protest. And I know there was a few people

540
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,640
that like not at the con, but I talked about it with some of my friends and they were like,

541
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,840
uh, are you sure? Don't you need like a permit? Oh, god, yeah, absolute the absolute cowardice of

542
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,600
some people that are like, oh, you're gonna get you're gonna get in trouble. You're gonna get in

543
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:37,400
trouble if you organize more than like 10 people in this like public park and like make some noise

544
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,640
during the day. People, as long as you don't cause problems, like things work out. Even if you do

545
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,720
post problems. I'm always, I'm always saying sorry I didn't realize. You should apply for a permit

546
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,440
before you do, before you publicly assemble anywhere public. What's that old saying they say?

547
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,720
It's always better to apologize than to like. It's ask for forgiveness, not for permission.

548
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,040
That's the one. That's the one. Yep. Better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission. It reminds

549
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:07,480
me of a time where I accidentally got myself into a situation that was illegal, but I was not in the

550
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,800
right mind frame to like deal with it. I thought I was going to die. I thought the police were going

551
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,160
to kill me. Um, it was just that I got onto a train and I didn't realize that I didn't swipe my,

552
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,920
my, my, uh, my ticket. Yeah. Yeah. Like I didn't, I didn't swipe the, the beep thing. And then I was

553
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,120
like, wait a minute. That's me every day. Wait a minute. When I get to the other end, when I get

554
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,480
to the other end of this train, I'm gonna have to swipe the thing to open the gate and they're

555
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,920
going to know that I didn't get on the train. They're going to fucking tackle me at the other end.

556
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,480
But like, uh, it doesn't matter because. Yeah, they just don't really care.

557
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,600
Like I did the, I pressed the thing and it's like, oh, it doesn't work.

558
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,040
And then this guy just opened it for me. It's like, there you go.

559
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:52,440
Law. There's an, there's an episode of, um, I think you say at Le Las Gare, the French cartoon

560
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,360
where the guy, a guy just hops the style or the till or whatever at the, at the subway station.

561
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,560
And the fucking like train bouncers like descend on him. And he decides that a way to get away

562
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,280
with it is to pretend that he's an American tourist who only speaks English. He's like, uh,

563
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,520
I saw the officer is first time I do it. And I think he gets his ass kicked. But my experience

564
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,280
is that nobody gives a shit. And even if you just openly run through the thing behind someone else

565
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,600
and don't swipe your card and are clearly just cheating the system, the worst that will happen

566
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,480
is like a guy in a T-jack. It will be like, sir, you get, you swipe your card, please.

567
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,240
Oh yeah, that happened that fucking last time we were in Boston. It might.

568
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,120
Oh yeah. It might genuinely white privilege that I might only get such mild responses

569
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,280
because I'm white and I look like a nerd. Perhaps. We tried to go through the thing like

570
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,440
in the ticket of the train where you do the thing and then a bunch of people run through

571
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,360
while it's open. And then the guy saw it and it's like, uh, could you, could you not do that?

572
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,680
But like nothing happens. Happens, you know? Yeah, no, nothing. Like, like he never drops.

573
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,440
People are scared of getting in trouble way too much. I think it might be brainwashing.

574
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,200
It's by design. It's by design, of course. I'm pretty like 99% sure it's like actual

575
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,560
like dumb brainwashing. Fear is what keeps the majority of society running.

576
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,480
Dude, I am always, I always watch like, you know, crime shows or whatever. And I'm like

577
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,240
amazed every time that I see like people do things like, like commit like armed robbery.

578
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Look, I know these things are exaggerated to some degree and like, like do actual like,

579
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,680
I don't know, be drug traffickers. And then they're like out on bail and just like are allowed to

580
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,000
continue their lives. Look, not for the extreme stuff, I know, but like generally speaking,

581
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,280
you'll like be fine in a while. If you're a first time offender, you'll like be fine. If you do

582
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,840
most things. I mean, it takes money. Yeah, money, which can be a problem for you. But like, yeah,

583
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,480
it doesn't end your life. And that's, we were definitely taught to like what they say that

584
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,520
like the middle of the, like the poor exists to create fear in the middle class to like,

585
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,200
you know, to sustain the upper class, they say or whatever. And then like, it's the same with

586
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,080
like criminals, like the hardcore crime and jails, whatever, like exist to scare people straight.

587
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,000
So that they're like terrified, like a fucking Tom in the boondocks scared of getting annually

588
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,520
raped in jail. I mean, he's the perfect example of like, that's a legit fear. Okay, sure. Sure.

589
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,120
Says Tom, I mean, from the boondocks, what if it's, what if it feels good? What if you like it?

590
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,840
What if you turn gay in his soul? I identified very strongly with that scene. Okay.

591
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,040
That is another Tom. That is, you know, I do too. I do too. But you know, speaking of like,

592
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:28,280
absolute, like small brained, like peanut, like regressed in the mind, childlike thinking idiots,

593
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:36,840
my girlfriend, Michelle is absolutely terrified of jaywalking. Because in Hawaii, yeah, because in

594
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,920
Hawaii, jaywalking is like considered, I guess I can't blame her, like an actual serious crime,

595
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,720
sort of like they actually prosecute people who jaywalk. In Boston, you're just expected to.

596
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,800
Yeah, no, that's the thing. I mean, I've been to New York and Boston, Philly and all over the

597
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,040
fucking place. And like, I jaywalk 24 seven, 365 and nobody gives a shit. But I guess in Hawaii,

598
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,320
they're like anti-curtle touchings for some reason, I still don't understand why. You get

599
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,200
arrested in Boston for not jaywalking because you're holding up foot traffic. It's because the

600
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,040
traffic in Hawaii is so bad because island, et cetera, et cetera, that like they really

601
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,760
take traffic violation seriously, I guess. I guess like LA or something. Ridiculous. But I mean,

602
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:20,280
Jesus Christ, her poor brain has been absolutely destroyed by fear of jaywalking. And she could

603
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,200
definitely get away with it most of the time. And I try, what I'm trying to say is long story

604
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,360
short, all this commit crimes. I'm telling you to commit crimes. I'm at the point where I'm starting,

605
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm at the point where I'm starting to wondering, is shoplifting really illegal? Like is it really?

606
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,120
Ben does it every single fucking day. Ben shoplifts every single fucking day.

607
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,760
You can literally. Well, here's the thing. This is what made me start thinking about this. I was

608
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,720
at Best Buy a few days ago and like they had like all the video games, right? And all the games are

609
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,200
like in like these fucking theft proof containers and everything. Then they had the bargain bin,

610
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,640
where it's just like a bunch of games just in plastic wrap. I'm like, are they just telling

611
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,280
me it's okay to take these ones? Do they just want them gone? And I just take a copy of Monster

612
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,760
Hunter World and just bail. Here's your homework for next week. Tom,

613
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,040
I'm literally going to tell you what you have to do. Ask this recording, go to Best Buy,

614
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,600
pick up a video game, walk out of the store. Like just start running, just fucking run out of the

615
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,240
store. They're not allowed to chase you. Wait, hold on. Video games have like the little metal

616
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:24,600
tag in them that sometimes the sensors detect. Well, that's the whole thing. And the bargain bin

617
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:30,040
ones, it's just plastic wrap. And that's why I'm just like, are these like the okay to steal ones?

618
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:35,160
That's how I'm interpreting it right now. You know me boys and girls. I am, in fact,

619
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:42,840
actually a straight edge. But like jaywalking is actually a victimless crime, 99% of the time.

620
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,680
The thing about shop, well, Nate, so is like not wearing your seat belt, but that's illegal.

621
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,920
Okay, true. True. Are we divided each individually? I don't know. I mean, if the law on the book,

622
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:01,240
if like draconian enforcement of traffic laws like leads to like significantly reduced like

623
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:08,520
death tolls or whatever, then like, I'd support it. Here's the thing about shoplifting,

624
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,360
like imagine that you are a minimum wage fucking work or you're any fucking drone working the

625
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:21,240
floor of a supermarket or something. And you see someone like pocket something and walk out the door

626
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,920
with it. What are you going to do? Are you going to run after that person like sir, sir,

627
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,080
you need to stop sir. And then when they don't fucking tackle them and risk your life and limb

628
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,320
to defend your employer's property. No, of course, no, no, no, no, give a shit. I mean, maybe it

629
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,520
depends. If you're in fucking Texas, maybe they have different state laws, like I don't know. But

630
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,240
I worked in Massachusetts at a Best Buy. I knew the security guys, I will tell you what they do.

631
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:50,840
First of all, they are not allowed to even attempt to stop you in any way. They maybe would speak

632
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,480
to you or maybe say like, please don't leave. You would have to be like a police officer to have

633
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,160
that like that thing that calling the cops is the most they can do. So if you're just letting

634
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,720
you know, you can definitely be out of there. But here's the thing, if you come back later,

635
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,880
they will like call the cops if you show up again. So you got to live your life on the road.

636
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,440
That's what you got to do if you want to live this way. I got my $20 copy of Monster Hunter

637
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,200
World for free. It was all worth it. Right, right. Today, I went on a school project.

638
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,160
Well, I wanted us out of the house and I was researching architecture.

639
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,080
Don't move on. I just wanted to say a quick jaywalking thing that was funny while it was

640
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:35,320
relevant that sometimes like when it's quiet, the roads are quiet. I realized that I don't have to

641
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,040
walk on one side of you know, on the pavement and then cross over to the other side if I need to. I

642
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,600
can walk straight down the middle of the road all the way down. And when I do that, I suddenly

643
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,560
like things like buildings, they start feeling like platforms. I start feeling like I can jump

644
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,120
over them and I can climb all over them and I become like, this is just a 3D model. This is

645
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:59,080
all just fake and I can jump and do all this cool shit. You're literally a god when you do that.

646
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,200
You activated the god mode. When it was snowy, I would walk in the middle of the road because

647
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,600
like tire tracks would have like cleared more of the snow out of the way. So I would like have less

648
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,240
snow to walk through. No, there's like genuinely like a state of mind that you enter. At least

649
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,440
I feel this way. I remember very distinctly when I came into being and I was in school and I was

650
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,120
walking in class and I thought to myself, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. I'm supposed

651
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,200
to go to class right now. That's what my body is like telling me. My mind is telling me I need to do.

652
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:31,960
But like I could just not. Like I could just like leave. I could just leave the campus right now.

653
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:38,200
And it was like, people don't think their body is their own. People think the way things are right

654
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,560
now. How about when you get to college, the reality says when you get to college and it's like,

655
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:47,800
wait, wait, I don't have to ask for permission to go to the bathroom anymore. What? Maybe Munchie,

656
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,680
since you did whatever it was, the weird school for retards and idiots as I understand it.

657
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:58,040
Dude, wait. Wait, what? I did what now? No, I said Munchie. Didn't I say Munchie? I meant to say

658
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,520
yeah, whatever it was. Nate, this is a quick aside. We're going to get back to the topic,

659
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,080
but I just want to say that you reminded me, as I was saying before, I was reading a history of

660
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:13,000
Boston, so you say Boston. And in that, there was a great little excerpt. Apparently, one of the

661
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,120
first schools for the disabled in United States of America, its name was the Massachusetts School

662
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:26,760
for the Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Uds. I mean, in the olden days, that was-

663
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,240
Xavier's rebranding was very interesting. Munchie, I was walking-

664
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,480
I want to be enlisted. Let me in. I was walking back to the food court or whatever,

665
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,640
because I'd left my bag and there's a building that I crossed that's called the Normal School.

666
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,680
Yeah, Boston Normal School, yep. Yeah, so I guess that's the opposite. That's like for the really

667
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,280
big brain kids is the Normal School. Yeah, and then you have the Idiotic and Feeble-Minded

668
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:55,240
Youth School. Sponsored by the Procrastinator's podcast. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But people

669
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,480
don't think their body and their mind is their own. People think that the way that the society is

670
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:05,800
right now is the only way that it can be. People have such an unimaginative, smooth brain approach

671
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,600
to critical thinking. But it's by design. I don't blame anyone for that. You've been conditioned

672
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:17,800
from birth to live in these lanes. Human life is conditioned to settle into a groove of life

673
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,840
that you come across. That just seems to be how the human brain works. And it's less energy to

674
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,360
do your routine as opposed to trying to mix things up. So it's understandable why you

675
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,840
fall into grooves, but you should always remember that you can change things up and do things

676
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:36,760
differently. I think one of the earliest times I realized crime is okay. This is not to get

677
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,800
political or anything, but this is how I feel every time I see someone saying that free college

678
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,200
and free healthcare is socialism. I understand, I understand. We only think that because we don't

679
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,280
already do them. If we already did those things, like with fire departments or public school,

680
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,040
you wouldn't have a problem with them. You would just think it's normal. It's just an

681
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,600
accident of history and circumstances that people feel like they'd need to rail against that kind

682
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,560
of thing. I want to brush up on that too, just because it's a very easy way to illustrate it.

683
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:11,320
But this goes to every single fucking aspect of human endeavor, where it's like some people think

684
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:19,240
that capitalism is one thing. It is one institution that, if implemented, is the same across all

685
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:27,480
countries. When things like that, capitalism doesn't exist in a concrete way. It represents

686
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,600
itself through policies and theories that are different in every single region and any place

687
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,280
that it is implemented in. People don't realize that things can be slightly different or you can

688
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:47,640
improve upon things in any way. All of how life is, it was made by other humans and it is all

689
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:53,400
the result of thousands of years of discussion. Capitalism can be taken away at any time if you

690
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:01,160
cross us. Literally exactly. Capitalism is not natural in the sense that this is just the way

691
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:07,560
that human beings have evolved naturally. It is the result of theories, the result of discussion,

692
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,720
it is the result of countless upon countless iterations of designs. People seem to think

693
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,960
that America, the countries that exist now, the systems that exist now, will simply exist in

694
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,680
perpetuity. And there's a natural state about it. Obviously, the United States exists. Obviously,

695
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,240
capitalism exists. Obviously, these are the ways that we do things because this is how they've

696
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:36,520
been since I was born. But even if you go double your lifetime back, things will start radically

697
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:41,480
getting different because the world is always changing. This is what I was saying at my first

698
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,760
point in this podcast. I don't know how to say it because I said it in a really obtuse way.

699
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:50,920
But it's like these sorts of things. Nothing is ever natural. Nothing is ever how it's supposed

700
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:57,160
to be. It's all just the result of circumstance and upon discussion and theory and evolution.

701
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,040
And this is the sort of thing where it's like people getting their little mind cage, their

702
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,320
neoliberal mind cage to quote Ben's lyric from under the city.

703
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:11,240
Dab, right. Neath the city is what the song is called, but close enough.

704
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,400
They don't understand that things can be different. And again, this is not just for

705
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,240
politics. This is just for, again, crossing the fucking road in the middle of the street,

706
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,000
in the middle of the road, instead of going to the pre-determined spots where you're supposed

707
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,280
to do it. Oh, I do that because that's what the lies. And there are these signs on the ground

708
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,440
that lead me to do that. That's what I'm told I'm supposed to do.

709
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,160
You're right. You're right. And the point is fuck cops do crime.

710
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:44,840
Yeah. Dare to dream, ladies and gentlemen, dare to dream of a McNook in every backyard and a slave

711
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:51,080
child harem to every man, to every property owning in my anarcho capitalist future that we

712
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,760
are heading towards one step at a time. Dare to dream. Dare to dream.

713
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,800
It's going to be great. People need to realize that like,

714
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:03,560
no, go ahead and hit me. I was going to say the first time I realized that crime was okay

715
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:13,160
was when I learned of the TV license that you're supposed to pay to make the BBC run.

716
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,920
And everyone I've ever talked to, old and young, has never, ever said they pay it.

717
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:25,480
Because there's no way to enforce it because the BBC is not the government exactly.

718
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,600
And they don't, they can't have a warrant to go into your house. And even if they know that

719
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,400
you're watching TV, they can't really do anything. There was this video I watched where this guy

720
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:40,520
explained the ways the BBC has tried to scare people into paying it because they can't actually

721
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:46,760
do anything to enforce this rule. And they said back in the 50s that they had this van

722
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,840
that would drive around with a television detecting like antenna. And it could tell

723
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,560
when, what channel you're watching and where, in what room. And then they would come to your

724
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:04,360
front door and say, Hey, you, you're watching TV without a license. And people like believed it

725
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,320
because they didn't realize the technology is impossible and cannot exist, especially in the

726
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:17,160
fucking 50s. And there has never been, like the BBC has kept up the life forever, even though

727
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,080
it's completely obvious to everyone that they don't have these things. Nobody's ever seen them.

728
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,200
Nobody's ever been convicted using one. It's just like a blatant scare tactic, but they have to,

729
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:33,080
they have to keep it up because nobody fucking pays the thing. Old, old people do, I think.

730
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,080
They probably do because they don't know any better. But like, have you guys seen

731
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,720
those videos on YouTube? There's a million of them of like, like, Professor confronts

732
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:47,960
entire classroom, who like one of them like stole the test answers. And like, he's chewing out the

733
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,200
whole room. And he's like, if you don't turn that in, that computer actually had like state

734
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,000
secrets on it, you could be serving 20 to life. If you don't confess to me, like these are real

735
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,440
things that were said. And what I like, this is a popular video. It's like a professor who's like

736
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,120
working with the government or something on some contracts, his laptop was stolen or something.

737
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,640
He had like the test answers, which is probably why they took it. But he's like, it also has,

738
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,040
you know, state secrets. And he's like laying on this case that like, if you don't turn it in,

739
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,760
like first of all, we're changing the test. So those answers you had, they're useless. Second of

740
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,560
all, you know, you'll go to jail if you don't turn in the computer. I'm the only one on the planet

741
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:29,800
who can help you, blah, blah, blah. I just feel like they're lying. And what I want to see is a

742
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:35,560
follow up video of how no one came forward and nothing bad happened to anyone. Not that I support

743
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,120
crime. I don't like crime of people stealing stuff. I'm against that. But what I also hate are these

744
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:45,240
overly self righteous displays about like, Oh, you're all, I'm going to scare the whole class.

745
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,440
You guys are so bad. The American everybody feel bad for like a couple of people doing some fucked

746
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:56,760
up shit. And I don't know, I like people who are acting tough to get slapped down. It amuses me

747
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,480
greatly. And I would love to see that some follow ups where nothing bad happened to anyone. And it

748
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:07,960
was totally fine. Last semester, I sometimes crime is good. I had an auditorium class and

749
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:14,200
apparently there had been issues taking attendance the previous year. And so instead of tapping

750
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:19,320
your badge on the door, like you were supposed to and the building was designed for people are

751
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:23,560
just tapping their badge and then like leaving like they weren't going to class. Sure. And so

752
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:31,640
the teacher lied to us. Yeah, I didn't lie that no one believed and was not effectual at all.

753
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:37,000
But it was so outrageous that I was funny. So what so he explained to us the first day, like,

754
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,720
you know, that doesn't work. You don't tap your badge. What happens is every single day that you

755
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:49,000
come in here, there is a photo taken of the class. And we have a team of volunteer students who go

756
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,280
through that photo and count each face individually to make sure that you were here every day.

757
01:04:54,280 --> 01:05:01,160
Did he say where the camera was? No, he didn't. He didn't. He did not. Okay. And he said that in

758
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:07,000
order to get your face in the system, because I guess it was AI like helped, you had to send

759
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,960
him a photo of your face head on. And no one did that. And it didn't matter. And it just

760
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:20,760
resulted to like a piece of white paper being passed around every class with your yeah. Yeah.

761
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:26,360
I mean, when it comes to college, the system that should be done is you don't have to show up to

762
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,960
class. But if you fail the test, you fail the test and fuck you. That's your problem. Yeah,

763
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,080
that's that's the system that should be done. You know, my school specifically is very,

764
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,280
very handholdy. And in fact, you know, just just before you go in further that I think

765
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,840
not only should that be the system, I think attendance should be held against the professor,

766
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,960
because if a bunch of people aren't in your class and they still pass,

767
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,480
you are irrelevant and they're paying you for nothing. I guess that's true.

768
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:59,320
Okay, I, I almost have like a weird opinion of this where it's like, I think that you basically

769
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,680
should be able to like be free to do like whatever you want. In the sense that it's like, there are

770
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,840
like, you know, if you if you miss these couple classes, you fail the class if you did. Okay,

771
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,080
yeah, okay, it makes sense. I understand why they do it. But on some level, I think like, okay,

772
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,560
the point of college is that it's like a service that you are paying for and you get things out of

773
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,720
it. So like if you just skip class, like why would you penalize that person? Because they're

774
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,720
already being penalized by wasting a lot of money and not getting anything from it. I'll tell you

775
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,640
why the answer to that is because college has been watered down and they now are officially

776
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,800
recognizing it as a kindergarten where they're forcing you to actually give a shit when actually

777
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:38,760
nobody of those people don't actually give a shit. Yeah, the real university is in the YouTube

778
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:44,760
tutorials now. It's literally true because that's where all information lies and everything you

779
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,520
need to be successful as a human being pretty much. Yeah, you can't get a teacher on the internet

780
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,160
that can talk to you one on one, but maybe in the future, like you almost have that.

781
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,520
What is your hairstyle? Yeah. I mean, obviously, there's utility to having a class with an actual

782
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,840
professor with actual skills. I got it understood, but you know what I'm saying.

783
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,280
Break the condition you need to do in VR chat. Don't fucking think that anything is right in

784
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,640
VR chat. What if there were VR chats where like people actually, you know, like you're there as

785
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:19,160
your cat girl, a big, big, titty anime avatar and you're the teacher. You're teaching your students

786
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:24,280
about, you know, Physics 101 that you're trying on. I mean, that's too low-level. The thing is

787
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:30,680
really just like the same as a stream. Like the talking and like asking questions and getting

788
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:37,880
specific answers to those questions is what a physical human teacher is as an informational

789
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,480
dump. They don't have to, like if you're on the internet and you ask a question,

790
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,920
Google is terrible. Google is the worst search engine ever made, all of them are,

791
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:57,400
because if you have a specific question, it doesn't use AI to really tell you anything.

792
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,160
There are a few websites where you can put a question in and humans can come and

793
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:08,920
like answer it like in Quora or like other things like that. But like AI does not do good

794
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,000
like with the teaching. So like as long as there's like an actual person on the other end,

795
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,760
it doesn't matter where you are. If it's in real life, it's more real and like that's one thing.

796
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,640
But online, it can also happen. Like I don't know why

797
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:30,680
like teaching streams don't exist. They don't really, they don't really exist.

798
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,800
There's a couple of them. Maybe they do, but like I haven't seen enough of them to be like

799
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,160
ASMR guy. Organized as like a real thing. There happens to be this one ASMR guy named Chicho,

800
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:44,920
who I passively follow, not particularly closely or anything. And he does like ASMR math streams.

801
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,000
He like is a teacher and just in his ASMR, he's like, Oh, today we're going to discuss like

802
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,560
quadratic functions that we're going to, you know, break it down. So it's really clear.

803
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,880
You know, I mean, it's kind of cool. I've never really paid that. I've never learned anything

804
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,080
from watching ASMR. I mean ASMR, I think it's like distracting, surely. It's gonna put you to sleep

805
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:11,080
literally. Yeah. So I mean, there's also sort of like a different like skill set that a teacher has

806
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:18,840
rather than even sites like that, because learning does not consist of you just continuously asking

807
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:25,320
questions over and over and over again. That can allow you to create the sort of art that you want,

808
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:31,240
but it doesn't necessarily allow you to grow. And what I mean by that is that a lot of the time,

809
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:36,280
teachers can provide things for you that you would not know to seek out or that you would not know

810
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,680
to ask or just information that you didn't know was even relevant. Like there can be sometimes

811
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:46,680
where you are given not just an assignment, but you are given advice or you were talking to someone

812
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,240
and they inform you of something that you would have not known about otherwise. Like

813
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:58,120
for instance, a big thing I know in the illustration department here is that you are told that you

814
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,880
should know other illustrators in the field. And that's the sort of thing where it's like,

815
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,840
you probably know a lot of Instagram people, right? You follow a lot of people on social media.

816
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,520
How many actual working illustrators, how many people actually making money doing what you

817
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,800
want to do? How many of those do you know? Most of the time the classes are like a zero.

818
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,640
Like there's no one that I can name at all. And that's not the sort of thing that you would think

819
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:30,040
yourself well-drying. Like, hmm, I wonder who's an illustrator that I can take inspiration from.

820
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,440
You kind of just like learn things through osmosis. And that's the sort of thing where it's like,

821
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,000
you were given insight into the field, you were given insight into job opportunities,

822
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,080
you were given insight into how to improve your craft in ways that you could not just, you know,

823
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:49,720
think to or know by Google search and things. You mean like, you mean like a personal connection

824
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:55,800
no, as in like you've talked to them and know who you are? Well, either or, either or. Because

825
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:02,840
the way I was thinking about that is like, getting, that like the teacher, like talking to like a

826
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,080
faceless username, asking a question in a live stream or some VR chat thing, some future teacher

827
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:14,760
thing is like one thing. But like, if the teacher knows who you are and they can see you in real

828
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:20,600
life, that is something that like they can get a sense of what sort of person you are, what sort of

829
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:25,240
like issues you may have, depending on the teacher and how much they give a shit, of course. But

830
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:31,320
like, I've gotten some like real good life advice from art teachers in the past that see that like,

831
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:39,160
I am not like the most like talkative and like, you know, socially active member of the class,

832
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:43,880
I don't usually ask the questions when I was in school. So they would like, bring me aside after

833
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:51,080
a class and like talk about stuff. And those moments would be very valuable for someone like me.

834
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:55,480
Those kind of unquantifiable things that you don't expect are definitely the main point of

835
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,520
But is that really worth tens of thousands of currency?

836
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:07,720
Who knows? That's up to the individual to decide. I'd rather just find a teacher and like meet them

837
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:14,360
outside of teaching, just like be friends with them. We have to go back to the Greek model of one

838
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:22,760
you know, wise older man personally tutoring one sexy little boy. That's right. This is the purest

839
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,600
form of love. And it's the purest form of education as well. And it's what I ascribe to

840
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,480
instead of instead of paying instead of paying for you know, years of college at hundreds of

841
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,960
thousand dollars in debt, you just pay with your with your with your with your with that sexuality

842
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,560
you weren't using anyway. So you might as well put it to good use. Makes sense to me.

843
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,400
Hey, I've got an update a life update. I hit Twitch partner the other day.

844
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:57,400
Did you make it? Did it work? Well, I hit all the thresholds that are needed. The application is

845
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,880
currently being processed. I don't know if I'm going, I mean, I assume I will. They're gonna

846
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:08,280
pull up every time you said the F word on stream. Oh, they're gonna give me my social media score

847
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,800
breakdown. Damn it, China. What have you done? I really close to making I got pretty close to

848
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:19,480
making partner that one month that I had Chris Chan on my on my Twitch. And I also did the

849
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:25,880
didgy debate on like the same week or the same month. And like, yeah, I also I was close to

850
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,240
hitting that 75 average viewers, but I think I got to like 71 or something like 60, 60. Thank God,

851
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,600
it's I mean, hopefully it'll be over. And like, I don't think you'll lose partner,

852
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:40,440
even if your views dip down. Once you make it, I don't actually know what the benefits like,

853
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,000
I'm sure you get more emojis. That's the main one. I know your streams more successful. I don't

854
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:51,800
think you just get more emotes. Don't you get ad revenue? You get a bigger share of

855
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,080
ad revenue. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's pretty good. Yeah, that's like the big thing. That might be

856
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:02,120
like a 5% difference. I'll be curious to hear if like it leads to like any substantial like

857
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:07,000
change in your Twitch revenue. Yeah, I mean, for me, since like I'm kind of like right at the

858
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,920
border, like I could have been affiliate or a partner at roughly the place that I'm at,

859
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,120
I'll be interested to see because I always track my income for these things month to

860
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,720
month. Anyway, like if there's a change, you know, I don't know, we'll fucking see if that

861
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,720
if that amounts to anything, or if I get more viewers, or like maybe now that I'll be partner,

862
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:26,600
hopefully, like it'll put me out more recommendations and more people see. I don't know. I don't

863
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,360
know. Maybe. Hi guys, I've carved more space for myself underneath of a thumb of San Francisco

864
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:41,560
Tech Bros. I can't wait to sell my personality more online. That's it's good. I mean, that's the

865
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,320
job, man. That's the job. You just literally you just debunked every YouTuber on the planet and

866
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,920
every online content creator who exists. In fact, every book writer is just literally just selling

867
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:57,480
their fucking personality and like their hard one knowledge to the fucking ignorant masses,

868
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,640
like literally like a fucking whore, like a fucking whore. It's exactly what every book

869
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,440
writer in history is. Every, you know, the guys who write the Bible, you know what they say,

870
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,800
whores are better than others. Sad but true. You hate to see it.

871
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,840
Sad, but you hate to see it. You hate to see it. I mean, Christ taught us that whores are cool now,

872
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,800
so that's the good news. He did. I remember when he did that.

873
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,160
We should remake the Bible, but Jesus is like a vlogger and he like assembly, like he's like the

874
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:30,600
PCP. He like assembles a bunch of content creators. We should remake the Bible, but Jesus is a woman

875
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:38,280
of color. That's he's channel terminated. That was him getting crucified. Yeah, right, right.

876
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,120
That was the big, the big F in chat, as it's known in the book. And then, you know,

877
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,040
three days later, his account gets restored, but he kind of, he uploads some weird vlogs,

878
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,560
like you don't really understand it. The way in Bibles where they have like the extremely

879
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,000
flowery like first letter of the sentence, but just one page is a huge big F. Yeah.

880
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:04,200
Oh, it's like there's this really like finely detailed H and then TTP slash and then just a

881
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,840
really long link in that one episode of SpongeBob where SpongeBob is writing the essay to pass

882
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:13,000
voting school or whatever. Didn't he draw like it's him like, yes, yes. And he spends like an

883
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,520
hour and it's just a big W. I learned in voting school is was it a T. It's just just writes the

884
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,680
Oh, it was the. Okay. I was hoping it'd be a W. So that could be used for epic SpongeBob.

885
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,600
W memes like here, bro. You would see it everywhere by now if it was a W.

886
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:35,000
You're absolutely like every other SpongeBob's still, you know, ever produced. Let me see. Hey,

887
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
a totally other subject. I was just going to say I, in my personal life update, I have finished

888
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:48,200
finally Star Trek, the original series, and I'm on to Voyager now. And I'm so excited this piece

889
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:55,960
of media from the 1970s. 1960s as it would have it. But I'm sorry. That's actually based,

890
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:02,120
actually. Maybe it's in the 70s. I don't know. No, Voyager is from like the 90s. Well, the original

891
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:07,640
series. The original series is from the 60s. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, it was great. Really good.

892
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:14,920
Very excited to continue consuming media in this way. And yeah, it feels good. We'll give updates.

893
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:23,240
Yeah. I'll tell you, okay, the one thing, guys, I gotta tell you, a big problematic moment.

894
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,880
I've watched, you know, three full Star Trek series now. It's been all male captains. Well,

895
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:33,880
I mean, the Cisco Star is a commander, but it becomes a captain in Voyager. Janeway is the

896
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:39,560
only one I've seen so far who at any moment doubted herself and her leadership capabilities.

897
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,320
Is it a coincidence she's the woman captain? I don't know.

898
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,840
She's a pretty seasoned captain. Why would they choose to write this into her narrative?

899
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:52,040
Little suss, little suss, sexism in the writer's room? I hope not. Impossible. You

900
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:58,600
can't be racist and work on television shows. People can't be racist and sexist at the same time.

901
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:04,680
It doesn't add up. Yeah, that's, anyway, didn't matter. She's a good captain. She's all right.

902
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,400
Media to consume. Please consume the Lord of Ghost comic. Give and take dot sign.

903
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,880
Yeah, please. Lord of Ghost chapter two. It's another fucking masterpiece.

904
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:19,320
God, I love Lord of Ghost comic. When chapter three, Gib, give me more to consume.

905
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:26,920
I really like your shit. Thank you. I bring it up mostly to plug, but also because it is

906
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:33,800
something that I have sort of like slowed down quite a lot on working on. And I don't know whether,

907
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,800
like, it's a good thing that I don't feel bad about it. Like, I don't feel worried that I'm

908
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:43,000
losing pace. I just sort of stopped for a bit because I felt like it. And I felt okay.

909
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,960
And usually I would expect myself to be like panicking, like, oh, no,

910
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:53,320
deadlines that I set for myself are not going to be met. Lol, damn, kill myself. But I feel

911
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:58,920
all right. I feel like this was a break I needed to take. And I'm going to get back to it. But like,

912
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,920
do you ever feel that like you're taking a break and it doesn't feel like a bad thing?

913
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,600
Yes, because I literally never. No, okay, hippo, I'm totally with you. That is the sort of thing

914
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,200
where if you don't have a functioning brain, then you can kind of work yourself. I feel like I've

915
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:24,680
said this a thousand times before, go to munchuscripts.tumblr.com. If you think that your time

916
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:30,360
is always work time and it's always potential work time, then all breaks will feel like you are

917
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,760
wasting time that you could be spending. But as long as you are intentional and you like

918
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,960
plan to like, you know what, I'm kind of not feeling it right now, I'm going to take a break

919
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,160
and then you actually take a break and don't just, you know, have the Lord of Ghost, you know,

920
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,920
up in your Photoshop file and then watch YouTube for a little while, then click back to it and

921
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,200
then you draw like a couple more lines and click back to YouTube and you just waste your time that

922
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:58,840
way. It's great. I played Civ 5 for like six hours, like a couple days ago. I just got home from

923
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,680
school and I thought, you know what, I haven't played video games in a really long time. I'm

924
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,080
going to play a video game, played a video game and it was great. It was great. And I just,

925
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,720
that's the sort of thing where it's like, if I were thinking to myself, okay, all right,

926
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:16,440
I have stuff I have to do, I have to get it done and I have to do my homework, but I really want to

927
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,520
play Civ 5. I'm going to play a little bit of Civ 5 and then I'll do a little bit of work and then

928
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,120
Munchy, it sounds so good to be mentally healthy. Yeah, I know. I can't even imagine.

929
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,080
Well, it's almost like everyone can be mentally helpful, healthy if they just, you know, try

930
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,840
at all and put any thought into the actions that they're doing and just like reflect upon their

931
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,920
life and you know, just like set out rules for themselves and like have like a moral or like

932
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,120
intellectual standard that they keep themselves to and it's all, and everyone's like about the

933
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,680
same intelligence is about just about, you know, trying really at all. None of us would know anything

934
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:51,640
about that. That's, you know, it's, it was, it was weird though because it was like the first time

935
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,840
that I've been okay with taking a break. It wasn't even really a plan break. I just was not feeling

936
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:02,440
it. So I stopped for a bit and I played some video games. I watched YouTube and then I made,

937
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:11,640
oh no, it wasn't that. I finished the Sangetsuno Lion anime and read the manga, which is really good

938
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:16,520
and is definitely on par with the show. If you get to the end of the show and you want more,

939
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:23,000
definitely continue reading. Great manga, great, you know, art and stuff, but it's ongoing. So

940
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
it sort of stops and that after that I was like, dude, I don't know what to do, but then I got like

941
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,600
a block of wood and I made a shogi piece. I talked about this a bit. I have a picture now. I've sanded

942
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:41,960
it down. It looks really nice. I'm thinking of, of like maybe etching into it and then doing a

943
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:47,560
little image and then like painting it gold or white or something. Make like a pump like face,

944
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:54,840
like a little pumpkin head. Possible. That'd be cool. Not like the pumpkin outline, but like just

945
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:01,480
like the face, like a jack-o'-lantern face. I took a break for the purpose of being productive

946
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:06,600
in that when I hit the point where I was like, okay, finale's coming up for Slime and Punishment,

947
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,200
I was like, I'm not going to do anymore. I'm going to go back. I'm going to finish the vapor

948
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:15,960
scripts, which I finally did this past week. I got the last one done. All the guest artists

949
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,400
have their scripts now. So my work is done. Amazing. I felt really terrible while I was

950
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:28,360
taking the break because I felt like it was way too long. Because Writing the Vapors is like an

951
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:35,800
emotionally horrifying experience for me. As I talk about on the patreon.com slash ben saint,

952
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:41,400
the new monthly podcast, I went, I like had revelations about the topic of like, why is

953
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:47,000
Writing Vapors hard? Like while I was recording that. That's great stuff. That's cool. That's cool

954
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,720
to have moments like that. You should link it for us so we can listen to it for free and other

955
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,840
people have to pay for it. I guess I can do that just for you guys. I can do it guilt-free because

956
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:06,680
fair. I forget where I was going. Wait, can I just like post the, if I post the patreon link here,

957
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,120
you won't be able to see it, right? Even if I want to share with you guys.

958
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,760
Correct. We would need like, like if it's like a YouTube uploader, if it's on patreon we would

959
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:20,280
have to. I guess maybe I can just upload the raw audio. I mean, you certainly could. You

960
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:25,080
don't have to, but I mean, I'm curious. I will, I will figure out a way to let you guys hear it.

961
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:32,280
Okay. And the first one too, I guess. I was going to say on the subject of taking a break, I am going

962
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:39,480
on vacation tomorrow for like 11 days or whatever, going to Hawaii. And so that is indeed the first

963
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:45,000
like big, I mean, I spent like literally two days of the parents. So that's a weekend. That is one

964
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,160
weekend that I don't think that really counts as much of a vacation. Wait, our parents? Wait,

965
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:53,640
where are you going on vacation? Hawaii to see Michelle's folks. Okay. Okay. So that, I mean,

966
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,200
that's, I mean, we're going to be there for like a good solid like nine days of chilling. So that's

967
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,760
going to be an actual vacation that I'm very much looking forward to. What's the vacation?

968
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:08,760
Fun? I mean, we like had wanted to see my like her parents for a while and like a while back, we

969
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,480
haven't been there for a while to see her folks. And like they just said like, hey, you know,

970
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:18,440
like we will pay for you guys to come out like to fly out sometimes like let us know when's good.

971
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,200
And we were just like, let's pick a time that like fits into our schedule reasonably well. So

972
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,320
like they they're paying for the flight, which is very generous. And we're just going to go hang out

973
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:33,880
for several days. And then come back and continue life in beautiful sunny Cincinnati, Ohio. And so

974
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,480
yeah, I mean, there's no real occasion, but it'll actually be like a nice break. And you'll get to

975
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:42,280
see your folks and all that stuff. But like this happens to coincide obviously with all my channels

976
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:48,680
being hacked. And one of the worst things about that on the subject of, you know, holding yourself

977
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:53,960
to a deadline and whatnot is I had previously promised my patrons that I would get a big video

978
01:24:53,960 --> 01:25:00,280
out during the month of January. It is now past the month of January. And I must admit I was had

979
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:06,280
had my head to the grindstone, working real hard to get it done, like my next big Nate video on

980
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:11,240
BGE. But when like the 22nd, the 23rd rolled around, and I discovered that my channels were

981
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:17,000
literally stolen. And I could not post them. I must admit, it just deflated me. And I was like,

982
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,520
well, I guess I'm just gonna not work on this as much because you know, dealing with some

983
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,680
shit right now. So you'd be able to upload to your patrons and you'd be able to upload as soon

984
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:32,120
as you got back or like whenever this resolved. Well, that's true. Like the video is not done

985
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:38,360
editing. It's going to be at least several more days of editing because I just was fucked up about

986
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,920
not being able to release it like on time. Like I could have probably finished it if I had had my

987
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:47,560
head to the fucking grindstone. But like for I had to deal with all these channels, you know,

988
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,040
there's work involved with that and stuff. But like it is, I mean, consider it a failure. I consider

989
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:56,280
it a failure. But it was due to circumstances that like, I don't know. I feel like that's totally

990
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:00,760
fair. Like even if you would put your nose to the grindstone, you got the video finished,

991
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:07,640
you still might have had to wait two weeks at this point to get it up. So like you can take time.

992
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,440
It would have been done, but like I can, I think it's not something to like work yourself up about

993
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:21,240
like, oh, I failed. Like this was out of your control. I mean, you know, people, my patrons are

994
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,240
the only people to the opinions I really care about on this particular subject because they're

995
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,800
the only ones I owe anything to. Actually it's not out of your control. It's entirely your fault.

996
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:35,560
Lol, die. I mean, you know, in a way, yes, in a way, you know, in the same way that like if you

997
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,720
get gunned down the street in a bad neighborhood, why are you in that bad neighborhood? I was in

998
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:45,720
the bad neighborhood of, you know, the internet and of, you know, sponsorship deals that I should

999
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:50,680
never have gone into. So that's, that's, that's on me. I don't know. I guess I just hope that my

1000
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:56,120
patrons are a little bit understanding and they don't, you know, all of it. I mean, I suspect

1001
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:00,120
they will, but like, I mean, if it was me, I have this thing in my head where it's like, well, I

1002
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:04,600
mean, you didn't do what you said you were going to do. I mean, you know, you could have done it anyway.

1003
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:11,640
So I mean, I can't blame people if they feel that way. I feel like like patrons specifically

1004
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:17,960
would, would understand. Like random viewers, I'm not here to beg or anything promised it to

1005
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:24,200
random viewers. They might like on serve or whatever, but like patrons care more. And so like

1006
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,840
something like this happening that probably like really supportive. I mean, I would hope. I hope

1007
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:33,320
so. And I mean, I do have a we Agua that's ready. It's been ready. It's just that my channel got

1008
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:38,680
stolen. So I have one thing to release as soon as it comes. You're back on. This is that last one

1009
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,640
that is the final way. Wait, you're not doing any more we Aguas ever? No, well, okay. That's not

1010
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,760
what I'm trying. I'm trying like for now. This is the last of I'm calling it season three. Like,

1011
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:51,560
I might pick it up again later, but like for now, the plans just work on the big videos and maybe

1012
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:57,080
a we Agua if I feel like it, that's that's awesome. Yeah, I mean, I hope so. It'll just

1013
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:01,560
hopefully make time for big videos and do stuff like that. But like, I was hoping to start off.

1014
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,720
Well, there's been a little bit of a, you know, derailing of the plan. But okay, whatever, enough

1015
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,320
about that. I just thought I'd throw that out there because it's like, I'm okay. What I was

1016
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,600
going to say, the last thing on that is just like, I'm feeling good that like what I'm going to

1017
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:18,520
Hawaii, I will just be tuned out of all this shit. Although I actually am going to call in for the

1018
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,480
PCP episode from Hawaii. I'm going to bring a mic with me to do it. So I don't know, that'll be fun.

1019
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:28,120
Hopefully have things to discuss. But like, I'm going to go as much as saying I'm going to use

1020
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,880
my body, I'm going to go learn to surf. I'm going to go do that, which I've been, I mean, look over

1021
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,160
at my fucking point break poster, and I'm just filled my eyes fill with tears at the sheer joy

1022
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:42,760
of being a man on the ocean connecting with real life and doing real life things.

1023
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:48,200
Yes. And so I'm just like, and you know, I'm hoping while I'm out, maybe I'll just get that call

1024
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:54,680
from the boys at YouTube and they'll say, Nate, happy vacation, buddy. Here's your channel back.

1025
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:58,600
We took care of it while you were off doing other things. And oh, won't that be nice. And

1026
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,960
hopefully all the channels will be restored, but I'm going to be paying attention and all that

1027
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:08,840
stuff. So I've excused myself for this like 10 day block of time to just not worry about all this

1028
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:15,640
stuff. I worry about everything else when I'm back. And if I like, I definitely am afflicted with,

1029
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:21,080
I am unable to stop thinking about all the things I have to do all the time. But when I block out

1030
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:26,120
specifically, like a big chunk of time like this, when I won't be doing anything, I think this will

1031
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:31,960
be a very, very helpful, recuperative block of time. So I don't know. That's it. Sick.

1032
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:41,800
What's next? I got one like, bit of news, but it's not much. I put a new video on the hypocrite

1033
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:48,920
channel. Oh, yeah. It's just a little five minute rant. And I was happy to see that the people

1034
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:54,360
who have subscribed are still there, like very, very happy to see. Everyone was excited to see

1035
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:58,120
that. Yeah. I was just really nice to like, I was expecting people to be like, what the fuck,

1036
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,720
lol, die. I'm mad at you for uploading content. It's only a five minute rant and there's no

1037
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,480
video editing. What the fuck? I care about standards, says the YouTube commenter. Redman is

1038
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:16,280
looking jacked. Oh yeah, he's so angry about video games. It makes his blood boil. And he goes,

1039
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:23,400
gear a second. You know what you're going to have to do? Yeah, I want you to go check that out.

1040
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:31,640
Because I have like, banished YouTube forever. I've blocked it on my desktop and on my phone

1041
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:36,360
and on my laptop and it's like, gone and I can't access it. The only way I can access it is if I

1042
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:42,200
go to the school library. So whenever you, when any of you upload a video that's good, DM me and

1043
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:46,600
then I'll go to the school library to watch it. Okay, we'll do. I'll keep you posted. I thought

1044
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:52,280
you said like, completely blocking out something. It just doesn't work. Or do you actually feel like

1045
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:57,400
YouTube has no value anymore? And so that's easy to do. I actually feel like it has no value and

1046
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:03,080
it's easy to do. Yeah, I feel like that sometimes as well. Like I still enjoy looking at a couple

1047
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:09,400
things, but it is sort of like the same video I've seen a few weeks ago. Well, I've got to be

1048
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:16,520
fully redpilled on the YouTube. I've taken the full red YouTube pill, which is like 99%, probably

1049
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:21,480
more than that, is just all people restating opinion that's the same as everyone else about

1050
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:26,520
current event. That's like the vast majority of what it is. And in terms of like actually

1051
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:33,240
insightful commentary, it's very rare. And but you know what? I aspire to be one of those people

1052
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:38,280
that people actually be like, Oh, good. Thank God in the sea of garbage, a best guy ever upload,

1053
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,760
I can count on this being at least interesting, at least something I haven't consumed a thousand

1054
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:48,760
times before. I mean, if you're not doing that on YouTube, what's even the fucking point? Be your own

1055
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:53,560
boss in a job saying the same thing as everybody else? How is that any better than just being a

1056
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:58,680
corporate cog of some company where you make way more money and have actual job security?

1057
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,480
Explain to me why that's a better job. You can't do it. So, you know, fuck it, man,

1058
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:07,480
make good content or don't do it at all, or have it be a hobby. I guess if you want to do that,

1059
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:12,280
that's fine too. Then do whatever the fuck you want. So much of YouTube is just like repeating

1060
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,560
things like you're just saying, like not even just like repeating what other YouTubers have said,

1061
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:20,600
but like reading a book and then boiling down that book to its like pure essence,

1062
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:24,520
so you get none of the nuance and you get none of the actual interesting tidbits. So it's just like,

1063
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:29,560
here's, here, I read a book, I'm just going to like repeat what the book said, but like worse

1064
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:33,480
and like way like less insightful, you know, that's just what I'm going to do.

1065
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:37,880
I'll just make, here's a little pitch, here's a little pitch about some, a video that I consider

1066
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:43,800
worthwhile and I think it's why people like it. Like my, my smash videos, I do actual research

1067
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,720
when I'm making one of those to find out like every appearance of a character.

1068
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:51,880
Most people will have not know at least some of that. If you watch those, they're short,

1069
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:57,560
they're punchy, they're hopefully funny and like they, I like to think at least they're actually

1070
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,240
both interesting and amusing for people because I put a lot of fucking work into getting everything

1071
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:09,320
I can and cramming in like every meme about that character. It's like a, I try to make it a full

1072
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:15,560
like 360, everything you think about this character is all in one place and it's telling the story

1073
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:20,680
of like a progression of something that would exist nowhere else. Like no one else has boiled

1074
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:26,440
down the complete history of Simon Belmont, the character better than my sign of the cross video

1075
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:31,400
about Simon Belmont getting into smash. In my humble opinion, it's, it's, it's making the world

1076
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,600
like a better place. There's a thing here that did not exist anywhere else, except for I guess

1077
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:41,160
a fucking like two hour history of Castlevania video, but you know what? I'm delivering it better

1078
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:48,120
and faster and smarter. So fuck you, watch Mojo or whoever. I don't know. To me, that should be like

1079
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:53,640
the bare minimum of what makes like actually worthwhile content. Now I consume lots of trash

1080
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:58,920
content on YouTube too, absolutely true, but there's a distinction to be made and I know what

1081
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:05,240
side of that equation I want to be on long term. Here's the thing about like people using YouTube

1082
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:12,520
as background or is quote unquote, stop doing that. That's fine. It's, it's, it is a stupid idea

1083
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:20,600
because there is music that you could listen to instead music on Spotify or YouTube. If you're on

1084
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:24,520
YouTube, you're likely to get distracted. But if you're on Spotify, it's just music or band camp

1085
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:30,920
or whatever. I made a tweet a while ago saying, give me a band, I will go through their entire

1086
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:38,840
discography and I will do that while I'm drawing and I've gotten through, I mean the band I'm on

1087
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,160
at the moment is Uriah Heap and they have like 70 albums, so there's a lot of stuff. But the thing

1088
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:47,960
that's great about music is that it doesn't have to be good music and it doesn't have to be music

1089
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,360
you like, it just needs to be background noise, just like a YouTube video. You don't care about

1090
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,000
what is happening in the YouTube video, you don't care if it's a good video or a bad video, but

1091
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:03,160
you get so much more out of music than people talking when you're not listening to it that hard.

1092
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:08,680
So it's like, if you have like hundreds, like there's so many replies to that tweet, everybody

1093
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,800
wants you to listen to their favorite band and nobody ever listens to bands ever. I never listen

1094
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:19,400
to music when people recommend it to me. But through this tweet and this desire to like replace

1095
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:26,600
background noise from YouTube, I've listened to so much stuff and it's just, it's great. It's

1096
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:33,400
really good. That's good. That's good. I was more productive when I was listening to music than

1097
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:38,600
when I would put on like background noise YouTube videos like speedruns and stuff. Because you're

1098
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,160
always going to switch back over to the YouTube video. You're always going to have that over.

1099
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:48,440
ASMR Chads unite literally worthless trash content that's just regurgitated to create

1100
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:53,560
new white noise that it's the most intellectual content for background noise there is.

1101
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,280
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

1102
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:03,320
Part of the reason why, again, viewers read Munchie scripts, because I talk about all this

1103
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:07,480
extensively and I'm probably going to post there more than I'm going to be on the podcast.

1104
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:13,800
Like I say that like, you know, you can't block out things completely. But the reasons I gave is

1105
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:17,960
just because like for some things, like, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are like really

1106
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:23,080
addicted to YouTube, like how I was. And a lot of people like don't think as radically as we made

1107
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:27,480
that, you know, it's all shit. It's all bad. Like don't even watch it. I'm sure a lot of people

1108
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:31,160
have like a lot of joy that comes from YouTube. I'm sure a lot of people have like, you know, like,

1109
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:35,880
oh, I really want to tune in to see this or subscribe. So like, like line just like cutting

1110
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:41,240
out something completely is just going to like cause more problems because you're lying to yourself.

1111
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,760
If you're as honest with yourself as I have tried to be and I've said to myself and I've

1112
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:51,480
analyzed, hmm, does YouTube give me any joy? No. Okay. All right. Great. Okay. I don't need it

1113
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:58,600
anymore at all then. And so that's fair enough. I think that they're like Marie Kondo speaking

1114
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:03,400
of sparking joy. Yes, it's true. Throw away everything that doesn't give true joy. There are

1115
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:08,760
creators who I would drop everything to go watch. For example, Twin Perfect uploading this gigantic

1116
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:15,640
four and a half hour video on, you know, Twin Peaks season three and the whole thing. I know

1117
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:21,080
that that video which took over a year to make is worth watching. I know it and that's why I'm

1118
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,560
setting aside time to watch Twin Peaks so that I can go consume this media. And yes, it's just

1119
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,720
going to be a breakdown, but it will also be an exercise in further understanding a media piece

1120
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:37,240
that I would think is worth spending some time to digest anyway. So I would absolutely not agree

1121
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:42,040
that it's all trash, but you do have to sort through the trash to find the good. And I would

1122
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:48,120
totally agree. There's very little actually good. Yeah, like specifically, like, watch the challenge

1123
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:52,280
you want to watch and subscribe from everybody that doesn't bring you joy every single time,

1124
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:57,240
but like specifically for like if you're going to YouTube bar, turn off autoplay. If you're going

1125
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:02,760
to YouTube for background noise, there's better things. There's way better things. And if you're

1126
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:07,560
making a calculation that like by having YouTube, maybe there are once in a blue moon an actually

1127
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:12,760
good video, but you know that you're wasting hours every day. So it's just not worth it. That's fine.

1128
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,400
That's a totally fair calculation to make to, you know, turn it off. Yeah, fair enough, fair

1129
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:23,160
enough. Guys, voicemails, voicemails, what do you say? I got shit I wanted to talk about.

1130
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:28,520
Y'all are so fucking boring, though. You just keep going. What are we even talking about? YouTube,

1131
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:35,800
fuck it. Say your stuff then. Amuse me then, Ben. Amuse me. Okay, well, get ready for disappointment.

1132
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:45,160
I'm ready. Okay, scramble for my notes. Tomorrow, Iowa caucuses. Today's the Super Bowl. I don't

1133
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:50,280
give a fuck. Tomorrow, the Iowa caucuses and I'm fucking high. Well, boring, Ben. This sucks so bad.

1134
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:55,160
Why are we going to the topic? It fucking sucks so bad. Wow, it's terrible. Is that relative to when

1135
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,760
they hear this or like relative to what's important? No, it is tomorrow for us. It will have already

1136
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:03,560
happened when the episode comes out. Wow, great. This is really great podcast content. I don't know

1137
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:07,480
if you're being sarcastic or not, Munchy. Just explain the joke to me. I think now he is being

1138
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:16,120
sarcastic at this point. Yes. Okay, sick. Whatever. Fuck you. Okay, I'm going to hide from a man,

1139
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:21,640
Bernie. I mean, the difference now is that it's not just idle talk about like political boys

1140
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:25,800
going to be better. Now it's like, okay, it actually matters. The voting starts fucking tomorrow.

1141
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:31,240
Yeah. I'm certainly interested to see where it's going to go. This does in fact impact our lives,

1142
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:36,200
at least a little bit. It does. Bernie's been, Bernie's been surging lately. He's like,

1143
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:43,560
top Biden in a lot of polls. Yeah, I don't know. Pretty good. The real challenge is,

1144
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:49,240
will Ben have the moral fortitude to be gracious and victory? No. I hate my enemies.

1145
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:55,880
Yeah, that's fair. Okay, whatever. That's the thing. I went clubbing on Saturday.

1146
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:02,360
I got thrown out of the club. How'd it go?

1147
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:09,720
I was, I mean, I guess, Kazzy's friend is like a bar promoter, and she was like,

1148
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:15,720
hey, everybody come out to this club with me. And I got the second hand invite and I was like,

1149
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:20,760
okay. Word. I mean, the long story short is we hung out at the bar and then they were like a dance

1150
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:25,480
floor like opened up downstairs and I was down there, you know, drinking white cloth seltzers,

1151
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:30,920
being a cool guy. No doubt. I guess I decided it would be funny or I felt what I felt like doing

1152
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:37,000
was like sitting down on the floor in front of the bar, right? In hindsight, I can understand why

1153
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:44,040
they wouldn't want me doing that. But mercilessly, they descended upon me, like pick me up, like

1154
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:51,080
carried me out of the fucking building and just like sat me down and outside and were like,

1155
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:56,840
you're kicked out. And I'm like, what, can I rectify my behavior? Not one word of warning,

1156
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:04,120
you're not getting back in. So I wait in line again, like I wait, I get back in line to try and

1157
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:08,920
like just wait my way back to the front to like be like, hey, guys, sorry about the whole thing,

1158
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,320
promise I won't do that again. But like my shit, so can I just get back in? And I'm waiting in line

1159
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:18,120
in these two like Arab guys, they turn, I start talking to them about Naruto, they both love

1160
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:23,080
Naruto. And I'm just like, yeah, whatever, I guess this will, I'm out here in my t-shirt in like

1161
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:27,640
freezing cold weather. I guess this will pass the time while I wait for the line for to get back

1162
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:33,080
in. But it's no use, they're like, you got kicked out, you were dipped up, no, I heard word, word

1163
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:37,880
from the top down is that this guy is trouble. He's not getting anywhere near our establishment.

1164
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,800
So I had to finally beg them like, put my debit card, please just give me my debit card. And they

1165
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:47,720
did. And then we all, we all left, we left and it was, fuck those guys. But like, yeah, they have,

1166
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:52,200
they had like the two guys, one on each side, like grabbing my shoulders, like physically moving,

1167
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:59,160
and I'm just like, okay, I'm, I like went limp. I went like, I'm just, I'll just let destiny

1168
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:04,280
take me wherever, wherever it needs to take me. I'm not going to fight it. So like, I mean, were

1169
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:09,480
you like, you know, drunk or like making a scene? I was kind of drunk. I don't think I was making a

1170
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:15,320
scene. I just, I sat down in front of the bar. And probably that is offensive to them because

1171
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:19,400
they want, I was probably like, someone might have been considering going up to the bar and

1172
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:25,400
getting a drink and be like, there's like a guy sitting in front of it. Like, I do understand

1173
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:30,920
the problem. I do. Seems like a disproportionate reaction. It's, I was a little surprised.

1174
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:35,080
Cassie was a little surprised. She like, she like came out and found me in line and was like,

1175
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,960
what the fuck? Why did they kick you out? I'm like, I, I guess I was sitting down and we were just

1176
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:45,320
like, well, fuck it. I guess we're leaving. And that's what happened. Clubbing is well munchy.

1177
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:52,280
No, I did not. No, he got, he couldn't, it was, it's 21, 21 plus. Oh, 21. That's right. I forgot.

1178
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:59,480
Yeah. All the, that's fun. All the, all the other, it was all friends of this, of this

1179
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:05,400
Cassie's roommate person. Yeah. There was only one, there was one that I talked to and seemed

1180
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:09,640
nice, but then she had a boyfriend, which I think should be illegal. But that's, that's

1181
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,680
for another, that's for another day. I'm like that. That's fucked up. Yeah. It was pretty fucked up.

1182
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,920
I don't, if she, if she has a boyfriend, why was she not wearing the veil?

1183
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,960
That's exactly what I'm saying. Why was she not accompanied by at least one adult male

1184
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,120
at least. For Pete's sake. For Pete's sake. It's shameful. Don't worry. Brannis gonna get

1185
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:37,320
Sharia Laan soon. I'm looking forward to it. All my favorite things. Okay. I guess I'm done.

1186
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:42,040
Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Thank you very much. Look, I just want to keep everyone

1187
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:48,520
updated on my, on my, my day to day, on my goings on. That's why I'm here. I'm on this podcast

1188
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:53,560
to maintain a presence and like have been like talk about my life with a, with people that want

1189
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:57,960
to hear it. That's what I'm here to maintain my profile. It's working. Yeah. You know what the

1190
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:02,120
best podcast content is? It's not like a, it's not like a conversation between two people,

1191
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,480
like, you know, contributing their like personalities to create like a new thing,

1192
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,320
a conversation. It's just like rapid fire. Like, hello, it's me. I'm standing up now.

1193
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,680
Oh, wow. This ride today. Huh? All right. You sit back down. Sorry. Hey, it's me,

1194
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:16,040
the next guy. I also have like the exact same life. What do, what do personal

1195
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:20,520
anecdotes from podcasters live? What place does such things have on a podcast?

1196
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:26,200
Indeed. Yeah. This is the question. Can't, can't imagine. I like the discussions.

1197
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:33,320
Okay. I think they were interesting. Fuck you. No. Pointless. I'm glad to hear it. I'm, I'm

1198
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:38,440
invested in the Ben Saga of, I don't know, uh, this, this could be a segment. This could be a

1199
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:43,560
segment of the, the, the Ben segment, the bit, like, like, what, like, what stupid, what stupid

1200
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:48,360
thing did Ben do and get in trouble for it? Ben got, Ben got drunk and something happened.

1201
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:53,000
It has been, has been a disproportionate amount of that lately.

1202
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,840
Okay. What could it mean? Let's get to our voicemails now. We've got,

1203
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:02,280
we've got them all lined up. They're ready to go. And I think, uh, wait,

1204
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:08,040
here. Yes. Ready. Yeah. Okay. You guys got yours as well.

1205
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:13,480
Yeah. By the way, so, okay. Of course, this is the voicemails speak pipe link down below in

1206
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:17,080
the description. Leave us your voicemails. We will review them and play the good ones on the show.

1207
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:21,800
And was there any disclaimer I was going to make? No, guess not. Okay. All right. Let's go right

1208
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:27,640
into them. Let's start with number 00 Radcon Kickstarter date. Let's already have to say

1209
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:38,440
one, two, three, go. Serious Inquiry lads. The Kickstarter ends on such a whack date.

1210
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:44,680
Like, could you extend it a couple of days? Maybe maybe extend it to like that next Friday

1211
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:51,560
or that next Saturday? I think it'd be. I agree that it ending on a Tuesday is kind of bad planning,

1212
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:55,560
but I don't think there's anything we can do about it now. I, I, you know, in regard,

1213
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,760
response to this, I did look into it to see if it could be changed. Anyway,

1214
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:04,920
it cannot be changed based on Kickstarter or anything like that. It's locked in once you decide,

1215
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:11,720
but the good news is just figure it out. Just fucking get together. And that's the good news.

1216
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:18,840
Fortunately, you know, you can just go fuck yourself and deal with it. Yeah. That's, I feel

1217
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:26,040
concerned slash watch and alert sites. It's radiation. Modern insight has an RBL value set by

1218
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:34,040
in ETC.com software, which is the radiation background level. Radcon minus one equals RBL.

1219
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:42,120
Radcon two equals rising. Radcon three equals elevated. Radcon four concern slash watch.

1220
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:48,840
Hmm. Is this, uh, this must be like some spectrum for. When you search Radcon four,

1221
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:54,360
that's what pops up. I want to know more. I want to know more. Um, all right,

1222
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:59,080
next one. Let's just move right along here. We've got a monkey is calling in with another

1223
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:03,640
voicemail. Here we have the same on the count of three combination of me and monkey. That's

1224
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:08,440
right. I'm looking forward to hearing from him again. Uh, okay. Here we go. One, two, three, go.

1225
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:15,640
So I'm really excited about the newest member of the PCP, Brad, um, Brad Garlinghouse.

1226
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:21,880
Honestly, I've been following his content for years and I always thought he'd be a great fit

1227
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:27,800
in the PCP. And I was just wondering how, uh, how this might affect Radcon because, um,

1228
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:32,280
you know, I'd really like to see, even though, even though he's new, you know, maybe you guys

1229
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:36,120
haven't met in person yet, but like, I'd like to see him at Radcon four. I'm wondering if we can get

1230
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:42,440
a stretch call to make this happen. You know, maybe, maybe even, um, maybe make it Bradcon four.

1231
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:48,040
I think, I think that would be a killer. All right. Um, and, uh, do you guys accept donations

1232
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:53,800
and ripple? Cause that's the only currency I have now. Um, thanks. Can't, can't blame you.

1233
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,600
It's going to the moon is what I hear. It's exploding. It's exploding in all directions.

1234
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:05,400
Well, tell you what, monkey, uh, surprise announcement guys, we even have, in fact,

1235
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:14,440
got Brad Garlinghouse confirmed to do a lecture at Radcon four in the flesh. He will be there.

1236
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:18,040
Uh, at least, you know, we've been informed it's Brad. Uh, he may be replaced by a stunt double.

1237
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:21,880
Finally. No, don't worry about that. It's going to be Brad. He's going to be there publicly to

1238
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:27,400
an audience about the benefits of ripple. That's what we get. Here it is, boys. New stretch call.

1239
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:31,640
This is real. Look on the website. It's there now for a new stretch call independent of all

1240
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:38,920
the other stuff at $15,000. Brad Garlinghouse will do a paid appearance at Radcon four. He will be

1241
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:43,480
there in the flesh. We guarantee it. You're going to be excited. Check the Kickstarter. We'll have

1242
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:49,400
some more details there, but, uh, we are pushing about 13 K right now. So that's not, that's not

1243
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:54,520
too K away. It's not, not, not too ridiculous. They are not too far by the time they hear this,

1244
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:58,360
it's going to be like, uh, you're going to have like eight days left or eight, wait, nine, 10,

1245
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:03,320
no, eight days, eight days or so. Should be plenty of time. So let's, let's get it, sis.

1246
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:08,680
Let's get Brad at Radcon for, uh, Brad hashtag Brad at Rad.

1247
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:14,280
Oh yeah. That's good. That's good. Uh, all right. That's real. Well, okay. Good news.

1248
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:19,160
I think man is here to call in possibly calling in right now. Let's, let's give him the floor.

1249
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:22,600
Here we go on the count of three. One, two, three, go.

1250
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:31,000
Attention all Nate heads. Best guy ever needs your help to get his channels back and banish

1251
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:38,280
the evil Brad Garling house back to the shadow realms of this, but he needs your credit card.

1252
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:44,040
No, the three digits on the back and the expiration month and year.

1253
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:51,800
Don't forget that you got to hurry. His subscriber count is falling down into the darkness.

1254
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:58,200
Hmm. Hmm. I mean, there you go. Please give me your money. Would really appreciate that.

1255
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:03,880
Brad, Brad G is the financial genius. You just need his, you need their credit card. I mean,

1256
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:06,680
you're kind of, you're not going to spend it or anything. You just like need them.

1257
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,880
Like I think that's like a math equation you can do if you like you add all of them and

1258
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:13,480
like divide them by amount of like entries and you can get like a password to access your

1259
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:18,440
category. Right. Right. No doubt. No doubt. All right. Let's go right on to our next one. We've

1260
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:25,640
got Aldorn. Oh, no, sorry. What's a teen CP? What's a teen CP? All right. Let's find out.

1261
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:32,920
The count of three. One, two, three, go. Hey, PCP. Long time listener. First time caller.

1262
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:39,240
I'm black. I'm 15. I live in Massachusetts. I'm an eight head. All this information matters.

1263
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:47,080
Because I lost my virginity and it's crazy because did you set 14 year olds could do it?

1264
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:54,040
So I thought to myself, why can't I? And I did. Thoughts and opinions on the Grammys slash

1265
01:50:54,040 --> 01:51:00,760
Oscars and teen preferences. No joke. This is the worst voicemail we've ever gotten. No, no.

1266
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:05,560
Ooh, an eight head, an African American. I mean, it started bad and it just got worse from there.

1267
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,400
Yeah, that's too bad. What's your opinion about me losing my virginity?

1268
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:15,480
I think that God doesn't smile upon it and neither do I. Let's move on to our next call.

1269
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:20,760
All right, here we go. Next one. We got Aldorn is next on the count of three. Let's

1270
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:27,880
blue Aldorn. One, two, three, go. Hey guys, I have a huge fucking problem. So huge, in fact,

1271
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:33,720
that it could be considered the biggest problem in the universe. That being how much I love

1272
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:39,800
Munchie and hate discord. I tried endless war. I swear to God, I gave it a fair shot,

1273
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:46,520
but it just sucks shit so bad. With that in mind, I absolutely require more Munchie content.

1274
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:50,920
Those episodes of stealing your dad, for example, would go a long way towards filling

1275
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:56,040
the hole in my heart. But it seems like that's the sort of thing that will eventually happen.

1276
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:01,560
And I just need to be patient for what I'm more concerned about is a little comic by the name of

1277
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,840
Investigator. Did this thing ever materialize? I searched for it, but all I could find was a

1278
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:11,960
Steam game by the same name. And that game looks fun, but it also doesn't seem like it was made

1279
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:17,080
by Munchie. So where the fuck is Investigator? Please tell me it wasn't just fucking a thing.

1280
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:24,520
This guy's out of the loop. Yeah, wow. Welcome to like 2017. I sort of resented because like, yeah,

1281
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:28,680
you've said like many times like, yeah, that project is not, I'm not working on it anymore.

1282
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:33,400
So like, where does this guy get off? Another public source announcement. Okay, but on the

1283
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:39,080
positive side, everyone, Munchie, we have previously instigated and continue to encourage

1284
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:45,160
a social media campaign to harass you on all mediums to release stealing your dad and whatever

1285
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:50,520
other shit. Release those emails. Release it. Release the dads. We need them. You know what?

1286
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,560
Actually, I've had a change of heart. You know, I'm going to do them right now. Wow,

1287
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:59,880
this has accomplished a whole lot, guys. Well, I thought they were done and you were just waiting

1288
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:06,120
to release them for no reason. Why would you think that? No, no. Ethan, Ethan's editing them for me

1289
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:11,000
like a good boy and he still has it. Is he really being a good boy? I said on like the last BGP that

1290
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:18,200
like Ethan is editing the stealing your dads. I am so clued in to the state of Munchie's content

1291
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:21,480
right now. Okay, I guess I was out of the loop. Didn't you say the first two are edited? It's

1292
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:27,240
the last one that's still waiting? No, he's doing like an intro for them. So I like technically

1293
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:31,800
the videos themselves, I guess, are done, but he's waiting for an intro. And you know,

1294
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:36,520
people may say to themselves, ah, but I don't care about the intro. I just want it to be released.

1295
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:40,440
But I mean, I don't know. Ethan wants there to be an intro. I want there to be an intro.

1296
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:46,120
I think it'd be cool. I owe you nothing. There's no reason for me to release them right now.

1297
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:51,560
There's no reason for me to do that. I have no incentive to do so. Well, the social media campaign.

1298
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:56,920
Hashtag finish the intro. Can we have them finished by Radcon 4 so we can have like

1299
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:02,360
Radcon 4 viewing of Radcon 3 content? Yeah, sure, I guess so. I don't know, maybe.

1300
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:06,760
Hey, somewhat unrelated, what's the status of the RFCK lecture?

1301
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:13,320
Oh, that can literally just be released, can't it? I'm pretty sure. Is it done?

1302
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:18,040
Well, no. Are you kidding me? No, Connor and Ethan like extensively talked about how they

1303
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:23,000
wanted to edit it. They're probably working on it then. Okay. Oh, God, you guys don't know? Oh,

1304
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,120
Jesus, I can tell nothing's been done. Well, how would I know? You can just tell.

1305
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:29,800
Probably nothing has been done. I don't know. Who's in charge? What's it matter? It will come out

1306
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:35,800
when it comes out. Oh, God, that's a nightmare of an attitude. Okay, anyway, let's just move on.

1307
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:41,640
You know what? Everyone's just waiting tooth and nail to wait for this lecture to come out.

1308
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:44,760
Everyone's just on the edge of their seats. I'm going to stop giving a shit eventually,

1309
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:47,560
Munchy. That's why you get it done as fast as possible. No, it's fine. Why do you give a

1310
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,600
shit right now? It's not out yet. The lecture would be better. The lecture would be better.

1311
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:55,160
That question doesn't deserve a response. The lecture would be better with visual cues

1312
01:54:55,160 --> 01:55:02,040
and imagery added to show what we're talking about. It's worth it, obviously. This has to

1313
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:09,400
be a meme. Okay, this guy. Oh, he tried Endless War, but where's the Munchy content? That's what

1314
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:12,360
is the Munchy content. If he actually liked me, then he would be in Endless War.

1315
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:17,320
Kind of. His grouping seems to be with Discord specifically. I don't know what that means.

1316
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:23,000
I mean, if Endless War is not his bag, that's fine. I mean, we're all heartbroken about no

1317
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,880
investigator, right? But you got to move on. Everyone's heartbroken that they have heard a

1318
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:33,800
project name before and they knew that a piece of art was going to happen, that something was

1319
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,560
going to happen, and then it didn't happen. Oh, I'm going to really mourn that.

1320
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,640
It's really strange. Oh my God, Munchy. You didn't hype the project up for little years.

1321
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:47,880
It's not about before the investigator, right? Munchy was just a guy who occasionally drew

1322
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:54,120
some pony art and avatars, and he was funny. Now that Munchy is clearly doing things,

1323
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:58,760
it doesn't matter. It was just exciting that Munchy was doing a project that was going to

1324
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:02,280
be a creative thing. Endless War is way cooler than Investigator could ever be.

1325
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:07,480
Unless you don't like Endless War. I mean, I think that Endless War is cool.

1326
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:15,000
I can understand if comics are more someone's bag than a free MMORPG playable inside of Discord.

1327
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,800
Just read the Lord of Ghosts. This is an Endless War comic.

1328
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:22,760
Yeah. Just write Investigator within the confines of the Lord of Ghosts comic.

1329
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:28,520
Dude, just release Investigator as a zine. Oh, there we go. Well, I can just outsource all the

1330
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:32,200
imaging for it. That one person that just approached us at the cafeteria bit, and I can just

1331
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:35,320
like, hey, dude, do you want to write for my zine? You want to draw for my zine, dude?

1332
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:40,600
Oh, yeah, perfect. I remember that. Damn it, I said I got another voicemail here.

1333
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:49,000
All right, next voicemail. This one. Yeah, fine. Okay. Okay, cool. You should be able

1334
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,640
to solve this. All right, put on your thinking caps, people, and click on this on three. One,

1335
01:56:53,640 --> 01:57:01,160
two, three, go. If a crab and a half weigh a pound and a half, and the half crab weighs half as much

1336
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:07,240
again as the whole crab, what do half of the whole crab and the whole of the half crab weigh?

1337
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:11,560
Oh my god, just cut that out. Just wait, he said one crab, I don't know.

1338
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:17,000
Well, he said that the half crab weighs half and again. So, does that mean that the half of a

1339
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,400
crab weighs 1.5 times as much as the whole crab? Right, do I have that right?

1340
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:28,760
I'm not going to lie. I could not follow all those words. I'm just lost. Okay, well,

1341
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:35,480
unless he misspoke there. It equals voicemail. If the half crab weighs half and again as much

1342
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:45,480
as the whole crab, then the half crab weighs 1.5 times. So, wait, so it's a pound and a half divided

1343
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:51,240
by five, and then times two would be the half crab. No, times three would be the half crab.

1344
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:55,960
Ben, tell me how about how you have a degree. Hold on. Hold on, I'm going to do it. I'm going

1345
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:05,000
to do it. I'm almost there. Okay. 1.5 divided by five times three. Wait, what? No, hold on.

1346
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:13,080
1.5 divided by five. Yeah, times, okay. The half, the half crab, wait, the half of the

1347
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:22,920
whole crab weighs 0.9 pounds and the whole of the half crab, no. Wait, wait, what? The whole of the

1348
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,160
half crab. I don't even know what that means. Oh, wait, there's like some rhetorical trickery

1349
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:31,240
happening here. It's just the half crab. It's a whole and a half. No, no, okay, but the way he

1350
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:35,480
said it, then like at the end he says the whole of the half crab and the half of the whole crab.

1351
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:40,360
Okay, well, they both weigh 0.9 pounds because both of those phrases refer to the same thing.

1352
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:46,280
Exactly. I.e. the half crab. There you go. That's our answer. Please let us know. Okay.

1353
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:51,640
Clip that whole bit with the half crab. That was a mistake. I fucking did it.

1354
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:59,640
Next voicemail. Okay, get ready for this. Wanna play Minecraft with us.jpeg on the count of three.

1355
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:05,240
One, two, three, go. Hey, PCP heads, do you like Minecraft? Do you hate Minecraft,

1356
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:10,040
but like Pokemon? Do you can be the very best like no one ever was? The PCP Minecraft server

1357
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:15,320
wants you to come and rock our socks. Dig a shitty hole in the ground, level up in the

1358
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:21,160
out and get rich, collect all the TMs, marvel at how Thosetamus doesn't sleep, mispronounce those

1359
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:27,080
Timmy's name, catch an Entei or just fucking lousy with Entei's, come see Victory Road where

1360
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:32,760
Seven Maniacs built their own continent to stage honorable combat. Wanna be the champion? Train

1361
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:37,560
a team and start fighting people. Just say you're the champion and dare anyone to prove you wrong.

1362
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:43,000
That's how Gary did it. You wanna be Gary, right? Hate Pokemon? Play the mods factorial

1363
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,520
ripped off instead. Lay conveyors, grind minerals, smelt the whole world and build a monument to

1364
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:55,000
your avarice. Wanna be a shitty wizard? We've got at least two brands of shitty wizardry.

1365
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Twist reality to your will. Become God and dare the world to oppose you. All on the PCP Minecraft server.

1366
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:19,160
We're doing what do you call them? You wanna do another one this week or next week?

1367
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:23,320
You guys can, I'm gonna be away. If I got time, yes.

1368
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:30,920
I want in the comments of this video, here's what I want. I want everyone watching this video to fill

1369
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:36,920
out a form. In the comments, okay, to differentiate your comments from the rest of the comments,

1370
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:46,680
I want you to do the following. Do a hashtag, like a PCP head form. I wanna give me your age,

1371
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:53,240
your gender, a short description of your bio, and then I want you to say something funny and I will

1372
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:56,680
give results of this form and the data that I collected next time. Don't forget those three

1373
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:00,680
wacky numbers in the back of mom's credit card. That's an important final addition.

1374
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:06,840
Sounds good. Okay, great. Just the three on the back. If we don't have the ones on the front,

1375
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,880
it doesn't even matter. The problem is American Express has four digits on the front of the

1376
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:17,160
credit card. I mean, that's, wow, we gotta think about those guys too. All right, anyway, let's go

1377
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:25,560
on to our next one. This is the number one hooligan, Fred and Shid warning. Okay, let's, I think I

1378
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:32,200
may have misspelled this, but let's see what he has to say for us. All right, one, two, three, go.

1379
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:45,720
This is a warning. Hool 3.0, the new formula. It has more probiotics, so when I consumed it a few

1380
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:52,920
more times after the first, it made me really gassy, made me fart and shit, and it smelled horrible,

1381
02:01:52,920 --> 02:02:01,320
like even worse than the first time. Also for the keto boys, he'll black addition, 50% less

1382
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:08,600
carbs for you. And it's also the 3.0. Black addition. Yeah, they have a black addition. Yeah,

1383
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:14,200
that's the new kind. That sounds cool. Let me check that out. It still has, I think, 10 or 11 carbs

1384
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:20,040
per shake. I mean, that's not zero. That's not a nightmare. That's not terrible. Can you maintain

1385
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:25,640
ketosis? I bought some ice cream. I bought some halo top ice cream, which is low. It's low calorie

1386
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:30,440
ice cream. Oh yeah, it's so good. But it also has a pretty low, it's like, it's like 20 grams of

1387
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:33,240
sugar for like the whole pint. So you could eat like a bit in response. Yeah, that's right, that's

1388
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:38,120
right. But I also got this other stuff called rebel, which is like four grams of carbs for a

1389
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:46,200
whole pint. So like nothing. Damn, not bad. It's epic. All right, let's wrap it up here. We got

1390
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:53,640
double Satan here, our final caller, double man. All right, let's get to it. Here we go. Three, two,

1391
02:02:53,640 --> 02:03:03,560
one, go. Hello, hello. I, I am, am double, double Satan, Satan. And, and I am, am here, here,

1392
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:11,640
to, to tell, tell you, you, to, to suck, suck my, my double, double dick, dick all the way, way down,

1393
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:18,280
down to, to double, double, hell, hell. Go, go, double, double, fuck, fuck yourself, yourself.

1394
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:27,000
Especially, especially Ben, Ben, Saint, Saint. Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

1395
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:34,680
Yeah, well, I mean, we got what was promised. I don't know why the double voice is so funny to me.

1396
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:40,200
That was great. I loved it. So, so, go back again, double Satan. I feel like we're from

1397
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:46,760
double God. Can double God call it? Is this like the new arch enemy to double Batman? It's gotta be

1398
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:51,320
related to double Batman. The, maybe double Batman died and this is he went to double hell.

1399
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:55,720
Well, when the double Batman died, Satan probably just like sucked him up and ate him like Kirby.

1400
02:03:55,720 --> 02:04:02,520
And uh, he got the double. This is his copy ability. I get it. It's like, like, like, like by the law of

1401
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:08,840
conservation of doubleness, we know that there can't be two doubles at once. So, first say double

1402
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:13,640
Satan to exist, double Batman had to end. Initially, I was imagining like it had two heads,

1403
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:19,160
but the idea of him having a speech impediment, just saying it again. That's much more endearing.

1404
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:25,960
All right, fuck it. That's the last voicemail, people. Speak, pipe, link down below. Leave us

1405
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:30,760
more voicemails. They're always fun to listen to and leave. No, it's false. I'll make them good,

1406
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:35,880
or you'll go straight to hell and I'll ignore you. That's it. So, hey, support the show,

1407
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:41,320
patreon.com slash the procrastiners. We're not on our channel right now, but hopefully we will be

1408
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:48,280
soon. That'll be nice. That'll be nice. Bonus episodes are still available. You can get them

1409
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:52,760
from the patreon and they're going to be around and also on the on the discord, which you also get

1410
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:58,040
access to for just $1 and for $5, get the bonus episodes. You know what is there's 34, including

1411
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:03,560
a new one that just came out. There was a little comic talk, which me and Tom bombed into later

1412
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:08,040
on. We talked about all kinds of stuff. It was a good time. It was a good time. So that's it. We'll

1413
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:12,280
see you there. Follow us on Twitter for all updates. We'll let you know there updates of the

1414
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:17,000
channel stats and all that stuff at TPCrastinators on Twitter. I would highly recommend you follow

1415
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,600
that for any kind of updates if you want to know what the channel is doing. And that pretty much

1416
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:26,280
sums it up right there. So we will see you soon. I'll be back next week calling in from a distant

1417
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:30,840
location. Other than that, it should be a normal episode and looking forward to it, everybody.

1418
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:36,440
All right. See you then next week. Radcon Force coming up everybody. 15,000 donation

1419
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:41,720
dollar reduced. Let's get Brad Garlinghouse given a lecture. It's going to be incredible.

1420
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:45,880
Check out the Kickstarter for all the details on that. I'm so afraid, but so tantalized of

1421
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:50,920
Brad Garlinghouse. If we can just make all the kind of, if we can invest all our earnings

1422
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:56,040
from the Radcon Kickstarter in Ripple, we'll go to the moon. Imagine it ladies and gentlemen,

1423
02:05:56,040 --> 02:06:03,000
all right, see you next week on the moon. See you then. Bye.
