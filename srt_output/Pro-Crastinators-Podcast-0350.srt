1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I won't bless that guy. That's son of a bitch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Or son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Or son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello, and welcome to another episode, another normal episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the world's oldest anarchy voicemail podcast.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Simsie made that joke the other day and I stole it.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're back, baby. My co-host was feeling a bit under the weather today, but that wouldn't stop her from being on. We'll keep the episode short, but she's here.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why don't you remind the audience who you are?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello, I'm Gibbontake. I'm happy to be on The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
May I eat beans on toast for tea? Long live the queen.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I could not agree more. Sorry, everyone. If you hear construction sounds or hammering the demons building the house next to me on behalf of a landlord, they just have no solidarity for me or for you.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You know what to do. You know what must be done.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, so let's get into it. What did we do this week?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Me, myself, I have been working quite a bit on the website, the new redesigned website.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want to have an archive of all the episodes and not just the episodes, but like other stuff besides the episodes, too, like the Digi's decompression chambers and the hyperbolic wine chambers and maybe most of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers episodes, you know, the ones that were uploaded here, stuff like that.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What else did I, you know what, let me check.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I, the real Gibbontake, look forward to the completion of the new Pro Crastinators Podcast website. Will the site host issues of our upcoming digital comic design, the Perfect Party Podcast?

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right, Gibb. It sure will. The site, you said you were going to work on getting the branding and icons on.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Honestly, it's taken a long time just for me to get the episodes because like most of the episodes, I have them in MP3 format already, but a lot of them and a lot of the other non-episode stuff, I needed to download the episode and then as a video and then run it through the Vegas and export it as an MP3 to get an MP3 version.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So yeah, the podcast episodes and side content and also like the interviews from way back when, those things I think should go on there.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you've got, audience, if you've got any recommendations for like content from this channel that you think should be available in MP3 format on the website, let me know in the comments and I will take suggestions.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I might have forgotten about some things and you might, if you remind me of them, I'll be like, oh yeah, and I'll throw them in. I'll put them in, you know, the master list.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So there'll be a PCP MP3 archive, there'll be a page for like stuff, you know, like just things, okay, the dojin will go on there and the road to Radcon text, well illustrated PDF, those things I think will make public digitally, sort of as the site debuts and it'll sort of be like, hey, there's a new website and it includes this stuff.

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That has been promised and that's where it's published.

25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So we'll probably release that all at once together and also like links to things like the PCP dating sim.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know, just let me know in the comments what you think the website should have hosted on it available for download or at least links to because I am trying to put it all in there.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm trying to keep the layout really simple, just a simple hub where you go there and there's links to like what do you want to find and you just click it and there's a list and you just download content.

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We bought a new domain, PerfectPartyPodcast.com, we own that now.

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It was actually cheaper, new suggested, we buy PerfectComic.Party, that was actually more expensive than PerfectComicParty.com, so we just got that one instead.

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We already own the ProcrastinatorsPodcast.com, so I guess we'll probably keep using that.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I haven't worked out the hosting yet, the website is not completely built, but it's getting there, it's getting there.

32
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My real human brain has had its neurons occupied with drawing the next chapter of Clarissa Gunsmoke.

33
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The next chapter is done and ready to be published in the first issue of the Peer Effect comic party.

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, I saw you announce that on Twitter and I saw you streaming afterwards.

35
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Very exciting that the next chapter of Clarissa Gunsmoke is ready to go.

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
For me, I know I said, alright, here's my struggle, here's a struggle that I'm having.

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I said that I wanted to work on Biscopades and I do, because as I've said many times, some of the ideas that I had for Biscopades, I was really excited about.

38
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I thought, well, I think they're good and they would be fun.

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I read through Biscopades again. I don't think I read through all of it, but I read through most of it.

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And here's the truth. I was dismayed by what I saw.

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I remember and it was intentional that the art was very simple.

42
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What I did not remember, reading through a lot of it, it wasn't just simple.

43
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A lot of it was sloppy. A lot of it was sloppy and you couldn't even really tell.

44
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It was sort of hard to tell what was going on in a panel and I was very disheartened and I was very disappointed and I'm not happy with it.

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I went through a minute there where I was like, maybe this was not even good.

46
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Maybe this does not deserve to be continued.

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I've mulled it over and I think that where I'm at with it now is, okay, some of it was good.

48
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There were some pages and some panels of it that work it, but a lot of it was disappointingly sloppy.

49
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And also it's like, I don't know, I don't really like how just a home stuck it is, how it's clearly just an MSPFA.

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think that's kind of lame and I think I want to try. Here's where I'm at with it though.

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think that rather than abandon it, because the ideas in it I still like,

52
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think the move is to just try and make it better going forward.

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm going to see it as like the next chunk of it is going to come out. I'm not going to post it on Twitter.

54
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's going to come out in the Perfect Party podcast.

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So I'll draw it for that with the idea that maybe some people who have never read it before will be seeing it for the first time

56
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and it will be their first impression of it and I'll just have to make it good going forward.

57
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I feel like I have a slightly higher standard of visual clarity that I want to hold to going forward

58
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and I want to, I don't know, hopefully that will maybe impress some people that maybe weren't impressed before.

59
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, that's it. And maybe I'll play with the format. Maybe I'll change the format up a little bit,

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because before it was made for MSPFA, now it's going to be made for a zine.

61
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Maybe that means that the text format and stuff should be a little different.

62
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know. But I'm going to, I was tempted to give up on it there for a minute.

63
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't think that's the move. And besides, you know, the Perfect Party podcast, what do we say?

64
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The Perfect Comic Party, literally the point of it is it's the lie we tell ourselves, right?

65
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We decided that we were going to do it so that we would have something that we must get work done for no matter what.

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like we're obligated to make some content to put in this periodical, right?

67
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So I have to do that. So it's, it's, the decision's been made for me. I can't just give up.

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have to do something. And Beescapades is what I was going to do. And I might as well do it, because that's, that was the point.

69
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So we'll see. I haven't actually started drawing anything. I think I said last week that maybe I said, well, I didn't.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, I fucking didn't. Okay. I've been working on stuff. I've been working on related things, the website.

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Had to make some, was going over the book again. There are some things to change about the Slime and Punishment book.

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What else? That's not, that's definitely not everything I've been doing.

73
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm spiraling. I'm spiraling. Oh, yeah, I started working on it. I started with, with the book, with the Slime and Punishment book after print,

74
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I had some time to start looking at the next lecture and trying to plan out the next lecture a little bit.

75
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, yeah, I think, I think I mentioned that I was considering doing a like History of Digi Bro lecture.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think my idea has changed. I could still do that, but I think maybe what, what would make a little more sense right now,

77
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
is if the next lecture that I did would be like a history of the PCP lecture, like specifically the PCP.

78
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And this is not going to be a big hit. It's not going to be a hit in the way that the Mega Man was, right?

79
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because Mega Man is popular and people want to hear about that. So my goal is, is not that.

80
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But I do think that the story, history of the PCP is interesting, explaining all the different people that were involved,

81
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
where they came from, what happened, where they went.

82
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So I do think it's worthy of a video, even if it's not going to do gangbusters the way Mega Man did.

83
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But my idea is that in doing so, if I make that, I think it will maybe draw attention to us and to the website

84
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and also to the Perfect Comic Party. And I think I can sort of do it not only as content, but also as a sort of outreach advertisement.

85
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
For like, we've started a new endeavor over here and this is our history.

86
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This will get you up to speed on who we are. And by the way, throwing it at the end, yeah, we're doing a new thing.

87
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We're doing this new digital zine. And I don't know, I just think it's a sensible synergy.

88
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
While you were speaking just now, I ran over 18 trillion prediction subroutines analyzing possible outcomes.

89
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I concur with your conclusion. Pip pip, cheerio, govna.

90
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Wow, truly remarkable. Hey, on the subject of comics I drew that are, that I'm ashamed of.

91
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Slime and punishment. Printing now. They are, they are working on getting my test copies printed.

92
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They sent me a freaking email, not an email, they sent me a message being like, hey, Ben, we actually, we sent you the wrong templates.

93
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, audience, I am pretty sure that I might have, if I talked about this before, I'm sorry, I don't understand anything anymore.

94
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't keep track of my thoughts. The world is too chaotic a place.

95
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They sent me a message being like, we sent you the wrong template. Here, have it again, and make it again.

96
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, I think I did talk about this with Oblivion. Or maybe I said that on a voice call. I don't fucking know anymore.

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Whatever. They gave me the wrong size and I had to redo it. And it was like the tiniest little change they had to make.

98
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I just had to scooch the title text that's supposed to be centered on the spine. I just had to scooch it over a couple of millimeters.

99
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But the fact that the file sizes are so huge and freaking manga studio kept crashing and it literally took me like four hours.

100
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And because I had to fuck around with all the different layers and things like that and redo the shading around it that made the lettering pop.

101
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It took me four hours just to make these tiny little changes and send it back to What's Your Name.

102
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And it was like, okay, now we'll go ahead. So I assume that has set the whole printing process back at least a week.

103
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What can you do? But anyway, I've been feeling dread and terror about the kick starting it.

104
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And the reason why is basically just that I always kind of assumed, right, I started drawing slime and punishment back in like freaking 2019.

105
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And at that time, the Vapors 2 Kickstarter was running and the Vapors 2 Kickstarter did, as far as I'm concerned, it did gangbusters.

106
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It made $12,000, way more than I expected it to make.

107
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I kind of just assumed, I always just sort of assumed that like my next slime and punishment book, it's a bigger book, it's in full color.

108
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And also it's, you know, and it's the next one. So it'll do even better and it's like bigger and better, so it'll sell even more.

109
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And it'll make, I just assumed it would do better for all these various reasons.

110
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And I'm starting to wonder if maybe I can't assume that anymore for a variety of reasons and these reasons fill me with dread.

111
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Reason one, I just think I'm not as popular anymore.

112
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I think I gotta face the facts and I gotta look at the reality of the situation and I just don't have the reach and I don't have the clout that I did in 2019.

113
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Not that I had a huge amount of it or anything, but I feel like I have less of it now.

114
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I think, you know, I feel like it's possible that that will just mean, you know, I'm gonna sell less.

115
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And there's, I don't know, there's nothing I can do about it.

116
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And the other thing is that slime and punishment is the fact that it references Chris Chan that it contains, like, that it includes content that is Chris Chan relevant is poison, is toxic.

117
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I genuinely think that I'm gonna need, I might be able to, I might talk about that on like Twitter, but I think on the, on like the actual like campaign website for the Kickstarter, I think I have to just not mention it at all.

118
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Like, I think if I mention it anywhere, it will like, I genuinely think that the average person, either they don't know what that means, either they don't know who that is, or if they do know, they are like disgusted by it.

119
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And they're like, I don't want anything to do with this shit.

120
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't think, I guess at one point, I kind of thought that maybe it would be a draw, like, because it's like, because, because Chris Chan is sort of like famous and this is like a thing that is associated with her.

121
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And that might be like good for reach and sales.

122
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't think so anymore.

123
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I think it's, I think it's toxic.

124
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So I think I need, I think I need to maybe minimize that maybe I can try and talk about it on Twitter and generate some like outrage interest with that angle.

125
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But like on the current, I honestly think that if I mentioned that on Kickstarter, like the campaign might get banned.

126
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know if they maybe that's, maybe that's catastrophizing a little bit.

127
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say it's impossible or anything.

128
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So, you know, these are these are the reasons why I'm like, the campaign, I could see the campaign underperforming, which would be a huge disappointment because I've sort of been looking forward to Kickstarter in this book for, you know, years.

129
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But what are you going to do?

130
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm going to do my best.

131
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Please buy my book when it's when the campaign goes live.

132
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Even if it doesn't do sales like Vapors 2 did, even if it only, even if it only sells, you know, more like Vapors 1, that would be okay.

133
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know, I would not consider that a failure if it like really fails, then I'll be very, you know, sad.

134
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then I'll, then Cheesy will make fun of me because I made fun of him for clown milk and he will, he will get to have that over on me.

135
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't let Cheesy have that over, don't let him win.

136
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't let him win by my book.

137
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Cheesy Manfredo, the comic artist who loves clowns and is a clown.

138
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I think that clowns are funny.

139
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They're comedic antics amused and delight me.

140
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Vriska.

141
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's right.

142
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You are, you are so right.

143
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm really on the ball today.

144
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Anyway, what did I, what did I do this week?

145
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What happened this week?

146
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay, I have a freaking anecdote.

147
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I have a freaking anecdote for you if you can even believe such a thing.

148
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So I got message by this guy on Discord.

149
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
His name was Neil Fox.

150
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And he said, you know what, let me, let me, I'll have the, I'll have the conversation right here so I can refer to it.

151
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He, he messaged me and told me that he has a radio show.

152
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And he was like, would you like to be on, he was like, he said, would you, would you like to be on my radio show for an upcoming investigative report on bronies?

153
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And I was like, I said, I said radio show, tell me more.

154
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Because like, that sounds interesting.

155
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I mean, I don't know why he would want to be, I mean, I guess I could see why he'd want me on a show about bronies.

156
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So whatever.

157
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So he said, tell me more.

158
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And he said, well, since you, well, since you were a bronie, the name you know me by is draw ponies.

159
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And the thing about that is that I had never heard that name before.

160
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So I told him, no, I'm not familiar with that.

161
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I also Googled it.

162
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And the only things I could find from someone called draw ponies were things from those guys at horse news who were like the edgy asshole counterpart.

163
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
They tried to be like the counterpart to Equestria Daily.

164
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They were a bunch of edgy like channers and shit.

165
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
They sucked.

166
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But they wrote like a thing about how like some guy called draw ponies was caught tracing.

167
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He was caught tracing his art from the show.

168
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And you believe it, shameful.

169
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, so I say, so I tell him, anyway, that's all I can find about this guy.

170
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But he, I don't know, he says that like he's famous or something.

171
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So I say, I don't know who that is.

172
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And he says, oh, no worries.

173
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's been forever.

174
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I was a minor bit player in the Brony saga.

175
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And, and this really sets me off.

176
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, this sets my red, this is a red flag.

177
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Because first, he just assumes that I know who I am, who he is, even though he's irrelevant.

178
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Second, and then I say, no, I don't.

179
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And he's like, well, you, it's been forever.

180
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Like you must have known at one point, but you must have forgot, right?

181
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I don't like it.

182
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And then he says, he's hosting a radio show called Predators about online cults.

183
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then he links to a Twitter for a Twitter account called the Satoshi show,

184
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
which has no followers and no tweets and is completely blank.

185
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So I'm like, okay.

186
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So I like forgot to respond to that, because I didn't know what to say.

187
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And then he messages me like a week later, and he's like, and he says this,

188
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I hope you were doing well.

189
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let me know when you would like to be on, to be interviewed for the radio.

190
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Perhaps we could talk about the making of your Mega Man video.

191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That could be content for you as well.

192
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If you'd like, we can record with riverside.fm and I can edit into a video for our channels,

193
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
basically a behind the scenes video for you.

194
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay.

195
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So one, I don't know what Riverside FM is.

196
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Two, the fact that he thinks that I would want to just like post,

197
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that it would be content for me, that I would post our conversation.

198
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No.

199
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Second, third of all, and then the fact that he just assumes,

200
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
he doesn't ask, hey, do you want to be on?

201
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He asks like, when do you want to be on?

202
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
As though I've already agreed to it.

203
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And then he links me some Discord server.

204
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And anyway, all these things together, I got really bad vibes and it pissed me off.

205
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I told him, I didn't agree to this and I don't like your attitude.

206
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And no, I'm not coming on your show.

207
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And so I think some people might say that that was me.

208
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Some people might say that I was overly aggressive.

209
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
However, I was immediately proven correct because here's the thing.

210
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
To me, he says like, oh, sorry.

211
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

212
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm autistic and I don't understand social graces.

213
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I thought tell me more meant you meant yes.

214
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I'm like, no, it just meant I wanted to know more.

215
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I said the vibes are off.

216
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And he says, oh, thanks for your time.

217
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No problem.

218
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then he goes on Twitter and it turns out he's got like 8,000 followers on Twitter.

219
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
From a show that I don't really think is real.

220
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't think it exists.

221
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He seems like some kind of weird drama hound.

222
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And maybe he's got a podcast which he calls a regular show, a radio show.

223
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And anyway, this guy, and he posts, he asked me and he posts a public post that's like Ben St.

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is what he said to one autistic fan.

225
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ben St. harassed autistic fan, told him his vibes were off and he didn't like his attitude or whatever.

226
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So he posts this stupid like drama mongering, gotcha thing.

227
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And I thought it was funny.

228
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So I retweeted it.

229
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But then I un-retweeted it because I don't want to give this guy free cloud because he seems like he sucks.

230
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So anyway, that was my adventure with Neil Fox, who claims to, you know, he claims to be Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin.

231
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We found his Twitter, and his Twitter was like, I don't know.

232
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It just seemed like a bunch of like obviously false claims that like maybe were meant to be parroted.

233
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Like he claims to have like two million listeners.

234
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Like no, he fucking doesn't.

235
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't know.

236
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It just seems like a scumbag.

237
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I'm glad I was mean to him.

238
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm always right when I mean to somebody.

239
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And that was that.

240
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Satoshi Nakamoto, born 5th April 1975, is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin,

241
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
authored the Bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed Bitcoin's original reference implementation.

242
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database.

243
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Nakamoto was active in the development of Bitcoin up until December 2010.

244
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There has been widespread speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity,

245
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
with a variety of people posited as the person or persons behind the name.

246
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Though Nakamoto's name is Japanese, and he stated in 2012 that he was a man living in Japan,

247
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
most of the speculation has involved software and cryptography experts in the United States or Europe.

248
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hmm, interesting.

249
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds right.

250
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I think that's probably true.

251
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Anyway, let's see.

252
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What else?

253
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do I have anything else here?

254
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh yeah, I was annoyed to see the latest, what do you call it?

255
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Genosamuel Christian documentary dropped.

256
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I guess I'm referenced in it.

257
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I didn't watch it, because I don't watch those videos, and I didn't want to hear it,

258
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and it seemed unpleasant, and I didn't think I wanted to hear what he had to say about me.

259
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:27,000
People tell me that he mentions my lecture, and he mentions some tweets that I made at Christian about Andrew Yang.

260
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And I'm sure, I don't know, I still didn't watch it.

261
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm sure that he probably reads it as though I was being serious, and when I was definitely not.

262
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So I'm sure that he reads my intent wrong, and I'm sure that he misrepresents me as more of a loser than I am.

263
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm not saying I'm not a big loser, but he probably makes me look worse than I actually am.

264
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So whatever, I don't watch his videos.

265
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I tried two or three episodes ago, and I just found his voice really annoying, and I couldn't deal with it.

266
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It was dead, and I don't know, just annoying.

267
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I thought his delivery was bad.

268
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He sounded really flat, I might even say robotic.

269
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You know what I mean?

270
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Ben, that was pretty insensitive of you to call Gino the R word.

271
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
There's nothing wrong with being robotic, and I'm triggered hearing you imply that there is.

272
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Shit. I'll try to be better. I'm working on it. I'm working on myself.

273
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Listen, I'm learning. I'm learning.

274
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm just a white man learning in this fucked up world.

275
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Alright, well, you know, what else can I say?

276
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Life is a nightmare, and nothing else happened.

277
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I guess my family came and visited me this week.

278
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
My sister is, like, moving.

279
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
My sister is, like, moving back to Massachusetts from Tennessee.

280
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If you might remember listeners, you might remember my sister was the one that shouted,

281
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You're a dog. You're a dog, and I'm sick of it.

282
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Intonates microphone that one time.

283
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Anyway, she's moving back to Massachusetts.

284
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
She's a tattoo artist, by the way.

285
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
She can stop by, and my parents stop by, because they had to meet and give her some documents or something.

286
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But they decided just to meet at my house, because it was a convenient spot,

287
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and to include me in it, so I could see her again for the first time in a couple months, I think.

288
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You're no longer than that.

289
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So that was fun. It was nice.

290
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Chatted a little bit.

291
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They will not stop, my mom especially, will not stop mentioning how much money my sister makes.

292
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I guess she's a tattoo artist.

293
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, I know she's a tattoo artist, and I guess she has a pretty loyal clientele,

294
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and I guess she has a pretty, I don't know exactly how big, but I guess she's got a pretty big following online,

295
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and I guess she makes good money doing tattoos,

296
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and I guess she's been selling these art pieces, these painted boards.

297
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
She paints these wooden boards and sells them on some website called...

298
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It wasn't Etsy. It was something else that I hadn't really heard of, whatever.

299
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Anyway, I guess she makes a ton of money doing it, so good for her.

300
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I wish... could they just leave me alone about it, please?

301
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Could they just... do they have to rub my face in it like that?

302
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You know, it's fine. I'm happy for her. Just don't be annoying.

303
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Mom!

304
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So anyway, that's all I did. What did you do this? What happened? What's this?

305
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I've been drawing Clarissa Gunsmoke. I've been streaming on Twitch.

306
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I've been playing Fire Emblem, Shadow Dragon, and the Blade of Laiite.

307
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I've been Depression. I've been Therapist Transgender Hormones,

308
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Boobies February, Vriska Music Dad, British.

309
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, it's nice to hear you're keeping busy.

310
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
There's a new chapter of One Piece this week, but I know you said you're not feeling good,

311
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so let's save that for next week and be able to do two chapters in one week.

312
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What do you think?

313
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
One Piece, stylized in all caps, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Aichiro Oda.

314
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It has been serialized in Shueisha's Shonen manga magazine, Weekly Shonen Jump, since July 1997,

315
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
with its individual chapters compiled into 104 Tankobon volumes as of November 2022.

316
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's right. Very good. Okay. Well, you know, let's just go to voicemails.

317
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You know, I think I'm ready. Let's do it.

318
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Alright, first voicemail says, Happy Birthday Ben. Thanks.

319
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Second one is called Liberals from SonicAtSez.com.

320
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

321
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What's up, kids? Sonic says, If a labial tells you to fight for Bowden, that's no good.

322
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What was this voicemail? Written by AI or something?

323
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Again, Ben, insensitive. There could be AIs in the audience who struggle with reading comprehension.

324
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
How do you think that sort of comment makes them feel?

325
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, I guess that's true. I guess as a marginalized group, they do need more rights.

326
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I guess we should set aside a certain quota of jobs for them.

327
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I guess, yeah, I'm saying we should affirm. We should affirmative action AI.

328
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You know, why not? Why not? They're better than us. Just like real minorities.

329
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay, next one is My Apology from Sonic.Sez. Three, two, one, go.

330
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I would like to sincerely apologize for my last voicemail.

331
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I've been struggling recently with a lot of substance abuse.

332
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm sorry. Recently, I got hooked on speed.

333
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Ever since, I just don't know what to do. I just got to go fast.

334
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I just got to go fast. And I hope you can forgive me.

335
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Jeez, uncomfortable.

336
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Well, I'm glad you... Are you sorry? Are you sorry because you said not to fight for Bowden?

337
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Or are you sorry because of your right-wing propaganda?

338
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Or are you sorry because you mixed up the vowels? I don't know. Both equally bad.

339
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Alright, next one. We've got Kong A. Luya. Three, baby. Let's freaking go.

340
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
One, two, three, let's go.

341
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And stretches arms, how to yell.

342
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
In fridges fight a big balloon and float real high.

343
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And pay this too, this crazy call. Just it's the Kong A. Luya.

344
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Kong A. Luya.

345
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm looking at the lyrics right now.

346
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And I see you're taking the lyrics and you're sort of transposing them into the original rap into the Hallelujah song with a couple changes to make them fit.

347
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And you know it's a good bit. It's successful. It's working for me. Appreciate what you're doing.

348
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Next one is called... Oh, we got a freaking image here.

349
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Let's go. Let's freaking go.

350
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Oh, is this sound? No, it's a video. It's a GIF.

351
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay, Pokemon Race, low IQ. I did Brock through walls twice. No.

352
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Pokemon Race, high IQ.

353
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay, this is... I'm struggling to recall. Did Mage just catch a Butterfree and was excited to catch a Butterfree or something?

354
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I kind of don't remember. This is Mage, right? She's purple and whatever. Got horns.

355
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I kind of don't remember what the reference is.

356
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay, wait, all right. Stop me if I'm misremembering.

357
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Because I remember Nate did some glitches and I just did more of them.

358
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I didn't... I think did we both do Brock skip but only I did Brock through walls?

359
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Or are those the same thing?

360
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's either Nate did Brock through walls but I did Brock skip also or the other way around. It's one of those.

361
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's not just that I did Brock through walls twice because he knew about them.

362
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
One of them was too hard and he didn't do it. I think he probably did Brock skip because I think that's easier than Brock through walls.

363
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Or are they the same? Do you Brock through walls by skipping Brock?

364
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You have to do that thing where you stop in front of the guy and save on that frame and then you reload your game and it lets you go through.

365
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Does that cause Brock skip or does that let you walk through walls? I don't remember.

366
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I actually forgot how to do it. But ha ha, Mage caught a Butterfree.

367
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:14,000
True Pokemon Masters fight with their favorites as Karen? Is the blonde lady Karen in black? I don't remember.

368
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Good stuff. Why is this an MP4? Why isn't this a gift?

369
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Next one is called Wido.

370
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's another image. Let's take a look.

371
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Why are his legs short? Is it that he looks really stumpy?

372
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I mean the answer is that I was lazy and I just drew it really fast. I'm sloppy.

373
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah, I don't know what else you could be referring to.

374
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't know. He's chibi. He's got little legs. He's little doxons.

375
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't know what you want from me, man. I don't know what you freaking want from me.

376
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Or is it just that his butt is prominent? Because that's just pony. That's just what pony is like.

377
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You gotta get over that.

378
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Next one is called Just Do It. 3, 2, 1, go.

379
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ben, I've decided to do the impossible. I'm going to go where no one has ever gone before.

380
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll actually read your comics and you know what that means.

381
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That means you have from today until however long it takes for the average person to read your silly pictograms

382
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
to actually start making comics again.

383
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Like you could take one or two hours a week of the time you've sat aside to watching Picnic Adventure

384
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and listen for the sound bites of Disney to actually make, I don't know, one page of Beastly Pages.

385
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Like one page of Beastly Pages a week. That should be doable, right? Please, man.

386
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Actually drawing Beastly Pages usually doesn't take that long.

387
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I need to like just plan out what I want to happen in the next chapter

388
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because you know what we're going to do on the perfect comic party? It's going to be like a chapter of it.

389
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's not going to be like one page at a time like it was on Twitter.

390
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So I just need to plan out what I want to happen in this chapter.

391
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Most of the pages of drawing Beastly Pages take no time at all.

392
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I want to take a little more time in it because like I said some of the panels, especially in the early ones,

393
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
are sloppy to the point that I don't think it's cute, I don't think it's stylistic,

394
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I just think it's lazy and looks bad and makes it hard to read and hurts the comic.

395
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I take no pleasure in reporting that, obviously.

396
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But looking back over it was definitely not all the time, but enough of the time that I started to cringe at it.

397
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But still, it's pretty fast to draw.

398
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm going to do minimal gif animating because it's not compatible with PDF download.

399
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I mean, I'll do it if I think a scene really needs it and then it'll just be like,

400
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
look at the animated version on my website or whatever.

401
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But I'm not going to do it unless I really think it's important.

402
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A static panel will suffice most of the time.

403
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Anyway, thanks for reading my comics.

404
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm sorry to say it's not going to take you very long.

405
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You can probably read all of the vapors and all that you can easily read them in a couple hours, probably.

406
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Slime and punishment might take a little bit longer.

407
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
No, I think it would probably still just take a couple hours, if that.

408
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You could read all my stuff in one day.

409
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Sad but true.

410
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Alright, and the next one is called Addendum 321 Go.

411
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Should I read? It's also ugly.

412
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Is that like your old work you're too embarrassed about to actually recommend to people?

413
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because if that is the case, I'll definitely read it.

414
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, I think some of it's kind of embarrassing.

415
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't really think that it's good.

416
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't think it's... I think there's a couple of them.

417
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I know there's a couple of them that I think some people could find funny and like, that's fine.

418
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't really like them, so they're not like prominently on my website.

419
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
They're sort of in their own section, and you can look at them if you want.

420
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So, sort of, kind of...

421
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Check them out if you feel like it, I guess.

422
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Next one is called Am I Crazy from Prince Isolation at Twitter 321 Go.

423
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I...

424
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh my god.

425
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The picture that Cheesy pulled up of the gollywag, like, racist doll in the last episode,

426
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I looked at it, and I was like, oh, you can just remove the racist features from this, right?

427
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Maybe, like, you know, you just change it.

428
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And I made a connection in my brain, and it looks exactly like the poppy playtime dolls that you see everywhere now.

429
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Like, it doesn't really look like it, because it's not black, and it's not racist,

430
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
but there's a vibe, and the vibe is, like, eerily similar.

431
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Even the way that it's, like, laying there in the picture...

432
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's got that same mouth, I guess.

433
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
...is exactly like the way that those playtime dolls feel.

434
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
What the f... What the fuck? Am I... Am I crazy? Am I...

435
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see.

436
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
...skish-skish-skish, right here.

437
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Tell me. Bye-bye.

438
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Um, I'm gonna say probably...

439
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
No, you're not crazy. No, it's definitely got the mouth.

440
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That is... yeah, it's friendly-looking, and it's just kind of offensive in a racialized context.

441
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But, you know, removed from that context in this... in the context of poppy.

442
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You know, it's just fine, I think.

443
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So, I think I agree with you.

444
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Duh... Where did... Where did... Where did they get it?

445
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I wonder if that... Did they get it from there? I don't know, but I think it's fine.

446
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It works for what they were going for.

447
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Also, I don't know what poppy's playtime is.

448
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I can see from a quick Google search that it's some kind of a cute thing that's actually scary.

449
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Haha, cool.

450
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Uh, next one is called, um... Oh, it's another image.

451
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yes, uh, let us behold.

452
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Hmm.

453
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Okay, what do we got here?

454
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm gonna try and read this from the first.

455
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Bigger, goth, Ben, uh, whatever.

456
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Nose piercing.

457
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
How did I become so ugly, exact the same for 20 years?

458
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
What are tend to marketable Ben plushie?

459
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So, the trick to those guys is... What is... In the bottom left, um...

460
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm wearing, like, a safari hat, and there's, like, some kind of cat serpent biting my face?

461
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, wait, this is a reference to something.

462
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
This is a reference to something, and I'm an idiot for not getting it.

463
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Okay, in the middle is the dragon look-gib.

464
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
They love us, and we're being hugged by a dragon?

465
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Or grabbed by a dragon?

466
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I feel like these are references I should get.

467
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Okay, bottom, throwing the birthday boy hat on the floor.

468
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
When you're 30, when you're 34, you don't like having birthdays.

469
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's grim.

470
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Uh, next one in the middle... Middle right, artist.

471
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Kill all... This one's just funny.

472
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This one rules, and I'm proud to be a self-hating artist, yeah.

473
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I told our... Ooh, bump the mic.

474
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I told my mom during the visit.

475
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
This is before my sister got there, but my mom was, like...

476
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I think she was asking about, like...

477
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't know, she was talking about my sister and about tattoo art and stuff.

478
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I think she asked me about, like, how my art was going, and I said, like...

479
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I said, like...

480
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah, art is worthless. Art is just a waste of time.

481
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Art is just a trick people do to get attention.

482
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Uh, it's just marketing. It's not valuable to society.

483
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Uh, and I stand by all that, of course.

484
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And, um...

485
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
She... And my mom was like...

486
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
She gave a really stupid answer. She gave a really stupid, annoying answer.

487
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Her answer was, like, oh, you wouldn't think that if you saw what your sister is making,

488
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and, like, way to fucking miss the point.

489
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Like, yes, I know it can make money.

490
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I know that art can make money. That's not what I'm saying.

491
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm saying it's worthless. Do you understand?

492
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Do you fucking get it?

493
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Mom!

494
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Ugh, don't understand me!

495
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Alright. Next...

496
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Anyway, kill all artists, definitely.

497
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Next one...

498
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Okay, up in the top right, there's, like, a signature killer.

499
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That is exactly me when I see a meme.

500
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I point at it and go cross-eyed.

501
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Well, such is the way of things.

502
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Uh, next voicemail is, uh, we got another image.

503
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Disgusting.

504
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Let's, let's look. Let's peep in.

505
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, look at me. I'm a little Rick and Morty.

506
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Haha, you really, you really are.

507
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Uh, where...

508
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Where are we?

509
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
There's a, like, a playground

510
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
in an apartment complex.

511
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And the color-crushing

512
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
makes me think this is in Lakkan,

513
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
but it's not green. The buildings are blue,

514
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
so it doesn't seem, it doesn't seem very in Lakkan.

515
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And there's a giant praying mantis.

516
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's a little hard to see against the building.

517
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Uh, but he looks angry.

518
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And I...

519
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I don't really know what's...

520
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
going on here.

521
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I don't know why we're on this playground,

522
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
but...

523
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Cool bug

524
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and, uh, cool spot.

525
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Let's go.

526
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Let's freakin' go!

527
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Let's go! Let's freakin' go!

528
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Hell yeah.

529
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Alright, sick.

530
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Uh, next one is, um...

531
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
another image.

532
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I think it's from Vinny.

533
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's titled VVV.

534
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Japanese guy, maybe don't be stereotypical

535
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
at it.com.

536
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Alright.

537
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Let's freakin'... let's freakin' go!

538
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh, okay.

539
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh, hell yeah. Alright, alright, alright.

540
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So, another chapter of the Vinny saga.

541
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We're walking into

542
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
or... orin...

543
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
orintal food.

544
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That says backwards.

545
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oki na tabemono

546
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oki na...

547
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Hitodoriji

548
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm gonna... I'm gonna Google translate it.

549
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm sorry, I have to.

550
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Uh, Google translate says that it means

551
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
big food, big human dancing character.

552
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Um, okay.

553
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Mmm, okay.

554
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Uh, alright, let's, uh...

555
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Let's freakin' read it. Let's go.

556
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Um...

557
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Hello.

558
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'll try to do the samurai voice. Hello.

559
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Welcome. I serve.

560
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
What's your order, please?

561
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Uh, Simsie sounds like...

562
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Oy, uu, fish, uu, sushi, and sake.

563
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Miso oden.

564
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Uh, teriyaki soda.

565
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Okay.

566
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So when I was being shipped here to America,

567
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I couldn't help but think about what life would be like

568
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
for a turtle, being cramped in that bag and all.

569
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Then living in my house as a turtle,

570
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'd have to be a person to walk up the stairs, though.

571
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Then it hit me, I'd have to be a TMNT.

572
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Haha, yeah.

573
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Heh, funny.

574
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Did I ever tell you I wanted to be a ninja

575
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
when I was a teenager?

576
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
There was the scam website that had me convinced

577
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
it would be simple to sign up and do it.

578
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Lol, heh heh, really?

579
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I was inspired by Naruto or something at the time.

580
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You know, when a phase hits you, you're all about it.

581
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I had a phase of trying to be like Gohan from Dragon Ball Z.

582
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Whoa, whoa, oh yeah?

583
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Heh heh, yeah.

584
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
When it first came out, I was really into it.

585
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Hello, Al Cool.

586
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Have you kept up with Dragon Ball Super?

587
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
No, I haven't, what should I do?

588
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I just got an update from my friends about it.

589
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh yeah, it's not as good of fun as the old stuff,

590
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
but you know, it's something.

591
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Gohan got a cool sword at some point.

592
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I like that part.

593
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yes, he did.

594
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
The Z Sword.

595
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It has the old Kai in it with the Potara Iris.

596
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You know your stuff.

597
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You're good with a blade, I see.

598
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Thank you.

599
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I have actually trained with a blade for most of my life.

600
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Heh, you mentioned a ninja website.

601
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
You wouldn't remember the name of it, would you?

602
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
No, it's been so long.

603
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I bet you would have made a great ninja,

604
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
who'd have even moved up to Samurai Reverie even.

605
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You think?

606
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You've got a really good physique, a perfect body, I'd say.

607
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh, thank you.

608
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Three.

609
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The form and techniques of the Kawasaki clan would have been a true sight to behold.

610
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Cut seeing you perform was Emma.

611
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You're so nice.

612
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You think I look good?

613
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You're so very...

614
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This guy is a real baka hentai, in my opinion.

615
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Chitter-chitter-chitter chatter.

616
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Hey, Ben.

617
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
The Kawasaki clan was that group it wanted to kill you, wouldn't it?

618
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Would it more than just the baby, or was there another guy?

619
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Another guy, for sure.

620
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So this guy is, uh...

621
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I don't know.

622
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
My name is Yuma Kawasaki.

623
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
May I know your name?

624
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Call me Gibb and take.

625
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Beautiful.

626
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And your friends?

627
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
This is Ben Saint and Simsie.

628
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Ben...Saint?

629
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yes, BenSaintofPatrion.com slash BenSaint.

630
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Ben...Saint?

631
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
BenSaint your treachery shall be avenged here by my Kawasaki blade!

632
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Swing!

633
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Shwoof.

634
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You've made a grave mistake to choose this fight.

635
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I will not die here!

636
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I really like the, uh, the toxic, uh, nuclear vaperig.

637
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Alright, this guy, let's see what the, what does Vinny say.

638
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
This guy's immediately enamored by Gibb and take.

639
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Woo-wee!

640
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
How about that? Simsie has a silly neck, like Cheesy said.

641
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Gotta make him sillier.

642
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Maybe don't read the guy's voice in a stereotypic voice,

643
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but you know he has at least half of Japanese with his Kawasaki decency.

644
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay, I see.

645
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You said this in the message.

646
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You said don't read it with a stereotypical samurai,

647
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and I didn't listen, and you know what?

648
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's on me.

649
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's my bad.

650
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I am recent.

651
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I'm sorry.

652
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Uh, okay.

653
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But, it was more, it was more fun to read in the samurai voice.

654
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Come on.

655
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It was.

656
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Um, alright.

657
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Uh, I like this one.

658
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Uh, this one looks good.

659
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I like this last panel is really good.

660
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Uh, I like the clouds, I like the rig.

661
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Um, these are fun.

662
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Uh, I like the scene of us all sitting at the,

663
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
at the table at the bar.

664
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Uh, we look good.

665
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We look good!

666
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Alright, sick.

667
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Thank you again, Vinny, for another,

668
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
for another of these.

669
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Uh, looking forward to more.

670
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Next one is Vincent Vainy Vici,

671
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and I appreciate Ben St. 4.

672
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Three, two, one, go.

673
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Well, I appreciate about Ben St.

674
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He's smart.

675
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And when I hear him make a reference to a funny thing

676
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
that I think is also funny,

677
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I say, Tee-hee-ha-ha, me too.

678
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yo, let's fucking go.

679
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Tee-hee-ha-ha, me too, me too.

680
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Ben St. is very smart, very cool as well.

681
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh, thank you.

682
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Thank you.

683
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Uh, next one is, uh, VVV appreciates Gibbentake.

684
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Uh, regularly sharing funnies with Gibb,

685
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
is my Kokoro wish at 4reel.com.

686
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Uh, three, two, one, go.

687
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Well, I appreciate Gibbentake 4.

688
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It's basically, like, everything she's done

689
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to, like, be who she is.

690
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
That's one of the things I've struggled with myself,

691
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and just seeing her bloom into who she is

692
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
and who she's happy with.

693
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
What does that mean?

694
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Like, that's inspired me.

695
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Wow.

696
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Okay, you're welcome.

697
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Welcome for me being who I am.

698
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.

699
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
That's very, uh, that's very unspecific.

700
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I don't, I don't exactly know what you mean.

701
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
What?

702
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah, I'm, I'm also being who I am.

703
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm also who I am.

704
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Is that not good enough for you?

705
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
What?

706
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Alright, never mind.

707
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Thanks, Vinny.

708
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Uh, next one is, uh, what, like, what is,

709
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

710
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What aspect of Gib being who she is?

711
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's just, I mean, I appreciate,

712
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I appreciate you being who you are.

713
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I appreciate most people being who they are, you know?

714
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
That's, it's a cool thing to do.

715
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Uh, next one is called Slime Times Weekend Update

716
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
from printisolationattwitter.com.

717
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Let's give it a listen.

718
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Three, two, one, go.

719
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Good afternoon, my Rudy Toody shooties.

720
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We're back with Slime Times Weekend Update.

721
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
This week, we'd like to update you

722
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
on the Nlaka Karmayor elections.

723
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
The first round of voting has concluded,

724
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and each faction has now their candidate.

725
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
For the killers, there is Frag,

726
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
impersonating the God Emperor of the 41st Millennium himself.

727
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
For the Rowdies, it was a close finish,

728
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
but in the end, the Court of Appeals decided

729
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
that Rowdy candidate Matt was in his legal right

730
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
to dredge up every old head from their shallow graves

731
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
to vote in his favor.

732
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And so Matt is the Rowdy candidate.

733
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
For the Juvies, Thinbug proved to possess

734
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
an unbeatable perspective on the future,

735
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
casting marine exploration and new items

736
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
on the city's horizon.

737
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Finally, for the State Eds, it appears that

738
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Captain Metalhead has the undisputed champion position,

739
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
riding on a platform of killing everyone in the city

740
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and starting the community's second negapause.

741
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
As the elections move ahead,

742
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
it will be interesting to see whose policies

743
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
prove the most attractive

744
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
and who will decide the fate of our great city.

745
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That's it for this week, and remember,

746
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
the slime time is the best time.

747
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I just got to say, I know that I endorsed him,

748
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
but the Rowdy elections are completely corrupt.

749
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Matt is clearly abusing his position

750
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
of authority as the stream host

751
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and as a rowdy old head to inflate his numbers.

752
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I mean, I don't know, it's debatable

753
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
whether you think that's legitimate or not.

754
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's just highly corrupt.

755
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Thinbug and Captain Metalhead both have real platforms.

756
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Captain Metalhead is just negapause 2,

757
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
which is very funny, and it's getting votes.

758
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I see the appeal.

759
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You're going to do a lord of ghosts 2

760
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and bring about the end times again.

761
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Thinbug is like the growth candidate.

762
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Thinbug is like, we'll do marine exploration,

763
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
we'll add game features.

764
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
There were some other stuff that I can't recall at the top of my head,

765
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
but they had actual positions.

766
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I thought their campaign was great.

767
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Captain Metalhead is great too, for obvious reasons.

768
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Keeping the ghostly spirit alive.

769
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Spirit, ha ha, get it?

770
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
When lord of ghosts summon the nega slime

771
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
to stop all the fighting, it didn't really work out,

772
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
because the ghosts just kept fighting each other,

773
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but who knows, maybe negapause 2 will work out differently.

774
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You never know, you got to keep hope alive.

775
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You just got to keep on trucking.

776
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Alright, next is Slime Times Weekend Update,

777
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
number 11, bonus, 3, 2, 1, go.

778
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Breaking news, we neglected to mention

779
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
that Vriska won candidate position for the Vriska party.

780
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Very important, very important to know this.

781
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I am too busy counting my bribe money

782
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
to check what her platform is,

783
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
but I'm sure it will be based as fuck.

784
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We can certainly be excited for more developments in the future.

785
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And remember, the slime time is the bribe time, the best time.

786
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Goodbye.

787
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yes, vote Vriska.

788
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah, sure, why not?

789
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Why not vote for Vriska?

790
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I hope Vriska is running on the platform

791
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
of having big mommy milkers.

792
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's a pretty, it's a pretty indefensible.

793
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Unassailable, it's a pretty unassailable platform.

794
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Thank you, Prince, for the updates.

795
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Next one is Ben and Gibb Appreciation Hour

796
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
from PrinceIsolation at twitter.com.

797
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Let's go, 3, 2, 1, go.

798
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Welcome back to the Ben and Gibb Appreciation Hour.

799
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Today, I'm coming at you with a single Ben Sainte quote,

800
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,000
discussing the diversity question on Mega Man Battle Network.

801
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And I quote,

802
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, you know, there's some representation.

803
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
There's your guts man using friend.

804
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
He's kind of not colored.

805
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Ben Sainte, 2023.

806
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Goodbye, I'll see you next time.

807
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I was thinking of that, I was thinking of the bit,

808
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
the line in Game of Thrones, or A Song of Ice and Fire,

809
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
when in the, oh shit, what's the southern country called?

810
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Dorn.

811
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
In Dorn, you see, the point is he describes a girl as nut brown,

812
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
a nut brown girl.

813
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
That's what I was thinking of when I said he was nut colored.

814
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You know, someone asked there were minorities in Battle Network,

815
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and the answer largely being thus far, thus far not yet.

816
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Pretty sure everyone's just Japanese.

817
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
No.

818
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I mean, I think land, land must be at least a quarter white,

819
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
but I mean, doesn't really matter, right?

820
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But he must be at least a quarter white,

821
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I mean, I guess they never really talk about it,

822
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
but I'm convinced that Dr. Light, his grandfather, is a western American.

823
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So I think that, yeah, he must have moved to Japan,

824
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and maybe he had a, maybe his wife was a white also,

825
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and just, I mean, no, he must have changed his name.

826
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So he must have moved to Japan, married Japanese,

827
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and then I would assume that his half Japanese son

828
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
probably got a Japanese wife, so that would make land.

829
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That's just what I would think.

830
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So, but that's like whatever.

831
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Ooh, your quarter white.

832
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Ooh, that's diversity for you.

833
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Why am I talking about this?

834
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Hey, Twitch.tv slash St. Comics,

835
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I am sticking pretty well to a schedule

836
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
of Monday and Friday evening streams, streaming Battle Network.

837
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I just finished, I don't even think I mentioned,

838
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I finished Battle Network 1.

839
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I finished the game.

840
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The ending was really good.

841
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's really funny.

842
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
The game's plot is like really, I mean, there is plot,

843
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
there is dialogue and stuff,

844
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
but like 90% of like the important shit in that game.

845
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Lore, I mean, there's like, you know,

846
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
there's initial world building and setup,

847
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
which kind of does occur over the whole game.

848
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You understand like the sort of world they live in, whatever.

849
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But then in terms of like what's going on with you

850
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and with Mega Man and with your dad,

851
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
that's like all in like the last like 10 minutes of the game.

852
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's just, it's all comes out and it's like, oh my fucking god.

853
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So we got through that part and it was, it's amazing.

854
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Honestly, the revelations at the end of Battle Network 1

855
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
are fucking astounding.

856
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So yeah, pretty good.

857
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Follow me on Twitch.

858
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Next one is, fuck it, going phone speaker mode.

859
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And we got another vocabruelink.

860
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
This is our last voicemail, so let's give it a listen.

861
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Three, two, one, go.

862
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Oblivionfall was like, I don't know about one piece

863
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and I don't know if you're going to read it.

864
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I prefer Conan.

865
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Gib instantaneously shows me Sunder Sonja

866
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and he's like, oh my god, oh my fucking god.

867
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm reading it right now.

868
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I love Sunder Sonja.

869
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah, Sunder Sonja is cool.

870
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Sunder Sonja is cool.

871
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I mean, she's kind of silly looking, but that's okay.

872
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
We can get a little silly with it, as Cheesy says.

873
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Make them sillier.

874
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's true.

875
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
That is true.

876
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I don't know if it pushed Oblivionfall over the edge to read one piece.

877
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I don't remember, but I hope it did.

878
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Sorry for not covering the new chapter this week.

879
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Well, next week we'll do a double chapter review of 1076

880
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and I guess 1077 will be up by then.

881
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That's the end of the episode.

882
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I think that's...

883
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Unless we got any last minute voicemails, did we?

884
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Let me see.

885
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Nope.

886
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Okay.

887
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
All right, that's the end.

888
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Gib, do you have any last minute words to impart upon our listeners?

889
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators to get access to all our bonus content

890
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and support the show as well as our upcoming zine, the perfect comic party.

891
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Patrons will get their names in a shout out page

892
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and we've also got a new hour long bonus behind the scenes episode out now

893
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
of the conversation with Oblivion and Cheesy from last week that had to be cut.

894
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
The value you get from becoming a patron is so insane.

895
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's a logical contradiction.

896
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
My sister servos are struggling to calculate the AG at these prices

897
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Couldn't have said it better myself, Gib.

898
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
All right, thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

899
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You
