1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Nope.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What a good intro, well done.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thanks.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Thanks.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I gotta get my folder open.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My voicemail folder for some reason.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This boy taking notes.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, a little bit.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Doing what you might call a thorough analysis.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Do you have your soundboard up?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you have your white woman in the room to go, oh my god, that is crazy.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now I got no bitches.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
God damn, how is this a podcast then?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No bitches.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No fucking maidens.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No maidens, touch grace.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's like that video game that I played that made me very angry.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't even know what it means, I just picked it up through the cultural osmosis.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I barely know what it means.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't know what the fuck it is.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I got to wait two years before all the lore videos are out.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's something about fingers, I know fingers are involved.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are they?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, fingers.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Fingers that are like actual just giant like hands that are just two fingers that talk to God or something.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a major element of the Elden Ring lore.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, like a ring goes on the giant finger that talks to God.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Fingers and rings.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh shit, I didn't think of that.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Have I made a connection here?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You did that I didn't.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh my god.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Alright.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I mean it's the Elden Ring.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So alright.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, so clearly you weren't paying attention when you played fucking 200 hours of the game, idiot.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, no.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, I guess we've already started.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I guess we're already going.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is the show.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Is it?

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, I think so.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's the worst.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There was like a full minute of dead air while you're looking at your folder at the start.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Eleazar, cut that dead air out.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Eleazar, boost all the background sound in the dead air and then leave the whole thing in.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Eleazar, pull stretch it and make it twice as long.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Eleazar, insert sound board.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sound effects.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Make me sound like a morning radio DJ.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Word up, it's Whittlerly Wazzle Benzane.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Benzane in the m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-morning.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
With his co-hosts, Jimmy the Fuckface.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, Simsie, aka Jimmy the Fuckface.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's my real name.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
People always ask me what's my actual name so they don't have to call me fucking Simsie

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because it's terrible and I just always tell them Jimmy the Fuckface.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good old JTF.

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,720
My first name is Jimmy.

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,560
My middle name is that the there.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
You see that? Yeah. Last name. Fuckface.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,800
This is fucking shit. Move on.

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,480
I have an announcement this week.

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
I was going to.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
It's a bit of a shame it gives not here

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
because it would be relevant to her as well.

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
But she is at a

69
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,560
Thundercat concert, which I gather from the context of it

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,920
being a concert that I guess Thundercat is a band.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
Maybe that that question mark.

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,960
I don't know. Maybe it's a concert that plays the soundtrack

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
to the original animated series, Thundercats.

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,600
Well, she didn't say Thundercats.

75
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,440
She said Thundercat.

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,080
So I mean, it could be a typo.

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
I don't know. Maybe they only had one of them.

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
What? Only one of them showed a new liner.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Hold on. Hold on.

80
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,800
Let me I mean, let's let's let's interrogate this.

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,040
Thundercat band.

82
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,240
Does it do I get any?

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
Yes.

84
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Oh, he's a no, he's a musician.

85
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
He's a guy.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
He's one guy.

87
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,440
He's a guy with a guitar.

88
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,640
Does he dress like a Thundercat?

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,480
No, he's got the pink dreadlocks.

90
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,000
So that's cool.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
Hmm.

92
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,680
At least that's acceptable.

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,320
And some of these pictures, he does.

94
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,280
That's a solid level of cat energy, I guess.

95
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
Sure.

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
Yeah, floats your boat.

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,480
That's just like just he's got pink dreadlocks,

98
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
just like a cat would have.

99
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,640
Just like my cat, Crunchy, he has pink dreadlocks.

100
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,520
Crunchy.

101
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,200
Oh, what a sweet boy.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,280
He's good.

103
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,200
Leave him alone.

104
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,720
I was paying him a compliment.

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,200
Learn how to take a compliment, lady.

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,240
I was just I was just grabbing your sweet asses

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,000
and he doesn't come.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,800
What are you fucking homies and Jesus Christ?

109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,240
Excuse me, sorry.

110
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,000
I had a dream before I woke up to record the PCP.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I had a dream and I remember it unusually well.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't usually remember dreams very well,

113
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
but this one I was in a bar and I was with a woman

114
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
and I don't remember, I don't know

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
if we were like on a date or something.

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,600
I don't remember like, did I know this woman?

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,720
I don't know what our relationship was,

118
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,480
but she was there and she seemed to be excited

119
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,200
about it being like a manly bar.

120
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,160
She was like, yeah, this place is manly.

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, that's cool.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm manly and I was like, cool.

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,680
So I ordered some manly stuff from the bar.

124
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,520
I was like, give us a plate of, give us pickles

125
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,120
and a cheese tray, please.

126
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,840
So like those are things that like,

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,120
those are bitter, salty things

128
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,920
that a man would like, thinking about it now.

129
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Actually-

130
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,960
Not like red meat or anything.

131
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Women love cheese trays, so that might have been a mistake.

132
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,480
Women like candy, they like sugar,

133
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,560
they're like little babies.

134
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,080
You like schnapps.

135
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Schnapps, yes, schnapps.

136
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,200
And they like flowers.

137
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,200
In that order, those are things that women like.

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,480
They like schnapps, flowers and Sailor Moon,

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,440
those are the three.

140
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,520
All women do, they just drink schnapps,

141
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,720
watch Sailor Moon, eat flowers and lie.

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,760
So, Bird, what the hell is this announcement

143
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
that you've got?

144
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,400
Oh, it's the most important game changing thing

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,280
that's happened ever.

146
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Since Radcon 4, everything will never be the same.

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,240
Are you ready to hear what has transpired?

148
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,400
Yes.

149
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I finished, I caught up on one piece, I did it.

150
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,720
Holy shit.

151
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,440
I fucking did it, yes, this week.

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,280
Perfect.

153
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,120
I know, I know.

154
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,840
I thought I was gonna have to dance around it

155
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,560
because I wanted to bring up Nate

156
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,720
having a panic attack every stream.

157
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I have heard some mention of people talking

158
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,960
about his stream pirates thing.

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,800
He's not happy bunny, he's not a happy bunny

160
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,320
with what's been happening.

161
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,480
I've heard, yeah, I've heard people complain,

162
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,440
I've heard complaints about it.

163
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,960
But anyway, everyone's people saying that like,

164
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520
this is the worst thing ever.

165
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,760
One piece is ruined, made me do it and I caught up

166
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,120
and now I know what's going on.

167
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,960
I know everything.

168
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,160
I know you're verdict, what do you think?

169
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,040
You're talking about Nika?

170
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,920
Yeah.

171
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,080
What else would I be talking about?

172
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,960
It's pretty weird, but I think I'm okay with it.

173
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,000
I think it's fine.

174
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I guess big spoilers, big spoiler warnings for one piece.

175
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,360
For chapter 1044 and 1045, I believe,

176
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,840
are the two chapters.

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah, that's as far as I've read,

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,720
I don't think there's any more.

179
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Luffy is a wacky, silly boy now,

180
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
like even more so than before.

181
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,440
Okay, if you are sticking around for spoilers,

182
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,400
I mean, I'll give you the condensed version is,

183
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,920
the big revelation is the gum gum fruit

184
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,440
is not actually the gum gum fruit.

185
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,360
It is a mythical Zohan type fruit.

186
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
It is the human, human fruit.

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,680
What is it, mythical model Nika?

188
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Yeah.

189
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,400
And Nika is some like sun god?

190
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,960
He's like the god of freedom or something?

191
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,320
He was a hero of slaves, sun god Nika,

192
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
and he always had green on his face.

193
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,480
Yeah.

194
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,880
So it's like the, who is, is it Son Goku?

195
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,600
Have the hitohitonomi mythical model Daibutsu, right?

196
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
That was the other one.

197
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,640
Not Son Goku, Sen Goku.

198
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,480
Sorry.

199
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
Oh, not only that,

200
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,360
not Son Goku is from Dragon Ball.

201
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
Yeah, and Gens of the West.

202
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,440
Sen Goku, the former Admiral, Fleet Admiral.

203
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,720
Now he's just an old retired guy, but that's not good.

204
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Good for him.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, yeah, I think my take on Nika is like,

206
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
on the one hand, on the one hand,

207
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,520
like it is disappointing that it's another,

208
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,640
it's not my favorite when characters are like,

209
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,600
oh, actually they have a special destiny.

210
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh, actually it turns out they kind of have

211
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
the best power in the world.

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,480
They kind of have the biggest advantage

213
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,880
one could possibly have.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
On the other hand, I mean,

215
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,160
that's kind of just been one piece for a while now.

216
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,880
It's just sort of been revelation after revelation of,

217
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,600
oh, actually this guy is so-and-so's long lost son

218
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,240
or whatever. Exactly.

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,000
So it's not like this is a new trend.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, there's like stuff there like,

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,240
with the giant frozen straw hat in the capital.

222
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,360
It's like, if that didn't annoy you-

223
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
Wait, giant frozen straw hat in the-

224
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
Do you remember that?

225
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,160
What do you mean in the Wano capital?

226
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,000
No, in the Mary Joie,

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,440
the place where all the celestial dragons live.

228
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,920
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
No, I don't remember-

230
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,160
I don't remember a giant frozen straw hat.

231
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,840
Okay, so during Reverie,

232
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,400
they show like a guy who's just like a silhouette

233
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,760
called Im, do you remember Im?

234
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
And he's like looking at bounty posters.

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
Okay, this is one of the big things

236
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
that people complain about in One Piece.

237
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,000
Like I just, I am?

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,560
Yeah, I am One Piece, just Google that.

239
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,840
One Piece and Im, okay.

240
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,280
Do you have any recollection of this whatsoever?

241
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,520
Oh, look at this, look at this.

242
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,040
Is that just like a big Hollow Knight crown?

243
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,680
Yeah, I don't know what he's trying to do.

244
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah, no, no, no, I do vaguely remember

245
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,560
this like shadowy dude.

246
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Yeah.

247
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,480
I mean, okay, no wonder I don't remember him.

248
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,240
Well, what happens is he like looks

249
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,080
at some bounty posters and it's Luffy

250
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,560
and then he goes into like a back room

251
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,120
and there's a giant frozen version

252
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,600
of Luffy's straw hat there.

253
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
What?

254
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,800
That was like, yeah, that was the big like,

255
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,920
oh, destiny, I guess,

256
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,080
because that must have been there for a long time.

257
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,640
For sure, for sure.

258
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,480
I have no idea what the fuck that means.

259
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,880
I think people think that Joy Boy had a straw hat

260
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,080
and he was a giant or something, maybe.

261
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,920
I don't know.

262
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,600
Hmm, okay.

263
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
But like if that doesn't annoy people a lot,

264
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,520
then why would Nika, you know what I mean?

265
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,920
It's on the same level of what the fuck?

266
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,160
The thing, I mean,

267
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,480
how, when you really think about it,

268
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,480
how long has the Luffy's powers have long since ceased

269
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
to be that he's made of rubber, right?

270
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,920
Yeah.

271
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,720
So basically ever since Gears started being a thing,

272
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,520
it's like, well, what is this?

273
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,360
Like this is not.

274
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,160
It became like a bizarre fucking second level of,

275
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,080
okay, so he's using, he's made of rubber,

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,400
but he's using it in like a really weird way.

277
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,480
Really highly specific way.

278
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
It was fun, yeah, it was fun.

279
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
But both of them don't make sense.

280
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
Like Gears second, making your blood move faster

281
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
doesn't do anything.

282
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,600
It wouldn't do much to help a human move super fast.

283
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,560
No, it wouldn't.

284
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,720
And like.

285
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,840
And Gears third is he just like puts air into his bones

286
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,640
so his hand is still has like the same mass.

287
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,720
It's just spread out.

288
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,120
So it wouldn't, you know.

289
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,880
It doesn't make any sense, but that's okay.

290
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,320
Exactly, I'm doing the thing

291
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,880
that I've seen a lot of people doing recently,

292
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,920
which is trying to apply logic to one piece and like rules.

293
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,960
But like, there comes a point where you remember

294
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,680
this is written for 13 year olds

295
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,320
and to be exciting every week.

296
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,600
Yeah, and like in hindsight,

297
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,720
I guess maybe it's like, okay, all that was bullshit.

298
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
Right?

299
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Like all that stuff about making your blood flow really fast

300
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,360
and he's blowing air into his bones.

301
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,080
That was what Luffy imagined it to be.

302
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,920
Yeah.

303
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,040
Tapping into the gear five.

304
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Which is almost a more elegant explanation.

305
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Like, no, that was all stupid.

306
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Like you, the reader are dumb for thinking

307
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,400
that that's really what was happening.

308
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,240
Yeah.

309
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,440
So I know in Nate's one piece lecture,

310
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,240
you guys had a discussion about how the fuck does gear second

311
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,720
like make any sense whatsoever?

312
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,880
And like this sort of, no, of course not.

313
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

314
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,760
And I always just went, ah, it's one piece.

315
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,720
Like he like fucking, he drinks milk and his teeth regrow.

316
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,560
It doesn't make any sense.

317
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,080
It's a stupid comic.

318
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,840
And like, I guess, I don't know,

320
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,640
it's sort of in line with like,

321
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,640
I think didn't Oda like start,

322
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,280
isn't the reason that he gave Luffy rubber powers

323
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,000
is just because he wanted to draw him like doing wacky

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,320
stretchy cartoon shit?

325
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,200
There's like an exact quote where it's something like,

326
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,280
it's the most free, crazy power of the world.

327
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
Right.

328
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,960
You can kind of go anywhere with it.

329
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,320
Well, it's just more creative, isn't it?

330
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,840
It's, it's, yeah.

331
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,400
So, I mean, so literally it's like,

332
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,120
like Nika's whole thing is like,

333
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,440
he's just like a cartoon character.

334
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,600
He's like a squash and stretch cartoon character.

335
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,840
And that's what, so it's sort of,

336
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,480
it's not like a rubber thing,

337
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,440
but it's, it's not a Gomu Gomu thing,

338
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,800
but it's sort of a continuation of the ethos

339
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,840
that is what made Oda want to draw Luffy in the first place.

340
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,360
Yeah, I think regardless of the reasons

341
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,760
why he has that power now,

342
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
I think that power is very fitting for Luffy.

343
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,280
Yeah. You know what I mean?

344
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,200
I think it's like the perfect extension

345
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,320
of him fighting as a character.

346
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,080
I agree, I agree.

347
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,280
Also, it's funny when he does stupid faces

348
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,160
and hits Kaido real hard.

349
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,640
It's, it's funny when he does stupid faces.

350
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,400
This is unrelated.

351
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,040
I was a little bit,

352
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,160
I was a little bit surprised to realize that Kaido is blue.

353
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,120
Yeah. Although I know that a blue,

354
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,880
I know that a blue dragon is like a thing

355
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
in like Chinese mythology.

356
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,800
Did you think it was red or?

357
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,040
Black, I think.

358
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,840
I imagine it has like a black,

359
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,160
maybe maybe with yellow highlights or something.

360
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,280
Yeah, he does have like black tattoos

361
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,600
of like dragon scales on him, doesn't he?

362
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,840
Something like that.

363
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,960
Yeah, he, he, I was, I was like, oh, he's blue?

364
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,120
Really? Okay, okay.

365
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,480
I know, I love that feeling where you have no idea

366
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,680
what the fuck a manga character's color scheme is.

367
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,560
And then you say it and you're like, what?

368
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,920
But I, you know, I know that a blue dragon is one of like

369
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,840
the four, I think it's like a Chinese mythology thing.

370
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,800
There's like a blue dragon, like a red monkey,

371
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,800
a green parrot and a yellow answer or something.

372
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,960
Oh, I've got no fucking idea.

373
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,440
And it's like, if they represent like the four directions

374
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,200
north, south, east, east, west,

375
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,080
they're in, they're in that one video game.

376
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,440
Xeno, Xeno, Xeno blade, I think.

377
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,400
It's a thing, it's a reference to something.

378
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Okay. But speak, yeah, I don't know.

379
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,840
Clearly I know all about it.

380
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,240
I have no fucking idea what the fuck you're talking about.

381
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
It's a reference to something.

382
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,400
It's probably, it's probably in Journey to the West.

383
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,840
But on the, on the subject of color,

384
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,800
every time I've seen, I did see images of,

385
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,960
I did see images, I guess Nate is calling him

386
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,400
goofy Luffy.

387
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah, I could do goofy.

388
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,040
Yeah, I did see images of Nika Luffy.

389
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,280
And I, and I, every time I've seen him colored,

390
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,520
he's drawn like he's like on fire,

391
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,000
like he's orange or he's gold.

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,440
But in the translation that I read,

393
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,000
Kaido explicitly says he's white,

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,320
like his hair and his clothes are pure white.

395
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,360
Well, I think that's because the chapter

396
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,320
that's before the most recent one,

397
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,880
they don't, he doesn't say anything

398
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,000
and people just assumed,

399
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,320
oh, it's shown in character with spiky up,

400
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,560
whiter hair, it's got to be yellow.

401
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,640
Right, yeah.

402
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,040
He's doing it, he's dragon ball.

403
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,240
He's dragon balling it.

404
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
He's dragon balling it.

405
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,320
Or he's on fire or something.

406
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,760
But I guess he's white.

407
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,560
I guess he's white.

408
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,960
I guess, I'm trying to picture it in my head

409
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,120
and it looks strange.

410
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,040
It's like he's old.

411
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,160
It's like he's a ghost,

412
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,000
like he's an old ghost or something.

413
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What I really like is if it was like,

414
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,240
he's black and white,

415
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,000
so he just looks like a manga character

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,120
even like in the context of the universe.

417
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,680
Oh, yeah.

418
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,040
Like if the, once the anime gets to that point

419
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,520
and he's just black and white,

420
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,320
you know what I mean?

421
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,040
He looks like the manga version.

422
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,760
The, I think-

423
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
But there's no way to do that in a manga,

424
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,160
like to have the distinction, you know what I mean?

425
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,680
Yeah, to just think, like, wow,

426
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,080
he looks like he was drawn with ink.

427
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,080
Say the characters, yeah.

428
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,040
The, I think, I felt like the penmanship

429
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,360
in the Nika chapters is like rougher and sloppier.

430
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,760
Yeah.

431
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,040
And I think it's gotta be on purpose.

432
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,880
It's-

433
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,720
Oh, yeah.

434
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,560
It's got-

435
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,400
I mean-

436
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
Yeah.

437
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,640
So honestly, I wouldn't be the craziest thing

438
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
if that were just true.

439
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,080
Like if he were white

440
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,160
because he's meant to be black and white.

441
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,080
Yeah.

442
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,960
That would be my favorite thing.

443
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,800
Yeah, that would be great.

444
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,400
It's like he went to Kingdom Hearts,

445
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
Steamboat Willie universe.

446
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
Exactly.

447
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,680
You got it.

448
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
I like it.

449
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,800
I hope, I kind of hope you're right.

450
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Well, I don't know.

451
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm sorry that's not gonna happen.

452
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,560
He'll just be, he'll just have a white shirt

453
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,280
and white hair and-

454
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,480
For some reason.

455
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,040
And like glowing blue eyes or something.

456
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,080
I don't know.

457
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,920
God.

458
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,440
Why not?

459
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,360
There's no way they'll be cool enough

460
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,680
to do something like that.

461
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,360
We'll be disappointed, don't worry.

462
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
So I guess, damn it.

463
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
I guess I'm gonna put my,

464
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I guess I'm gonna throw,

465
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,600
what's the phrase I'm looking for?

466
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,400
I have no fucking idea what you're talking about.

467
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm pro, I'm pro-nika, I guess.

468
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,840
I'm pro-nika.

469
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,120
I guess I'm kind of a little bit pro-nika, yeah.

470
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,800
Like after I'm okay, I'm okay with it.

471
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm good.

472
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm pro-nika in terms of what's actually happening.

473
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
I just hate the reasons behind it.

474
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,400
You know what I mean?

475
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,880
Which ones?

476
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,960
I just, you know, the whole destiny.

477
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
Oh, it's actually the most important fruit in the world

478
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,560
that the world government's been looking for for 800 years.

479
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,240
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,080
It feels a little-

481
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,280
Yeah, sure.

482
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,840
It's not like Naruto where they explicitly say,

483
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,880
Naruto isn't special apart from he has a nasty fox in him.

484
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,840
And then it turns out he is special.

485
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
Like nobody's ever said Luffy isn't special.

486
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,160
It was, yeah, I mean, it was sort of implied.

487
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,280
It was a fun element of his character that-

488
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,120
An element of his character?

489
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,480
Is he's just some kid?

490
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,520
Yeah, he's really determined.

491
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,440
He has a fruit that's like would be useless

492
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,360
if he wasn't so creative with it.

493
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,600
Yes, that's a fun element.

494
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,520
But I guess it's like, well, we've done all we can do with that.

495
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
Yeah, I mean, all they ever really did with it

496
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,720
was he tried to fight Ace when he was a little kid

497
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,840
in the flashback and he couldn't throw a punch properly

498
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
because he was all rubbery.

499
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,880
I mean, that's the only time it was ever

500
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,320
like a drawback to him and then he overcame that.

501
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,520
I get you, I get you.

502
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,720
But like special destiny wise,

503
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,440
everybody's getting a special destiny.

504
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,280
Yeah.

505
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,040
Sanji, Sanji's the son of this like,

506
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,080
he's like a science freak.

507
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,960
He's a Nazi scientist.

508
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,440
He is a Nazi science experiment gone wrong.

509
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,880
Zoro, I guess they're about to they're revealing

510
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,080
that he's like the son of like the old Shogun or something,

511
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,920
right?

512
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Maybe.

513
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,160
It seems like they're implying he's the,

514
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,200
he's the lost son of like the old,

515
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,160
like the former someone from Wano who was like a great.

516
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,200
They, they, no, they're saying pretty heavily that like,

517
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,680
oh, he looks just like this guy.

518
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
It was the guy who was in the cave.

519
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
He was in the cave with Yamato.

520
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,600
I was about to bring that up, but I don't,

521
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,280
he wasn't like a Shogun, was he?

522
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,120
I thought he was just like a known samurai.

523
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,040
Maybe he wasn't, he was someone important from Wano

524
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,720
who was like the best swordsman of the last generation.

525
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,400
Maybe he wasn't the Shogun, but he was someone important.

526
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,240
I know the guy you mean, I see people saying,

527
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
he doesn't look enough like Zoro,

528
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
so he's got to be his uncle.

529
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,080
And it's like, why?

530
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,600
He kind of looks a lot like Zoro.

531
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,560
He kind of looks exactly like Zoro,

532
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,400
so I don't know what the people are talking about.

533
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,880
Yeah, that's a stupid thing.

534
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,720
I don't know.

535
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,520
Yeah.

536
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,560
So what have you thought of the Wano arc like in total,

537
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,800
overall?

538
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,640
What have I thought?

539
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,480
Hmm, what do I thought of the Wano arc?

540
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,760
I guess I've enjoyed it.

541
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm trying to think like, do I like it more or less

542
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,520
than like, maybe I don't like it as much as like the,

543
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
I've complained a lot about the Fishman arc,

544
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,040
but I think, I think there were more memorable characters

545
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,600
in the Fishman Island arc.

546
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,120
Yeah, Wano's been all right.

547
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,440
I'd say Wano's just a bit overstuffed.

548
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,000
There's just too much going on.

549
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,560
It's, I mean, it is really stuffed full of shit.

550
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,400
It's, I always bring this up when I'm talking to people

551
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,240
about it.

552
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,720
It's like, did we really need two little girls

553
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,920
whose lives were ruined by Orochi and Kaido?

554
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,480
Could they not just have been one character

555
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,680
combined into one?

556
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,760
You know what I mean?

557
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,880
Do you mean?

558
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,280
Like Tama and Toko, those two characters.

559
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,560
Toko is the laughing one and Tama is the one

560
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,080
who can make the disgusting little rolls out of her face.

561
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,400
Disgusting.

562
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,240
It's cool.

563
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,080
Shut up.

564
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
Did those really need to be separate characters?

565
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,920
I had honestly forgotten about face roll girl

566
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,480
until she reappeared at like in the end.

567
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,360
And I, she had the power to make people change sides

568
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,840
in the battle with her face food.

569
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,720
Did Kaido really need like four tiers of like guys

570
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,640
on his team?

571
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,920
Couldn't it just been like two?

572
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,960
Did he need the flying six, the headliners,

573
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
the other ones?

574
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,560
Did he need all of those guys?

575
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,680
The all stars.

576
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,520
Yeah.

577
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,880
The, yeah, I mean,

578
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,040
I guess it just had to fit all these character designs

579
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,000
in there somewhere.

580
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,840
It's true.

581
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
Just had too many, yeah.

582
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,120
I forgive him because he put giraffe man in

583
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
and stuff like that.

584
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,040
Oh, the guy who's, yeah, the new giraffe guy.

585
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah.

586
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,080
The smile users are pretty, are pretty funny.

587
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,440
Yeah, they're good.

588
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Hey, why did killer become like a serial killer

589
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,560
for a minute, but like now he's good again?

590
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
I don't know.

591
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
He, yeah, I don't know either.

592
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,680
He ate a dud smile, didn't he?

593
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,600
Which is why he wears the mask

594
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,200
because he's always grinning.

595
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,080
No, no, no, no, that's not why he wore the mask

596
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,200
because he had the mask before.

597
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,840
Okay.

598
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,000
Nevermind then.

599
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,240
I don't know why he just decided to kill random people.

600
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,840
Do they ever say like that the guys would,

601
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,320
he was killing with like specifically Kaido dudes?

602
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,280
He, yeah, yeah, he was working for Kaido.

603
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,720
He was like, he was doing it for Kaido.

604
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,560
Oh.

605
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,200
But now he's just not.

606
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,080
Yeah.

607
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,680
Was it because kid was in prison

608
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,000
and he was doing it to try and make it

609
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,920
so he doesn't kill kids maybe?

610
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,760
I don't know.

611
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,160
Oh, wait, was it Basil Hawkins?

612
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,120
Was Basil Hawkins making him do it?

613
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
Maybe.

614
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
I don't remember.

615
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,120
All of those characters are completely uninteresting to me

616
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,280
so I forget about them as soon as they're not on screen.

617
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,200
I know, because I know he just beat Basil.

618
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah.

619
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,160
And that's fine.

620
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,680
And I don't know why.

621
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,320
And you know, it being a continuation of the theme

622
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,040
of Basil has like people's lives in his little wicker dolls

623
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,960
and he uses it to blackmail people into stuff.

624
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,720
Like, I guess that would make sense.

625
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,600
So it's the best theory I've got.

626
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
I mean, I could look this up,

627
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,760
but I really don't care it's killer.

628
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,600
You know what I mean?

629
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Well, it stands out to me as a baffling moment

630
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,640
in the story.

631
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,480
I guess so.

632
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,440
I mean, I guess.

633
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,920
I completely forgotten about that.

634
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,200
That wasn't, that's the one that was like,

635
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,320
I don't understand.

636
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I don't understand these characters' motivations right now.

637
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
And there probably is an explanation.

638
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,920
I can't have just completely.

639
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,400
Well, he was killing people because his name was Killer.

640
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
Right, at the end of the day.

641
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,960
He was like a serial killer,

642
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,720
but actually he was working for Kaido,

643
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,560
but they were calling it serial killings

644
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,160
because they didn't want people to know

645
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,800
that it was Kaido, or no, it was Orochi.

646
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,280
I mean, he was working for Orochi,

647
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,600
but like Tomato Tomato or something.

648
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
He was a street murderer in Wano Country,

649
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,080
secretly acted as an assassin working for Orochi.

650
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,920
Yes.

651
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,440
They were trying to get him to kill Toko, apparently.

652
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
Toko the girl?

653
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,560
Yeah.

654
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,800
Yeah, he was chasing after Toko and the...

655
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,640
Grandpa?

656
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,160
Was it grandpa or uncool?

657
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,080
No, it was, oh, I don't remember her name.

658
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,360
Something of the, wasn't it?

659
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,520
No, it wasn't Kiku of the lingering snow.

660
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,280
It was one of the siblings, one of the two.

661
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,160
No, Kiku is one of the two siblings, right?

662
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
There were the two actors.

663
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, it's Kiku and Iso.

664
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,280
I think it might've, no, it wasn't Kiku

665
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,800
because the girl who was holding Kiku Toko

666
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,240
was useless, like she was not a fighter.

667
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,600
Yeah, it's Comrisaki, the heroine, Odin's daughter.

668
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,400
Was it her?

669
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,440
Oh, wait.

670
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,280
Odin.

671
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,480
Yes, Odin's daughter, Momo's big sister.

672
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,440
Yeah.

673
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,280
Yeah.

674
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, boy.

675
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,360
Yeah.

676
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Momo, Odin's big, his big sister who I don't remember.

677
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,920
Oh my God, there's like, there's fucking...

678
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,880
There's like 900 characters in one or alone.

679
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,040
There's, there's Momo, okay, there's Momo's big sister.

680
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,880
There's, there's the other one.

681
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,400
There's Odin's wife, Odin's wife,

682
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
who is like the same age now.

683
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,240
Toki.

684
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,240
Toki's wife.

685
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,760
Wait, no, Odin's wife's dead.

686
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,040
Odin's wife is dead?

687
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,120
Yeah, she died when she sent them back to the future.

688
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Not back, but when they sent them to you.

689
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,360
You remember that Odin flashback, it ends with after Odin dies,

690
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,640
they raid his castle and his wife is there with the two kids

691
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,360
and he sends them 20 years.

692
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,640
He sends Momo and the rest of the samurai.

693
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
You mean she sends them 20 years?

694
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,160
Yes.

695
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,840
And she doesn't, why doesn't she send herself?

696
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,920
Because she...

697
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,760
I forgot that she died.

698
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Because her husband died and she was sad,

699
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,160
so she didn't want to live no more.

700
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,600
And then Hiori doesn't get sent to the future.

701
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,680
Which one's Hiori?

702
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,520
Oh, is the...

703
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,400
Hiori's the daughter.

704
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
Yes.

705
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,440
Momo's sister, brother, yeah, sister.

706
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,640
Sister, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

707
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,400
She escapes and is looked after by a little kappa guy.

708
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,400
What's his name?

709
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,880
The frog, Kawakami or something like that?

710
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,560
Kawamatsu, that's it.

711
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,240
Kawamatsu, I think.

712
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,080
Someone like that.

713
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,160
Kawakami?

714
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,320
Yeah, it's Kawasomething.

715
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,080
I'm literally looking at the wiki now,

716
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,680
trying to figure out why the fuck he was murdered.

717
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,520
My killer was murdering people.

718
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,000
The Basil Hawkins theory is compelling enough

719
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,720
that I'm just going to assume that that's the case

720
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,920
until I'm corrected.

721
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,280
Okay, yeah.

722
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,000
Orochi offered killer a chance to save his captain

723
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,960
by giving him a smile fruit.

724
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,520
So, like, he was going to kill kids.

725
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,640
Kid.

726
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,480
And then...

727
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
Unless you eat the smile.

728
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,640
Yeah, and he did.

729
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,800
And he turned into a pleasure,

730
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,440
which is the crazy people.

731
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,280
Okay.

732
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,280
And then he started killing people for some reason.

733
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,520
So, I guess they were like,

734
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,960
it must have just been,

735
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,400
it must have been I'm going to kill kid

736
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,200
unless you eat the smile

737
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,000
and you got to work for me.

738
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,920
Yeah.

739
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,760
It's got to be.

740
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,880
I don't think he was working for him.

741
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
I think he just, like, went off

742
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,200
and then just started killing people

743
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,560
because he was mad.

744
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,920
Okay. I don't understand.

745
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
My impression was that the people

746
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,200
he who were being killed

747
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,440
were people that Orochi wanted killed,

748
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,560
but they called it serial killings

749
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,120
to hide the fact that he was...

750
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,360
But maybe he was, like,

751
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
supposed to be working for Orochi,

752
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
but he went rogue

753
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,440
and he's just started being a serial killer?

754
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,280
Yeah.

755
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,000
I thought maybe he was killing Orochi's guys

756
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,240
as a street murderer.

757
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,960
But I don't know.

758
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
And then Zora beats him

759
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,800
and then he turns to a killer again or something.

760
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,960
I guess that does explain why when kid shows up,

761
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,080
he just immediately stops being a serial killer.

762
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
Yeah. Maybe he thought kid was dead.

763
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I don't know.

764
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,240
Hmm. Yeah.

765
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,960
So he went nuts.

766
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
Okay. Something like that.

767
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,880
Sure.

768
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
We'll go with that.

769
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
Everyone was talking about...

770
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,040
Everyone was talking about Yamato being trans.

771
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,240
No one was talking about Kiku being trans.

772
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,080
Yeah, I know.

773
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,040
I didn't hear anybody bring up Kiku.

774
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
I thought...

775
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,400
Because Kiku isn't the...

776
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
She doesn't hit people as hard.

777
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,800
So people don't talk about her.

778
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,720
That's true. That's true.

779
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,640
But Kiku is just actually, like,

780
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,440
straight up, like, proper trans.

781
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,720
Just straight up? Yep.

782
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,920
Just there's...

783
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,680
They just say it.

784
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,800
They just say it.

785
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Faced.

786
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,760
It's like, okay. All right.

787
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,040
And then her brother, Iso, isn't...

788
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,640
No.

789
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,440
But he kind of looks like a girl anyway.

790
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,680
Yeah, but he's also very cool.

791
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
Yeah.

792
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,680
I like those two a lot.

793
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,400
Uh, yeah.

794
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,080
Kiku's under-discussed.

795
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,440
Very cool character.

796
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,200
I think so. I think so.

797
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,240
I mean, I remember...

798
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,080
You know what it was?

799
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,120
Okay, this was...

800
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,280
Maybe I'm just stupid.

801
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
I felt like I was stupid for needing this help.

802
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
But when Kiku...

803
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,440
Okay, because there's all these similar-looking women...

804
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,920
Yeah.

805
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,640
I appreciated that, commonly, when things happen to Kiku,

806
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,160
she would talk about snow in a way that I was like,

807
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,240
oh, it's Kiku the lingering snow.

808
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,960
Okay, that's the woman I'm seeing right now.

809
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,320
Was that a thing?

810
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,560
A couple of times.

811
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,600
Like, I think when she got wounded, she said like,

812
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
ah, the snow is melting.

813
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm like, okay, I wasn't 100% sure who that was,

814
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,800
but now you've removed all down.

815
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,720
Thank you.

816
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,480
Okay, that's cool, but I never noticed that.

817
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,600
It was... Maybe it was just one time that it happened,

818
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,280
but I remember, I was like, few.

819
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,000
I guess it's because I... I was confused.

820
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,080
I've been reading it weekly for ages now,

821
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,600
so I guess I didn't...

822
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
There's some stuff that I just don't pick up on,

823
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,320
like, because it happens like one week

824
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
and then it's not addressed again.

825
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,080
I just liked the name.

826
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,200
I just thought the name Kiku of the lingering snow was cool,

827
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,920
and so when they mentioned snow again,

828
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,560
it reminded me of the name that I liked.

829
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,400
It sounds like a Sekiro boss.

830
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
It's exactly the type of energy that those people...

831
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,680
Hmm, I wonder... I wonder why it kind of sounds...

832
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,520
Is that racist?

833
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,840
Yeah!

834
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,280
Hey, yeah!

835
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,440
Hey, yeah!

836
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,560
Could they have been pulling on a similar cultural mythology

837
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,040
to create these two settings?

838
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,880
I don't know.

839
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,560
Because I've been reading weekly since,

840
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,240
like, the very end of the Odin flashback,

841
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
like, the first chapter I read as it came out

842
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,680
was the He Laugh Chapter,

843
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,200
when they actually reach Laugh Tale and find out what it is.

844
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,640
It's funny, I read that like one day ago.

845
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,520
That was, like, three years ago for me.

846
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,720
That's awesome.

847
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,120
It's crazy.

848
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,080
It's crazy to think that the raid has been going on

849
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,320
for, like, a full two years now.

850
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
It's insane, which is why I don't remember anything

851
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
that happens in it, because so much happens.

852
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,280
I feel like I kind of feel like I made the right choice

853
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,960
not reading it weekly, because, like,

854
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,480
I've read the entire Wano arc in, like, three days.

855
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
That's good.

856
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,720
It is good.

857
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,320
There was long stretches of just when it was everybody fighting,

858
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,160
where I was like, oh...

859
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah.

860
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,880
I hope next chapter something funny happens,

861
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,960
or something character-y happens.

862
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,760
Yeah, for sure.

863
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,440
But I'm pretty happy with where it is now,

864
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,880
and it's clearly headed towards the end of Wano, finally,

865
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,640
unless it's some other fucking insane twist happens.

866
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:39,280
We've gotten to the part where Luffy has revealed a new form.

867
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,760
This is the final battle.

868
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,160
We're at the part where everyone else has stopped

869
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,280
having on-screen fights, and Luffy is fighting the main bad guy,

870
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,840
so it's getting towards the end.

871
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,520
We've arrived.

872
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,600
So are you going to be reading it weekly going forward,

873
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,880
or are you just going to let it build up again?

874
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,600
I might read it weekly.

875
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,520
Yeah, at least while this fight is going on.

876
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,960
I think I'm going to follow it weekly.

877
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,440
Maybe I'll stop at some point, but for now, I'm planning on keeping up.

878
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,960
What day does the new chapters come out?

879
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,080
Is it Wednesday?

880
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,720
Yeah, like, the fan transit ones come out,

881
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,680
like, the leaks come out Wednesday or Tuesday.

882
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,280
The fan transit ones come out Wednesday or Thursday,

883
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,640
and then the official ones come out on Sunday.

884
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,720
Yeah.

885
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,080
It just all depends on chaos.

886
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,640
I don't know.

887
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,920
Chaos, who I've maxed out my affection meter with in Hades.

888
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, yeah, you've been playing Hades.

889
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,200
But I still haven't got...

890
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,880
No, I did.

891
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,000
I got Chaos to try to talk to Nix.

892
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,560
But I think I have to do something

893
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,320
to unlock the rest of Nix's little heart meter

894
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,760
so I can start giving her ambrosia.

895
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,800
I think you get an option for her to go to see Chaos on one of your runs.

896
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,160
I just think that's what happens.

897
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,640
I don't remember it's been ages since I played it.

898
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,880
Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.

899
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Have you talked about Hades on the podcast?

900
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
I haven't seen him on the podcast.

901
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
A little bit, yeah, a little bit.

902
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,880
So you've played it.

903
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,800
I like it a lot, it's great.

904
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,840
I played up until like the true ending,

905
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,680
but not the true, true, true super ending.

906
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,080
The true ending went on the river with the song.

907
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,960
Yeah, the true ending when you get first credits,

908
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,240
I think is how people talk about it.

909
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,720
Yeah, OK.

910
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,920
I played up to there and then I sort of fell off and dipped.

911
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,200
I played up to there.

912
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,640
Yeah, I didn't play any Hades this week, I don't think, or not much.

913
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,720
I don't think I played this week.

914
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
But yeah, I've seen that one.

915
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,560
That's the only credits that I've seen.

916
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,440
Yeah.

917
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,920
And I didn't do like any, I didn't do like any nectar gifting.

918
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,880
Oh, no.

919
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,920
No, that's not true.

920
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,200
I did.

921
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,600
I didn't do any nectar gifting with the with the Olympians.

922
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,240
OK.

923
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,480
Yeah.

924
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,120
Yeah, I was saving for the people that I liked.

925
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,840
Yeah, exactly.

926
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,440
You do get like preferential inclinations going on in that game,

927
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
I find.

928
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah, I don't want to give fucking nectar to what's the name?

929
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,720
Artemis, pardon me.

930
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,880
I don't give it to fucking Artemis.

931
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,600
I don't care about her.

932
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,120
She doesn't say funny things.

933
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,680
I don't care about her, but I guess you got to do it for the true, true ending.

934
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,280
So whatever.

935
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,520
I'll give it to the boulder, though.

936
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,680
I didn't I didn't start talking to Bouldie until after.

937
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,440
Yeah, after the credits.

938
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,800
Yeah, it took me a while to realize that you could and just give him

939
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,760
and you can just waste nectar on him.

940
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,600
You you you can't you definitely can't until Sisyphus mentions him.

941
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,160
OK, yeah, because I because I try.

942
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,280
I heard that he was a thing and I tried talking to him

943
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,800
and it wouldn't let me until until Sisyphus brought him up.

944
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,880
Who's the who's the guy that is like

945
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,040
friends with.

946
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
Percy, not Perseus.

947
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
Perseus Jackson.

948
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,040
No, who's the guy who's the old guy at Spawn

949
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,000
at the Hades House who like trains Agrius?

950
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,360
Oh, Achilles Achilles.

951
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, who's the guy who's like Achilles's old bro or boyfriend?

952
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,920
That first of all, they're definitely boyfriends.

953
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,800
OK, I don't remember if it was explicit or not.

954
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,720
It's pretty it's pretty explicit.

955
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,040
It's Patroclus. Yeah. OK.

956
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,280
Whenever I like Patroclus, he's like I like he's like

957
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,480
he's like you are sitting on his hill watching his clouds.

958
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,040
Yeah, I just remember every run I did just hoping I got him

959
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,080
because I wanted to fucking restore death defines

960
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,480
because I always fucked up somewhere in the other run.

961
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,200
When I when I the first couple of times I found Patroclus

962
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,560
and I realized he would restore my death defiance.

963
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,880
I was like, oh, my God, I can't I can't believe it.

964
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,320
Like we've got we've got the run back boys.

965
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,040
But then it's but then I realized that really what you want

966
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,480
is to not lose your death defiance so you get to him

967
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,120
and you can take the other upgrade,

968
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,720
which gives you the 60 percent attack damage boost for like 10 rooms,

969
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,520
which makes the frickin the frickin thesius fight

970
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,560
like take half as long.

971
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,360
God, what a fight. It's cool.

972
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,000
But it is as great the first few times you get to it.

973
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,520
You're like, what? What do I do?

974
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,840
Took me a lot of time.

975
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,640
I died a lot of times on that fight for for a while.

976
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,200
Now now I've kind of figured it out.

977
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,240
Do you have any idea like how soon into the game

978
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,200
you got your first kill on Hades?

979
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,960
I know.

980
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Yeah, it was probably after like 40 something.

981
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,800
Yeah. Attempts.

982
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,040
It took me, I think I.

983
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,040
I probably have been playing it for maybe like 30 or 40 hours.

984
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,320
Maybe something something like that makes sense.

985
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,640
That's about when it feels like there's like a tipping point

986
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,320
once you have enough upgrades and it starts to turn in your favor.

987
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah, there's.

988
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
I like it's it's so it's so gradual.

989
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,320
It's so gradual, but it's it's gradual, but definite.

990
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,680
That's what I would say in a review on YouTube.com.

991
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,640
I OK, did you I didn't realize that there's an entire other set

992
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,360
of Mirror of Night upgrades.

993
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Yeah, that I think I did figure out.

994
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,920
I just never tried clicking them.

995
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,360
Yeah, because you see that button,

996
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,240
it doesn't like register in your brain.

997
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,680
It's just like a little arrow pointing to the thing.

998
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,560
Yeah, no, like, sure.

999
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,960
OK, that's just part of the UI.

1000
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
And then you go, oh, oh, there's a whole other set.

1001
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,360
Yeah, it wasn't.

1002
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
But like most of them are worse.

1003
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,200
Like most of them, I think, are bad.

1004
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,520
I'd say all of them are worse.

1005
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't think I've ever like there's one or two.

1006
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,760
OK, I like the the green one that lets you reroll.

1007
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,280
I would rather reroll.

1008
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,440
I have been using the the reroll items from the mirror

1009
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,640
from the the Well of Charon because it gives me more

1010
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,800
because it gives me more chances to get a kiss of sticks

1011
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
and get my death defiance back in the last section.

1012
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,200
Yeah, I I suppose there is ways you could use it.

1013
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,200
But is that the one that swaps out for swapping rooms instead?

1014
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Yes, because I think rooms I never get anything good

1015
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,800
when I try to swap rooms.

1016
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,160
Yeah, whenever I play Hades,

1017
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,320
I get so obsessed with collecting like permanent upgrade materials

1018
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,960
like the treasure and the the nectar and stuff like that.

1019
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,840
Yeah, yeah, like I've started runs and then just quit them

1020
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,040
because I was getting no nectar and stuff

1021
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,600
because I just wanted to progress the quest lines.

1022
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,040
Yeah, I mean, though, there's literally no reason to stop a run.

1023
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,240
Like you get something out of it every time.

1024
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,920
Yeah, I mean, the way that you get the most of that stuff

1025
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,840
is like by getting the furthest.

1026
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,480
Because like the most like the most gems

1027
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,800
you can get is the boss after you buy the upgrade

1028
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,120
from the contractor is the boss rewards for like for killing

1029
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,320
for killing these CS and killing Hades.

1030
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,120
Yeah, that's the like the most gems you can get.

1031
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,880
So, yeah, pressing on is the most profitable thing you can do.

1032
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,960
Most of the time.

1033
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,520
But I'm impatient and stupid and don't think about things like that.

1034
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,120
If I waste all my re-rolls and don't get a nectar,

1035
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,520
fuck you, I ain't doing this.

1036
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,600
I have been. OK, I don't know if it actually makes a difference.

1037
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,600
But it feels like after the true the first credits,

1038
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,920
it feels like I have fewer opportunities to fish for the good fish

1039
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,120
on the surface, and that makes me upset.

1040
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,040
What? Like once you beat Hades and you can fish

1041
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,840
like yes, because you can't because you yes,

1042
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,560
because you you don't you no longer make the walk to Persephone's cottage.

1043
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,920
Oh, yeah.

1044
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,120
And there's and there's ponds on the path and there's ponds at

1045
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,240
there's several different places at her cottage that you can fish.

1046
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,640
And I don't get to see those poop those puddles anymore.

1047
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,320
And so I don't get as many trout and bass.

1048
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
And what the fuck?

1049
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,640
The thing is, I feel like I miss the only reason I even liked my mom

1050
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,720
is because I got to get fish.

1051
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,320
I felt like I only ever got like two fish,

1052
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,680
like I only ever saw the same two fucking things and I fucking.

1053
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,560
I don't know. Did you ever did you ever fish in chaos?

1054
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,560
No, I don't think I ever even saw a fishing point in. OK.

1055
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,400
It was funny.

1056
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,360
One time I got to chaos and I was I'm going like I'm like muscle memory

1057
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,320
like bubble bubble bubble grab the thing, choose the thing, go get the portal.

1058
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,680
And I do that.

1059
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,680
And as I'm I'm getting the like leave chaos thing as I'm leaving,

1060
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,960
I get Zagreus's voice actor comes and goes, is that a fishing point?

1061
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,560
And I'm like, wait a minute, what? No, but I'm already leaving.

1062
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,320
It's when you realize that you can fish there.

1063
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,760
That was when I realized.

1064
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,640
And so further and so for like the next like 20 runs,

1065
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,400
I'm just like just keep my eye out for a fucking fishing point.

1066
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,920
Turns out the way that I got a fishing point in chaos, finally,

1067
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,040
I've seen one or two and generally the way that I get them is by buying things

1068
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,000
at the pool of sticks, you buy the one that guarantees a fishing spot

1069
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,080
and the one that guarantees you a portal to chaos.

1070
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,680
And then they both proc at the same time and then you get a fishing spot in chaos

1071
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,360
and you fish up these little cosmic jellyfish things.

1072
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,280
Sweet. And I think you trade them for a diamond and did you get annoyed

1073
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,120
when you realized like when you were like, I hate that in games

1074
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,720
where you realize that you could have been getting something for ages,

1075
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,200
but you had no idea it was there because I had a moment like that

1076
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,920
with Elden Ring where I was about 30 hours into the game.

1077
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,120
And I realized that there were invisible walls in this one, too.

1078
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,280
And that did that did damage to me when I found that out

1079
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,000
because I had not been thinking about it whatsoever.

1080
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,120
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

1081
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,480
And there's more flaws, too.

1082
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,600
I think that was probably I probably had not missed any chaos fish before that.

1083
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,000
That was probably when he said it, but it was too late.

1084
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,480
That was probably the one that I missed.

1085
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,880
You could just pretend that it was and then you won't be annoyed.

1086
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,280
Yeah. Yeah, for sure, for sure.

1087
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,440
But a real good game.

1088
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,440
It is a real good game.

1089
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,840
When I I was a bit.

1090
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,960
I was going to I was underwhelmed.

1091
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,120
I was I thought I was underwhelmed by the the quote unquote romance options.

1092
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,040
Mm, but then then I got an extra cut scene.

1093
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,520
I maxed out my my Meg.

1094
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,160
I don't even like Meg. No, no, I don't I don't like Meg.

1095
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,560
I know people who really, really, really like Meg.

1096
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,720
And I'm like, no, I don't really love any of the options.

1097
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,800
I guess if I had to pick one, I would say Dusa is my favorite.

1098
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,480
But like she's fine.

1099
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,120
That's like a gag one more than anything.

1100
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,000
She's the only one who's like, I don't remember who is Romance of all.

1101
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,760
OK, Meg is I mean, Meg is a it's Meg, Fanatos and Dusa.

1102
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,480
OK, so you got it.

1103
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,800
So it's like, OK, I mean, I don't really I mean, he's all right as a guy.

1104
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,640
Like he's a decent guy, I suppose.

1105
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,800
So it's so you got that the extent of my feelings for him.

1106
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,080
So you got that bro.

1107
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,360
He is that bro.

1108
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,560
Yeah, he is that bro.

1109
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,240
I yeah, that's true.

1110
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,560
You got step bro mean lady and floating heads.

1111
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,400
It's got to be the floating head.

1112
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,440
It's got to be the floating head.

1113
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,280
She's nice.

1114
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,760
I just I'm sorry.

1115
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,680
I'm a simple man.

1116
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,360
I just like her because she's nice.

1117
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,480
I like her because she's friendly to me.

1118
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,320
Yeah.

1119
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,160
Is that so hard to understand?

1120
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,760
And she's not my step brother.

1121
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,280
I didn't even think about it, but he's totally your step brother.

1122
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,760
Yeah, exactly.

1123
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,000
People forget that.

1124
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,280
But it's great because it's fine.

1125
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,240
I guess I yeah.

1126
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,160
Oh, I mean, I guess I guess these are Greek gods we're talking about.

1127
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,920
I mean, they were always up to that stuff.

1128
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,720
Yeah, I mean, I had forgotten, but I was reminded recently

1129
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,000
yet Hera, Hera and Zeus are just siblings as well as married.

1130
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,560
And that's fine.

1131
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,360
God, I didn't realize that.

1132
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,160
They didn't bring that up in Percy Jackson.

1133
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,680
Geez, that's it's true, although

1134
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,040
they might be siblings in the sense that like they both like congealed

1135
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,160
out of like a pool of blood, the same god goop.

1136
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,560
It might it might be like that.

1137
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,800
Yeah. So it's like, yeah, it's a bit like.

1138
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,160
I mean, I guess if you conceived like that, all the characters

1139
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,320
and homestuck are siblings because they all spawned out of the same

1140
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,800
communal spawning pool, but that's just how their species is.

1141
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,800
So I guess it doesn't count.

1142
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Our robots built in the same factory.

1143
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,840
If they fall in love, is that interest?

1144
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:23,880
If they if they're the same model, if they were designed

1145
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,560
but or they were designed by the same.

1146
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,480
Yeah, by the same by the same use the same blueprints.

1147
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
Then that's like DNA, I think so.

1148
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,400
Yes, I think so case that's and if they fuck and have a little robot

1149
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,520
children, they'll be too similar and they'll get you know, he be

1150
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,760
him a few acts or whatever.

1151
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, Jesus, you know how it is.

1152
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,240
What was it? What was I talking?

1153
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
Anyway, step step rose.

1154
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,960
He's all right. He's OK.

1155
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,760
I don't dislike him.

1156
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,040
My friend was really obsessed with him.

1157
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,600
Really? But that's fine.

1158
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,720
That's his type of character where it's like a pretty handsome boy

1159
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,320
who is mean sort of and sly, you know, I would say.

1160
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,880
I guess you can see one of the things

1161
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,120
in Hades is you can see exactly who each character is for.

1162
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,480
You can see the demographic that they aimed at.

1163
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,680
Yeah, I feel like Dusa is for someone who doesn't like either of the other two.

1164
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,560
Exactly.

1165
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,480
And Nick's is for me.

1166
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,560
Yeah, Sam. Yeah, Nick's is the best.

1167
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,280
Electo is unfortunately you can't romance your stepmom.

1168
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,200
No. Sadly, cowards, cowards.

1169
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,880
Why can you do the gay one but not the mum one?

1170
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,480
Right. I mean, I mean, slippery slope, I guess.

1171
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,560
Just let me let me slide all the way down it.

1172
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,120
Big, big, globo homo agenda.

1173
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,360
God's sake.

1174
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,960
You can't you can't romance Cerberus, cowards.

1175
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,160
Yeah, he's he's a god.

1176
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,720
It doesn't count.

1177
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,640
It doesn't count as agristers by things.

1178
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,640
He's God's mother.

1179
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,360
So I think Cerberus could consent.

1180
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,320
Yeah. The narrator.

1181
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,720
Well, the thing is that the thoughts.

1182
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,480
The tongue, the tongue head would consent, but the other two won't.

1183
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,240
So. No, yeah.

1184
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,440
Yeah, there'd be issues around that.

1185
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,160
Yeah, they could convince one of them to give them enough ambrosia.

1186
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Everything would be fine.

1187
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,480
You can't romance Skelly.

1188
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,480
And you stand out shit characters that you hate when I.

1189
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,680
I love Skelly. I love Skelly.

1190
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,600
Yes, Kelly's good when he I actually I said this in the last episode

1191
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,120
when he gave he was the first keepsake I got and when I got it.

1192
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,560
And I realized I could summon Skelly to show up in my runs.

1193
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,000
I was like, oh, my God, he's there.

1194
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,080
There he is, my friend, my friend.

1195
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,960
I have a family with me.

1196
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,920
Yeah, I don't think I ever figured out how to progress Skelly's quest

1197
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,440
or whatever he or I just didn't happen to give him enough nectar.

1198
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,840
You you just I think you just give him enough nectar, I think.

1199
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,400
And I don't think there's I don't remember doing anything else.

1200
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,280
I think it plateaued at a point.

1201
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,640
And maybe there was just something that most people do that I didn't do

1202
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,640
and didn't realize. Well, for me, I never looked anything up for Hades.

1203
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,400
I went in like fresh.

1204
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,000
I. I barely.

1205
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,680
I think I looked up one or two things about the Mirror of Night,

1206
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,400
like when I got confused about the switching.

1207
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,800
I looked up like one or two things.

1208
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,840
I didn't look up very much.

1209
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,120
Skelly, all that happened with I think I just maxed out his nectar.

1210
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:56,320
And then at some point, he asks you to he asks you to kill him permanently

1211
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:03,400
by fully upgrading the Zagreous aspect of the Stygian Stygian blade.

1212
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,520
OK, yeah, I never did that.

1213
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,040
Yeah. And then you do that.

1214
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,000
But then it's just a joke.

1215
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
He's just like, well, I was just fucking with you.

1216
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,360
We're in hell. What the hell's going to happen?

1217
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,760
Yeah. And then I think it's a dumb ass.

1218
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,520
And then I think after that, you can give him ambrosia

1219
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,640
and you give him like three ambrosia and he gives you the skeleton keepsake.

1220
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,120
And he's just.

1221
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,040
And like I said, he he does in battle exactly what he does

1222
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,520
outside of it, which is he just stands there and lets the enemies away.

1223
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,880
It's awesome.

1224
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,080
The writing in the writing, the more I played it,

1225
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,960
the more I I wouldn't say it was annoying, but it sometimes came off

1226
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,120
a little too cutesy.

1227
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,800
The writing in in in that game is just a little bit cutesy sometimes.

1228
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,840
And I know what you mean.

1229
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,680
It's on purpose.

1230
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,240
I don't think it's a mistake like they did it on purpose, but sometimes I feel

1231
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,240
it's a bit much that like

1232
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,040
Skelly the Skeleton, boldly the bolder.

1233
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,880
I don't know.

1234
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,440
I don't know. There's a lot of good stuff in there,

1235
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,600
but there's some stuff that borders on and I hate to say it, the C word cringe.

1236
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,040
There's a little there's a few little things or I was like,

1237
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,200
eh, I can't. I would.

1238
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,440
I don't know if it ever goes into full on cringe.

1239
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,360
Occasionally, it feels a little like a Redditor wrote it.

1240
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,800
Yeah, that's not even that often.

1241
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,720
It's mostly good.

1242
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,760
Just one or two moments.

1243
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,640
I'm like, you tried to be cute and I don't know if I appreciate it.

1244
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,120
Would rather you be quiet, please?

1245
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,720
Yeah, the fat guys who look like Donald Trump.

1246
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,360
They do.

1247
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,120
Louts.

1248
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,240
Is that what they're called?

1249
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,160
Yeah, they're called louts.

1250
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,680
I never looked at the best year, even though I knew it was there.

1251
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,120
He thought I don't remember what the name of the enemy.

1252
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,800
I also did not look at the best year.

1253
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,280
He says he says more louts when you go to a room with them in it.

1254
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,000
I just assumed that would be a he's just calling everybody a lot.

1255
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,320
I don't know. It's again, again, it's been like two years.

1256
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,400
That's so silly.

1257
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,080
He know he occasionally will say the name of the enemy and some of them.

1258
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,920
Actually, no, this was one of the first times I was like, really?

1259
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,520
It was when he says it about, you know, the skeletons with the bombs in

1260
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,720
in Asfidel. Yeah.

1261
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,520
Some of them have goofy names like slam dancer.

1262
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,240
The skulls, the floating skulls that come out of the piles in Tartarus.

1263
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,480
They're called knuckleheads.

1264
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,720
It's like, oh, yeah.

1265
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,280
These names are so goofy.

1266
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,960
They're so cutesy, like, what about learning that the learning?

1267
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,720
Yes, learning.

1268
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,440
Yes, learning, the learning in Hydra.

1269
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,720
Another another moment.

1270
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,760
I'm like, all right, OK, cute.

1271
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,520
They're being cute and it's fine.

1272
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,480
Serbi and Hades, Hady.

1273
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,520
I that's they would do it.

1274
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,920
They would do it.

1275
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,520
They have no shame, no shame at all.

1276
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,600
Hades is cool.

1277
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,120
The character, not the guy. Game sucks.

1278
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,520
Game sucks. Obviously, the game sucks.

1279
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,200
I played it.

1280
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,880
I played it so I could fuck the

1281
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,360
monster floating the floating monster flying head.

1282
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,040
I haven't filled out her gauge yet, but I think I'm like one away and

1283
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,080
when you give her the second gift of Ambrosia, she literally is like,

1284
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,760
Prince, why are you being so nice to me?

1285
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,520
Look, we both know I'm just a floating monster.

1286
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,160
Yeah, I know.

1287
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,840
Got to fill that gauge, though.

1288
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,480
Yeah, you need to do that.

1289
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,800
Yeah.

1290
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,560
It's a good ending to that one.

1291
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,280
I'll just say that I like that one.

1292
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,480
Oh, you did it. OK. Yeah, I definitely did that.

1293
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,640
Well, I think she was the only like summon I got.

1294
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,360
By the end of the game.

1295
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,080
I have gotten her summon, but I have not used it yet.

1296
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,680
I've only used Skelly's and Meg's.

1297
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,040
Yeah.

1298
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,200
I got Thanatos's, too, but I have not.

1299
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,040
I haven't haven't used.

1300
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,840
I haven't finished his gauge either.

1301
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,280
I'm going to do it.

1302
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,440
I'll I'll fuck them all.

1303
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,960
Whatever. I'll fuck my brother.

1304
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,840
Who cares?

1305
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,280
It's not related by blood.

1306
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,400
No, no, no, no, don't worry.

1307
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,600
No, no, no, don't worry.

1308
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,160
Don't worry.

1309
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,680
It's OK.

1310
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,680
I can I can get my I can get my stepbrother pregnant.

1311
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,120
And it won't be weird because we don't share DNA.

1312
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,120
So it's fine.

1313
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,120
It's true.

1314
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,600
Yeah. It's fine.

1315
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,000
Absolutely fine.

1316
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,400
Mm hmm.

1317
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,440
That's right.

1318
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,040
How are we going to get out of your game?

1319
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,160
I can't fuck Hypnos.

1320
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,440
Why can I fuck Thanatos but not Hypnos?

1321
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,680
I don't know.

1322
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,640
It's the game just doesn't respect Hypnos,

1323
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,840
even though he literally did nothing wrong.

1324
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,080
Hypnos like is Haiti's son, though, isn't he?

1325
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,640
No. Is he or is he just Nix's?

1326
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
I think he's I don't think he is.

1327
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,080
I don't think he's Haiti's son.

1328
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,680
I think he's just Nix's son.

1329
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,600
OK.

1330
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,000
He's him and Thanatos.

1331
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,800
He's your stepbrother as well.

1332
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,040
He's also your stepbrother.

1333
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,480
Yeah. OK.

1334
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,480
I don't like Hypnos.

1335
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,600
You didn't like him?

1336
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,680
No.

1337
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,480
It's all right.

1338
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,080
I think he's fine.

1339
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,200
I think the games really mean to him.

1340
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,720
Everybody talks about him like he sucks so bad,

1341
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,880
but he's like slight.

1342
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,000
He's like slightly silly sometimes,

1343
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,760
and that's the extent of it.

1344
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,760
Like he like sleeps.

1345
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,640
He sleeps on the job and like there's nothing.

1346
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,160
There's no consequences for it.

1347
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
And everyone's like, ah, what a fuck up.

1348
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,720
God, I can't fucking stand Hypnos.

1349
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,920
Come on, eat them all and fuck her.

1350
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,680
I'm sat there with my little control of my head going, yes.

1351
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,640
Fuck you.

1352
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Yeah, kill him.

1353
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,480
Yeah. Get his ass.

1354
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,400
I wasn't mad about Orpheus either.

1355
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,440
Orpheus, music, man.

1356
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,760
It's Orpheus a trans man.

1357
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,640
That was my read because I feel like

1358
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,960
he's got a female voice actor.

1359
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,840
Yeah.

1360
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,120
And then I thought, and then I thought,

1361
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,000
maybe I'm thinking too hard about it.

1362
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,680
I don't know.

1363
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,360
I don't really care.

1364
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,040
Yeah.

1365
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
He just got annoying and old.

1366
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,320
The joke of him being scared and sad.

1367
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,560
I don't know.

1368
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,960
I got tired of his character.

1369
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,600
That's just his personality.

1370
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,600
I don't know.

1371
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,000
But I mean, by the time by the time

1372
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,280
I got him and Eurydice back together,

1373
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,680
I like his little question mark,

1374
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,360
like stopped even propping.

1375
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,880
So I basically stopped even having conversations with him.

1376
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,480
So I didn't really get.

1377
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,120
Walking straight past him, poor man.

1378
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,480
I mean, he's not saying anything.

1379
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,560
So like I didn't get tired of him.

1380
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,440
Like he was done.

1381
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,240
He was done having things to say.

1382
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:32,920
I forget.

1383
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,880
So that was it.

1384
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,720
Does he just stay with Eurydice

1385
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,560
or does he come back to the House of Hades?

1386
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,320
Like half and half.

1387
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,120
Like half the time he'll be hanging out

1388
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,760
in his little Hades chair and half the time

1389
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,520
he'll be singing with Eurydice in Asphodel.

1390
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,760
Can I just say Eurydice is the coolest fucking name ever?

1391
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,600
And it's so fun to say.

1392
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,920
I don't like it just because I see it written

1393
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,240
and I want to say Eurydice.

1394
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,640
Yeah, that's true.

1395
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,840
But once you know it, you can be the cocky asshole

1396
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,080
who says, actually, it's Eurydice.

1397
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,760
And you get to say Eurydice and it's fucking sick.

1398
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,600
I like that name.

1399
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,840
It's fine.

1400
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,200
It's all right.

1401
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,080
God damn it, Ben.

1402
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,880
Clap for the things I clap for.

1403
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,560
Ah, please clap.

1404
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,800
Trying to think.

1405
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,840
Trying to think if there's anything else.

1406
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,400
I'm working on doing, I think I'm getting close

1407
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,440
to finishing Sisyphus' quest line.

1408
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,680
Think I'm almost there.

1409
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,680
Sisyphus is the goodest boy.

1410
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,160
He is the sweetest cinnamon roll.

1411
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,880
As the writers of the game would probably say.

1412
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,120
I like his dumb fucking face.

1413
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,960
He does have a dumb fucking face.

1414
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,800
He does.

1415
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,960
Oh, Prince.

1416
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,640
But it's like a friend dumb face.

1417
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,720
Good to see you.

1418
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,360
Oh, oh, oh, Prince, I'm having a banger week.

1419
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:01,240
The lashings were mild today, Prince.

1420
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,320
Yeah, that stuff works.

1421
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,440
I like that stuff.

1422
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,920
He's delightful, yeah.

1423
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,240
Who's your favorite god to talk to?

1424
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,360
My favorite god to talk to.

1425
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,920
My favorite god to...

1426
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:29,640
I guess I would say, I guess I would say probably Poseidon.

1427
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,120
Poseidon's a little shit stirrer.

1428
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:31,440
I like him.

1429
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,040
Because he's goofy.

1430
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,840
Yeah.

1431
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,400
He's the one that I have more of a reaction to, I guess.

1432
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,560
He's the wacky uncle who takes over barbecue duties

1433
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,120
at the house party.

1434
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,120
Yeah.

1435
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:52,160
He's, I get him, and Haiti's just calls him dumb.

1436
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,720
He's just like, yeah, he's just an idiot.

1437
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,240
I mean, it adds up.

1438
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,240
He's kind of, yeah, sure.

1439
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,760
I'm trying to think if there's any others that I particularly

1440
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,320
like.

1441
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,600
Artemis seems embarrassed when you give her stuff.

1442
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,120
And that's kind of cute, I guess.

1443
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,920
Just like, what?

1444
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,760
I love all their designs so much.

1445
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,480
I think they're all some of the best versions of drawing

1446
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,440
those characters I've seen.

1447
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,680
They're all beautiful.

1448
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,760
They're all gorgeous.

1449
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,680
Yeah, they are.

1450
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,840
I love Athena's design so much.

1451
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,200
I like that she's just gray for no reason.

1452
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,080
She's just gray.

1453
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,200
It just suits her color scheme perfectly.

1454
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,040
The colors are nice.

1455
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,760
Her color is blue, yellow.

1456
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,200
Not green.

1457
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,920
Blue, gold, and gray.

1458
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,520
Blue, gold, gray, silvery color.

1459
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,320
It's like, yeah, cool, cool, man.

1460
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,760
She gives you all the best powers

1461
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,440
because you can just live through anything.

1462
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,320
She gives you, I mean, divine dash is like the best.

1463
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,120
It's like the Runsaver.

1464
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,480
When you have divine dash, you just spam dash.

1465
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,280
I mean, you should be spamming dash all the time.

1466
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,400
But when you have divine dash, you just spam dash

1467
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,560
and nothing can hurt you.

1468
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,520
You just got it.

1469
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,440
You just got it.

1470
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,400
I don't like any of Aphrodite's powers that much,

1471
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,480
to be honest.

1472
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,480
You know what?

1473
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,400
Aphrodite does good damage.

1474
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,240
She's a big damage booster.

1475
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,040
And I like, yeah, she gives you like,

1476
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
I mean, maybe not as much as like the who's,

1477
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,720
I mean, she gives you her weapon upgrade,

1478
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,720
gives you more of a damage boost than what's her name,

1479
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,160
than Athena does.

1480
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,080
Yeah, but Athena shoots bombs back to people

1481
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,360
that kills.

1482
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,040
That's, yeah, I guess that's fine.

1483
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,880
That's cool.

1484
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,680
I mean, if you want to shoot bombs back,

1485
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,280
then just dash.

1486
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,120
True.

1487
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:46,960
You should just be dashing.

1488
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,800
What do you need?

1489
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,120
I don't need everything to deflect.

1490
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,200
I just like the ones that do the most damage.

1491
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,040
And I think.

1492
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,960
Yeah, Artemis is like summon thing.

1493
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,280
No, not summon thing, like super attack.

1494
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,120
Oh, the arrow?

1495
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,960
Yeah.

1496
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,800
The arrow.

1497
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,200
Yeah, I didn't use that one for a while.

1498
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,400
I eventually did.

1499
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,760
And then I realized it just like,

1500
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,640
takes out like a third of a boss's health.

1501
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,080
I know, you can just like shred Hades with it.

1502
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,400
Okay.

1503
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,120
That one ability she has that like summons an arrow

1504
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,680
whenever you do an attack.

1505
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,680
I, I didn't, honestly,

1506
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,680
I didn't use a lot of Artemis stuff at first.

1507
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,760
I kind of looked at the numbers.

1508
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,440
I was like, what, 3% of my hits will be critical hits?

1509
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,640
Like, okay.

1510
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,360
Do you know the one I mean?

1511
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,480
Yes, the one that every time you cast

1512
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,760
or hit with an attack or hit with something of special.

1513
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,640
She's, you just shoot a little arrow.

1514
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,560
That one's fucking great.

1515
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,160
I love that one so much.

1516
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,120
I've only used that one like one time.

1517
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,320
And it was, it was pretty good actually.

1518
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,800
It's so good for like crowd control in the,

1519
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,480
what's it, the Labyrinth bit?

1520
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,480
The Labyrinth, but you mean Tartarus?

1521
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,720
No, what's the fucking, the bit right before Hades

1522
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,280
where you have to go through the randomized rooms.

1523
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,240
Oh yeah, the, the, the temple of sticks?

1524
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,200
Yeah, that one.

1525
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,240
Yeah.

1526
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,240
Yeah.

1527
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,360
There's some, there's some real dicky enemies in there

1528
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,360
and there's lots of them.

1529
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:18,320
And that, like some an arrow thing is fucking perfect for that.

1530
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,760
Uh, man, when I'm in the temple,

1531
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,680
when I'm in the temple of sticks

1532
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,440
and I'm fighting one of the stupid fucking bosses

1533
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,880
in the final rooms and I get poisoned by a fucking Seder.

1534
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,840
Oh, bang, bang, my fucking desk, like, no.

1535
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,560
Why are they in this video game?

1536
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,720
I hate them so much.

1537
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,560
Yeah, yeah.

1538
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,440
At least there's always the poison cure thing nearby.

1539
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,040
Did you, did you unlock all the weapon aspects?

1540
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,000
I don't think I unlocked all the aspects by lockable.

1541
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,320
I have recently unlocked all the aspects.

1542
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,800
All the unlockables are like,

1543
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,640
they're all like slow and strong.

1544
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,680
In a way that, like they're not bad.

1545
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,760
They're kind of good.

1546
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,600
Some of them are kind of good,

1547
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,320
but they all are similarly like slower,

1548
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:14,160
tankier versions of the regular weapon, which is fine, I guess.

1549
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,120
I think what mostly I did with Titan Blood,

1550
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,280
which is what you used to upgrade those, isn't it?

1551
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,480
Mm-hmm, yep.

1552
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,280
I think I mostly just like traded that in

1553
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,680
to get Ambrosia and Nectar.

1554
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,400
But, ugh.

1555
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,080
Because I wanted to do quest lines.

1556
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,440
Oh my God.

1557
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,160
You know, I guess, but then, but then like...

1558
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,160
That's why I got no aspects.

1559
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,600
But then you got no fucking Titan Blood.

1560
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,040
But then you got no Titan Blood.

1561
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,040
I know.

1562
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,960
You'll eventually finish all the quest lines

1563
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,960
and you'll be like, okay, great.

1564
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,800
Well, now I've got all this fucking Ambrosia and Nectar.

1565
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,640
I think the only one...

1566
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,960
And I just need Titan's Blood.

1567
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,120
And I have none.

1568
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,640
I think the only one I upgraded

1569
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,680
was the one that just like makes the gun have more ammo.

1570
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,920
And the gun is the most boring weapon to use in that game,

1571
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,280
but it's the winner.

1572
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,080
I got my first two wins with the rail.

1573
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,240
Yeah.

1574
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,320
That was the one that I found.

1575
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,600
That one, and then I think I have the...

1576
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,120
Other than that, I have the most wins with the spear.

1577
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,240
I really like...

1578
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,120
I think probably my best weapon

1579
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,640
is the aspect of Hades spear.

1580
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,720
Cause you just spin it.

1581
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,200
You get the Daedalus Hammer that gives you massive spin.

1582
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,600
You just spin it and hit everything in the room

1583
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,600
every single time you do huge damage

1584
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:34,120
and you debuff them with a 150% bonus damage debuff.

1585
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,440
And that's just it.

1586
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,160
You just win every fight like that, yeah.

1587
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,760
I really like the Daedalus Hammer for the bow,

1588
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,520
which makes it rapid fire.

1589
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,760
And you don't have to charge it.

1590
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,120
It feels cheaty, but that one's real good.

1591
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,480
I don't know if I have that one.

1592
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,880
I did get the Daedalus Hammer that makes

1593
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,920
the rail continuously fire, no ammo.

1594
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,200
Yeah, there's ones for each of them, I think.

1595
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,680
I'm pretty sure there's one.

1596
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,400
Or is it like an explosive shot I'm thinking of?

1597
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,000
There is an explosive shot.

1598
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,840
Yeah.

1599
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,600
I haven't gotten all the upgrades for every weapon.

1600
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,200
I'm still working on the prophecy list right now.

1601
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,080
That's my thing is to get...

1602
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,360
I'm like really close.

1603
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,240
I actually know, I think I just got all the legendary boons

1604
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,000
and I am really close to getting all the duo boons.

1605
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,280
Oh, I got nowhere near fucking the duo boons.

1606
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,920
I think I have two more to go.

1607
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,240
No, wait, no, now I remember.

1608
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,080
I did.

1609
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,640
That's the one thing I looked up was,

1610
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,200
I had one duo left to get after playing the game naturally.

1611
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,480
And I looked it up and then it was like,

1612
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,480
you had to get a Zeus, some Zeus one before some other one.

1613
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,560
There's one?

1614
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,760
That Zeus thing just never dropped for me.

1615
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,720
Probably the one that's gonna be last.

1616
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,520
There's one that you need.

1617
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,440
It's like the most complicated one.

1618
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,920
You need a Zeus upgrade.

1619
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,600
You need like a regular Zeus upgrade.

1620
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,680
And you need a...

1621
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,600
I think you need a Zeus upgrade that gives you

1622
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,640
like lightning or chain lightning.

1623
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,080
And you need an Aries upgrade that gives you doom.

1624
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,800
And you need some ability from someone

1625
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,280
that gives you like a deal damage

1626
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,000
when you get damaged ability.

1627
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,920
And it like all combines into like a revenge,

1628
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,320
lightning, doom thing.

1629
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,200
That's probably exactly what I was thinking of.

1630
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,400
And I have not gotten that one yet.

1631
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,720
Yeah.

1632
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,320
I got a great combo.

1633
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,560
The unlocked aspect of the rail,

1634
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,920
the aspect of Lucifer, it shoots like a laser.

1635
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,000
And I got, yeah.

1636
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,920
And I got the Hades attack buff that inflicts doom

1637
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,320
when you hit with the laser.

1638
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,400
And the laser, it does like no knockback.

1639
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,440
Enemies don't even like react to being hit with it

1640
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,160
but it just does like, it just does damage tick,

1641
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,200
like did, did, did, did.

1642
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,560
And the number increases for like every consecutive tick

1643
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,960
that you remain focused on them.

1644
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,440
And I had, but I had the doom.

1645
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,620
And so I'm just like spinning the laser around the room

1646
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,120
and just like hitting every enemy with the doom effect.

1647
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,400
And then just running away and letting the doom just like explode them while I'm not even looking at them.

1648
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,360
I do really like the doom power.

1649
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Sometimes it's really good, like on fast weapons.

1650
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,700
There was one run where I got... On slow weapons it's bad.

1651
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:27,700
Where I got like no boon. No, no, like, boons are the like specific powers that the guys give you, right?

1652
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Yeah, when you get the glowy orb with the god in it.

1653
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,960
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

1654
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:38,960
I got like none of those apart from a doom one for the like the shield throw with a doom.

1655
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,960
It's good. It's good. It's...

1656
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,960
And I just dumped fucking tons of the...

1657
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,960
The pomegranates?

1658
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,960
Yeah, the pomegranates into it.

1659
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,960
And it was fucking just killing everything after like two seconds. It was amazing.

1660
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,960
Yeah, yeah.

1661
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,960
It bounces between like 10 enemies.

1662
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,960
And I think I got one that the hammer that made it bounce between like even more enemies

1663
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,960
and then do like an explosion when it comes back to you or something like that.

1664
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Yes, yes, yes.

1665
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,960
And it was absurd and I loved it.

1666
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,960
Yeah, there have been... I have definitely...

1667
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,960
I have definitely had runs where I've just been relying on doom damage.

1668
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,960
It's pretty good.

1669
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,960
I had one.

1670
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,960
Maybe it's kind of cool.

1671
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:22,960
Oh man.

1672
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,960
Oh, I did that with... It was against...

1673
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,960
I really... You know what? I really like the shield.

1674
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,960
I really like the shield.

1675
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,960
Yeah, I do really like the shield as well.

1676
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:41,960
Because there's a lot of bosses who you can kind of just set down the shield and like hold it and ready a bull charge.

1677
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:48,960
And the boss just can't hit you through the shield and then like they'll attack and then when they're done attacking you just bull rush through them.

1678
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,960
Get on their other side and just like repeat.

1679
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,960
Yeah.

1680
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,960
And it's fun. It's fun to win that way.

1681
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,960
Most of my friends said that they didn't like the fists, but I really liked the fists.

1682
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,960
They're okay. They're not my favorite, but they're fine.

1683
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,960
I think just because they remind me of the fist weapon in Devil May Cry.

1684
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,960
They were the last weapon that I got the final upgrade of.

1685
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:16,960
Actually, I don't think... I don't think I've unlocked the last aspect of them, but I haven't used it yet.

1686
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,960
Because I always go with the weapon that has the...

1687
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,960
The darkness buff.

1688
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,960
Yes, the dark... I always... Yeah.

1689
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,960
Because otherwise you just leave in darkness on the table.

1690
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,960
That's free money.

1691
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,960
It is. That's permanent. That's permanent progress.

1692
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,960
You churn credit cards. You're not going to turn down a darkness buff.

1693
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:40,960
Yeah. Although it's more about the gems now.

1694
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,960
I've got all the darkness I really need.

1695
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,960
Now I just want to buy new chairs for the lounge.

1696
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,960
I do really like doing money builds.

1697
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,960
Getting upgrades and stuff that just mean that you get a fuck ton of money.

1698
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,960
Oh, obons or gold or whatever.

1699
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,960
Yeah, and then just dumping it in Karon's shop and becoming absurd by having a million powers.

1700
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:12,960
When you get the Chaos Boons that gives you plus 93% gold.

1701
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,960
Yeah.

1702
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,960
Yeah, all right.

1703
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,960
And then there's Dionysus ones that give you 15 gold when you exit a room and you can stack those together.

1704
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,960
That's a Hermes.

1705
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,960
Oh, okay. Yeah, they're Hermes with gold ones.

1706
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:30,960
Side hustle. Side hustle gives you 15 gold every time you go in their new room.

1707
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,960
God, it rules.

1708
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,960
It does rule. What a good fucking game.

1709
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,960
It's just a good ass video game.

1710
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,960
Unlike Elden Ring.

1711
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,960
I don't think I'm going to play it for an entire year like I did with Noita.

1712
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:51,960
Although I did boot up Noita again this week and I got a run going and then I died and I was like, I don't care.

1713
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,960
I don't care that I died.

1714
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,960
I'm sort of glad that the run's over.

1715
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,960
I was bored.

1716
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:01,960
I've told you that I've still never beaten Noita at all this time.

1717
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,960
Well, how many hours have you played it for?

1718
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,960
Let me have a look.

1719
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,960
I've probably played it for like 800 hours.

1720
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,960
I know Spork beat it a lot quicker than I did.

1721
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,960
Well, Spork beat it.

1722
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,960
Do you know why Spork beat it?

1723
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,960
Why?

1724
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,960
Because I was walking her through a run.

1725
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:28,960
She was streaming it and I was just kind of like observing and telling her like, oh yeah, go for that.

1726
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,960
Go for that.

1727
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,960
Or like, try this.

1728
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,960
Or like, wait, wait, wait.

1729
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,960
Try to build the wand like this.

1730
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,960
Okay, so I've played 40 hours and I haven't gotten a single win.

1731
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,960
That's fine.

1732
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,960
I had kind of penis envy with that and I was like, I'm embarrassed.

1733
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,960
My penis is small because I haven't beaten Noita and I've played it 40 hours.

1734
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,960
It probably took me longer than that to get my first win.

1735
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,960
I don't remember, honestly.

1736
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,960
It's something I dip back into every now and again, but I don't play it for like explosive bursts.

1737
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,960
I have occasion.

1738
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:09,960
I'll be like, I don't know, wasting time fucking opening up Metal Gear and then playing one mission and being like, cool.

1739
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,960
And then I'll just go, Noita, okay.

1740
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,960
And I'll do that.

1741
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,960
It's when I'm like bouncing between games.

1742
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,960
I have occasionally been watching.

1743
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:23,960
There's a new guy I've been seeing on YouTube who does Noita like info videos every now and then.

1744
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,960
He's called Dunker Slam.

1745
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,960
He has made some videos recently that have...

1746
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,960
I actually didn't know some things about...

1747
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,960
Okay, here's a weird thing that I found out.

1748
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:39,960
You ever found a spell that's just called like water or oil or blood?

1749
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,960
Yeah.

1750
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,960
And it's just like a ball and it just squirts out a little squirt of whatever it is?

1751
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,960
Yeah.

1752
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,960
Okay.

1753
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,960
Well, you can use...

1754
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
Okay.

1755
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:58,960
I knew that people use those along with the like crit on wet, quit on oil, quit on bloody, or crit on those things.

1756
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,960
Like when your enemy is wet with something, you deal an automatic crit.

1757
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,960
Well, so I knew people did that.

1758
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:11,960
I thought what you had to do with that was to put the material spell on a trigger.

1759
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:19,960
So like spark bolt to trigger so that the material would spawn on them when the trigger spark hit them.

1760
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,960
Wouldn't that be like after though, logically, just triggered by it?

1761
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:25,960
No.

1762
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,960
Well, I think because normally when you cast that material spell...

1763
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,960
I guess after the first shot it doesn't matter.

1764
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,960
Well, when you cast the material spell, a bit squirts out of your wand.

1765
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:39,960
But if you cast a trigger, spark bolt with trigger, the spark bolt would hit and then it would just cast out of the trigger,

1766
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,960
which would be, you know, on the enemy that it hit.

1767
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,960
Yeah.

1768
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,960
So I thought that's how you had to do it.

1769
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:58,960
Turns out, no, if you cast a block of spells that includes a material spell, all projectiles in that block will have the property

1770
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:06,960
that they will inflict that material wetness status on anything they hit just automatically.

1771
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,960
So if you cast a double spell with a spark bolt and a water and you shoot it,

1772
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,960
like a little drop of water will come out of your wand and be like,

1773
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,960
but also the spark bolt will hit them and make them wet.

1774
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,960
And so if you have a crit on wet, it will do an automatic crit.

1775
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:29,960
And that's not like a specific like modifier that just happens if you have that in like a block of spells.

1776
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,960
Yeah, you don't have to get like a does this effect spell to add to it.

1777
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,960
No, it's basically like it.

1778
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,960
Wow.

1779
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:40,960
Yeah.

1780
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,960
Like that, like the material spells are not modifier spells.

1781
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:52,960
And yet they sort of have this hidden thing that they do where they sort of give this secret modifier to projectiles in their cast block

1782
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,960
that makes them make enemies wet.

1783
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,960
That's so cool.

1784
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:04,960
It's it's sort of cool because like it it sort of feels honestly,

1785
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,960
it sort of feels like the developer just throwing you a bone even though it doesn't make sense.

1786
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,960
Yeah, like it doesn't really make sense why that would happen.

1787
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,960
But like, they're just like, did it to make the crit on material spells good?

1788
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,960
No, it's just like those things.

1789
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,960
It's just like, I can't imagine like even starting to make a game like that.

1790
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:25,960
You know what I mean?

1791
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,960
There's so much like just the way the system of the ones works.

1792
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,960
It's so clever and so complicated.

1793
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,960
I I can imagine I can understand.

1794
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:48,960
I can understand the like seed idea and having like like like what if the world was built of pixels that were materials and they were simulated

1795
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,960
because, you know, the sand game or whatever.

1796
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,960
The one thing.

1797
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,960
Yeah, the one the one building stuff.

1798
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,960
It's pretty it's pretty nuts.

1799
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,960
It is impressive.

1800
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,960
It's very it's very robust the way that.

1801
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,960
Yeah, but also it's pretty janky.

1802
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:16,960
Like when you like the way that the spells interact like you can learn them and you can make use of its quirks,

1803
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:26,960
but like its quirks are really weird and don't feel designed intentionally all the time.

1804
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,960
Like spell wrapping kind of just seems like it happened by accident and they just left it in.

1805
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:36,960
That's when you'd like fill an empty slot with a light or something to just make it so it recharges quicker.

1806
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,960
Yeah.

1807
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:43,960
Yeah, that's when you put a modifier at the end of the cast at the end of the ones casts.

1808
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,960
And so it tries to cast the modifier.

1809
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:53,960
But because it isn't modifying anything, it loops around and casts the first block in the wand a second time.

1810
01:18:53,960 --> 01:19:04,960
And the fact that you can do that to effectively do like you can just have you can just make like a mana refresher spell just cast twice per block,

1811
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,960
even though you only have one.

1812
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,960
It feels like an accident, honestly.

1813
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,960
But it's the kind of fun accident that develops.

1814
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,960
It's a fun.

1815
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,960
Yes, it is.

1816
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,960
It's a fun accident and I don't think it's bad.

1817
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,960
But I also don't think they knew exactly what they were doing.

1818
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,960
But that's OK.

1819
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:27,960
But I think I was going to have.

1820
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:36,960
So was there another example of like the material, the wetness thing, the way that shit, I was going to go somewhere.

1821
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,960
There was one other example that was similar.

1822
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,960
Oh, the.

1823
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,960
Yeah, those material spells.

1824
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:50,960
Another thing about them that is maybe not immediately obvious is they're actually just fucking awesome.

1825
01:19:50,960 --> 01:20:01,960
Even if you don't have a crit on material spell, they're awesome because they cast they cost no mana, but they give a huge cast delay and recharge time reduction.

1826
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,960
Oh, so just just put them in a block like and like, yeah, you'll be squirting water or oil or whatever.

1827
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,960
But you'll also just cast like way faster angels turn it into a machine gun.

1828
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,960
If you if you don't mind having water everywhere, like you can just make it want way better.

1829
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:22,960
Like it's actually they're actually really good modifiers, just just because.

1830
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,960
Yeah.

1831
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
Yeah.

1832
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,960
Dunker slam is I don't know.

1833
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:29,960
He's pretty good.

1834
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,960
He's shown me some shit.

1835
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,960
I didn't know about it.

1836
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,960
I had I had fucked around a little bit with the material.

1837
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,960
Like I'd put him on the trigger and gotten them to do the like the material crit like that did work.

1838
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,960
But it turns out I was like over complicating it.

1839
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,960
It's actually way easier to achieve the same effect.

1840
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:48,960
Hell yeah.

1841
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Yeah.

1842
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,960
Oh man.

1843
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:51,960
Okay.

1844
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:59,960
Wait, I got to tell you a little while ago I got a run and I got a I built it so that do you know the thing about bouncing burst?

1845
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,960
The secret thing.

1846
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,960
There's a secret thing.

1847
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,960
Yeah.

1848
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,960
No, I didn't think so.

1849
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,960
Bouncing burst is the is the green one that like bounces around.

1850
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,960
Yeah.

1851
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,960
Well, it has a secret property that it actually does.

1852
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,960
It doesn't always do the same damage.

1853
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:27,960
It's damage actually is a like it's based on a like comparison of its initial speed to it's the speed at which it hits the enemy.

1854
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:35,960
So if you can get it to start slow and hit fast, it does like it can do like thousands of damage with a single shot.

1855
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,960
Yeah.

1856
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:46,960
So if you have heavy shot, which makes it slow, but you have accelerating shot, which makes it accelerate, you can cast bouncing burst and it will start really slow and get faster and faster.

1857
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,960
And if it hits an enemy like that, it will do like thousands of damage.

1858
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,960
And does it still like bounces for?

1859
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,960
It does bounce.

1860
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,960
Yeah.

1861
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,960
It bounces the same number of times, whatever that is.

1862
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:03,960
So you can sort of like set up like a few like slow moving bouncing ones that get faster and then do a lot of damage.

1863
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:19,960
I had a build where I had a one that was a spark bolt with trigger and then on the trigger, I put, you know, like a big multicast and I had a bunch of bouncing bursts that were all heavy shot and accelerating shot and homing shot.

1864
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:20,960
Oh my God.

1865
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,960
So my every and bouncing burst is not expensive.

1866
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,960
It did not take much mana to do this.

1867
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:38,960
So every shot I did would have like, you know, eight bouncing bursts would come out that would all be slow heavy shots and then they would accelerate and then they would and then they would go everywhere and they would home in on enemies.

1868
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:54,960
And they would do like thousands of damage for every and I was and I was literally like machine gun shooting out spark bolt triggers that were all just exploding in these like unbelievably deadly accelerating homing bouncing burst that just sought out enemies and killed everything.

1869
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,960
It was awesome.

1870
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,960
That was probably maybe the most impressive just like kill everything on screen like without even thinking about it.

1871
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,960
Build the damage was off the chain.

1872
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,960
I love stuff like that.

1873
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,960
And that's what makes Hades appealing as well is figuring out little tricks and just find the perfect little combo.

1874
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,960
I get I get the same feeling.

1875
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:22,960
I get a similar feeling in Hades when I find because in Hades, the best defense is a good offense.

1876
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:34,960
So when you when you get a bunch of like when you get like an epic boon, like an epic or heroic boon on, you know, on one thing, like usually it's my attack.

1877
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,960
But sometimes it can be my cast or my special.

1878
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:43,960
Usually it's the attack, but like you get like, you know, a good attack boosting boon on your on your base attack.

1879
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,960
Plus you get a day a good Daedalus pair of Daedalus boons that just boost your attack.

1880
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,960
And like is everything comes together and it's all stacked on like your base attack.

1881
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:03,960
And it's like, OK, all I got to do is just spam my base attack and it just like choose through bosses health bars and just the damage is so good that like nothing can stop me.

1882
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,960
I love the point in a game where you find something and it feels unfair, but you don't care anymore.

1883
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,960
It feels so good.

1884
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,960
Yeah.

1885
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,960
The Elden Ring was pretty good about that.

1886
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,960
The whole system that they have set up where you can like add a special ability to like any normal weapon.

1887
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,960
I have not played Elden Ring.

1888
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,960
Basically, you can like mix and match different powers on different weapons.

1889
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:40,960
So you can just have like a normal longsword and then put like an ability on it where if you hit left trigger, it will just shoot like a basic sorcery spell.

1890
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,960
And with a trick like when you attack.

1891
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,960
Yeah.

1892
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,960
No, it's just it's a separate attack, but it's just on the weapon.

1893
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,960
Yeah.

1894
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,960
But the way that those work is they scale with the weapon level as opposed to your stats.

1895
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,960
So you can you can be like an entirely strength character.

1896
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:06,960
But if you put like there's a spell called Glintstone Phalanx, which summons four swords and then they shoot at the enemy.

1897
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,960
It's like the homing soul mass from Dark Souls.

1898
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:10,960
Okay.

1899
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,960
Yeah.

1900
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,960
But it scales with your weapon level.

1901
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,960
So if you have like a plus 10 sword, but you don't even need the intelligence to cast that.

1902
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,960
So you can do you can just be like a crazy strong guy.

1903
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,960
So your normal sword swings do like super damage.

1904
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,960
But then also you have this backup range attack.

1905
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,960
And each one of those does like a fuckload of stun damage.

1906
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,960
So you can cast that once and then four swords hit a guy.

1907
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,960
And if that doesn't start, you can just do one basic jumping attack and that will stun him.

1908
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,960
And then you can do like a repose attack.

1909
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,960
And there's so many little fucking.

1910
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,960
Oh, oh, it's good.

1911
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:53,960
I admit I have felt some pangs of like, I'm missing out when I see some some of the Elden Ring discussion.

1912
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,960
It is a real good game.

1913
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,960
I'm not a I'm not a huge souls guy like it's I'm okay.

1914
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,960
Yeah, like souls is fine.

1915
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,960
But the Elden Ring seems really big and kind of fun.

1916
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,960
I mean, like if you like Breath of the Wild and you like Dark Souls,

1917
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,960
I haven't played Breath of the Wild, but it I've watched someone play a bunch of it.

1918
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,960
And it also like is another one.

1919
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,960
I would play it.

1920
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,960
That is all about player experimentation.

1921
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,960
Yeah.

1922
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:26,960
It rules.

1923
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,960
Elden Ring is good until the last spot.

1924
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,960
The last phase of the last boss, which really pissed me off.

1925
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,960
Then it sucks.

1926
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,960
Yeah.

1927
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,960
There's some there's some shit in that game that really does feel like Dark Souls 2 where it's like.

1928
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,960
I've been I've been spoiled on like one or two of the bosses.

1929
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:44,960
Yeah.

1930
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,960
I've seen I've seen Radon.

1931
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,960
Radon is is insane.

1932
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,960
I know about Radon.

1933
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,960
It's fucking like the weirdest idea to put in one of those games, but it kind of works.

1934
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,960
Yeah.

1935
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,960
Yeah.

1936
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,960
But also made me very angry while I was doing it.

1937
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,960
And then immediately afterwards, like that was the coolest thing I've done in a video game.

1938
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,960
There's lots of movies like that.

1939
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:11,960
I saw Radon and I was like, OK, I kind of see what the game's doing a little bit.

1940
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,960
Yeah.

1941
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,960
I feel I feel bad for anyone with a sense of pride when they play Dark Souls games,

1942
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,960
like the people who are like absolutely no summon ever.

1943
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:19,960
Oh, sure.

1944
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,960
Like you're not going to be Elden Ring unless you just absurdly good.

1945
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,960
I mean, to be honest, that's how I played.

1946
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,960
That's how I played Dark Souls was no no summoning.

1947
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,960
I felt like I was cheating if I summoned.

1948
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,960
I've always been that way as well.

1949
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:40,960
But with Elden Ring, I got it got to a point and then I just fully committed to the win as a win mentality.

1950
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,960
I mean, it's I mean, it's in the game for you to use.

1951
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,960
So yeah, sure.

1952
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,960
I just feel lucky that there's so many absurd like combos that you can do.

1953
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,960
I mean, there's there's a whole system of like a flash that you can mix like different effects in,

1954
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,960
which just give you temporary buffs.

1955
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,960
And one of them is you can cast unlimited magic for 10 seconds.

1956
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,960
You can combine that with another one that like triples your magic damage.

1957
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,960
And then there's also a spell that puts a rune on the floor that triples your magic damage.

1958
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,960
And there's a there's a spell which is just a giant Kamehameha laser beam.

1959
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,960
Which usually you can only cast for about four seconds, even with like really high like magic.

1960
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,960
Because it just it just eats up all your mana.

1961
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:32,960
But with that combination, you can cast it for like a full 10 seconds and you can just straight up kill like most things in the game.

1962
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,960
The problem is you can't redirect it.

1963
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
So it has to be like a slow moving enemy.

1964
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:37,960
Otherwise you're fucked.

1965
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,960
Right.

1966
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,960
Now you've sent the people I've summoned, like because I did a little bit of like,

1967
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,960
Oh, I'll summon some people fun and you talk about summoning from from online like real people.

1968
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,960
Yeah, most people just use that fucking ability.

1969
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,960
Kamehameha beams.

1970
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,960
Yeah.

1971
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,960
Because I feel like people are like, Oh, I'm so clever.

1972
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:02,960
I figured out how to cast it like you're like an insane person, but like everyone's doing the same thing.

1973
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,960
Yeah.

1974
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,960
Yeah.

1975
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,960
I mean, we have when I played, have you played Lisa?

1976
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,960
No.

1977
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:18,960
In Lisa, like Lisa has a thing where there's a drug, the main character is addicted to this drug called joy.

1978
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,960
Right.

1979
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:26,960
And you can use joy in the game and it makes you super powerful for like the battle that you use it in.

1980
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,960
It's a really strong and good item.

1981
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,960
Yeah.

1982
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:36,960
But it gives you, well, I mean, your main character is addicted no matter what he'll have withdrawals.

1983
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,960
But like, you can use it on other characters too, but it will make them addicted and they will get withdrawals.

1984
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:42,960
Right.

1985
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,960
And basically you're, I think to get the good ending, you have to not use any joy.

1986
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:54,960
Then, but then in the sequel or the DLC or whatever, there's joy.

1987
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:01,960
You're expected to use it like it's technically possible to beat the game without using joy, but you're expected to use joy.

1988
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,960
And if you don't, you're punishing yourself.

1989
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,960
You won't have a good time.

1990
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,960
There's no consequences for using it.

1991
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:08,960
Exactly.

1992
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:15,960
Because I guess, narratively, it's canon that the character is using it, so just fucking use it.

1993
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:24,960
It feels like Frozoff sort of decided that that sort of mentality with summoning, but they've done it another way because there's NPC summons now.

1994
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,960
Yeah.

1995
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:31,960
Where you can like summon any, like you can find the ash of basically any enemy in the game and then summon them to help you.

1996
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,960
And it rules.

1997
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,960
Oh.

1998
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:34,960
It's real fun.

1999
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,960
Like, I mean, there were NPC summons in Dark Souls.

2000
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:38,960
No, yeah.

2001
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:43,960
They're not like character NPCs, but like you can literally just have like Pokemon stands from JoJo.

2002
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:44,960
It's great.

2003
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,960
So you can just have like a particular ghost that you will summon over and over again.

2004
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:55,960
So say you really like the imp guys who, they're like little gargoyle men who hit people really fast and do a lot of bleed damage.

2005
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:00,960
You can find their ash and then that means that you can summon them as ghosts to help you.

2006
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,960
And it's balanced pretty well because there's only certain areas you can do it.

2007
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,960
You can do it in pretty much any boss fight and then like certain areas in the open world.

2008
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,960
There's a fuck ton of enemies.

2009
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,960
You can call in your boys to even the odds.

2010
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:12,960
Yeah.

2011
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,960
Calling the boys.

2012
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:21,960
There's a really good one, which is just it summons like, you know, the basic bitch zombies that like do nothing in Dark Souls.

2013
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,960
Sure.

2014
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,960
Yeah.

2015
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Like in the first area, there's one that just summons like 10 of those.

2016
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,960
You mean there's a ghost summon?

2017
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,960
Yeah.

2018
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,960
Yeah.

2019
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,960
They're useless, but they're just meat shields.

2020
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,960
Yeah.

2021
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:36,960
I was watching.

2022
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,960
Like Skelly.

2023
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,960
Summon Skelly.

2024
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,960
Let the enemy beat the shit out of him.

2025
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,960
I was going to bring this up when we were talking about Hades, but like German got obsessed with that one.

2026
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,960
And every time he used it, he would just go, boys.

2027
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:56,960
And there's one moment where he's like walking through like they walked into a room and he sees that he's allowed to summon like the symbol on the side of the screen appears and he goes,

2028
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
right, boys, and summons them.

2029
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:05,960
They step forward and they immediately get crushed by a chandelier and all of them die.

2030
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,960
And it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

2031
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,960
Gentlemen, gentlemen, we have no choice.

2032
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,960
We must summon the boys.

2033
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,960
And of course, the best one is a summon that is you.

2034
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:25,960
So like towards the second half of the game, you can find there's a boss fight, which is called the Mimic Tier, and it turns into you and uses your build against you.

2035
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,960
Which is a fun idea.

2036
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,960
And then you can find that as a summon later on.

2037
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,960
And if you summons a copy of yourself?

2038
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:38,960
Yeah, summons a copy of yourself so you can sort of just have to trust no one but yourself.

2039
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,960
It's great.

2040
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:40,960
That's awesome.

2041
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:48,960
And what I did was I leveled up my strength enough so that I could carry two greatswords.

2042
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,960
And then I would switch off the greatsword.

2043
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,960
So I was dual wielding greatswords.

2044
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,960
Summoned the Mimic Tier, he would appear with the two greatswords and now I'd switch back to my seat shield.

2045
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:06,960
So I could sort of be, I could be the one that lives and he could be the one that goes nuts.

2046
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:07,960
It's funny.

2047
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:08,960
It is funny.

2048
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,960
It sounds like a really fun game.

2049
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:11,960
It is.

2050
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:12,960
It's on Steam, right?

2051
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,960
Yeah.

2052
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:20,960
I guess I technically could get it if I wanted to, but I'm scared of commitment.

2053
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,960
But Ben, the horse can double jump.

2054
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,960
I know.

2055
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,960
You've seen the horse double jumping.

2056
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:27,960
The horse is cool.

2057
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:28,960
He's a goat horse.

2058
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,960
He jumps.

2059
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,960
And there's a cool Welsh witch girl who talks to you.

2060
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:34,960
I might.

2061
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,960
Damn.

2062
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,960
I almost feel, this is stupid.

2063
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,960
I almost feel like it's too late.

2064
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,960
Like Elden Ring was the hot thing for like a week or two there.

2065
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,960
It feels like everyone's beat it now.

2066
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,960
Everyone who bought it at launch has gone through it now.

2067
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:51,960
Yeah, I feel like I've, I mean, it's not a good reason not to play it.

2068
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
No.

2069
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,960
But I do feel like I've missed the moment when it was like the thing everyone was doing.

2070
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,960
There was a great, like the first two weeks of just talking to people.

2071
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:02,960
Oh, have you found this yet?

2072
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:03,960
It was one of those games.

2073
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:04,960
Yeah.

2074
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:05,960
Have you found this yet?

2075
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:06,960
Did you find that?

2076
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,960
Oh, did you know you can do this?

2077
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:08,960
That looks like fun.

2078
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,960
Yeah.

2079
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,960
Yeah.

2080
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,960
I'm sure there's aspects of that.

2081
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,960
Like you could still always have a friend who knows a little bit more.

2082
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,960
That's the way it is.

2083
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,960
And I feel like the game is definitely designed around that.

2084
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,960
Like with the message system and everything.

2085
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:22,960
Yeah.

2086
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,960
Oh, God.

2087
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,960
Yeah.

2088
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,960
It's pretty great.

2089
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,960
Yeah.

2090
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,960
Just some, just some real bad balance issues towards the end of just how do we, how do

2091
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,960
we make this boss fight hard?

2092
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,960
Oh, that kind of balance.

2093
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,960
Just hundreds of AoE spell attacks at the same time.

2094
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:40,960
Sure.

2095
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:41,960
Yeah.

2096
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,960
Fuck it.

2097
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:43,960
Fun.

2098
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,960
And that's when you summon the moot here and let him dangle the damage so you can

2099
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,960
I might, I might get it.

2100
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,960
I don't know.

2101
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,960
I might get it at some point.

2102
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,960
Maybe when you burn out on Hades.

2103
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,960
Yeah.

2104
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,960
Maybe when I, if I either burn out or just like exhaust everything there is to do in Hades,

2105
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,960
maybe the next one I would consider might be Elden Ring.

2106
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,960
I'd recommend it.

2107
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,960
Good game.

2108
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,960
Yeah.

2109
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:08,960
I'm thinking about it.

2110
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,960
I'm thinking about it.

2111
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,960
I have to, I have to pee.

2112
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,960
Me too.

2113
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:13,960
Okay.

2114
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,960
Let's take a, let's, let's break for a minute.

2115
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:16,960
All right.

2116
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:17,960
Sick.

2117
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,960
Hell yeah.

2118
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,960
I've returned from urinating.

2119
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:22,960
Hell yeah.

2120
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:27,960
Hey, Elis, make my audio five times louder and with a big echo sound.

2121
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:39,960
I'm back.

2122
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:40,960
Hell yeah.

2123
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:41,960
Me too.

2124
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:42,960
Nice, nice.

2125
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,960
That was a clean break.

2126
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:44,960
We did it.

2127
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,960
I definitely didn't say anything into my microphone after I came back.

2128
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,960
Don't worry about it.

2129
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,960
Good.

2130
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,960
There's no secret audio.

2131
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,960
Excellent.

2132
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,960
Yes.

2133
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:02,960
I love when there's no secret audio.

2134
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,960
Let me look at my stupid notes here.

2135
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,960
I had one other thing on my things to mention list.

2136
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:16,960
I asked, this week I asked CC, the Tails gets trolled guy about if I could, if I could

2137
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,960
draw a page for Tails gets trolled.

2138
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:19,960
Nice.

2139
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,960
I'm going to, I'm going to do it.

2140
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,960
I'm going to do a page.

2141
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:23,960
I'm going to do it.

2142
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:24,960
I'm going to do a page.

2143
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,960
Do you have like a brief or anything?

2144
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,960
Or is it just, yeah, you can do that at this point?

2145
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,960
No, they gave me, they're a factory.

2146
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,960
They're like a well oiled machine.

2147
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:41,960
From what I've seen, it seems very organized, alarmingly organized for something called

2148
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,960
Tails gets trolled.

2149
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,960
It is shockingly organized.

2150
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,960
So I asked CC, can I do one?

2151
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,960
He was like, yeah, sure.

2152
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,960
And then he said, I think he said, ask Embergram.

2153
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,960
He said message Embergram.

2154
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,960
That's a laser bots brother.

2155
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:02,960
Yeah.

2156
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,960
He said message Embergram about it.

2157
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,960
So I messaged Embergram.

2158
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:10,960
He was like, I was like, hey, CC told me to ask you about doing a page.

2159
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,960
He was like, did you, I think he asked me, like, did you submit, did you submit like

2160
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,960
a resume or something?

2161
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,960
Or did you submit like a sample?

2162
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:22,960
And I said, no, but you know, CC knows my art.

2163
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,960
He told me to just ask you about it.

2164
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,960
Yeah, I'm kind of a big shot, you know.

2165
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,960
Well, he said, can I see your work?

2166
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:30,960
And I said, sure.

2167
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,960
I have comics on my website and I linked to my website.

2168
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,960
He was like, he was like, yeah, looks good, looks good.

2169
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:45,960
And then I think he said, I think he said, by the way, like, I know who you are because

2170
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:46,960
I know your video.

2171
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,960
I just, I didn't know you made comics.

2172
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,960
I was like, all right.

2173
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,960
That's great.

2174
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,960
Yeah.

2175
01:37:53,960 --> 01:38:00,960
So they got me into the like artist server and they put me in my own little room.

2176
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,960
So I have my own little sub channel, which is specifically about the page that I'm, oh,

2177
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,960
no, I asked him.

2178
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,960
I said, hey, I was the voice of Satan in the audio book.

2179
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,960
So if there's a page with Satan on it, could I draw that one?

2180
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,960
And he was like, funnily enough, I'm finishing writing the script for a Satan page right

2181
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,960
now.

2182
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,960
I'll give you that one.

2183
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:20,960
That's great.

2184
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,960
I was like, hell, yeah, I was like, hell, yeah.

2185
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:27,960
So yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a script in there.

2186
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:32,960
And I got to draw, I have to draw it by, they gave me like two or three weeks to draw it.

2187
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,960
The deadline is like April 14th.

2188
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,960
No, that's fine.

2189
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:36,960
Yeah.

2190
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:37,960
Yeah.

2191
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,960
It shouldn't be too bad.

2192
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,960
So I got to do that.

2193
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,960
Actually, I've been sitting on that for like almost a week now.

2194
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,960
So I should get on it.

2195
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,960
Never mind.

2196
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,960
Get to fucking work.

2197
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,960
Yeah.

2198
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,960
So maybe not, maybe like four days.

2199
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,960
Yeah.

2200
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:53,960
So I got to do that.

2201
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,960
But I thought that was a pretty funny.

2202
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,960
Cool.

2203
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,960
That's lovely.

2204
01:38:58,960 --> 01:38:59,960
I know.

2205
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:00,960
Yeah.

2206
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,960
It's a great little turnaround on now you were saying, now you make Satan.

2207
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,960
They're going to pay me something.

2208
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,960
I don't know.

2209
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,960
I told CC, just give me the standard fee.

2210
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,960
Just give me whatever is normal to pay someone for an artist.

2211
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,960
And I don't, and I don't know what amount that is.

2212
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:23,960
If it's hilariously low, then that'd be funny.

2213
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:24,960
I don't know.

2214
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,960
It would be funny if it's like 10 bucks.

2215
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,960
No.

2216
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,960
I mean, I don't know.

2217
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:34,960
I will report back when I know, when I get that and find out how much it is.

2218
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,960
There's got to be one chink in the armor of the insane organization of the Tails gets

2219
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,960
rolled team.

2220
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:42,960
Perhaps.

2221
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,960
Perhaps.

2222
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,960
And it's the payment.

2223
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,960
I mean, I'm not doing it.

2224
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,960
I just wanted to do it to do it.

2225
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,960
But also, I don't believe in working for free.

2226
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,960
I kind of would do it for free, but I just don't want to.

2227
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,960
I'd rather do it in a professional capacity.

2228
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,960
So just give me whatever is normal.

2229
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,960
Also, you like money and money is good to have.

2230
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,960
Yeah, I mean, sure.

2231
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,960
At the moment.

2232
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,960
I mean, I imagine it won't be.

2233
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:19,960
I mean, I'm not counting on a huge amount here, but we'll see.

2234
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,960
I mean, the pages are long.

2235
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,960
You've read.

2236
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,960
Tails.

2237
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:24,960
Yeah.

2238
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,960
The I don't like nowadays a page is not like one.

2239
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,960
I've read the early stuff.

2240
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,960
I never got too far.

2241
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,960
Well, I think it varies.

2242
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,960
But like now, like a page is not one comic page.

2243
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,960
A page is like a long column.

2244
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,960
Oh, so it's probably the equivalent of like two or three.

2245
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,960
It's sort of like a webtoon page.

2246
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,960
Yes.

2247
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,960
Yes.

2248
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,960
So it's longer than almost a chapter, but like not.

2249
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,960
Not a chapter chapter.

2250
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,960
No, yeah.

2251
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,960
Yeah.

2252
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,960
So it's it's a bit it's a bit long, but you know, that's all right.

2253
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,960
I was imagining when you said I've got to draw a page in three weeks.

2254
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,960
I was like, well, don't bend way faster than that.

2255
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,960
Even even I am faster than that.

2256
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:08,960
Yeah.

2257
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,960
God knows.

2258
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,960
I mean, depends depends on the drawing.

2259
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:14,960
You turn out.

2260
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,960
You turn out.

2261
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,960
I have ups and downs.

2262
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,960
Sure.

2263
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,960
Big ups and downs.

2264
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:28,960
Man, actually speaking of being slow, what I have been doing this week, and I may have

2265
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:35,960
mentioned this previously a bit, but I've continued to do it is I've been taking.

2266
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,960
I'm trying to do the book format for slime and punishment.

2267
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,960
And what I'm doing is I'm taking screenshots of the game.

2268
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,960
I'm trying to organize screenshots of phantoms revenge and organize them into like a readable

2269
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,960
sort of sequential comic.

2270
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:50,960
I see.

2271
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,960
Put that on the page so it's in.

2272
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,960
And that's very tedious because otherwise you would just have to have like you turn the

2273
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,960
page and then it's a URL and it says go play phantoms range.

2274
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,960
Yeah, which I could do that, but I don't want to.

2275
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:06,960
I wanted to be in there.

2276
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,960
So but it's not it's not just as simple.

2277
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:15,960
Okay, first of all, to get those screenshots, I didn't want to like play through the game

2278
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:20,960
and like hit print screen every time I got to a scene that I wanted.

2279
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:27,960
So I had I fucked around an OBS to get a screen recording that was that like, you know, a

2280
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:32,960
lossless quality so that I could just have perfect screenshots.

2281
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,960
Oh, no.

2282
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,960
So I so I record it was pretty big.

2283
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,960
The file size.

2284
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,960
I could imagine.

2285
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,960
But but I could handle it.

2286
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:46,960
So I have this master file that is like a high resolution play through of the game.

2287
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,960
And I've go through that in VLC doing like screen, you know, frame capture this frame

2288
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,960
this frame this frame.

2289
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,960
And then I'm putting them together.

2290
01:42:54,960 --> 01:43:02,960
And sometimes I'll like take two images and like combine them like in a room where like

2291
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,960
there's a bunch of attacks instead of showing like every turn of the game.

2292
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,960
I'll show a few images that are like phantom and Virginia like, you know, attacking together

2293
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,960
like multiple like killing like multiple enemies in a single shot or whatever.

2294
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,960
Yeah, just to make it try to not make it drag any more than it needs to.

2295
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:25,960
But it's very tedious because like, I'll have to put two images over each other and

2296
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:30,960
like, you know, erase parts of one to include bits from the other and then I'll have to

2297
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,960
go and like, oh wait, the blood splatters are inconsistent.

2298
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,960
Okay, I got to like fix those.

2299
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,960
And you got to make sure all the pixels line up because sometimes there's like a screen

2300
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,960
shake and I got to account for screen shake to make the images match each other and stuff.

2301
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:48,960
So it's like in a movie when there's two of the same guy on screen, except it's attacks

2302
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,960
in your brony game.

2303
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:51,960
Right.

2304
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:57,960
And you got a green screen, the screen to when you apply green screen because there

2305
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:01,960
were two of the guy and you got a green screen to make them out.

2306
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,960
So there's only one.

2307
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,960
Yeah.

2308
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,960
It's like, it's like that.

2309
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:11,960
Or like Jack and Jill by Adams, by master filmmaker Adam Sandler where it's the reverse.

2310
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,960
Yeah.

2311
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:19,960
It's the reverse of putting, taking two images with two guys and putting both guys in the

2312
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:20,960
shot.

2313
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,960
We got two guys in the shot.

2314
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,960
We got to get one of them out.

2315
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:23,960
We got two guys.

2316
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:24,960
We got a green screen one of them.

2317
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,960
Just too many guys.

2318
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,960
We got two guys.

2319
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,960
I've only made 14 pages.

2320
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,960
It sometimes takes me like several hours just to like put together screenshots from the

2321
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:43,960
game and just line them up and get them all looking right and be like, yes, the formatting

2322
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:44,960
is good.

2323
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:45,960
It looks clean.

2324
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:46,960
Yeah.

2325
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,960
I guess with the exact pixel stuff, you definitely don't want any overlap or anything.

2326
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,960
Yeah.

2327
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:59,960
I'm trying to hurry it, but like, yeah, because it's pixels, it can be very finicky and I

2328
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:07,960
just want to get one and be like, oh, wait, he's in slightly the wrong pose.

2329
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,960
It's the wrong frame of his animation.

2330
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:14,960
I'll go back in and be like, get the same shot but like at a different point in his animation

2331
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:20,960
cycle so that like two images will go cleanly over one another and stuff.

2332
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,960
To save myself the work of like, you know, having to like manually edit it.

2333
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:26,960
So that's been tedious.

2334
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,960
At least you don't have to make new stuff.

2335
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,960
Honestly, I've been a little surprised.

2336
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:40,960
Like, sometimes it's like, damn, this can like, feels like it takes longer than just

2337
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,960
drawing a panel would take sometimes occasionally.

2338
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,960
But it's come along.

2339
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:47,960
I've got 14 pages done.

2340
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,960
I'm probably like almost halfway through bookifying that.

2341
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,960
So that's good.

2342
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:56,960
Yeah.

2343
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:57,960
Sweet.

2344
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,960
And then I got it.

2345
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:05,960
It's going to be writing the index, writing all the notes.

2346
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,960
Oh my God.

2347
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,960
It's going to be really fucking long.

2348
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:16,960
And what's actually going to be quite maybe annoying is going to be like, I think I'm going

2349
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:25,960
to write it in like a notebook file and then like copy paste the text into like an image

2350
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:31,960
like like manga studio or something in like a text box because like I have not finalized

2351
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,960
what page size I'm using.

2352
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:38,960
I haven't I haven't chosen a printer yet because there's too many freaking options.

2353
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,960
And some of them are more cost some of them are more cost effective at like printing 100

2354
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:48,960
copies versus some of them would be a better deal to print like 500 copies.

2355
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,960
So I might print like one or two test copies from a couple different printers and then

2356
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:57,960
show them in the Kickstarter and just be like, listen, I just don't I don't know which of

2357
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,960
these I'm going to go with whichever one of these is most effective, but they're all mostly

2358
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:05,960
the same except like ever so slightly different dimensions.

2359
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:06,960
That might be the thing to do.

2360
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,960
I might just have to not settle on one.

2361
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:14,960
You know, but I have to be open to the possibility that the page size will change slightly in

2362
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,960
which case the formatting of the text would ideally be a little different.

2363
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:20,960
Yeah.

2364
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,960
So so I'll probably have to write the text in its own file and then when I know the final

2365
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,960
page size, put it in the file.

2366
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:28,960
Stick it in there.

2367
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,960
Get it out there.

2368
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:30,960
Exactly.

2369
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,960
Get the money.

2370
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:32,960
Get the smiles.

2371
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,960
Get the fucking money.

2372
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,960
I hope someone buys the book.

2373
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:39,960
Oh, yeah.

2374
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:42,960
Speaking of books, I got my copy of Lord of Ghosts.

2375
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:43,960
Yeah.

2376
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,960
Lord of Ghosts and my little pouch.

2377
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,960
Oh, hell yeah.

2378
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,960
Oh, hell yeah.

2379
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,960
I do not have mine yet.

2380
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,960
It's very surreal that the plush is just like real.

2381
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,960
It's like it feels like it like I went to a shop and bought it.

2382
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,960
So so nicely made compared to what I imagined.

2383
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:00,960
Yeah.

2384
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:01,960
Very nice.

2385
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:05,960
So you bought a plush of a Pokemon and you know how they usually like really good quality.

2386
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:06,960
It's like that.

2387
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:07,960
Wow.

2388
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:10,960
I did not expect that from a Kickstarter for a tiny book.

2389
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:11,960
Yeah.

2390
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,960
Yeah.

2391
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,960
She did a damn good job.

2392
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,960
I haven't read it yet.

2393
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:19,960
Oh, I mean, I've read it already on on on the internet.

2394
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:25,960
I was saving my reading for the physical version, but now I'm sort of in between reading other

2395
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,960
stuff and watching other stuff.

2396
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,960
And I I've sort of had to come piece.

2397
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,960
Yeah.

2398
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:35,960
I sort of had to come up with a rule for myself where I'm going to finish things more instead

2399
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,960
of like having tons of things like almost like, you know, how you'd like to start a project

2400
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:43,960
and then you start another project and you never finish anything.

2401
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,960
Sometimes the project is reading something.

2402
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:46,960
Yeah.

2403
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,960
No, I got in that with media in general.

2404
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,960
So I'd be I was like, like my brain was spread between like Elden Ring and like reading Bleach

2405
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,960
and watching Seinfeld.

2406
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,960
And I decided, right, I'm not going to do anything.

2407
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:00,960
Right.

2408
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,960
I'm not going to do any of the other things until the other things is done.

2409
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,960
So I finished Elden Ring.

2410
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,960
I've nearly finished Seinfeld now.

2411
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:09,960
Oh, wow.

2412
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,960
And like when I have free time and I'm not working on commissions, I'm doing one of those things.

2413
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,960
Are you still reading Bleach?

2414
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:16,960
No.

2415
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,960
Bleach is on hold until Seinfeld is done.

2416
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,960
But I'm in the last season of Seinfeld.

2417
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:21,960
So we'll come back.

2418
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:22,960
We'll come back.

2419
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,960
I've never read Bleach.

2420
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,960
I read up to where it gets bad.

2421
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,960
Cool.

2422
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,960
And like last year.

2423
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,960
But you're committed to finishing.

2424
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:33,960
Yeah.

2425
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,960
Now there's like the anime coming out later this year.

2426
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:40,960
And I'm like, I kind of want to watch the anime with people and like be hype because all my

2427
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:41,960
friends have already read it.

2428
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:42,960
Yeah.

2429
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,960
And even if it's bad, you know what I mean?

2430
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,960
That makes total sense.

2431
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,960
Yeah.

2432
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:52,960
So I'm going to power through because I know I dropped it last year.

2433
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,960
Like I read all this because I watched it when I was like 14.

2434
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,960
And I got to the end of the Soul Society arc, which is the bit everyone likes.

2435
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,960
And then I just didn't watch anymore.

2436
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,960
And then I read up to that point last year.

2437
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:08,960
And then I got to a bit and it's like that story reveal happened.

2438
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,960
I was like, that's fucking stupid.

2439
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,960
Stopped reading it.

2440
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:13,960
And now I'm reading it again.

2441
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,960
And it feels like like this.

2442
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,960
It feels like the manga isn't already out.

2443
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,960
It feels like it's come out for me now.

2444
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,960
It feels like I've been waiting for the sequel since I was a kid.

2445
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:27,960
It's a really weird feeling, even though that's absolutely not what's happening.

2446
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,960
It's just my brain tricking itself.

2447
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:32,960
But it looks good and it's stupid.

2448
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,960
So I don't care.

2449
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,960
Hmm.

2450
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:36,960
Yeah.

2451
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,960
I've never, never read it.

2452
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,960
I'm vaguely aware that it's about like.

2453
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:42,960
Swords.

2454
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,960
Swords.

2455
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,960
I think they like, are they grim reapers or something?

2456
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:47,960
Yes.

2457
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:48,960
They're death ghosts.

2458
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,960
They're Shinigamis.

2459
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,960
Death gods, ghosts sort of.

2460
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:53,960
Yes.

2461
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,960
Excellent.

2462
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,960
It's got all that delicious fucking edge.

2463
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,960
It's so fucking wonderful.

2464
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,960
But also kind of bad at times.

2465
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,960
Is it better or worse than Yu Yu Hakusho?

2466
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,960
I've never read Yu Yu Hakusho.

2467
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:08,960
I've never read it.

2468
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:09,960
I've seen it.

2469
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:10,960
Or watched it.

2470
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,960
Is that by Rumiko Takahashi?

2471
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,960
Is that by the Ranma?

2472
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,960
Lady or is it a different?

2473
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,960
It shows by the Hunter X Hunter.

2474
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,960
Oh yeah.

2475
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,960
No, no, they're not married.

2476
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:24,960
Hunter X Hunter guy is married to the Sailor Moon lady.

2477
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,960
Yeah.

2478
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,960
Not, not the Ranma lady.

2479
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,960
You gotta, yeah, no.

2480
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:30,960
Yeah, you're right.

2481
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:31,960
Yeah.

2482
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,960
Did you see?

2483
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,960
No, go on.

2484
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,960
I read Naruto two years ago now.

2485
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,960
And that was like completely raw.

2486
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,960
Like I knew nothing about Naruto.

2487
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:43,960
And I just said, you know what?

2488
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,960
I'm going to see what all the fuss was about.

2489
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,960
And I read the whole thing.

2490
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,960
And I was like, that was good for a while.

2491
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,960
Then it was less good.

2492
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,960
But it was still entertaining, you know what I mean?

2493
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,960
Overall positive.

2494
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,960
I never read Naruto.

2495
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:02,960
Like many people, I watched it until a little bit after Shippuden.

2496
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,960
At some point I fell off of Shippuden.

2497
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,960
That's the general idea.

2498
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:12,960
Because my housemate, he was like his kid thing when he was a kid was Naruto.

2499
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,960
And he was obsessed with it.

2500
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,960
And he's watched it like four times or something.

2501
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,960
Ridiculous like that.

2502
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:18,960
Yeah.

2503
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:24,960
It's got its moments for sure.

2504
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:25,960
Yeah.

2505
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,960
And it was really interesting to have like no outside perspective of it.

2506
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,960
Like it wasn't still going or anything.

2507
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,960
So nobody was talking about it.

2508
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,960
Like I had nobody to talk to about Naruto apart from that guy.

2509
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,960
Did you read all the like Boruto stuff?

2510
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:39,960
No.

2511
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,960
I watched the Boruto movie.

2512
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,960
Which was okay.

2513
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:46,960
And it's just like the start of Boruto basically.

2514
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:47,960
Right.

2515
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,960
People seem to either really, really like Boruto or really hate it.

2516
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,960
Which is really strange to me.

2517
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,960
I didn't think anyone would like it.

2518
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,960
I would assume it would be really bad.

2519
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,960
I would, yeah.

2520
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:05,960
I would assume that it's just like, well, we got to keep this cash train chugging along to the next station.

2521
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:06,960
So.

2522
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,960
A Dragon Ball Super.

2523
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:10,960
Right.

2524
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,960
I read that for a long while and now I just can't.

2525
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,960
I just can't do it anymore.

2526
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,960
I really, really, really gave up on that one.

2527
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,960
What's bad about it?

2528
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:24,960
I don't like, what is wrong with it?

2529
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,960
You know how Dragon Ball is very formulaic?

2530
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:28,960
Formulaic.

2531
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,960
And it's like new bad guy, new bad guy's minions.

2532
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:35,960
They fight new form maybe sometimes.

2533
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:36,960
Yes.

2534
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,960
But Z sort of had twists on that with like Gohan beating the final bad guy.

2535
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,960
Or Goku being dead for half the arc and then coming back.

2536
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:47,960
I only saw like the latter half of Dragon Ball Z.

2537
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,960
Okay.

2538
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,960
You sort of get what I mean where it's like all the same thing, but like.

2539
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:52,960
Yeah.

2540
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,960
The tweaks and changes that keep it fresh.

2541
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,960
Dragon Ball Super is if they didn't do that, if they didn't tweak it at all.

2542
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,960
And it was just the same thing over and over again.

2543
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:01,960
Oh, okay.

2544
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:02,960
Okay, cool.

2545
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,960
Nice.

2546
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:07,960
And just he flubs it at the end of every arc.

2547
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,960
Every single one, it just always falls apart and it turns into nonsense and it sucks.

2548
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:18,960
I don't know how, there's only so many ways you can say everything about this is bad.

2549
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,960
You know what I mean?

2550
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:21,960
Yeah, sure.

2551
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:22,960
There's the occasional.

2552
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,960
It's just not, just not having a good time.

2553
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:25,960
Yeah.

2554
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:30,960
There's the occasional idea that I'm like, that's the tick and then it doesn't capitalize on it.

2555
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,960
Or it ruins it in some way.

2556
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,960
Like the villain Zamasu, I thought he was really good.

2557
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:43,960
I thought he was one of the genuinely, not that this is high praise, but he was one of the best written Dragon Ball villains.

2558
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:44,960
Zamasu.

2559
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,960
Oh, the green guy.

2560
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,960
Yeah, he's the green guy.

2561
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,960
Is he a Saiyan?

2562
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:52,960
No, he's a Supreme Kai.

2563
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,960
Do you remember those?

2564
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:57,960
I remember a Supreme Kai who was purple.

2565
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:00,960
Okay, he's a Supreme Kai from another universe.

2566
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,960
Oh, so he's like an alternate universe version of that guy?

2567
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:06,960
Yeah, not specifically.

2568
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:07,960
Or is he just one of his race?

2569
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:14,960
Like the Supreme Kai's, yeah, their race is just sort of in charge of universes.

2570
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:15,960
Yeah, sure.

2571
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:22,960
So he's one of those and Goku meets him and he sees how strong Goku is and he's like, that's fucking scary.

2572
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,960
I better kill all the models.

2573
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,960
Okay.

2574
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:36,960
And I like that as a motivation because it's not the same thing that most Dragon Ball is where it's like, I need to take over the world or I need to kill all these people because I don't like them.

2575
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,960
I'm scared of him.

2576
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,960
So that's why I do it.

2577
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:40,960
Yeah, okay.

2578
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:45,960
And then there's interesting, like he's the guy who steals Goku's body and becomes evil Goku.

2579
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:48,960
I'm sure you've seen maybe images of him Goku Black.

2580
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,960
I have not.

2581
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,960
I have not seen Goku Black.

2582
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,960
Have you not heard of Goku Black?

2583
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:54,960
No.

2584
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,960
Wait, Goku Black.

2585
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,960
I'm scared of what I'm going to get.

2586
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:00,960
Okay.

2587
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,960
He's just wearing black.

2588
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:03,960
Yeah.

2589
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:10,960
See, there was a time where if you typed in like a few years ago where if you typed in Goku Black on Google, you would have gotten very different results.

2590
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,960
Yeah, I think so.

2591
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:13,960
Yeah.

2592
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,960
That's the green guy in his body.

2593
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:20,960
Okay.

2594
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,960
And then with time travel shenanigans, he meets the green guy.

2595
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:31,960
So Goku Black, which is Zamasu in Goku's body, meets another Zamasu from the past or the future.

2596
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:32,960
I don't remember.

2597
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,960
And then they fuse into a super one.

2598
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:39,960
So he fuses with himself in Goku's body.

2599
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,960
Is that how he turns pink?

2600
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:42,960
No.

2601
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:43,960
And get the mask?

2602
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:49,960
The pink doesn't make any sense because it's just like he steals Goku's body and he tries to go Super Saiyan blue, I think.

2603
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,960
And it just comes out pink for some reason.

2604
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:54,960
All right.

2605
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:55,960
Yeah.

2606
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:56,960
Just so they can sell different toys.

2607
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,960
Is the other...

2608
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:58,960
Okay.

2609
01:56:58,960 --> 01:56:59,960
Okay.

2610
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:06,960
I see there's a Zamasu that has big Goku hair and there's a Zamasu that has like a side cut shaved head like Mohawk.

2611
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:07,960
Yeah.

2612
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:09,960
The Mohawk one is his base form.

2613
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,960
It's Zamasu normally.

2614
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,960
And then when he fuses with Goku Black, he becomes the one with the Goku hair.

2615
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:16,960
I see.

2616
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:17,960
Yes.

2617
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:18,960
And then...

2618
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,960
Then Goku and Vegeta fuse and they fight him.

2619
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:22,960
Wait a minute.

2620
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:23,960
Hold on.

2621
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:24,960
Wait a second.

2622
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,960
Wait a second.

2623
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,960
What?

2624
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:27,960
How is he...

2625
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:31,960
He's in Goku's body, but also Goku is still around to fuse with Vegeta.

2626
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:38,960
He went back in time in another timeline and killed Goku and told it took his body.

2627
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:39,960
No, no.

2628
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,960
He didn't use the Dragon Balls to wish to steal his body.

2629
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,960
And then he killed Chichi and Goten in that timeline.

2630
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:47,960
So, okay.

2631
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,960
Different timeline, Goku.

2632
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:50,960
Yeah.

2633
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:56,960
See, what I was trying to get that is I really like the idea of that villain, but they use

2634
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,960
time travel in the worst fucking way possible and it gets so confusing as to what the fuck

2635
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:03,960
is happening.

2636
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:04,960
So, he's Goku...

2637
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:05,960
So, he's...

2638
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:06,960
Okay.

2639
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:12,960
So, he's Goku's body from another timeline with an evil God inside of him.

2640
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:13,960
Yeah, inside of him.

2641
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,960
What also fused with a different God?

2642
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,960
What's the point of fusing?

2643
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:19,960
Fusing makes you stronger.

2644
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:20,960
What's the point?

2645
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,960
It makes you stronger, then.

2646
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:23,960
Okay, yeah.

2647
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:26,960
It's your number times his number.

2648
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,960
I guess you're right.

2649
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,960
It's bigger number.

2650
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:35,660
And the worst part is they can't beat him.

2651
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,960
He gets too strong, right?

2652
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,960
Right.

2653
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:41,960
Naturally, because he multiplied the big number by another big number.

2654
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:45,960
And so, even Goku and Vegeta fused can't beat him.

2655
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:48,960
And then some real bullshit happens and fused...

2656
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:53,960
I think people refer to him in that form as fused Zamasu, which is a terrible fucking

2657
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:57,960
name for a character or a merchandise or whatever, but whatever.

2658
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:58,960
Sure.

2659
01:58:58,960 --> 01:58:59,960
Yeah.

2660
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:00,960
He does the most insane...

2661
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,960
He fuses with the universe or something.

2662
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,960
Okay.

2663
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:08,960
And tons of his face start appearing in the sky.

2664
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,960
So, it's like he's become the...

2665
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,960
And they don't explain how he did this.

2666
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,960
He just does it.

2667
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,960
That's awesome.

2668
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:16,960
No, that rules.

2669
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,960
It's a cool idea, yeah.

2670
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,960
But like...

2671
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:20,960
Yeah.

2672
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:21,960
What?

2673
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:22,960
How?

2674
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,960
And the way that they write themselves out of this corner, because...

2675
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,960
Do they punch the universe?

2676
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:27,960
No.

2677
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:32,960
Earlier in Dragon Ball Super, they introduced the real God of actual everything.

2678
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,960
Like the whole multiverse.

2679
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,960
He's like a little bean guy.

2680
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,960
He's got a head like a football.

2681
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:48,960
So, because they're in the past while they're fighting this fused Zamasu, Goku has a button

2682
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:53,960
that you can press because he's friends with God of the multiverse, right?

2683
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:54,960
Yeah.

2684
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,960
And the God of the multiverse appears and he's like, hey, Goku, let's hang out, let's play.

2685
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,960
Let's play tag or something.

2686
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:05,960
And Goku's like, can you get rid of this Sky God man?

2687
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:07,960
And he goes, no.

2688
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:13,960
What I'm going to do instead is I'm going to teleport us out of this timeline and erase

2689
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,960
the entire timeline from existing.

2690
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,960
Oh, oh God.

2691
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:24,960
And it just so happens that that timeline was the same one that Future Trunks comes from.

2692
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,960
Future Trunks is wrapped up in all this shit as well.

2693
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,960
That's the timeline that Future Trunks is from.

2694
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,960
So what happens for Future Trunks?

2695
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,960
You know the basic concept where the androids came and killed all of us, everybody, yeah?

2696
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:37,960
Yeah.

2697
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:38,960
So that was a dark timeline.

2698
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,960
So he came back in time and entered a new timeline so we could kill the androids and

2699
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:43,960
that's the real timeline.

2700
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:44,960
Yeah.

2701
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,960
So following on from that time, after he kills the androids in his own timeline and they

2702
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,960
try and rebuild Earth, Goku Black shows up and he causes another apocalypse, basically.

2703
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,960
And then all this bullshit happens.

2704
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:01,960
But wasn't Goku already dead in that timeline?

2705
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,960
Yeah, but they jump between timelines.

2706
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:06,960
Okay.

2707
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:09,960
See, that's one of the...

2708
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,960
That's one of the...

2709
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:11,960
What?

2710
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:12,960
Moment.

2711
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,960
All right.

2712
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:20,960
So yeah, God of the Multiverses erases the entire Future Trunks timeline and sends Future Trunks

2713
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:23,960
to just another one, I guess.

2714
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:24,960
Sure.

2715
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,960
So he's fine.

2716
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:31,960
And then before they go, he goes, I'm coming with you to your timeline and he goes back

2717
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:32,960
to the present.

2718
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,960
Goku and Vegeta is like normal timeline.

2719
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,960
And now there's two of God there.

2720
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:38,960
Which God?

2721
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:41,960
The God of the Multiverse, Zeno.

2722
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:42,960
Wouldn't...

2723
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,960
Why is there more than one of him?

2724
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,960
If he's the God of the Multiverse, shouldn't there just be one of him that oversees all

2725
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,960
the other timelines?

2726
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:53,960
Unless you time travel him and then he can have a best friend who is himself.

2727
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:54,960
Okay.

2728
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,960
Yeah, that tracks.

2729
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:57,960
Sure.

2730
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:00,960
Hang on, I need to show you him.

2731
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:01,960
Hang on, here they are.

2732
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,960
Show me.

2733
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,960
Show me the little bean guy.

2734
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:04,960
I'm curious.

2735
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:05,960
That's good.

2736
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:08,960
I need a sparkling water.

2737
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:10,960
Sparkling water.

2738
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,960
Strawberry Kiwi.

2739
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:13,960
I'm back.

2740
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:14,960
Very nice.

2741
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,960
I'm back.

2742
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:16,960
All right, show me.

2743
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:17,960
I just posted a little gif of him.

2744
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,960
Oh, let me see.

2745
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,960
General.

2746
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:20,960
Oh, this little guy.

2747
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:21,960
Yeah.

2748
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:22,960
I've seen.

2749
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:23,960
Oh, Stewie Griffin.

2750
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:24,960
Yeah, Stewie Griffin.

2751
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,960
Haha.

2752
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,960
What the deuce?

2753
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:29,960
Because there's two of them.

2754
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:31,960
Hell yeah.

2755
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,960
Yeah.

2756
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:33,960
I'm super so good.

2757
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,960
I love it.

2758
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,960
Man, animation is cool.

2759
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:43,960
It's kind of weird.

2760
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:45,960
Kind of weird sometimes.

2761
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:48,960
Wacky Japanese.

2762
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:55,320
I feel like if I ever put a gun to my head and made me do a lecture, it would be on how

2763
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:58,960
stupid Dragon Ball Super is.

2764
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,960
Honestly, honestly, yeah.

2765
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,960
Like, fair enough.

2766
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:05,960
Can I hear my favorite fact about Dragon Ball Super?

2767
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:09,960
I'm sure not going to watch the entirety of the Dragon Ball continuum.

2768
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,960
Yeah, favorite fact.

2769
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:12,960
Lay it on me.

2770
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:19,960
They established that there are only 27 populated planets in Goku's universe with life on them.

2771
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,960
27, huh?

2772
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:22,960
27.

2773
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:23,960
Exactly 27.

2774
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:25,960
In the universe.

2775
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:27,960
In his universe.

2776
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:29,960
I'm okay with it.

2777
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,960
I'm okay with that.

2778
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,960
That's, like, I don't know why.

2779
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:37,960
Frieza had a galactic army of, like, thousands of aliens.

2780
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:38,960
Yeah.

2781
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:42,960
Wait, so we only conquered, like, six planets?

2782
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:43,960
Yeah.

2783
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:46,960
His whole thing with the Saiyans is that he sent them out to conquer planets.

2784
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:50,960
But there's just not that many of them, I guess.

2785
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:51,960
Hmm.

2786
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,960
It makes his job easier.

2787
02:03:53,960 --> 02:04:00,960
That's the bullshit reason they have for rank, because there's a big tournament between all the universes, right?

2788
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:01,960
Naturally.

2789
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:07,960
And you expect, oh, Goku's universe is going to be, like, in the bracket, they're going to put in one,

2790
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:09,960
because it's got Goku in it and he's the strongest, yeah?

2791
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:10,960
Yeah, yeah.

2792
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,960
Nobody's going to be stronger than Goku.

2793
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,960
But it turns out that their universal power level is much lower,

2794
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,960
because they only have 27 planets with other people on them.

2795
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,960
All the other universes have, like, millions of populated planets.

2796
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:23,960
Oh.

2797
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:28,960
But to balance out Goku being, Goku and Vegeta and everyone being so absurdly strong,

2798
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:33,960
they have way less, like, global, like, universal power.

2799
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:39,960
So that they're, like, ranked number six or something instead of being number one.

2800
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:42,960
So in other universes, there's just way more people.

2801
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:43,960
People, yeah.

2802
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:45,960
So that adds up to bigger number.

2803
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:51,960
Yeah.

2804
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:54,960
So just so that they could say that and have you go,

2805
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,960
oh, no, those other universe might be scary after all.

2806
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:02,960
They retcon it and say that there's only 27 planets with people on them.

2807
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:05,960
I mean, I guess it makes sense.

2808
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:07,960
Sure.

2809
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:08,960
Why not?

2810
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:11,960
And people complain about Nika Sun God, Devil Fruit.

2811
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:12,960
Right, yeah.

2812
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,960
You should try being a Dragon Ball fan, mate.

2813
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:16,960
I'm just kidding.

2814
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2815
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:21,960
Nika, Nika base.

2816
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:22,960
Yeah.

2817
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,960
My favorite.

2818
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,960
My favorite guy.

2819
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:27,960
Yeah.

2820
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,960
He is pretty fun.

2821
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:35,960
One piece lore is pretty, pretty fucking, it's a little goofy.

2822
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:37,960
It's a little dumb sometimes.

2823
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:42,960
But that's, it's mostly, it's mostly all right.

2824
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:43,960
Yeah.

2825
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:46,960
I don't think there's anything in there that annoys me too much.

2826
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,960
I'm not one of those psychos who is screaming about Nika and saying,

2827
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,960
I'm not going to read the series anymore.

2828
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,960
Oda has ruined everything.

2829
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:54,960
You know what I mean?

2830
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:55,960
I've seen a lot of that.

2831
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,960
About, wait, about what?

2832
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,960
You cut out for a second.

2833
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:01,960
About, about Nika, all the Nika reveal would go,

2834
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:04,960
Luffy being the Sun God, people are not happy about it.

2835
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,960
Some people, your brother in particular.

2836
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:10,960
I've heard that he is upset.

2837
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:15,960
I've heard, I don't know, I got the impression that everyone hated it,

2838
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,960
but I've also heard that like, maybe that's just more like,

2839
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,960
the like two online crowd really hates it, but like, maybe not.

2840
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:23,960
You see.

2841
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,960
I don't know what the general opinion is.

2842
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:26,960
There's two extremes.

2843
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,960
There's people who have been like picking vague things that Oda has put in the manga in the past

2844
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:34,960
and saying that it was direct foreshadowing of Nika.

2845
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:39,960
Honestly, I feel like there might be some of that.

2846
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,960
There's some that I can believe, but there's a lot that are just like,

2847
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:43,960
what the fuck?

2848
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:44,960
No way.

2849
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:45,960
Sure.

2850
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,960
There's, there's been a lot of people like making up their own foreshadowing.

2851
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:54,960
I mean, they've been, they've been talking about Joy Boy for a while.

2852
02:06:54,960 --> 02:07:00,960
Like Joy Boy got mentioned, maybe not that far back, but like before like,

2853
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,960
maybe not pre-timeskip.

2854
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,960
He was Fishman Island, I believe he was first.

2855
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,960
No, it was, it was pre-timeskip.

2856
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,960
Yeah.

2857
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:11,960
They may have, I would believe, yeah, Joy Boy got mentioned that even that far back.

2858
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:12,960
Yeah.

2859
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:13,960
So there's that.

2860
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,960
I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure it wasn't planned from the beginning,

2861
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:18,960
but like nothing was planned from the beginning.

2862
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:19,960
No, exactly.

2863
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:23,960
There are people saying that there's clues in chapter one that have led to Nika.

2864
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:25,960
It's like, no.

2865
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:29,960
I can't give a specific example because I looked at the post and said,

2866
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:31,960
you're stupid and then stop looking at it.

2867
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:34,960
I just, I just don't.

2868
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:37,960
I simply don't care or no.

2869
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:43,960
There's, I mean, I was reading, I read the Wiki article about the

2870
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:47,960
Hitohitonomi mythical model Nika.

2871
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,960
Yeah.

2872
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:53,960
And it said like, I rolled my eyes because it says like, it talks about,

2873
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:55,960
you know, the history of the fruit.

2874
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:56,960
Oh yeah.

2875
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:59,960
It was stolen by the shanks by the red-haired pirates.

2876
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:00,960
Yeah.

2877
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:03,960
And then it was eaten by, you know, Monkey D. Luffy.

2878
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:09,960
It's unknown whether the shanks knew the true nature of the fruit or not.

2879
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:16,960
And like, that's just a little dumb because like, first, like, there's no way,

2880
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,960
like the only explanation for the way they behave.

2881
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:22,960
Like it would sort of make sense that they, like, if they didn't know,

2882
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,960
if they just thought it was the gum gum fruit.

2883
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:25,960
Yeah.

2884
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:28,960
If they knew that it was like the ultimate power in the universe,

2885
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:31,960
I'm sure they would have reacted a little more strongly.

2886
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:35,960
They probably just wouldn't have left Luffy to just live in his little town.

2887
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:39,960
It makes way more sense to think that they didn't know.

2888
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,960
So like, why wouldn't you assume that they didn't know?

2889
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,960
And why would they know?

2890
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:46,960
No, like the point is, you know,

2891
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:49,960
The point is the government has scrubbed the knowledge of it.

2892
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,960
They've suppressed the knowledge.

2893
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:51,960
Yeah.

2894
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:55,960
It's perfectly reasonable to assume that they wouldn't know what it was.

2895
02:08:55,960 --> 02:09:00,960
But like, maybe they could they have known about it.

2896
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,960
I don't think so.

2897
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:03,960
I don't think so.

2898
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:04,960
But whatever.

2899
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:05,960
Fine.

2900
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:10,960
There are a lot of people that are thinking that the Nika reveal confirms evil shanks.

2901
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,960
Do you want me to take you through this?

2902
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,960
Sure.

2903
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:15,960
Why not?

2904
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:20,960
So like, there's a scene in Reverie where shanks shows up and speaks to the five elders

2905
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,960
who are in charge of the Navy.

2906
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,960
Do you remember this?

2907
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:27,960
Is this pre-Fishman Island?

2908
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:28,960
Or post-Fishman Island?

2909
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,960
It's a long post-Fishman Island.

2910
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,960
It is...

2911
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:33,960
I can't remember.

2912
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,960
I think it's in Reverie.

2913
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:40,960
Like the mini-arc between Wano and Holcake Island.

2914
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:47,960
Wait, Reverie was between Holcake and Wano?

2915
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:48,960
Yeah.

2916
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,960
Oh, I thought it was before that.

2917
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:51,960
But okay.

2918
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,960
I think it's then.

2919
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:58,960
I mean, we see some of the Reverie in Wano, and I thought that...

2920
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,960
Yeah, they flashback to it.

2921
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,960
I thought maybe that a new Reverie was happening now because it had already been a year since

2922
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:06,960
the last one.

2923
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:07,960
No.

2924
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:12,960
Wait, wasn't the Reverie immediately post-time skip?

2925
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:13,960
Am I crazy?

2926
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,960
No, you're crazy.

2927
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:15,960
That doesn't happen now.

2928
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:16,960
All right.

2929
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,960
It was very recent.

2930
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:20,960
Because Shirahoshi's there, the mermaid princess, so it's like after everything's been

2931
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:21,960
set up.

2932
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:24,960
All the dressers and people are there.

2933
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:25,960
Okay.

2934
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:26,960
Yeah, I remember...

2935
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,960
I'm pretty sure it's after Holcake Island and before Wano.

2936
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:32,960
I know that the flashbacks happened during Wano.

2937
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:37,960
Yeah, I think Wano, they show the characters because it's like there was some kind of disaster.

2938
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:40,960
They're kind of vague about it, but there was some kind of disaster that happened at the

2939
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:43,960
Reverie, and we don't really know what that is yet.

2940
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:48,960
But anyway, during Reverie, there's a bit where Shanks shows up and he talks to the five elders.

2941
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,960
The five guys who were talking about Nika in the research.

2942
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:52,960
The Gorase.

2943
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:53,960
Yeah, those guys.

2944
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:54,960
Yeah.

2945
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:58,960
And he says, I need to talk about certain pirate, and people think that means that he knew that

2946
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,960
Luffy had the Nika fruit and was warning them, and that's why they sent a guy to Wano to

2947
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:08,960
get him or something.

2948
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:17,960
I mean, oh, like Shanks was there to inform them that Luffy has the Nika.

2949
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:25,960
Which I guess can kind of make sense because he's probably seen on like the news that like

2950
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:26,960
Gear 4.

2951
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:31,960
I don't know if Gear 4 is like public knowledge, but you could probably see that and say, that's

2952
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:32,960
not rubber.

2953
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:33,960
That's something weird.

2954
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:35,960
You know what I mean?

2955
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:43,960
I mean, I could believe that Red Hair would know secret things.

2956
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:44,960
Yeah.

2957
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:50,960
And it wouldn't shock me to know that he has become aware of the Nika, of the Hito-Hito-Nomi

2958
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:51,960
Nika.

2959
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:56,960
I can't say the whole fucking name every time.

2960
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:00,960
Yeah, I mean, it sounds plausible enough, maybe.

2961
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,960
Yeah.

2962
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:05,960
Evil Shanks could be, I don't know.

2963
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,960
I don't know.

2964
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:10,960
It's just one piece discussion recently.

2965
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:12,960
It's just been chaos.

2966
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:18,960
I saw it trending on Twitter.

2967
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:22,960
It was just that the tag was just like one piece 1044.

2968
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:25,960
It's like, oh boy, something happened.

2969
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:27,960
Now I know.

2970
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,960
Now I know.

2971
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,960
I don't know.

2972
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:34,960
I'm just going to roll with it.

2973
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:35,960
Yeah.

2974
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:36,960
Sure.

2975
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:39,960
Just like much like Nika himself, you know.

2976
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,960
Just go with the flow, man.

2977
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:47,960
Just sprint, save slaves and be rubber and be wacky cartoon.

2978
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:51,960
Hey, in the new chapter, was Luffy like punging through Kaido's eyes?

2979
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:53,960
You see that?

2980
02:12:53,960 --> 02:13:01,960
Yeah, it looked, I think he was doing, because they say Kaido says like, hmm, looks like

2981
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:04,960
you can turn everything around you into rubber.

2982
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:05,960
Yeah.

2983
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:07,960
Does that mean you've awakened your paramecia?

2984
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:10,960
Hmm, but this transformation seems more like a zone.

2985
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,960
So I think he was just doing a goofy thing.

2986
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:16,960
Like he was like turning Kaido into like rubber cartoon physics.

2987
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,960
And he was like wearing him like a glove.

2988
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:21,960
He like punched all the way through his skull.

2989
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,960
Cause there's like a funny rubber way.

2990
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:28,960
There's a really weird panel where like Kaido swallows Luffy and then he punches

2991
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,960
out of his eyes.

2992
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:31,960
Do you remember that?

2993
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:34,960
Wait, he swallows him and he punches out of his eyes.

2994
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:38,960
Like Luffy's inside of Kaido's mouth in dragon mode.

2995
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:41,960
And then he like punches his two fists out of Kaido's eyes.

2996
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:45,960
And it just looks like Kaido's eyes have turned into Luffy's hands.

2997
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:48,960
And then like the next panel, he's like coming out the mouth and it's like,

2998
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:49,960
what happened?

2999
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:51,960
Did he pull himself out through?

3000
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:52,960
What?

3001
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:54,960
I don't understand.

3002
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:56,960
Wait, this is in 1045?

3003
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:57,960
Yeah.

3004
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,960
Oh, oh God.

3005
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:01,960
Yeah, yeah.

3006
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:03,960
I didn't, I see it.

3007
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:05,960
I'm seeing it right now.

3008
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:07,960
Yeah.

3009
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:12,960
I didn't even think about it at the time, but he's totally just punching.

3010
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:17,960
And if you look the way he like grabs onto Kaido's nose and then pulls himself out,

3011
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,960
but he comes out the mouth.

3012
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,960
I don't understand how that works.

3013
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:28,960
He's like swinging.

3014
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:29,960
Yeah.

3015
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:32,960
He like grabs the nose.

3016
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,960
Okay.

3017
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:36,960
I think it doesn't make any sense.

3018
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,960
His arms would have had to go through his snout, but I think the idea is he's like

3019
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:44,960
grabbing the nose and using it as like a fulcrum to swing himself down and out the

3020
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:48,960
mouth, even though it doesn't make any sense because his arms are coming out of his

3021
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,960
eye socket.

3022
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:55,960
What's really weird is it doesn't look like Kaido's eyes are turning into like a glove

3023
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:00,960
and like stretching around his hand because you can see his like fingernails.

3024
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:01,960
Okay.

3025
02:15:01,960 --> 02:15:05,960
Let me, let me, let me, uh, you can see his.

3026
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:06,960
Yeah.

3027
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:10,960
It just looks like they're just puncturing the eyes, but they're not.

3028
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,960
Is he just, is he just phasing through?

3029
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:13,960
Yeah.

3030
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:17,960
I don't know if he has phasing powers or something.

3031
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:21,960
It's, uh, it's a little hard.

3032
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:22,960
Hmm.

3033
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,960
Well, maybe.

3034
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:25,960
Okay.

3035
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:26,960
Look at this.

3036
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:27,960
Look at this fucking panel.

3037
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:28,960
Look at his head.

3038
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:29,960
He's great.

3039
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:30,960
Look at his fucking face.

3040
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:34,960
If you turn your head upside down, he looks like a Charlie Brown character.

3041
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,960
He totally, he totally does.

3042
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:38,960
Maybe, okay.

3043
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:43,960
Maybe if he really is, maybe if he really is like all white, like he's a drawing.

3044
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:44,960
Yeah.

3045
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,960
Maybe the white of the hands and the white of the eyes combine.

3046
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:53,960
Maybe he's just got whiteness powers and any white that he can just, he's just part

3047
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:54,960
of anything white.

3048
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,960
And because it's a manga, that's everything.

3049
02:15:56,960 --> 02:15:57,960
Yeah.

3050
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:58,960
Sure.

3051
02:15:58,960 --> 02:15:59,960
Why not?

3052
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:00,960
Sure.

3053
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:01,960
Fuck it.

3054
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:02,960
Fuck it.

3055
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:03,960
The rules are all out the window.

3056
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,960
The panel you brought up as well.

3057
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:07,960
Whereas hand is going through Kaido's face.

3058
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,960
Hang on here.

3059
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,960
It's this one.

3060
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:10,960
Yes.

3061
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:15,960
It's like, for a second I thought it was like a cartoon thing like where like, uh, uh,

3062
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:19,960
Jerry hits Tom with a hammer and then he like cracks and then it goes through.

3063
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:20,960
Yeah.

3064
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:21,960
You know what I mean?

3065
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:22,960
Like cartoon logic.

3066
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,960
Yeah.

3067
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:26,960
But like, no, like immediately after Kaido is like fine.

3068
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,960
But he's like wounded.

3069
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:31,960
And but like, it's really strange.

3070
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:32,960
He just, he just reacts.

3071
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:37,960
If I remember correctly, he just reacts as though he, you know, he got punched in the

3072
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:38,960
face.

3073
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:43,960
Not that like he was fully, you know, impaled through his skull.

3074
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:49,960
Like you can see his face in the next panel and it's like, there's no like hole.

3075
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:55,960
So I don't really understand what the phasing through stuff is going on.

3076
02:16:55,960 --> 02:17:02,960
Like, like Kaido's skin must be stretched thin like rubber around his fist that has

3077
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:07,960
punched like gone through and the eyes must be doing the same thing.

3078
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:08,960
Yeah.

3079
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:09,960
It's just the lack of like texture on it.

3080
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:10,960
You know what I mean?

3081
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:11,960
It is.

3082
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:12,960
Yeah.

3083
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,960
It is confusing.

3084
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,960
It doesn't really look like that's what's going on, but that's just the only thing.

3085
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:18,960
This is the only thing that makes any sense.

3086
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:21,960
I'd love to see the anime try to make sense of this.

3087
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:22,960
Jesus Christ.

3088
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:26,960
Oh, look at, look, look at this panel.

3089
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:27,960
Look.

3090
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:28,960
Oh God.

3091
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,960
This has become what's, what's even going on here.

3092
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:34,960
Ben and Simsie scream about one piece panels that he does.

3093
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:35,960
Look at him.

3094
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,960
I can't even tell what his body is.

3095
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:42,960
I guess that's his leg sticking out black behind him.

3096
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:43,960
Yeah.

3097
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,960
It's like his leg like shadowed in the back.

3098
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:46,960
Yeah.

3099
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:50,960
And then his front leg is bent and his knee is sticking out the bottom and then he's just

3100
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:51,960
like loud.

3101
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:55,960
Is that, is that just a wisp of cloud floating in front of him there?

3102
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:57,960
What next to Kido's hand?

3103
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:01,960
No, to the right, like under his body and sort of.

3104
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:02,960
Oh yeah.

3105
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:04,960
He just sort of has that in gear five.

3106
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:07,960
He just kind of has little and like around his neck.

3107
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:11,960
He's got like a weird like wreath of like flame cloud.

3108
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:13,960
Gear four has the same thing.

3109
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:20,960
Cause you know, like gear two was he, he like shoots a, he gets like loads of steam coming

3110
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:21,960
out of him.

3111
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:22,960
Yeah.

3112
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:26,960
It's, it's like, it's like in gear four, that just becomes like a permanent thing and it's

3113
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,960
like in a specific shape.

3114
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:31,960
Maybe that's why he's white.

3115
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:33,960
Maybe it's like steam, steam cloud.

3116
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:34,960
Okay.

3117
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:35,960
Sure.

3118
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:36,960
Whatever.

3119
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:37,960
Look at, look at this.

3120
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:39,960
Look at this panel.

3121
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:41,960
Look at these like scribbles.

3122
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:44,960
I don't know how anyone could hate this.

3123
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:45,960
I.

3124
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:46,960
Yeah.

3125
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:48,960
Like it's, it's very weird.

3126
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,960
I mean, there's so it's very weird.

3127
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:52,960
It is very weird, but I like it.

3128
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:53,960
I don't hate it for sure.

3129
02:18:53,960 --> 02:19:02,960
I don't know if I would say that I like, I'm committed to like, like, it's so hard.

3130
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:06,960
It's mostly just, it's mostly just strange and curious.

3131
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:07,960
Yeah.

3132
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:11,960
I guess I'm the most emotion you have reading this chapter is what the fuck.

3133
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:12,960
Yeah.

3134
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,960
Yeah.

3135
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:14,960
Yeah.

3136
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:15,960
Yeah.

3137
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:16,960
Yeah.

3138
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:18,960
What the fuck is happening?

3139
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:20,960
Honestly, I'm not sure.

3140
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:25,960
I feel like maybe you're supposed to be like, oh God.

3141
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:26,960
Yeah.

3142
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,960
I don't, yeah, I'm not sure if it, if that's intentional.

3143
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:34,960
I've heard a lot of people saying this is going to remove the stakes from the rest of

3144
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:37,960
the series because he's just too strong now.

3145
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:39,960
He's always been.

3146
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:40,960
I know.

3147
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:42,960
That's always been how it is.

3148
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,960
You've always known he's going to win every fight.

3149
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:47,960
The stakes.

3150
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,960
Give me a fucking break.

3151
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:54,960
One thing I've said is just like, well, it's not like he's, I feel like he's going to,

3152
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:57,960
for some reason there's going to be some reason why he can't use this power all the time.

3153
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:58,960
You know what I mean?

3154
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:04,960
In this fight, in this fight, he like gets tired and he like stops using it and he's

3155
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,960
like, I can't, it's like, I can't keep using it forever.

3156
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:08,960
It's too, it takes too much out of me.

3157
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:12,960
There are people who saying like, well now Luffy's all part, he like literally is a God.

3158
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:15,960
But that's like, not what's happening.

3159
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:23,960
He has a, he has a God power fruit that is just takes a lot, takes a lot of energy to

3160
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:24,960
use, I guess.

3161
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,960
Sure.

3162
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,960
We see, we see that he can't maintain it forever.

3163
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:28,960
Yeah.

3164
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:30,960
I don't know what people are worried about.

3165
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:34,960
Oh, well, we circle back to one piece because everything always does.

3166
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:42,960
It's, what is, what really is there to say other than to just gawk at some of these fucking

3167
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:43,960
panels?

3168
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:44,960
They are insane.

3169
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:46,960
They are.

3170
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:52,960
I mean, the, him getting his head like caved in and curved by the, by the back.

3171
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:55,960
Yeah, and it stays that in the next like few parts.

3172
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:56,960
Yeah.

3173
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:00,960
I really like when Kaido hits him on the head and he gets really flat and then springs off

3174
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:01,960
the wall.

3175
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:03,960
Kaido hits him on the head.

3176
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,960
Hang on, this one here.

3177
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,960
Oh yeah.

3178
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:09,960
He's just like.

3179
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:10,960
Yeah.

3180
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:12,960
It's great.

3181
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:23,960
It's, it's, I, I, I do think it feels like a, a continuation of the sort of ethos of like

3182
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,960
why Luffy is a rubber man to begin with.

3183
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:29,960
Cause this Oda wanted to draw shit like this.

3184
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:35,960
Imagine how much Lama gear five could be like in, in terms of like any other version, like

3185
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,960
where they make it like serious.

3186
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:43,960
Like there's the, there's this classic image of someone's fan made version of gear five.

3187
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:45,960
I've never seen this before.

3188
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:50,960
Imagine if we got like this instead, how much worse that is.

3189
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:51,960
Honestly.

3190
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:52,960
Yeah.

3191
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:58,960
At some point, at some point, I mean, this is like, you know, all the, the new like super

3192
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:02,960
new Sands where like, oh, well he's blue, he's blue now, but like blue means he's like

3193
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:03,960
stronger now.

3194
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:04,960
Like it's better.

3195
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:05,960
And pink.

3196
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,960
He's got more.

3197
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:08,960
Well pink's even better than that.

3198
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:09,960
Yeah.

3199
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:12,960
It's at some point, it's like none of these like mean anything.

3200
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,960
Like you just, you just, you're just making number go up.

3201
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:19,960
So I'm glad Nika is, it's not that.

3202
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:20,960
It's different.

3203
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:22,960
He can do different things now.

3204
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:27,960
It's not, he's, he just does things in, in, in the same way, but stronger.

3205
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:28,960
Yeah.

3206
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:30,960
So that's good.

3207
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:31,960
Yeah.

3208
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:32,960
Sure.

3209
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,960
I'm with it.

3210
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:34,960
We'll see.

3211
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:35,960
We'll see.

3212
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:36,960
Yeah.

3213
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:37,960
We'll see.

3214
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:38,960
Yeah.

3215
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:39,960
We'll see.

3216
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:40,960
That's a good thesis.

3217
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:41,960
Yeah.

3218
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:45,960
Do you want to go to voicemails?

3219
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,960
Sure.

3220
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:47,960
Hang on.

3221
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:48,960
One last thing.

3222
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:55,960
I want to mention that I saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in cinema.

3223
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:56,960
Oh, yeah.

3224
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,960
And it was a perfectly serviceable kids movie.

3225
02:22:58,960 --> 02:22:59,960
Knuckles was pretty funny.

3226
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:00,960
Nice.

3227
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:04,960
He acted like Warf from Star Trek, which I thought was strange, but I liked it.

3228
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:07,960
That seems about, that seems about right.

3229
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:11,960
He was all about honor and he, he was Idris Elbert and it was great.

3230
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:12,960
He was the best.

3231
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:13,960
Yeah.

3232
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:14,960
He's an honorable dude.

3233
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:17,960
He's got to carry out his sacred task.

3234
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:20,960
I do not care about your mission, Robotnik.

3235
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:21,960
He was like that.

3236
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:22,960
And I was like, this is strange.

3237
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:27,960
Jim Carrey, that man's got a lot of energy for somebody who's like 60.

3238
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:28,960
Yeah.

3239
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:31,960
He's getting old, but he's still doing it, I guess.

3240
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:32,960
God bless him.

3241
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:34,960
He put all the effort in.

3242
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:38,960
Like there's clearly scenes in the movie where Jim Carrey just did something and then they

3243
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:41,960
made an entire like effect sequence around it.

3244
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:42,960
Well, that's awesome.

3245
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:43,960
Yeah.

3246
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:44,960
That sounds great.

3247
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:45,960
Cool.

3248
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:49,960
The best thing about the movie was me and my friend were the only adults there without

3249
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:57,960
children and I felt like a pervert.

3250
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:01,960
You know, I don't know if I've ever told anyone this, I don't know if I've ever mentioned

3251
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:08,960
this, but when the hype was building, like early in the hype cycle for the first Sonic

3252
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:18,560
movie, that was during, that was during the hilarious fall of Monkey Jones.

3253
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:23,000
That was during the whole like Lou the Kitty arc.

3254
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Or it was after that.

3255
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,400
I mean, it was after, it was during the fallout from that.

3256
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:30,360
I talked to him a little bit.

3257
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:36,260
I think I reached out to him because like, I don't remember who reached out to who actually,

3258
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:41,760
but we talked a little bit and I was like, man, I don't think he's doing that well.

3259
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:50,360
He asked if I would, if I wanted to see the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.

3260
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:52,640
And I was like, yeah, I guess.

3261
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:57,320
And he mentioned like, well, you know, when it comes out, you know, come out to North

3262
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:01,960
Carolina or whatever and we'd go see the, you know, you can come out and see the Sonic

3263
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:02,960
the Hedgehog movie.

3264
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:09,400
I was like, yeah, I guess I could do that and it didn't come up again.

3265
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:17,160
So I did not do it, but it was the offer was made to see the Hedgehog movie with a monkey.

3266
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:18,160
Oh yeah.

3267
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:20,600
The weirdest thing, I never saw the first one.

3268
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:24,320
So I just went and saw the second one with my friend because he asked me, I said, sure.

3269
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:25,840
You've never, you have not seen it?

3270
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:27,080
No, I haven't seen the first one.

3271
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:29,240
I just went and saw the second one because fuck it.

3272
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:32,080
People said it was, people said it was okay.

3273
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:33,080
I can imagine.

3274
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:36,280
I can imagine exactly what it is from what happens in the second one.

3275
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:37,280
Yeah.

3276
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:41,320
Because it like starts out with Sonic living in like two, the two human characters house

3277
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:43,000
and they're like, oh, come on, buddy.

3278
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,480
I ain't your dad.

3279
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:45,480
Come on.

3280
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:46,480
Get it together.

3281
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:48,280
And I'm like, oh, I know exactly how the first one ends.

3282
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:52,040
Wait, he's not Sonic's dad telling Sonic I ain't your dad.

3283
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:55,720
No, no, Sonic goes, you're not, you're, you're, you're, you're supposed to be my friend, not

3284
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:56,720
my dad.

3285
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:59,320
And it's like, oh, he's like a cop, right?

3286
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:00,800
Doesn't he like hang out with a cop?

3287
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:01,800
Yeah.

3288
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:02,800
Nice.

3289
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:05,000
He's a cop with a hot black wife.

3290
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
All right.

3291
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:09,640
And they, they like can't kiss on screen because it's a kid's movie.

3292
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,440
So they like hug awkwardly whenever that something good happens.

3293
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:13,440
It's great.

3294
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:18,160
There's like a 10 minute section of that movie that turns into like an Adam Sandler.

3295
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:21,280
Like Sonic is on screen for like a good like 15 minutes.

3296
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:24,520
And it just turns into like an Adam Sandler movie with like goofy shit happening and like

3297
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:25,520
normal people.

3298
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:30,760
You should have got the studio notes that said, whenever Sonic isn't on screen, everyone

3299
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:33,560
should be asking, where's Sonic the Hedgehog?

3300
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:35,520
Where's Sonic the Hedgehog?

3301
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:41,080
But the best thing about that was that none of the kids in the cinema laughed at a single

3302
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:44,640
thing Sonic said or like clapped or like seemed happy.

3303
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:50,280
But when there was the spit that I said felt like an Adam Sandler movie, it's like a, there's

3304
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:54,000
like a fat lady and she's like running around and going, oh hell no.

3305
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,240
And like running after fiance, who's actually like a, a secret agent or something.

3306
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:01,920
I don't really remember what was happening, but and then she like drives around in a golf

3307
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:04,560
cart and throws tales as it explodes without him.

3308
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:07,760
And then all the kids were laughing and clapping for that, but they shouldn't react like to

3309
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:11,400
a single thing that Sonic did for the entire movie.

3310
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:16,200
They were just too, they were just too enraptured by their hero, Sonic the Hedgehog.

3311
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:17,200
They were probably scared of him.

3312
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,200
You see John.

3313
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:22,800
Brought to life on the silver screen in glorious 4k.

3314
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:23,800
Anyway.

3315
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:25,800
60 frames per second.

3316
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,800
Sonic movie, sure.

3317
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:28,800
Yeah.

3318
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,320
Go see it if you want to.

3319
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:31,440
Okay.

3320
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:32,440
Go see it if you want to.

3321
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:34,680
Well, if I want to, then I will.

3322
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:40,960
Like any, like if you feel like you're going to enjoy it, you will otherwise, you know,

3323
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:43,840
you know exactly how you're going to feel about it by just looking at it.

3324
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:44,840
You know?

3325
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:47,840
It's one of those.

3326
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:48,840
Yeah.

3327
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:52,200
And for, for me, I'm, I'm good.

3328
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,960
I'm good on that, but I won't judge.

3329
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:54,960
I didn't even care.

3330
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:56,760
But I got, I haven't seen my friend in a while.

3331
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:57,760
I was like, yeah, fuck it.

3332
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:58,760
Obviously Sonic.

3333
02:27:58,760 --> 02:27:59,760
Sure.

3334
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:05,480
If I, damn, if I had a friend, and, and he invited me to see the Sonic the Hedgehog

3335
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:10,040
2 movie, I'd be like, yes, please.

3336
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:12,600
I'd be like, sure, I guess.

3337
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:14,680
I'd be like, sure, buddy.

3338
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:15,680
Why are we friends again?

3339
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:16,680
Oh, well.

3340
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,680
Come on, man.

3341
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:22,680
Go see it with Munch and Kazi.

3342
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:28,520
I don't know if they'd be, I don't force them to.

3343
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:33,680
They watched, um, like last week they watched, uh, that Pinocchio movie.

3344
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:35,680
Oh, no.

3345
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:39,800
Because they were, because that trailer had come out where he goes, father, I have the

3346
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:41,520
whole world to see.

3347
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:42,520
I love that video.

3348
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:44,880
And they were memeing on that.

3349
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:47,440
And they were like, ha ha, what if, what if we watched it?

3350
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:52,680
And then they were like, yo, Ben, you know, we're watching the new Pinocchio come over,

3351
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:53,680
we're watching the new Pinocchio.

3352
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:57,600
And I'm like, I don't actually want to watch that Pinocchio movie.

3353
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:01,480
I'm not actually going to do that.

3354
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:04,840
I have not found, I have not heard whether it was any good.

3355
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:05,840
No feedback.

3356
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:10,360
We'll have to, we'll have to see, wait for their, wait for their review.

3357
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:14,840
Oh, well, well, I'm drained.

3358
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:16,160
Voice mail time.

3359
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:17,160
Voice mail time.

3360
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:18,160
All right.

3361
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:21,880
Uh, listen, if at any point it becomes too much to bear, I won't blame you.

3362
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:24,960
If you, uh, just have to dip and leave me to it.

3363
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:25,960
Okay.

3364
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:29,240
You said that there's a lot of them and I'm betting that there's going to be one person

3365
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,160
who sent like 10.

3366
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:33,240
There's, there's, there's about 50 of them.

3367
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:34,240
Yeah.

3368
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:35,240
Okay.

3369
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:37,720
I'm going, I'm betting a bunch of them are going to be from the same person.

3370
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:38,720
Yeah.

3371
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,240
That's, that's a safe bet.

3372
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,240
All right.

3373
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,600
I'll post them in general.

3374
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:48,120
This one is called with killer, killer Prince 930, three, two, one, go.

3375
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:51,440
Hey, I feel talk so I want to discuss.

3376
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:55,400
I was going to clarify about wolf girl, but it seems like somebody I already searched

3377
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:56,400
for it.

3378
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:04,200
Uh, Ben, because of you, I watched even lock the movie of the guy on the card.

3379
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:05,200
Yeah.

3380
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:06,200
He's only on the card in the car.

3381
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:08,360
Look, he's really, really good.

3382
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:09,360
Thank you.

3383
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:12,160
And you started to play a Hades.

3384
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:13,160
Yes.

3385
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,160
Do it.

3386
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,160
Hades is the best.

3387
02:30:15,160 --> 02:30:16,160
Based.

3388
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:17,160
But watch out.

3389
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:24,640
Uh, doesn't matter who you are, Hades, you come out of it, gayer than you were before.

3390
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,360
So it's kind of dangerous.

3391
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:28,960
I mean, I am going to, I'm probably going to fuck.

3392
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:36,520
Why do you think the implications in society would be if everybody had just big as wings

3393
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:46,400
like this through structure, transportation, you know, what probably architecture would

3394
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:47,440
be different.

3395
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:50,440
We probably wouldn't have stairs.

3396
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:54,440
Yeah, I suppose so.

3397
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:55,440
Probably nests.

3398
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:56,440
Nests.

3399
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:58,920
Nests culture would be bigger.

3400
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:01,720
You'd see a lot more posts from Nest Twitter, I think.

3401
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:05,600
Probably probably wouldn't probably wouldn't have cars, probably wouldn't have roads.

3402
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:06,600
No need.

3403
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:07,600
No, yeah.

3404
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:14,520
I reckon planes would still exist because then they'd be much more efficient.

3405
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:15,520
Would they?

3406
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:19,600
Well, we don't really need cars, do we?

3407
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:20,600
Oh, I guess.

3408
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:21,600
Yeah.

3409
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,600
I don't know.

3410
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:28,760
I feel like flying your, I feel like walking versus rolling, like cars are much, cars are

3411
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:29,760
much faster.

3412
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,280
Well, I guess planes are faster than birds.

3413
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:32,280
Yeah.

3414
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:33,280
Never mind.

3415
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:34,280
Yeah.

3416
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:35,280
I win.

3417
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,280
All right.

3418
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:37,280
You win.

3419
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:38,280
Point to sin too.

3420
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,280
Yeah.

3421
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:40,280
Anyway, that's it.

3422
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:41,920
We wouldn't have cars or stairs and that's what would happen.

3423
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:42,920
That's it.

3424
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:43,920
No other changes.

3425
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:44,920
Everything else would be exactly the same.

3426
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:51,160
Oh, you know how like people, like some people, like fetishized angels, it would be the opposite

3427
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:53,720
where people fetishize people without wings.

3428
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:56,160
No, that'd be like amputee pulling.

3429
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,160
Yeah.

3430
02:31:57,160 --> 02:31:58,160
Absolutely.

3431
02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:01,160
What if we didn't have wings?

3432
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,160
Ew, gross.

3433
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:03,160
Oh, I'm coming.

3434
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:04,160
I'm coming.

3435
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:11,680
Oh, you could sleep on your back and it'd be comfy.

3436
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,680
Damn.

3437
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:19,680
Okay, next one is called Admit This Is Funny, 3, 2, 1, go.

3438
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:22,680
I just made a video on it, so I don't have a video.

3439
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:28,680
I just made a video on PCP7 or what I feel about it, whether it's like, I don't know.

3440
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,680
It's hard to say.

3441
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:30,680
It's just, it's just so complicated.

3442
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:31,680
I need that man.

3443
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:32,680
I need that man to cut through bullshit.

3444
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:33,680
I need that man to put his hands together.

3445
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:34,680
When you look at comments on like the lectures, like specifically, I look at the animarts

3446
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:35,680
and we can see the lectures obviously, the ones I share.

3447
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:37,680
And there's just tons of people being like, are they serious with misogynists?

3448
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:38,680
And I'm just like, can you really not tell?

3449
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:39,680
It's a joke.

3450
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,680
Like, I don't even, I don't even remember.

3451
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:41,680
Like, what are they talking about?

3452
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,680
Like, there are some times when, like in the animarts when Nate was like saying, like,

3453
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,680
I'm not a woman, wrote this law, but like clearly as a joke, and it happens like twice,

3454
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,680
I think.

3455
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:45,680
And it's just like, yeah, I don't know.

3456
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:46,680
Like, uh, yeah.

3457
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:47,680
So yeah.

3458
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:48,680
So what, I guess, what is the, are they, are they really misogynist?

3459
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:49,680
They really can't read the room at all.

3460
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:50,680
And I'm like, I don't know.

3461
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:51,680
I don't know.

3462
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:52,680
I don't know.

3463
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,680

3464
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:54,680
I don't know.

3465
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:55,680
I don't know.

3466
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,680

3474
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:04,680
I don't know.

3477
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:07,680
I don't know.

3478
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:08,680
I don't know.

3479
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:09,680
I don't know.

3480
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:10,680
I don't know.

3481
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:11,680
I don't know.

3482
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,680
I don't know.

3483
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:13,680
I don't know.

3484
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,680

02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:19,680
I don't know.

3490
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,680
I don't know.

3491
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:21,680
I don't know.

3492
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:22,680

3493
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:23,680
I don't know.

3494
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:24,680

02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:27,680
I don't know.

3498
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:28,680
I don't know.

3499
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:29,680
I don't know.

3500
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:30,680
I don't know.

3501
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:31,680
I don't know.

3502
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:32,680
I don't know.

3503
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:33,680
I don't know.

3504
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,680
I don't know.

3505
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:35,680
I don't know.

3506
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,680
I don't know.

3507
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:37,680
I don't know.

3508
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,680
I don't know.

3509
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:39,680
I don't know.

3510
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:40,680
I don't know.

3511
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:41,680
I don't know.

3512
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:42,680
I don't know.

3513
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:43,680
I don't know.

3514
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,680
I don't know.

3515
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:45,680
I don't know.

3516
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:46,680
I don't know.

3517
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:47,680
I don't know.

3518
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:48,680
I don't know.

3519
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:49,680
I don't know.

3520
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,680
I don't know.

3521
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:53,560
It was funny. I'm a funny guy. I say funny things.

3522
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:59,080
I would say that was decently funny. I'm an entertainer.

3523
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:03,640
You got to recycle a full minute 30 of material there, Ben.

3524
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:04,840
You didn't even have to do anything.

3525
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:07,400
That's free content. That's free.

3526
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:12,120
You know, when you're this funny, you don't even have to come up with new material.

3527
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:18,680
You just get them to tell you to play the old stuff and you just do it.

3528
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:19,880
You just do it.

3529
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:20,840
Why not?

3530
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:21,480
And it's good.

3531
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:28,360
Next one is called Patrick Star. 3, 2, 1, go.

3532
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:36,200
Fuck you and Saint. If you ever get with a woman, I'll be there.

3533
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:42,280
The shadows waiting to cuff you. If you ever climax their self-stimulation,

3534
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:47,560
I'll be there to collect your summons, which leads to fertilize a bird of woman.

3535
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:52,280
Then you'll be on the Hooper Child support. That would be putting justice.

3536
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:54,680
Thanks, Patrick.

3537
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:59,160
Please don't do that. Please don't do that, Patrick Star.

3538
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:00,920
Patrick, keep it up. You're doing great, buddy.

3539
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:07,720
Okay. Well, he's just following orders, Ben. He's just following orders.

3540
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:09,160
Who's orders?

3541
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:09,800
Never you mind.

3542
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:14,200
Okay. Wait, there's a YouTube...

3543
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:19,800
There's a YouTube link in the next one.

3544
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:20,360
Oh, boy.

3545
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:25,080
This is the video, Secret Tips on Watching a Puppy That You Don't Know.

3546
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:28,680
Should we watch the video first or the voicemail?

3547
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:29,880
Yeah, it's seven seconds.

3548
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,760
Okay.

3549
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:36,120
Hey, guys. It's your boy, Brad Brad here. Today, I'm bringing you a secret on how to take care of your dog.

3550
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:38,760
You play a lot of Call of Duty, then you take care of your dog.

3551
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:40,600
Because every time you pet her, you'll go,

3552
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:42,280
Sorry, man. Things got fucked up.

3553
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:44,040
Sorry, man. Things got fucked up.

3554

Subscribe to more tips on how to take care...

3555
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:47,320
That was a cool dog.

3556
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:49,160
Cool dog. Good dog.

3557
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:49,400
Yeah, sure.

3558
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:51,080
Sorry about the cone.

3559
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:57,960
Let me see. All right. The voicemail, let's listen to it. Three, two, one, go.

3560
02:35:57,960 --> 02:35:59,800
Hey, guys. It's your boy, Brad Brad here.

3561
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:02,440
Just letting you know that my videos are starting to get more views.

3562
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:05,560
So, if I ever become a YouTube game, it's always sure to tell me audience to go

3563
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:11,560
subscribe to PCP, BenSaint.com, no, Patreon.com, BenSaint.com.

3564
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,760
Yeah, BenSaint.com.

3565
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:16,760
Just give and take and play Fan of Revenge and to play Pumpkin Alley.

3566
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:19,400
Oh, also, as usual, no Tom, no watch.

3567
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:20,280
Okay.

3568
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:21,880
Well, he won't know.

3569
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:23,320
This guy's just shilling his channel.

3570
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:27,240
Yeah. Yes. It worked. We watched the video of a dog.

3571
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:28,680
Yeah, I guess.

3572
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:31,880
Well, thanks for that, man.

3573
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:35,560
I'll use that next time I watch it puppy that I don't know.

3574
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:37,720
All right.

3575
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:40,920
Next one is called Heat. Three, two, one, go.

3576
02:36:42,600 --> 02:36:45,480
All right, Ben. I got some, I got some heatwave.

3577
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:46,600
Okay, thanks.

3578
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:51,800
I think we found the post.

3579
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:53,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3580
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:59,480
Exactly. Okay. Next one is called Big News. Three, two, one, go.

3581
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:13,560
Okay, next one is- That's right, everybody.

3582
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:15,400
Keep wearing masks.

3583
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:19,240
Keep wearing masks. Yes. Get your fourth booster.

3584
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:22,040
And I'm not kidding. I will get it.

3585
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:28,040
Ben, we don't need to watch the video of someone explaining that the Breath of the World has been delayed.

3586
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:29,320
We got to watch the whole video.

3587
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:31,800
No, we don't. Otherwise, how will we react to it?

3588
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:36,360
I'll tell you, I knew it comes on screen and he says it's delayed.

3589
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,080
That's it.

3590
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:42,200
Okay, but I just think we got to watch the video.

3591
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:42,680
Okay, watch all of it.

3592
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:44,280
No, you're right. No, no video.

3593
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:45,080
Watch the title, bro.

3594
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:46,360
Uh, next one is called-

3595
02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:49,000
It's a minute 30. We don't need to watch it.

3596
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3597
02:37:50,520 --> 02:37:52,600
Okay, next one is called High Ben New Fan Here.

3598
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:55,000
What do you think of plants versus zombies?

3599
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:56,680
I've never played it.

3600
02:37:57,560 --> 02:37:58,200
Oh, it's kind of cool.

3601
02:37:58,200 --> 02:37:59,080
It's got a good song.

3602
02:37:59,080 --> 02:37:59,880
It looks fine.

3603
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:00,200
Zombies go-

3604
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:00,680
It looks fine.

3605
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:07,400
I know that the Shamblers and RFCK are plants versus zombies based.

3606
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:07,960
Yes, good.

3607
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:10,040
Next one is a YouTube link.

3608
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:14,200
Nathaniel Bandy.

3609
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:15,160
So, I got hacked.

3610
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:15,880
What happened?

3611
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:18,120
And it's eight minutes long and I'm not going to watch it.

3612
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:21,000
Probably someone got Garling Houseed.

3613
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:24,120
Yeah, you had a channel.

3614
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:24,600
Oh, yeah.

3615
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:26,440
You mentioned a channel that got Garling Houseed.

3616
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:31,080
There's a channel called Lenors who did funny edits of a weird 80s video of a guy dancing.

3617
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:38,200
Anyway, they got hacked by the exact same people that you guys did, the Ripple RFCP.

3618
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:40,840
Yeah, like literally they got Garling Houseed.

3619
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:41,800
It was the Ripple people.

3620
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:42,600
Yeah, exactly.

3621
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:45,240
I was like, no, no.

3622
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:48,200
Yeah, that sucks.

3623
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:51,800
Hope they fix it.

3624
02:38:54,360 --> 02:38:57,000
It's funny now in hindsight, but it sucks so bad.

3625
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:57,640
I know.

3626
02:38:57,640 --> 02:39:01,080
I checked their Twitter and they were trying to get in contact with YouTube.

3627
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:04,600
I hope they're all right, but Lenors, cool videos.

3628
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:06,520
Maybe I should reach out and be like...

3629
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:09,080
Yeah, maybe I'll send you a link once we're done.

3630
02:39:09,880 --> 02:39:10,920
Yeah, why not?

3631
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:16,680
And then he'll be like, oh, this happened to you?

3632
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,800
Oh, how are you guys doing now?

3633
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:20,920
And then he'll look at our channel and be like, oh my god, it's a graveyard.

3634
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:22,040
Oh my god, it's a wasteland.

3635
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:24,360
Oh my god, no, this is my future.

3636
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:25,320
No!

3637
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:28,440
Next one.

3638
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:34,200
Okay, well, there's a short voicemail to go along with this video link.

3639
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:36,600
I'll listen to the voicemail first.

3640
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:37,720
Three, two, one, go.

3641
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:42,520
It looks like Trixty's doing rants again.

3642
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:47,160
Evan, you should make a video where you expose her and be like, yo,

3643
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:49,800
she didn't fulfill the most of her fucking rant.

3644
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:52,600
So you guys shouldn't support her and fuck her.

3645
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:53,560
What do you think?

3646
02:39:53,560 --> 02:39:54,760
I think it's genius.

3647
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:57,240
I mean, I don't know.

3648
02:39:57,240 --> 02:40:01,240
People still think they're going to get what they pay for with Trixty.

3649
02:40:01,240 --> 02:40:03,240
Then like, I don't know, they've dug their own grave.

3650
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:07,960
Yeah, I mean, anyone who can't see the pines for the fields,

3651
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:08,840
what's the expression?

3652
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:11,000
The pines for the fields?

3653
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,280
Some of that, yeah.

3654
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:13,560
Anyone who can't see, you're missing,

3655
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:15,560
you're really missing the pinewood for the derby.

3656
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:21,080
I was trying to be clever, but like anyone who's still like hanging around the yig stuff,

3657
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:22,040
like you can't help them.

3658
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:23,000
They're like flat earthers.

3659
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:23,800
You can't convert them.

3660
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:25,240
Honestly, true.

3661
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:31,000
There's, yeah, I saw this, I don't know if it was this stream,

3662
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:35,000
but like there was another yig stream and I saw,

3663
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:39,880
there was a brief moment in one of these recent streams,

3664
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:42,840
I think the latest one, not this one.

3665
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:45,000
The one with Thu's thumbnail is the girl in the hat.

3666
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:49,720
She, I forget how it came up.

3667
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:54,520
Someone, some weirdo in the chat was saying like,

3668
02:40:55,080 --> 02:41:02,600
was saying to Trixie, like you just seem like a stupid ripoff of best guy ever.

3669
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:05,000
And I'm like, okay.

3670
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:07,240
And that was a weird thing to say.

3671
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:11,000
And then later that same person was like, and this is great.

3672
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,400
At least, at least he doesn't, you know, you're like,

3673
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:15,240
you just seem butter, you just seem jealous.

3674
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:17,640
At least he doesn't rub his gender in your face.

3675
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,720
Oh my God.

3676
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:25,160
At least, at least best guy ever doesn't rub his gender in your fucking face.

3677
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:27,080
Oh my God.

3678
02:41:27,080 --> 02:41:29,000
So this guy was based, obviously.

3679
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:35,400
But somewhere talking about that, the subject of me came up.

3680
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:37,800
Oh, no, no, it was someone said, someone mentioned Munchie.

3681
02:41:37,800 --> 02:41:39,000
Someone was talking about the PCP.

3682
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:45,960
And Bird said like, Munchie, yeah, he seems all right.

3683
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:47,240
I don't know about him though.

3684
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:50,840
Because like he hangs out with Ben Sain, right?

3685
02:41:50,840 --> 02:41:52,440
So that came up.

3686
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:53,160
He mentioned that.

3687
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:55,480
And then the two of them, they sort of like nervously chuckled.

3688
02:41:55,480 --> 02:41:59,000
They're like, hey, yeah, that's not a good look.

3689
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,440
Like, that's never good.

3690
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:01,240
That's never good.

3691
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:02,280
Ben Sain is bad.

3692
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:03,320
Ben Sain is bad.

3693
02:42:03,320 --> 02:42:04,760
Wait, it's not a good look?

3694
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:06,120
I got to get out of here.

3695
02:42:06,120 --> 02:42:07,480
You got to get out of here, man.

3696
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:09,800
You're looking a little sus right now.

3697
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:14,040
But so they said that they did not elaborate.

3698
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:16,280
And then some guy in the chat,

3699
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:17,720
and this blew my mind.

3700
02:42:17,720 --> 02:42:20,760
I could not believe someone would actually say this.

3701
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:22,600
This is like a parody.

3702
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:27,000
If I was imagining like the dumbest, tricksy head take on me,

3703
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:31,880
they said like Ben pretended to be not problematic.

3704
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:34,280
Like Ben masqueraded is not problematic,

3705
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:36,360
but really he was like the worst of them all.

3706
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:39,560
Man, you didn't even pretend once.

3707
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:43,160
Because I don't love tricksy.

3708
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:44,920
I'm actually the most problematic at all.

3709
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:51,720
I could not believe a person said that in like genuine whatever.

3710
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,120
So that was great.

3711
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:57,640
That's all that was, I don't know.

3712
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:58,520
Just thought that was funny.

3713
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:01,080
It was funny in like a tragic way.

3714
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:01,320
Yeah.

3715
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:08,280
Anyway, that's what I have to say about these streams.

3716
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:08,920
Whatever.

3717
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:11,080
Streams means the low on money, which is funny.

3718
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,520
It is funny.

3719
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:17,960
Give her 10 bucks if you want her to like mumble some shit

3720
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:20,120
about something she doesn't know what she's talking about.

3721
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:23,320
Oh, did you remember the tweet that was like,

3722
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:26,360
oh, I need to make a negative anime video or something?

3723
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3724
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:31,800
She said I need to criticize something

3725
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:34,440
because I'm just so good at criticism.

3726
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:37,000
And that's why all my negative criticism videos

3727
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:39,560
do better than my positive videos.

3728
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:41,960
It's because I'm just so good at criticizing stuff.

3729
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:47,160
It's not, yes, it's not that like,

3730
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:50,360
that's always the case and everybody knows that like

3731
02:43:51,480 --> 02:43:54,840
hating on a thing gets more views than praising a thing,

3732
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:55,480
like always.

3733
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:57,400
It's not that.

3734
02:43:57,400 --> 02:43:58,200
It's not that.

3735
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:02,120
I'm just such a genius at negative criticism.

3736
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:02,840
I'm so good at it.

3737
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:07,160
I just want to shout out Veil's response to that tweet

3738
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:08,600
where he said, we have forgotten hate.

3739
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:09,960
I thought that was funny.

3740
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:13,640
I know that I made a whole video

3741
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:16,680
where I sort of like vaguely alluded to the fact

3742
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:18,680
that I'm like changing my whole personality

3743
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:20,440
so that I'll only be positive now

3744
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:21,800
because we need to remember love.

3745
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:24,840
I know that I made a whole thing and like said that

3746
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,680
and implied that about myself.

3747
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:33,880
But actually, I need to like do like some clickbait.

3748
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:35,480
So that's actually like at the window

3749
02:44:35,480 --> 02:44:37,160
and it didn't mean anything, lol.

3750
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:41,320
It's time to start dumping on stuff again

3751
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:43,160
because it's the only way I can make any money.

3752
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,400
Ooh, I hate her.

3753
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:46,120
Ooh, I hate her.

3754
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:47,320
She's so dumb.

3755
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:48,280
She's so dumb.

3756
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:50,680
Simsie, she's so fucking dumb

3757
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:53,160
and people actually watch her and they nod and they go,

3758
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:55,160
this is smart and they go, this makes sense.

3759
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:56,920
I'm on board.

3760
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:59,080
I'm on board with whatever this is.

3761
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:00,440
This is a comprehensible.

3762
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:04,440
She's so dumb that it's like,

3763
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,880
it's like it just makes everyone else dumber

3764
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:09,640
and they're with it.

3765
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,080
It's a seeping dumb curse.

3766
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:12,200
It is.

3767
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,240
I don't know, is that an Elden Ring thing?

3768
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:15,640
Sort of.

3769
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:17,800
There's a seedbed curse.

3770
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:18,360
I was close.

3771
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:21,400
Okay, we'll go with that.

3772
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:22,200
Seedbed curse.

3773
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,080
That was intentional.

3774
02:45:23,080 --> 02:45:25,640
I didn't accidentally reference Elden Ring.

3775
02:45:25,640 --> 02:45:27,240
Does it turn you into a garden?

3776
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:29,320
No, there's a man called the Dung Eater

3777
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:32,440
and he infects corpses with the seedbed curse.

3778
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:35,960
It sounds like Hollow Knight.

3779
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:38,040
Yeah, except his name's the Dung Eater,

3780
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:39,800
which is funny because it means he eats poo.

3781
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:41,000
He does.

3782
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:43,000
He really does.

3783
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:46,600
Good for him.

3784
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:49,640
Anyway, is the YouTube just a link to the whole stream?

3785
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:50,760
Yeah, it's just a link to the whole stream.

3786
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:52,920
Should we watch the whole thing?

3787
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:54,920
Yeah, I think so.

3788
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:56,120
It's only like three hours.

3789
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,720
Oh, that rant was so stupid.

3790
02:45:59,480 --> 02:46:00,440
Well, I'm sure it was.

3791
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:04,360
Hey, Trixie, can you rant about Dragon Ball Super retcons?

3792
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:06,840
She would.

3793
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:08,040
She would take some money.

3794
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:10,440
Says, oh, actually, I don't really know anything about that.

3795
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:11,240
I haven't watched it.

3796
02:46:11,880 --> 02:46:16,360
I think I don't watch shows anymore.

3797
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:18,760
Thanks for the money.

3798
02:46:19,480 --> 02:46:20,280
Thanks for the money.

3799
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:25,080
There's like six people.

3800
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:27,160
There's maybe like six people who are like

3801
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:32,280
more invested in Trixie and Yig than a person should be.

3802
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,880
There's like six people who will just throw $20.

3803
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:39,800
You should just be like, I just love you.

3804
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:42,520
I'm just so glad that you're playing Elden Ring.

3805
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:45,000
I've been waiting to see you play Elden Ring for like,

3806
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:46,520
I'm so happy to see this.

3807
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:49,480
Before you said the throw $20 thing,

3808
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:52,040
I was like, there's six people who are so invested in Trixie

3809
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:52,600
that it's unhealthy.

3810
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:54,200
And I was like, well, two of them are me and you.

3811
02:46:57,480 --> 02:47:00,760
Okay, eight people, but at least I don't give money.

3812
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:01,960
I give money to the other people.

3813
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:03,880
But I was just in like a sick way.

3814
02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:05,320
I was in like a cool go.

3815
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:07,400
Yeah, yeah, sick, but good.

3816
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:09,320
Sick in the head, but sick in the bed.

3817
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:10,520
You know what I mean, homie?

3818
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:12,280
They're sick in the head in the bed.

3819
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:12,840
We're sick.

3820
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:14,920
No, scratch that reverse it.

3821
02:47:14,920 --> 02:47:17,240
You're missing the pines for the fields here, man.

3822
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:19,560
We're sick in the bed, but not with each other.

3823
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:23,720
We're not, we're not gay.

3824
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:25,000
We're not like Thanatos.

3825
02:47:25,800 --> 02:47:27,000
I was sick in your bed.

3826
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:27,480
I'm sorry.

3827
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:31,160
I'm going to fuck Thanatos later, but not in like a gay way.

3828
02:47:31,160 --> 02:47:33,480
God, you give him ambrosia and make him my boyfriend.

3829
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:37,880
You keep bringing that up, but you seem pretty excited about it, man.

3830
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:39,560
No, I'm just dreading it.

3831
02:47:39,560 --> 02:47:40,760
I'm like, oh, I got to do it.

3832
02:47:41,320 --> 02:47:43,240
Oh, I got to kiss that handsome man.

3833
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:45,560
Fringe, am I right?

3834
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:48,680
That handsome gray boy.

3835
02:47:49,240 --> 02:47:51,560
So look at those pecs.

3836
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:54,120
Look at those, that Serratus anterior just bulging

3837
02:47:54,200 --> 02:47:55,160
out of his ribcage.

3838
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,240
Disgusting, am I right?

3839
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:05,320
There's a part two, actually.

3840
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:10,200
So let's post, there we go.

3841
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:12,360
Part two, three, two, one, go.

3842
02:48:13,160 --> 02:48:15,400
I might be wrong because I didn't watch those videos.

3843
02:48:15,400 --> 02:48:18,440
I watched a shit fucking content, but who knows?

3844
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:19,080
Nobody knows.

3845
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:19,800
You're not wrong.

3846
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:20,440
Don't worry.

3847
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:21,720
Nobody, nobody knows.

3848
02:48:22,120 --> 02:48:25,320
Nobody watches a fucking content, bro.

3849
02:48:27,400 --> 02:48:31,640
Those views, those view counts, we're cracking like 4K on a good one.

3850
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:39,560
She just keeps putting them out and they just keep doing like 3K views, 4K views.

3851
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:41,640
Any day now.

3852
02:48:45,080 --> 02:48:49,880
Next one is called, it's a YouTube link, whatever, three, two, one, go.

3853
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:52,600
Hey guys, that's my my favorite YouTube videos here.

3854
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:55,000
Make sure you like it, subscribe, and leave a comment.

3855
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:56,200
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

3856
02:48:56,840 --> 02:48:57,800
I'm going to kill you.

3857
02:48:57,800 --> 02:48:58,360
I'm going to...

3858
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:00,360
If you were right, it's the same guy.

3859
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:03,000
Guest privileges and say voice jail.

3860
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:07,560
I'm, I'm, if, he's on thin ice.

3861
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:09,240
He's, he's on thin ice.

3862
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:10,120
Anymore plugin.

3863
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,040
And I think any more plugin and yeah, we'll just have no choice.

3864
02:49:14,680 --> 02:49:15,640
I'll have to become a cop.

3865
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:16,680
But Benny's blowing up.

3866
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:19,160
He said his videos are blowing up and he's gonna give you a shout out.

3867
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:23,480
Well, I hope he does.

3868
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:25,880
You know, I wish him, I wish him the best in that endeavor.

3869
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:29,320
But if you fucking come around here again.

3870
02:49:30,920 --> 02:49:33,400
Yeah, I wish he, I hope he does it elsewhere.

3871
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:40,600
Next one is called, best guy ever, isn't getting any more PC Patreon money.

3872
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:41,640
Glad.

3873
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:46,520
Speaking of PC Patreon money, I forgot to upload those bonus episodes that are in the can,

3874
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:48,520
but I will, I swear I will do it soon.

3875
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:50,120
Oh, Ben, you silly boy.

3876
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:50,760
I know.

3877
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:52,120
I am a silly Billy.

3878
02:49:53,240 --> 02:49:55,480
Anyway, three, two, one, go.

3879
02:49:56,600 --> 02:50:00,040
Now that Nate's not getting any PCP Patreon money,

3880
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:03,880
expect the donations from us over at Trump Tower.

3881
02:50:03,880 --> 02:50:04,840
Yes, Nate.

3882
02:50:04,840 --> 02:50:05,400
No, watch.

3883
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:08,840
Come on, thanks, Donnie.

3884
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:13,000
I picked up like halfway through and I was like, is that Trump?

3885
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:16,600
Hell yeah, my man.

3886
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:17,320
Thanks, man.

3887
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:22,200
Did you see, he made a, I saw a screenshot of him, you know, because he's off Twitter.

3888
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:23,400
He's banned on Twitter.

3889
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:28,040
So now he does these like email, like press releases.

3890
02:50:28,040 --> 02:50:28,680
Oh my God.

3891
02:50:28,680 --> 02:50:34,360
Like, and I saw one fairly recently and it starts out with just like an entire paragraph of him.

3892
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:36,840
He says like, yes, it's true.

3893
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:38,680
Yes, the rumors are true.

3894
02:50:38,680 --> 02:50:45,800
Yes, I golfed, I golfed a three under par on like a certain, on a certain, like playing,

3895
02:50:45,800 --> 02:50:48,200
playing with like such and such PGA tour.

3896
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:50,280
It was three under par, it was wonderful.

3897
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:51,720
It really happened.

3898
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:52,200
Yes.

3899
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:53,560
So the wind was against me too.

3900
02:50:53,560 --> 02:50:54,280
It was beautiful.

3901
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:55,400
It was a beautiful shot.

3902
02:50:55,400 --> 02:50:56,920
It was almost a hole in one.

3903
02:50:56,920 --> 02:50:57,400
Absolutely.

3904
02:50:57,400 --> 02:51:00,520
Would have been a hole in one if the wind was with me instead of against me.

3905
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:02,760
But yeah, everyone was very impressed.

3906
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:03,320
It's true.

3907
02:51:03,320 --> 02:51:04,280
You've been hearing about it.

3908
02:51:04,280 --> 02:51:05,160
I'm here to confirm.

3909
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:06,200
You've heard the rumors.

3910
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:06,680
You heard them.

3911
02:51:07,960 --> 02:51:08,440
It's true.

3912
02:51:08,440 --> 02:51:08,920
It's true.

3913
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:09,880
It's all true.

3914
02:51:09,880 --> 02:51:11,960
Every single word of it, every single word of it is true.

3915
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:12,440
I'm golfing.

3916
02:51:12,440 --> 02:51:16,600
I thought that was pretty good.

3917
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:18,440
God bless that fucking monster.

3918
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:20,920
Living it, living his best life.

3919
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:26,280
Just a, just, just golfing, golfing with the stars.

3920
02:51:27,400 --> 02:51:31,000
Next, next one is called, wait.

3921
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,520
Oh, the next one is just a YouTube link.

3922
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:39,880
Oh, I saw that Cybershell put this video out, but I did not watch it because I have not seen

3923
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:42,200
the first Sonic movie.

3924
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:42,920
Me neither.

3925
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:50,040
But if anyone is interested, yeah, Cybershell put out a video thoughts on the first Sonic

3926
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:52,600
movie, so watch it perhaps.

3927
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:53,720
I'm sure he was like.

3928
02:51:53,720 --> 02:51:54,920
I might watch it anyway.

3929
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:59,320
I'm sure his opinion was it was a perfectly serviceable kids movie because that's everyone's

3930
02:51:59,320 --> 02:52:00,600
opinion of the Sonic movie.

3931
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:04,680
It would make, would make, would make sense.

3932
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:09,240
Next one is called, Trixie's Pride.

3933
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:09,640
No, no.

3934
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:12,120
Three, three, two, one, go.

3935
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:19,560
I don't get why Trixie doesn't just change her channel name back to like Digi or Diginae

3936
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:22,920
because like there is no more Yugi Studios.

3937
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:25,080
Everybody's left and it's just her now.

3938
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:29,720
And she's gone back to just making the exact same sort of anime.

3939
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:32,680
Who, who could have seen it coming when she was Digi Bro?

3940
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:35,400
Only, I think the recent ones are a lot worse.

3941
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:35,960
IMO.

3942
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:40,920
Nevertheless, like she would, she gets no views.

3943
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:44,920
And I think she would get views if she just changed her channel name to Digi probably,

3944
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:47,320
but she doesn't for some reason.

3945
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:49,160
Yeah, you're probably right.

3946
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:52,760
I mean, there's lots, I'm sure there's lots of people that see that logo and are like,

3947
02:52:52,760 --> 02:52:53,720
I don't know what this is.

3948
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:54,920
Unsubscribe.

3949
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:58,120
Uh, I won't, I won't unsubscribe or just, I'll never click it.

3950
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:01,720
So you're probably right.

3951
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:02,120
Well, the real.

3952
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:03,000
Yeah, she had.

3953
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:03,800
Yeah, yeah, go on.

3954
02:53:03,800 --> 02:53:06,040
The real answer is she's not playing that character anymore.

3955
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:07,640
That's true.

3956
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:08,040
Yeah, she's not.

3957
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:10,440
Digi was a character long and she's not playing it anymore.

3958
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:11,800
Digi was a character.

3959
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:17,800
Trixie has remembered love until she needs to make a video shitting on something popular to make some money.

3960
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:25,160
So, yeah, you fool.

3961
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:26,680
Trixie has remembered love.

3962
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:30,680
If she, if she were to rebrand to Digi, it would be admitting,

3963
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:36,440
it would be admitting that by going back to making the exact same content as before and

3964
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:39,400
everything else that she said she was going to do with Yeeg Studio failed,

3965
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:42,040
it would be admitting that she's doing the same thing.

3966
02:53:42,040 --> 02:53:42,600
It would be like,

3967
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:44,840
And obviously she's remembered love, so it's totally different.

3968
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:48,600
It'd be like at the end of Avatar season two when Zuko's like almost turning good,

3969
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:51,640
but then he betrays Aang at the very last second and goes by it again.

3970
02:53:51,640 --> 02:53:53,720
It would be, it would be precisely like that.

3971
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:54,920
It would be exactly like that.

3972
02:53:55,560 --> 02:53:56,440
What would Riley say?

3973
02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:58,840
It would be, it would be a betrayal of Riley.

3974
02:53:58,840 --> 02:53:59,160
Yeah.

3975
02:54:00,040 --> 02:54:03,240
Riley's got, he's, he had Yeeg in his bio and now like,

3976
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:03,640
I don't know.

3977
02:54:03,640 --> 02:54:05,640
He didn't have, he didn't have Digi in his bio.

3978
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:07,560
They still make podcasts with each other.

3979
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:10,120
I mean, they're basically still a thing.

3980
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:12,120
I mean, it's not like Riley did anything in the first place.

3981
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:16,120
They basically, they basically, yeah, they have their, right,

3982
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:21,080
they do the podcasts that get like 200 views on Riley's channel.

3983
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:25,480
I haven't, I mean, I haven't listened to anything.

3984
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:26,200
Have we, have we talked about that?

3985
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:27,160
I'm sure they're riveting.

3986
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:30,200
Mint's art tutorials and specifically the comments on those.

3987
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:35,080
Um, maybe, but like, I don't remember.

3988
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:39,800
So I mean, I've seen one or two of those videos and they're very embarrassing.

3989
02:54:39,800 --> 02:54:40,360
Yeah.

3990
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:43,560
But like, they're like, I was looking at the comments on them recently

3991
02:54:43,560 --> 02:54:45,480
and it is literally just all people saying like,

3992
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:46,680
Oh my God, you're so cute.

3993
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:48,440
What are you wearing and stuff like that?

3994
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:48,680
Yeah.

3995
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:50,760
So strange.

3996
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:55,800
I think she looks like there's something wrong with her, honestly.

3997
02:54:55,800 --> 02:54:57,400
But that's, yes, that's just me.

3998
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:03,160
I don't think she looks like she's got all her chromosomes.

3999
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:05,000
Then she's got a low view count.

4000
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:07,880
So she can't fucking say that, by the way.

4001
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:10,280
She's got a low view count, which means that she's mine.

4002
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:13,240
That's probably what they're thinking.

4003
02:55:13,240 --> 02:55:14,760
That's probably their brain process.

4004
02:55:15,560 --> 02:55:18,760
I, I, I, is, I mean, is that true?

4005
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:21,160
Is it all just like comments about like, you're cute?

4006
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:21,400
Yeah.

4007
02:55:22,040 --> 02:55:22,920
It's very funny.

4008
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:27,880
And like some, it's like good episode and things like that.

4009
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:28,760
Right.

4010
02:55:28,760 --> 02:55:29,080
Yeah.

4011
02:55:30,360 --> 02:55:34,440
I can't imagine the kind of person, I can't imagine the kind of person

4012
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:38,920
who's like invested in like Riley's channel.

4013
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:44,680
They, they uploaded a movie review every day for like a month.

4014
02:55:45,640 --> 02:55:47,240
And I have no, can you imagine?

4015
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:49,480
I saw that that, well, I mean, I didn't see all of them,

4016
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:51,640
but like I saw that someone mentioned that that happened.

4017
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:51,720
Yeah.

4018
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:54,600
Can you imagine being the kind of person who would watch every single one of those?

4019
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:02,680
The kind, it's, it's not, I mean, I'm imagining that sort of person and it's not,

4020
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:05,240
it's not a flattering.

4021
02:56:05,240 --> 02:56:06,520
It's not a healthy person.

4022
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:09,000
It's not a healthy person.

4023
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:19,000
It's probably someone who I would call them the lowest bottom feedingist,

4024
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:26,520
like a social climbing like cloud chaser who like is below the floor.

4025
02:56:26,520 --> 02:56:29,800
Is at the very bottom and is like, I need to start somewhere.

4026
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:37,080
Well, here's a guy who has like a third hand connection to a, to a famous podcaster.

4027
02:56:37,640 --> 02:56:41,080
So it's, I'll start by sucking up to him and then maybe I can climb the ladder.

4028
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:42,920
I mean, that was always my plan with you,

4029
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:45,480
like getting me friends with you, so I could be friends with Nate instead.

4030
02:56:45,480 --> 02:56:45,720
Right.

4031
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:46,840
Right.

4032
02:56:46,840 --> 02:56:47,800
It was my, right.

4033
02:56:47,800 --> 02:56:50,600
And I mean, it was my plan with Trixie.

4034
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:54,680
I was going to use her to get to Jeff and, and then, you know,

4035
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:58,520
and then it all fell apart at Radcon and things were never the same.

4036
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:03,720
Um, you know, I get it.

4037
02:57:03,720 --> 02:57:06,840
Like I get it, but, but that's, but that's, that's it.

4038
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:10,120
That's the only kind of person I can imagine who's like commenting,

4039
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:12,760
like nice, like nice upload, like good video.

4040
02:57:13,800 --> 02:57:14,840
I love those comments.

4041
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:15,560
They're funny.

4042
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:16,200
Yeah.

4043
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:16,600
Yeah.

4044
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:18,120
I'm glad they exist, even though I'm scared.

4045
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:19,480
They're ubiquitous.

4046
02:57:19,480 --> 02:57:20,360
They're ubiquitous.

4047
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:20,520
Yeah.

4048
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:21,240
You always see them.

4049
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:29,080
Uh, anyway, next, the episode, I mean, is called, uh, Forg Wizard.

4050
02:57:29,720 --> 02:57:31,320
Virginia Beach is bad.

4051
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:33,400
Three, two, one, go.

4052
02:57:35,320 --> 02:57:39,960
So, uh, did you always use to talk about how much she loved Virginia Beach

4053
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:42,200
and how great of a fucking location it was?

4054
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:46,200
And I'm just going to, maybe just because I'm a Midwest boy,

4055
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:50,120
but, uh, Virginia Beach fucking sucks.

4056
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:50,600
I agree.

4057
02:57:50,600 --> 02:57:54,920
I've been there a couple of times now just visiting family or traveling there.

4058
02:57:54,920 --> 02:57:59,320
I've spent quite a bit of time there and God, it's hot.

4059
02:57:59,320 --> 02:58:00,360
It's sticky.

4060
02:58:00,360 --> 02:58:02,600
It is a tourist trap nightmare.

4061
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:03,880
There's no reason to go there.

4062
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:05,480
Did you, you are wrong.

4063
02:58:05,480 --> 02:58:06,280
You suck.

4064
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:07,240
You are bad.

4065
02:58:07,880 --> 02:58:15,960
Also, the best city in this gosh darn country is Minneapolis, Minnesota.

4066
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:17,320
I've never been.

4067
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:18,280
Boston is up there.

4068
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:19,080
It's pretty close.

4069
02:58:19,080 --> 02:58:23,560
You know, there's some good cities, but name a better city than Minneapolis, Minnesota,

4070
02:58:23,560 --> 02:58:24,360
and not St. Paul.

4071
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:26,040
Fuck St. Paul, but Minneapolis.

4072
02:58:26,040 --> 02:58:27,080
The fuck is St. Paul?

4073
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:29,080
Goddamn boys.

4074
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:31,320
It's a damn good city.

4075
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:33,320
I don't even know where St. Paul is.

4076
02:58:33,320 --> 02:58:34,680
I've never been to Minneapolis.

4077
02:58:35,640 --> 02:58:38,840
Um, I've been to San Francisco.

4078
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:40,760
Easy answer, but I think New York is cool.

4079
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:43,000
I've never been to San Francisco or San Diego.

4080
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:43,480
It was neat.

4081
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:45,000
Hmm.

4082
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:48,840
I went on a tram and I was, I was too scared to go to Alcatraz because I was like seven.

4083
02:58:48,840 --> 02:58:50,600
So I went on a tram with my mom instead.

4084
02:58:51,880 --> 02:58:53,240
Wait, you were too scared to go on what?

4085
02:58:53,240 --> 02:58:53,480
Yeah.

4086
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:58,760
My, my sister's two years older than me and her and my dad went to Alcatraz and did like a tour there.

4087
02:58:59,960 --> 02:59:00,280
Oh, right.

4088
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:01,640
And I was too scared.

4089
02:59:01,640 --> 02:59:04,520
So I, I went on a tram with my mom and she bought me ice cream.

4090
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:04,920
It was great.

4091
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:08,920
Are you talking about like the trolleys like you see at the beginning of the room?

4092
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:09,000
Yeah.

4093
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:09,320
Yeah.

4094
02:59:09,320 --> 02:59:09,480
Yeah.

4095
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:09,560
Yeah.

4096
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:10,040
Yeah.

4097
02:59:10,040 --> 02:59:10,280
Yeah.

4098
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:10,760
Yeah.

4099
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:11,160
It was cool.

4100
02:59:11,160 --> 02:59:12,600
Those seem, those seem pretty nice.

4101
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:13,480
And then we went skiing.

4102
02:59:13,480 --> 02:59:14,040
Seems like a nice thing.

4103
02:59:14,040 --> 02:59:15,480
Somewhere in Denver, I think.

4104
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:17,640
I hate skiing.

4105
02:59:17,640 --> 02:59:18,120
I like skiing.

4106
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:18,760
What a hassle.

4107
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:19,800
I was really bad at it.

4108
02:59:19,800 --> 02:59:21,240
I always hurt myself really badly.

4109
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:23,320
I almost beat up a cliff and died.

4110
02:59:23,320 --> 02:59:27,880
My, my cousin like, my cousin like went to the hospital one time that like we did

4111
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:29,320
went on like a family ski trip.

4112
02:59:29,320 --> 02:59:31,720
He like, I think he like plowed into a tree or something.

4113
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:31,960
I don't know.

4114
02:59:31,960 --> 02:59:33,560
He indeed, he had to go to the hospital.

4115
02:59:33,560 --> 02:59:34,200
He hit something.

4116
02:59:34,920 --> 02:59:36,840
I mean, I think he was fine, but uh.

4117
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:40,680
I landed in a tree well upside down and almost, I almost drowned in snow

4118
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:44,520
because snow was like sliding down my body because I was upside down in a tree well on a slope.

4119
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:48,280
And it was fucking gonna kill me and luckily some random man saved me.

4120
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:49,480
Jesus.

4121
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:51,720
What do you mean a tree well?

4122
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:55,880
A tree well is like, you know, when it snows and then like a tree, like around a tree,

4123
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:57,240
there's like a funnel of snow.

4124
02:59:57,240 --> 02:59:58,280
It doesn't settle as much.

4125
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:00,200
Oh, sure.

4126
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:04,040
It's like a, like a dip in and I fell into that like backwards upside down.

4127
03:00:04,040 --> 03:00:07,880
So my head was pointing down the slope and I was in a tree well and then like the snow was like,

4128
03:00:07,880 --> 03:00:09,320
like soft powdery.

4129
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:10,760
So it was like sliding down towards me.

4130
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:13,720
And I was only like a little, I had skis on.

4131
03:00:13,720 --> 03:00:14,680
So I couldn't fucking move.

4132
03:00:16,280 --> 03:00:19,240
I've never heard of such a thing happening.

4133
03:00:19,240 --> 03:00:24,520
No, every time I've almost injured myself or almost died, it's always like such a hyperspecific

4134
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:27,880
like stupid nonsense thing that takes like 10 minutes to explain.

4135
03:00:28,680 --> 03:00:37,000
Like fell into a big snow hole and the snow was too powdery and it just kept flowing in your face.

4136
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
You couldn't just like push it away from your face.

4137
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,520
Yeah, I was doing that, but I was getting tired.

4138
03:00:40,520 --> 03:00:44,600
I was there for like 10 minutes, 15 minutes, something like that.

4139
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:50,520
And just screaming because there was like an offshoot of the ski slope where you could

4140
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:54,360
like ski through the trees and like weave between them.

4141
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:58,920
And I fucked up because I was bad at skiing and I fell up because nobody was going through it

4142
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:01,960
apart from like the reckless kids looking for fun.

4143
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:04,520
And I was just screaming and like nobody could hear me.

4144
03:01:05,480 --> 03:01:05,800
Fuck.

4145
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:07,080
It was wild.

4146
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:07,880
It's horrifying.

4147
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:08,040
Yeah.

4148
03:01:09,080 --> 03:01:09,480
Oh well.

4149
03:01:11,480 --> 03:01:11,800
Boy.

4150
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:13,960
Wait, what was the...

4151
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:16,280
Oh, I don't like Virginia Beach.

4152
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,960
It's not walkable, so it sucks.

4153
03:01:19,960 --> 03:01:21,400
It is a tourist trap.

4154
03:01:21,400 --> 03:01:21,960
It sucks.

4155
03:01:22,760 --> 03:01:27,000
Trixie just like decides she likes something.

4156
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,080
She doesn't know anything, but she'll just be like...

4157
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:33,320
She'll talk about it like an authority, but like it's just all she knows.

4158
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:34,760
Like all she knew was Virginia Beach.

4159
03:01:34,760 --> 03:01:36,840
So she'd just be like, yeah, it's the best city.

4160
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:38,600
I've decided it's the best city.

4161
03:01:38,600 --> 03:01:41,960
And here are my reasons and lists the only things she knows about it.

4162
03:01:41,960 --> 03:01:42,520
I don't know.

4163
03:01:43,160 --> 03:01:43,960
It's on a beach.

4164
03:01:43,960 --> 03:01:45,000
It's probably got a Wendy's.

4165
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:45,720
It's probably all right.

4166
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:49,880
I guess if you like the beach, sure.

4167
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:52,360
Everything else sucks about it.

4168
03:01:53,400 --> 03:01:54,600
Mostly it's just not walkable.

4169
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:55,000
I'll take your word for it.

4170
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:55,800
Why would you live there?

4171
03:01:57,320 --> 03:01:57,800
Huh?

4172
03:01:57,800 --> 03:01:59,240
I'll take your word for it.

4173
03:01:59,240 --> 03:01:59,640
I don't know.

4174
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:00,920
There's no...

4175
03:02:01,720 --> 03:02:04,440
I mean, there were some light rail.

4176
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,400
There were some buses, but like not really.

4177
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:13,160
So, uh, Boston, you don't need to own a car, so it's perfect.

4178
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:13,560
Sure.

4179
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:14,120
One more.

4180
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:15,320
One more do you need?

4181
03:02:15,320 --> 03:02:15,640
Yeah.

4182
03:02:17,240 --> 03:02:19,640
Next one is called Yummy Yummy.

4183
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:22,120
Did I already posted it?

4184
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:22,360
Yeah.

4185
03:02:22,360 --> 03:02:23,960
Three, two, three, two, one, go.

4186
03:02:29,480 --> 03:02:30,600
It is the same guy.

4187
03:02:30,600 --> 03:02:32,120
They're all the same fucking guy.

4188
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:32,680
I told you.

4189
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:35,400
All right.

4190
03:02:35,400 --> 03:02:36,360
Cool.

4191
03:02:36,360 --> 03:02:39,560
Next one is not a voicemail.

4192
03:02:39,560 --> 03:02:42,120
It's a Twitter link.

4193
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:44,040
Oh, I saw this.

4194
03:02:44,040 --> 03:02:44,360
Yeah.

4195
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:47,480
I retweeted this on the endless war account.

4196
03:02:47,480 --> 03:02:49,240
That's a slime.

4197
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:54,360
It's a robot made of magnetic slime.

4198
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:56,760
I guess it's...

4199
03:02:58,520 --> 03:02:59,320
I don't know if...

4200
03:02:59,320 --> 03:03:00,040
I don't think...

4201
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:01,160
Okay.

4202
03:03:01,160 --> 03:03:04,440
I think that it does not actually like contain any like

4203
03:03:05,400 --> 03:03:07,160
circuitry or computers.

4204
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:09,720
I think it is controlled by external magnets.

4205
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:10,200
Exactly.

4206
03:03:10,200 --> 03:03:11,480
That's what I thought when I saw it.

4207
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:12,520
Yeah.

4208
03:03:12,520 --> 03:03:17,320
So it's this, but it's this slime that they use external magnets to manipulate into basically like

4209
03:03:18,280 --> 03:03:24,760
the idea is that it could like worm its way through your body and like remove foreign objects and stuff.

4210
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:28,680
So it's just this gross little slime monster.

4211
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:31,400
It's real.

4212
03:03:31,400 --> 03:03:33,400
And it looks, looks delicious.

4213
03:03:33,480 --> 03:03:37,560
It says in the video that like it needs to be tested to ensure...

4214
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:43,720
Like it's, it's like the, it's made of a material, like the metal it's made of is toxic.

4215
03:03:44,360 --> 03:03:50,680
It's coated with this material that prevents that like toxic metal from, you know, getting into your body.

4216
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:58,280
But like they need to test it to ensure that like it remains coated and it doesn't like leak the toxic stuff that's inside of it.

4217
03:03:59,080 --> 03:04:00,120
Is like why it's still...

4218
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:03,080
Good, yeah, it's pretty neat.

4219
03:04:03,080 --> 03:04:07,480
I think this is going to be one of those things that just doesn't ever happen, you know what I mean?

4220
03:04:08,360 --> 03:04:12,440
I, I don't see it ever like becoming like widespread.

4221
03:04:12,440 --> 03:04:12,920
Yeah.

4222
03:04:15,880 --> 03:04:19,960
Yeah, but it's pretty, but it's neat, but it's neat for sure.

4223
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:20,600
It's funny.

4224
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:22,120
It's green.

4225
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:23,320
It's green slime as well.

4226
03:04:23,320 --> 03:04:24,280
It's a little bit green.

4227
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:24,840
You've got to address it.

4228
03:04:24,840 --> 03:04:25,480
Yeah, it's greenish.

4229
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:29,240
I, I, I retweeted it on the endless work.

4230
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:31,800
What more do you want from me?

4231
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,720
The community, no, the community has been made aware.

4232
03:04:37,800 --> 03:04:43,320
The next one is called God She Is Still Making Videos Help at gmail.com.

4233
03:04:43,320 --> 03:04:48,120
And it's a link to one of these Trixie videos that's got like 4k views.

4234
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:52,760
Yeah, as I mentioned, she just, she'll just keep putting them out, I guess.

4235
03:04:53,720 --> 03:04:54,120
Sure.

4236
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:57,640
I, I guess, do you think she'll give up eventually?

4237
03:04:57,720 --> 03:04:59,560
Will she just be like, it's just not working?

4238
03:04:59,560 --> 03:05:01,320
I don't think she has any other options.

4239
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:02,440
I think she'll just stick with it.

4240
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:04,040
What little she can.

4241
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:05,880
Yeah, I think so.

4242
03:05:06,520 --> 03:05:08,120
I think, yeah, I think, I think.

4243
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:14,760
For the foreseeable future, it would probably just be living off of the Patreon, like losers.

4244
03:05:15,880 --> 03:05:20,280
And whatever, whatever real job Bird has, if he still has one, I don't remember.

4245
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:23,240
He used to have a job driving.

4246
03:05:23,240 --> 03:05:25,080
I don't know if he has one now.

4247
03:05:25,080 --> 03:05:26,120
Yeah, yeah.

4248
03:05:26,920 --> 03:05:32,920
Probably Bird will just pay for stuff and then Patreon will pay for stuff and she'll,

4249
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:33,640
yeah, you're right.

4250
03:05:33,640 --> 03:05:35,240
Like what else, what else is she gonna do?

4251
03:05:35,240 --> 03:05:36,440
She's got nothing else to do.

4252
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:37,880
Are they living in someone else's place?

4253
03:05:37,880 --> 03:05:38,520
I don't remember.

4254
03:05:39,320 --> 03:05:40,360
I don't know.

4255
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:42,120
I know that they're living in Virginia Beach.

4256
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:50,600
I am not sure if they're, I know they, I know they've historically mooched off of people.

4257
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:51,320
Yeah.

4258
03:05:51,320 --> 03:05:54,680
But as of now, I'm not sure if that's, if that's the case.

4259
03:05:54,680 --> 03:05:55,240
Whatever.

4260
03:05:55,240 --> 03:06:00,920
I mean, if Bird has a job and she makes like, and she's still making Patreon money from people

4261
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:06,520
that just have not checked their Patreon account in like four years, I think they could afford a,

4262
03:06:06,520 --> 03:06:09,800
they could afford some place in Virginia.

4263
03:06:09,800 --> 03:06:10,120
Yeah.

4264
03:06:10,920 --> 03:06:12,840
So I, but I don't know.

4265
03:06:14,360 --> 03:06:16,280
I don't think she should stop anytime soon.

4266
03:06:17,240 --> 03:06:18,280
Yeah, you're right.

4267
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:19,560
She's got nothing else to be doing.

4268
03:06:19,560 --> 03:06:19,880
Yeah.

4269
03:06:21,240 --> 03:06:22,280
Human content machine.

4270
03:06:22,920 --> 03:06:24,360
The human content machine.

4271
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:27,400
No, DigiPro is dead.

4272
03:06:27,400 --> 03:06:28,680
The DigiChannel is dead.

4273
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:30,440
This is, this is a rap studio now.

4274
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:34,680
YigStudio, it's going to be, we're going to be featuring like local musicians.

4275
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:38,920
We're going to be on tour around the country, featuring rap artists.

4276
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:40,280
We're going to be doing interviews.

4277
03:06:41,960 --> 03:06:43,240
We have an anime in production.

4278
03:06:43,240 --> 03:06:45,000
We're making an original anime, Simsie.

4279
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4280
03:06:46,280 --> 03:06:50,360
Actually, we're going to put those on Branches of Yig, which is another channel, by the way.

4281
03:06:50,360 --> 03:06:51,080
Okay, okay, okay.

4282
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:51,800
Yeah, those didn't work.

4283
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:54,520
Those are going on Branches, but we're still making an anime.

4284
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:58,280
Okay, and we're still the, we're still going to have, we still, we,

4285
03:06:58,280 --> 03:06:59,560
we got the colored thumbnails, right?

4286
03:06:59,560 --> 03:07:01,720
Oh, we, we, we're going to have, we're going to, we're still going to have music

4287
03:07:01,720 --> 03:07:03,800
movies and cartoon movies and movie movies.

4288
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:06,280
I say we give up, we give up with the color thumbnails for now.

4289
03:07:06,280 --> 03:07:08,680
Oh, how about a music review show?

4290
03:07:09,560 --> 03:07:10,120
Okay.

4291
03:07:10,120 --> 03:07:10,600
Okay.

4292
03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:11,320
Yeah.

4293
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:15,640
But, oh, we got to put that on a different channel.

4294
03:07:15,640 --> 03:07:17,080
We got to put that on the other channel.

4295
03:07:17,080 --> 03:07:17,240
That's fine.

4296
03:07:17,240 --> 03:07:17,480
Okay.

4297
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:18,360
Okay.

4298
03:07:18,360 --> 03:07:19,080
So what are we left with?

4299
03:07:19,640 --> 03:07:21,160
Oh, anime reviews.

4300
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:22,440
Anime on Yig Studio.

4301
03:07:22,440 --> 03:07:22,920
Yeah.

4302
03:07:22,920 --> 03:07:23,720
And then.

4303
03:07:23,720 --> 03:07:24,280
Okay.

4304
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:25,400
But it's, okay.

4305
03:07:25,400 --> 03:07:25,880
All right.

4306
03:07:25,880 --> 03:07:26,920
This is the Yig Studio.

4307
03:07:26,920 --> 03:07:31,000
Yig Studio is now guys, guys, drumroll please.

4308
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:35,080
Yig Studio, I am announcing that as of now I'm deleting all my old content, right?

4309
03:07:35,080 --> 03:07:37,400
All, I've got three weeks in three weeks.

4310
03:07:37,400 --> 03:07:38,600
I'm deleting all my old content.

4311
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:39,560
It's going to be gone forever.

4312
03:07:40,840 --> 03:07:45,720
All my Yig content, I'm going to, instead, I'm going to be re-uploading all those old

4313
03:07:45,720 --> 03:07:47,400
Digi videos that I said I was getting rid of.

4314
03:07:47,400 --> 03:07:48,040
They're all back.

4315
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:51,240
And Yig Studio is now drumroll please.

4316
03:07:52,360 --> 03:07:53,640
An anime review channel.

4317
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:55,000
We're rebranding, boys.

4318
03:07:55,880 --> 03:07:56,360
God bless.

4319
03:07:56,360 --> 03:07:57,320
We're going for it.

4320
03:07:58,360 --> 03:07:59,080
We can make it.

4321
03:07:59,080 --> 03:07:59,800
I don't know.

4322
03:07:59,800 --> 03:08:00,840
I don't know if it's going to work out.

4323
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:03,320
You know, I'm taking a big bold step into the unknown.

4324
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:04,760
We have remembered, hey, everybody.

4325
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:05,640
We have remembered, hey.

4326
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:14,120
But I believe in my, I believe that with God at my side, with the power of God and

4327
03:08:14,120 --> 03:08:15,880
anime on my side, we shall prevail.

4328
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:17,800
Hey, Trixie, review this.

4329
03:08:17,800 --> 03:08:18,840
Put some middle finger.

4330
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:20,360
Hey, yeah.

4331
03:08:21,480 --> 03:08:22,120
Yeah.

4332
03:08:22,120 --> 03:08:23,000
Let there be carnage, bro.

4333
03:08:23,320 --> 03:08:23,720
Carnage, bro.

4334
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:27,960
Next video.

4335
03:08:27,960 --> 03:08:28,840
I mean, YouTube.

4336
03:08:28,840 --> 03:08:30,360
I mean, next YouTube video.

4337
03:08:30,360 --> 03:08:32,520
Next YouTube link that we're not going to fucking watch and just talk about.

4338
03:08:33,400 --> 03:08:33,880
No.

4339
03:08:33,880 --> 03:08:37,480
It's, it's, it's called what?

4340
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:39,400
It's short.

4341
03:08:40,360 --> 03:08:41,480
Thank God.

4342
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:42,600
Here it is.

4343
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:43,800
Three, two, one, go.

4344
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:46,840
Looks like you're treating a cancel again.

4345
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:51,720
Whatever you say, buddy.

4346
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:53,080
Yeah.

4347
03:08:53,080 --> 03:08:54,120
True, true.

4348
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,920
Next one is called, it's just text.

4349
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:59,240
It says, Ben, you should do a lecture on T-Bap.

4350
03:09:00,600 --> 03:09:06,360
Unironically, I think a lecture on phantom horn slash T-Bap is not a bad idea.

4351
03:09:06,360 --> 03:09:07,000
And I might do.

4352
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,160
I think I've had this idea before.

4353
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:09,640
Yeah.

4354
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:14,760
Either a lecture or maybe just a video explaining it.

4355
03:09:14,760 --> 03:09:16,200
Somebody has to explain it.

4356
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:17,960
And nobody's going to do it if it's not me.

4357
03:09:18,920 --> 03:09:20,920
Um, so yeah, I agree.

4358
03:09:21,480 --> 03:09:23,800
I agree with this, uh, yeah.

4359
03:09:25,960 --> 03:09:26,520
Cause I mean.

4360
03:09:26,520 --> 03:09:29,240
At ride code five, we're announcing it here ladies and folks.

4361
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:35,480
I mean, you know, much the idea behind the lectures is that like the best sort of lecture

4362
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:40,680
is explaining a piece of media that is inaccessible for one reason or another.

4363
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:44,920
What's more inaccessible than T-Bap slash slime and punishment?

4364
03:09:44,920 --> 03:09:45,320
Nothing.

4365
03:09:46,120 --> 03:09:50,360
Uh, it's, it's the most inaccessible thing I knew how to make.

4366
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:52,920
So, so it's great lecture fodder, perhaps.

4367
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:54,920
Tell you.

4368
03:09:54,920 --> 03:09:55,560
Next one.

4369
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:55,960
Do it.

4370
03:09:55,960 --> 03:09:56,520
Do it now.

4371
03:09:57,640 --> 03:09:57,880
Okay.

4372
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:06,440
Well, the, well, no, no, no, no, no, I would just, I would just read out the, the story so far

4373
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:11,880
on the itch page of phantom, phantom explaining how he was just a mild mannered

4374
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:18,680
somepony with a, with a YouTube channel until, until an inciting incident occurred

4375
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:21,240
and she, and turned his world upside down.

4376
03:10:21,240 --> 03:10:23,080
Act one of the narrative began.

4377
03:10:23,720 --> 03:10:24,440
That's correct.

4378
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:28,840
Uh, closing in on 400 downloads.

4379
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:29,720
That's cool.

4380
03:10:29,720 --> 03:10:30,360
That's cool.

4381
03:10:31,160 --> 03:10:34,040
Or I think I'm at like 360 or something.

4382
03:10:34,040 --> 03:10:39,000
Once I've read Lord of Ghosts, next up is slime and punishment and then the game.

4383
03:10:39,800 --> 03:10:42,520
Oh, oh, I did, um, I did a poll.

4384
03:10:43,240 --> 03:10:44,840
I did a poll on Twitter.

4385
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:51,240
I don't know if you saw, but, um, I asked people like what they're like, how, like,

4386
03:10:51,240 --> 03:10:54,200
whether they've played phantom's revenge and stuff.

4387
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:58,920
The, the results were about 15% have played it and beaten it.

4388
03:10:58,920 --> 03:11:01,720
Another 15% have played it and not beaten it.

4389
03:11:02,360 --> 03:11:05,080
Uh, almost 50% haven't played it yet.

4390
03:11:05,880 --> 03:11:07,960
Uh, but if that's, okay.

4391
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:11,640
But implying that they will play it or they intend to play it.

4392
03:11:11,640 --> 03:11:15,720
And then another 20% said they either aren't going to play it or they can't.

4393
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:19,800
I assume some of those are just like, they can't play it because they don't have like a Windows

4394
03:11:19,800 --> 03:11:20,280
computer.

4395
03:11:21,320 --> 03:11:25,320
Uh, so some of those would hopefully play it because I'm planning on, on making, um,

4396
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:33,480
I'm trying to pay a guy on Fiverr to, uh, to fix it for HTML and hopefully Mac, maybe Android.

4397
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:35,000
Uh, I'm going to put it.

4398
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:35,320
Yeah.

4399
03:11:35,320 --> 03:11:36,280
I don't want to do it myself.

4400
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:37,080
I don't want to do that.

4401
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:37,320
Yeah.

4402
03:11:37,320 --> 03:11:40,200
I'm just going to, I'm going to try and get a guy and just do it for me.

4403
03:11:40,920 --> 03:11:48,520
Uh, Matt, ideally I would get it on, um, working on Mac and Linux and Android and

4404
03:11:49,480 --> 03:11:50,360
in HTML.

4405
03:11:50,360 --> 03:11:53,320
HTML is the most important because that's how I've calculated.

4406
03:11:54,440 --> 03:11:54,760
Yeah.

4407
03:11:54,760 --> 03:12:00,200
On a TI 83 and switch on a black, on a blackberry, uh, get it on switch.

4408
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:01,880
Obviously, obviously he's got it.

4409
03:12:01,880 --> 03:12:04,360
Everybody who plays fantasy event says this should be on switch.

4410
03:12:04,360 --> 03:12:05,400
Why isn't this on switch?

4411
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:05,720
Yeah.

4412
03:12:08,920 --> 03:12:09,480
All right.

4413
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:11,720
We are getting, we're like more than halfway through.

4414
03:12:11,720 --> 03:12:12,280
Okay, sweet.

4415
03:12:12,840 --> 03:12:14,840
We're probably, we're probably about halfway through.

4416
03:12:15,400 --> 03:12:17,240
Well, half of them are going to be the same guy, so it's fine.

4417
03:12:17,960 --> 03:12:18,840
Probably.

4418
03:12:18,840 --> 03:12:23,080
Next one is, uh, let me find my place here again.

4419
03:12:23,160 --> 03:12:40,280
It's called Masha Tick, Tick, Tick, Tick, Venova three, two, one, go.

4420
03:12:40,280 --> 03:12:42,280
Is this, is this in Russian?

4421
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:44,280
I do not know.

4422
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:46,280
Oh.

4423
03:12:46,280 --> 03:12:53,000
Is that your baby in the background?

4424
03:12:53,560 --> 03:12:58,920
No, that's not the voicemail.

4425
03:13:07,960 --> 03:13:12,920
I feel a jump scare coming.

4426
03:13:13,160 --> 03:13:17,080
You won't take when saying they aren't real.

4427
03:13:17,080 --> 03:13:21,400
They were real, but they left after trips left.

4428
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:24,200
Oh, I can't follow it.

4429
03:13:24,840 --> 03:13:29,480
I, I feel like I could understand it if I really focused, but I just,

4430
03:13:32,200 --> 03:13:32,920
I just can't.

4431
03:13:32,920 --> 03:13:34,120
I just can't pay attention.

4432
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,480
Somebody transcribe that, put it in the comments.

4433
03:13:37,480 --> 03:13:38,520
It's too annoying.

4434
03:13:39,080 --> 03:13:45,000
It hasn't, why does it have intentional background?

4435
03:13:46,040 --> 03:13:47,000
To make it feel real.

4436
03:13:49,240 --> 03:13:49,640
That was surreal.

4437
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:50,600
What the fuck was that?

4438
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:55,160
There was like a concept going on there.

4439
03:13:55,160 --> 03:13:56,280
Good voicemail.

4440
03:13:56,280 --> 03:14:00,360
And it just totally failed, just completely failed at whatever it was trying to do.

4441
03:14:00,360 --> 03:14:04,680
There was a cat that got shot by a Gatling gun, and that's all I could really tell.

4442
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:05,480
And they said Ben saying.

4443
03:14:06,360 --> 03:14:11,800
There was work put into that voicemail to absolutely no end whatsoever.

4444
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:17,320
Next one is called, where am I?

4445
03:14:17,320 --> 03:14:17,960
Where am I?

4446
03:14:20,600 --> 03:14:21,560
Oh God.

4447
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:23,480
Well, there's an image to go along with it.

4448
03:14:24,360 --> 03:14:27,720
Here's, here's the image.

4449
03:14:30,920 --> 03:14:33,000
Okay, this time, this time listen to the voicemail.

4450
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:34,360
He says, listen to the voicemail first.

4451
03:14:34,360 --> 03:14:34,680
Okay.

4452
03:14:35,400 --> 03:14:36,920
Oh God, I got a couple of L's.

4453
03:14:37,560 --> 03:14:38,360
Here's a voicemail.

4454
03:14:38,360 --> 03:14:39,880
Okay, three, two, one, go.

4455
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:45,800
So, you were wondering why it is better to have nothing in the code affect anything else.

4456
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:50,520
Same reason, you want to have different colors on different layers when drawing.

4457
03:14:51,240 --> 03:14:54,520
To have control in case something doesn't work out as planned.

4458
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:57,320
Yeah, I looked up tight coupling and I understood.

4459
03:14:57,320 --> 03:14:59,880
To fix one bug doesn't snowball into a bunch of other bugs.

4460
03:15:00,600 --> 03:15:02,440
Expect trouble to prevent trouble.

4461
03:15:03,320 --> 03:15:04,360
Speaking of trouble.

4462
03:15:04,680 --> 03:15:07,640
It seems Twilight Sparkle voice finally died.

4463
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:10,440
I am unbelievably sad, yet you can't even hear it.

4464
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:14,200
I guess I will just have to create my own deep fake.

4465
03:15:14,200 --> 03:15:15,720
Um, who should I pick?

4466
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:19,320
Someone with bright and emotional voice, yet thoughtful and competent.

4467
03:15:20,200 --> 03:15:22,600
Oh, I think I know just a person.

4468
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:24,440
Just listen to their voice.

4469
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:25,480
Music to my ears.

4470
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:27,560
Hey folks, how's it going?

4471
03:15:27,560 --> 03:15:31,320
Today I am talking about the newest film from Pixar called,

4472
03:15:31,560 --> 03:15:32,760
Turning Man.

4473
03:15:32,760 --> 03:15:34,600
Yes, this is perfect.

4474
03:15:34,600 --> 03:15:36,360
From here on out, call me.

4475
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:37,960
Liquid, Saber Spark.

4476
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:40,040
Ah, okay, I see.

4477
03:15:40,040 --> 03:15:41,320
Okay, I see now.

4478
03:15:41,320 --> 03:15:41,960
That was a lot though.

4479
03:15:41,960 --> 03:15:43,800
Yeah, it came together.

4480
03:15:43,800 --> 03:15:47,080
The image is Liquid Saber Spark.

4481
03:15:47,080 --> 03:15:47,640
And it says.

4482
03:15:47,640 --> 03:15:48,920
Wear shades.

4483
03:15:48,920 --> 03:15:49,640
Yes, bitches.

4484
03:15:49,640 --> 03:15:50,280
Yes, bitches.

4485
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:51,800
Wear shades in the dark.

4486
03:15:51,800 --> 03:15:54,760
Trench coat, naked body in Alaska.

4487
03:15:54,760 --> 03:15:55,800
You are a loser.

4488
03:15:56,840 --> 03:15:59,240
Doesn't wear a mask, doesn't need to breathe.

4489
03:15:59,720 --> 03:16:01,640
Hairs are literal, sun, plasma.

4490
03:16:03,160 --> 03:16:03,640
Okay.

4491
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:05,480
Liquid, sure.

4492
03:16:07,640 --> 03:16:09,320
I hate Saber Spark's cadence.

4493
03:16:11,240 --> 03:16:15,000
Honestly, I don't like it, but I don't, I don't,

4494
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,080
I don't honestly feel that strongly about it.

4495
03:16:17,080 --> 03:16:19,960
This is the strangest movie I've ever seen.

4496
03:16:20,680 --> 03:16:23,160
All YouTubers sound like, well, not all of them.

4497
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:25,480
All bad YouTubers sound like that.

4498
03:16:29,240 --> 03:16:32,920
Okay, next one is called, Biden weighs in on the

4499
03:16:32,920 --> 03:16:34,280
trans-racial question.

4500
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:34,760
Yes.

4501
03:16:34,760 --> 03:16:36,840
Three, three, two, finally.

4502
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:38,200
Three, two, one, go.

4503
03:16:39,720 --> 03:16:40,440
Look, fat.

4504
03:16:40,440 --> 03:16:43,080
Transmortialism is ridiculous, believed me.

4505
03:16:43,080 --> 03:16:45,880
Raises the social construct arbitrarily categorizing

4506
03:16:45,880 --> 03:16:46,920
certain verbal things.

4507
03:16:46,920 --> 03:16:47,480
Weak sex.

4508
03:16:47,480 --> 03:16:50,120
And now social construct degrades new arbitrary categories

4509
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:51,560
on a thinner gender.

4510
03:16:51,560 --> 03:16:52,920
Senior truth of blackness.

4511
03:16:52,920 --> 03:16:54,040
It's like, senior trends, amen.

4512
03:16:55,160 --> 03:16:56,120
Thanks, Biden.

4513
03:16:56,120 --> 03:16:57,400
Thanks, thanks for waiting.

4514
03:16:57,400 --> 03:16:58,400
Ben.

4515
03:16:58,400 --> 03:17:04,600
Thanks, Biden, for being against all those fucking psycho bills they're trying to pass

4516
03:17:04,600 --> 03:17:05,600
right now.

4517
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:06,600
I appreciate it.

4518
03:17:06,600 --> 03:17:09,720
He said, look fat, which is the one thing I know about Biden is that he said that.

4519
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:10,720
Look fat.

4520
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:13,680
Yes, it's the one thing I know.

4521
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:18,120
Well, he hates British people.

4522
03:17:18,120 --> 03:17:19,120
Yes.

4523
03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:20,120
Thank God.

4524
03:17:20,120 --> 03:17:21,120
Yeah.

4525
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:22,120
Woo.

4526
03:17:22,120 --> 03:17:23,120
He's Irish.

4527
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:24,120
Genuinely same.

4528
03:17:24,120 --> 03:17:27,000
He doesn't like what's going on with you guys.

4529
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,000
No.

4530
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:29,000
No.

4531
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:37,280
I wonder if that's why he's being a little, he's being a little cool about trans stuff

4532
03:17:37,280 --> 03:17:38,280
right now.

4533
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:42,520
It's just because he hates GK rallying so much because she's British.

4534
03:17:42,520 --> 03:17:44,000
I clout.

4535
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,400
Thank God.

4536
03:17:46,400 --> 03:17:48,360
Thank God.

4537
03:17:48,360 --> 03:17:51,960
Next one is Ben's weekly reminder play Delta Rune chapter two.

4538
03:17:51,960 --> 03:17:53,920
I will one of these days.

4539
03:17:53,920 --> 03:17:54,920
You've done one piece.

4540
03:17:54,920 --> 03:17:55,920
Now you have to do Delta Rune.

4541
03:17:56,040 --> 03:17:57,040
I did one.

4542
03:17:57,040 --> 03:17:58,040
Yeah.

4543
03:17:58,040 --> 03:17:59,040
I can only do so much.

4544
03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:01,560
I read one piece, which is the hardest thing in the world.

4545
03:18:01,560 --> 03:18:03,960
It sucks and it's been ruined.

4546
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:06,040
It sucks and it's bad.

4547
03:18:06,040 --> 03:18:07,760
And Luffy, it's not it.

4548
03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:08,760
What do you mean?

4549
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:09,760
What do you mean?

4550
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:11,240
It wasn't the Gomu Gomu No Mi.

4551
03:18:11,240 --> 03:18:14,560
I was only reading it because I thought it was rubber.

4552
03:18:14,560 --> 03:18:15,560
Now everything's different.

4553
03:18:15,560 --> 03:18:17,560
Oh, now you hack.

4554
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:19,560
You've ruined the story.

4555
03:18:19,560 --> 03:18:20,640
Oh, do you hack?

4556
03:18:20,640 --> 03:18:22,640
I was reading for the rubber.

4557
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:24,640
You took it from me.

4558
03:18:25,360 --> 03:18:30,240
Ben, you're turning it to your brother.

4559
03:18:30,240 --> 03:18:36,120
If he wasn't made of rubber, then why couldn't Enel shock him with the lightning fruit?

4560
03:18:36,120 --> 03:18:37,120
Oh, no.

4561
03:18:37,120 --> 03:18:38,120
What do you mean?

4562
03:18:38,120 --> 03:18:39,120
He's a son.

4563
03:18:39,120 --> 03:18:40,120
What?

4564
03:18:40,120 --> 03:18:41,120
Get it.

4565
03:18:41,120 --> 03:18:42,120
Get it.

4566
03:18:42,120 --> 03:18:43,120
Get it.

4567
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:44,120
Sure.

4568
03:18:44,120 --> 03:18:47,120
That's every talking parts stream, by the way.

4569
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:49,120
Is that right?

4570
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:50,120
Yeah.

4571
03:18:50,120 --> 03:18:52,520
I have not seen any of it.

4572
03:18:52,520 --> 03:18:56,440
I just have heard that Nate does not like goofy Luffy.

4573
03:18:56,440 --> 03:18:58,440
He does not.

4574
03:18:58,440 --> 03:18:59,440
Why?

4575
03:18:59,440 --> 03:19:00,440
He's not keen.

4576
03:19:00,440 --> 03:19:02,960
Just the destiny shit, really.

4577
03:19:02,960 --> 03:19:04,120
Just the destiny shit?

4578
03:19:04,120 --> 03:19:05,120
I mean, sure.

4579
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:06,120
I don't like that.

4580
03:19:06,120 --> 03:19:07,120
I don't love that either.

4581
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:08,120
Yeah.

4582
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:09,120
I don't love that either.

4583
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:10,120
It's just this is...

4584
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:11,120
There's so many...

4585
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:13,120
This is such like just one more in a long line.

4586
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:16,120
There's so much more to life than you could have been.

4587
03:19:16,120 --> 03:19:20,920
There's just one more thing in a long line of things where I've been like, oh, so they've

4588
03:19:20,920 --> 03:19:23,040
got a special destiny, huh?

4589
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:25,520
Well, all right.

4590
03:19:25,520 --> 03:19:27,520
Next chapter.

4591
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:34,840
A thousand chapters later.

4592
03:19:34,840 --> 03:19:41,080
Me reading chapter like 200 or being like, wait, so Shanks was one of the four emperors

4593
03:19:41,080 --> 03:19:42,080
the whole time?

4594
03:19:42,080 --> 03:19:45,120
Oh, Luffy had a special destiny this whole fucking time.

4595
03:19:45,120 --> 03:19:49,320
He knew one of the four most important people in the world?

4596
03:19:49,320 --> 03:19:54,280
Honestly, honestly, yeah, even that, even that, it's like, oh, so Shanks.

4597
03:19:54,280 --> 03:19:56,720
His brother was the son of Gold Roger?

4598
03:19:56,720 --> 03:19:57,720
What the?

4599
03:19:57,720 --> 03:19:58,720
That's...

4600
03:19:58,720 --> 03:19:59,720
That sucks.

4601
03:19:59,720 --> 03:20:01,960
Oh, genuinely, yeah, that does suck.

4602
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:05,360
Honestly, yeah, finding out Shanks was like this really important guy instead of just

4603
03:20:05,360 --> 03:20:07,560
like a cool dude that he knew when he was a kid.

4604
03:20:07,560 --> 03:20:14,040
It's like, boo, boo, boo, genuinely, I don't like it, but like that ship has sailed, no

4605
03:20:14,040 --> 03:20:15,040
pun intended.

4606
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:20,600
Dad is the leader of the Revolutionary Army and he has like no lines of dialogue in the

4607
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:23,360
entire series.

4608
03:20:23,360 --> 03:20:24,360
He's got no what?

4609
03:20:24,360 --> 03:20:25,720
He's got like no lines of dialogue.

4610
03:20:25,720 --> 03:20:28,640
Dragon doesn't do fucking anything.

4611
03:20:28,640 --> 03:20:29,640
Has he?

4612
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:31,960
Yeah, he's spoken like once, yeah, I think.

4613
03:20:31,960 --> 03:20:36,200
I'm sure we'll see him, but like whatever, it's fucking funny.

4614
03:20:36,200 --> 03:20:41,640
He'll hug his baby boy and explain the law to him.

4615
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:43,880
He will probably, yeah, I think so.

4616
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:48,000
I think that's probably right.

4617
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:51,960
The Revolutionary Army must be a pretty big fan of Joy Boy.

4618
03:20:51,960 --> 03:20:52,960
Yeah, sure.

4619
03:20:52,960 --> 03:20:54,400
That's kind of good.

4620
03:20:54,400 --> 03:21:00,360
That's probably going to work out well for them, I guess.

4621
03:21:00,360 --> 03:21:01,360
Whatever.

4622
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:02,360
Whatever, yeah.

4623
03:21:02,360 --> 03:21:05,640
I'll just consume product and then wait patiently for next product.

4624
03:21:05,640 --> 03:21:12,160
I don't want to think about it, I just want to see it and go, mmm.

4625
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:15,520
I remembered love, so I like Nika now.

4626
03:21:15,520 --> 03:21:16,520
That's right, that's right.

4627
03:21:16,520 --> 03:21:17,520
I remembered love.

4628
03:21:17,520 --> 03:21:18,640
Nate just has to remember love.

4629
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:19,720
He does.

4630
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:23,120
Like me.

4631
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:28,920
Next voicemail is called Tom Part Two, three, two, one, go.

4632
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:35,520
Okay, I got an idea of what Tom's actually doing in Virginia.

4633
03:21:35,520 --> 03:21:41,480
He's there to start the Lazy Guy's podcast, in other words, the new PCP.

4634
03:21:41,480 --> 03:21:45,040
Just in spite of you, Ben, he's going to invite Gibb to it, he's going to bring Jesse

4635
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:50,200
back, Taboo's coming back, what's his name, Mother's Basement's coming back, aw yeah.

4636
03:21:50,200 --> 03:21:52,840
Why is it called the Lazy Guy's podcast then?

4637
03:21:52,840 --> 03:21:54,360
Because they don't make any things.

4638
03:21:54,360 --> 03:21:55,360
Jeff is a hustler.

4639
03:21:55,360 --> 03:21:56,360
Jeff is a hustler.

4640
03:21:56,360 --> 03:21:57,360
Oh yeah, Jeff is a hustler.

4641
03:21:57,360 --> 03:21:58,360
He can't be on.

4642
03:21:58,360 --> 03:21:59,360
Yeah, I don't know.

4643
03:21:59,360 --> 03:22:00,360
I don't know about that.

4644
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:02,840
Gibb can't be on either.

4645
03:22:02,840 --> 03:22:08,320
Gibb is also, wait, why would you move to Virginia to start a podcast with Gibb?

4646
03:22:08,320 --> 03:22:09,320
Yeah, what?

4647
03:22:09,320 --> 03:22:16,800
I don't think you thought this voice mail through Ding Dong or whatever your name is.

4648
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:23,120
Next one, silly boy, silly lads, who's the Lazy Boy now, huh?

4649
03:22:23,120 --> 03:22:31,680
Next one is called Message to Mr Slim Time, three, two, one, go.

4650
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:35,280
Hey, to the guy, the slime time guy.

4651
03:22:35,280 --> 03:22:36,280
Prince.

4652
03:22:36,400 --> 03:22:41,520
I don't know, you're down to my trap sucker.

4653
03:22:41,520 --> 03:22:42,520
Fuck off.

4654
03:22:42,520 --> 03:22:44,520
Well, honestly, I'm thinking voice jail.

4655
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:45,520
Yeah.

4656
03:22:45,520 --> 03:22:46,520
What was that?

4657
03:22:46,520 --> 03:22:47,520
What are you talking about?

4658
03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:53,560
Shut the fuck up, I'm done, I've had enough, I'm up to my fucking eyeballs.

4659
03:22:53,560 --> 03:22:57,360
I'm over it, he's a total loser, get rid of.

4660
03:22:57,360 --> 03:22:59,400
That was good.

4661
03:22:59,400 --> 03:23:02,160
Take him out.

4662
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:07,080
Even the, Merry Christmas, what is it like, Merry Christmas to everyone, yes, even the

4663
03:23:07,080 --> 03:23:08,560
losers and haters.

4664
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:13,760
I like what he called that guy a proven loser, that's a good phrase.

4665
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:15,160
Who did he call a proven loser?

4666
03:23:15,160 --> 03:23:19,280
I have no idea who called it, but he says like, he's a loser, he's a proven loser.

4667
03:23:19,280 --> 03:23:25,160
That's a good, that's a good thing to call someone who loses all the time.

4668
03:23:25,160 --> 03:23:26,160
A proven loser.

4669
03:23:26,160 --> 03:23:28,000
It's the next one just a drill tweet.

4670
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,600
Yeah, the next one is just a drill tweet.

4671
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:35,360
I have, oh, I see, oh no, no, no, there's a caption.

4672
03:23:35,360 --> 03:23:42,280
It's called YIG colon, and then the drill tweet, oh, I get it, I get it, yeah.

4673
03:23:42,280 --> 03:23:48,280
So it's like, this is, this is, this is the, the rebrand to YIG.

4674
03:23:48,280 --> 03:23:54,680
It's as though Trixie said, so long suckers, I rev up my motor, motor slice and create a

4675
03:23:54,680 --> 03:24:01,120
huge cloud of smoke when the cloud dissipates, I'm lying completely dead on the floor.

4676
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:03,120
This is one of my favorite drill tweets.

4677
03:24:03,120 --> 03:24:04,120
I love this one.

4678
03:24:04,120 --> 03:24:05,120
Solid.

4679
03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:06,120
Yeah.

4680
03:24:06,120 --> 03:24:07,120
I'm keen.

4681
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:08,120
I like it.

4682
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:09,120
Yeah.

4683
03:24:09,120 --> 03:24:10,120
Okay, it works.

4684
03:24:10,120 --> 03:24:22,440
Next one is, next one is called Autism Speaks She-Her, she slash her, okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

4685
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:33,440
Trixie, from my amusement, tell me your deepest, darkest trauma, or simply flounder, lamal.

4686
03:24:33,440 --> 03:24:38,040
I'll just flounder, thanks.

4687
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:48,200
One time, I pooped my pants at school, and everyone laughed at me, the first day of primary

4688
03:24:48,200 --> 03:24:51,880
school, a bee flew in my ear and stung me inside of my ear and I've always been terrified

4689
03:24:52,320 --> 03:24:55,320
of bees and wasps, like horribly, because of that.

4690
03:24:55,320 --> 03:24:57,320
I would also be terrified.

4691
03:24:57,320 --> 03:25:04,120
And also school, because that happened on my first day of primary school.

4692
03:25:04,120 --> 03:25:05,120
Jeez.

4693
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:10,000
I'm trying to think, is there anything that I'm afraid of because something bad happened

4694
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:11,000
with them?

4695
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:14,080
No, nothing bad's ever happened to me.

4696
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:15,080
Sorry.

4697
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:19,360
Yeah, I'm kind of a cool guy like that, nothing bad ever happens to me, you know.

4698
03:25:19,360 --> 03:25:20,840
I guess you're just a proven loser.

4699
03:25:20,960 --> 03:25:24,560
I guess you just took the L with that B, you little child.

4700
03:25:24,560 --> 03:25:26,560
I suppose so.

4701
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:30,280
Yeah, that happens, I guess.

4702
03:25:30,280 --> 03:25:41,160
Next one is called, oh, here we go, The Ben St. Dream, from hardpissaprilatdustydumps.com.

4703
03:25:41,160 --> 03:25:42,160
Good name.

4704
03:25:42,160 --> 03:25:44,960
3, 3, 2, 1, go.

4705
03:25:44,960 --> 03:25:49,760
I had a dream that Ben St. bullied me over my tiny Tokyo apartment.

4706
03:25:49,800 --> 03:25:51,280
Why would he do such a thing?

4707
03:25:51,280 --> 03:25:54,600
Because you're a bitch, because you're a proven loser.

4708
03:25:54,600 --> 03:25:56,960
Because it's small and that sucks.

4709
03:25:56,960 --> 03:25:58,960
Nice tiny apartment, nerd.

4710
03:25:58,960 --> 03:26:01,960
How many tatami mats he got in here, like four and a half?

4711
03:26:01,960 --> 03:26:03,960
You fucking biatch.

4712
03:26:03,960 --> 03:26:06,760
Why don't you commit harakiri?

4713
03:26:06,760 --> 03:26:08,760
Oh, boom.

4714
03:26:13,760 --> 03:26:17,360
Which means hurting yourself in Japanese.

4715
03:26:17,360 --> 03:26:24,360
This is the guy who does the songs and stuff.

4716
03:26:24,360 --> 03:26:32,360
He was also the same guy who sent me that torturous voicemail about how to upload a podcast to Spotify.

4717
03:26:32,360 --> 03:26:38,360
So I would say that those two things cancel out and he's neutral now.

4718
03:26:39,360 --> 03:26:46,360
Um, suck it, nerd.

4719
03:26:46,360 --> 03:26:48,360
Remember the pig?

4720
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:50,360
Freddy Krueger.

4721
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:52,360
The pig?

4722
03:26:52,360 --> 03:26:54,360
Yeah.

4723
03:26:54,360 --> 03:26:56,360
I kind of missed the pig.

4724
03:26:56,360 --> 03:26:59,360
I thought the pig was coming on that Russian one.

4725
03:26:59,360 --> 03:27:01,360
I thought there was going to be something.

4726
03:27:01,360 --> 03:27:03,360
I see what you mean.

4727
03:27:03,360 --> 03:27:05,360
It was so boring.

4728
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:09,360
It's going to shock me with something, but it didn't do it.

4729
03:27:09,360 --> 03:27:11,360
No pig.

4730
03:27:11,360 --> 03:27:18,360
Next one is called In Defense of Ben's Bad Programming.

4731
03:27:18,360 --> 03:27:25,360
I have not done the thing where I post my source code on my Patreon yet.

4732
03:27:25,360 --> 03:27:26,360
I'm going to do that.

4733
03:27:26,360 --> 03:27:28,360
I just haven't gotten around to it.

4734
03:27:28,360 --> 03:27:30,360
Three, two, one, go.

4735
03:27:30,360 --> 03:27:34,360
There's a voicemail last week calling Ben a dunce for tying the damage checks in Phantom's Revenge to the animation,

4736
03:27:34,360 --> 03:27:36,360
and they're right in that it's good practice to avoid that sort of thing,

4737
03:27:36,360 --> 03:27:40,360
but like 90% of game development is about recognizing what shortcuts or concessions you can take

4738
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:42,360
to avoid stretching your time and resources too thin,

4739
03:27:42,360 --> 03:27:44,360
lest you never end up finishing the project.

4740
03:27:44,360 --> 03:27:49,360
And this is doubly so considering Ben started out knowing basically nothing about his development environment or the process.

4741
03:27:49,360 --> 03:27:52,360
Of course, you have to take the needs and scope of each project into account,

4742
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:54,360
but he did that and all it resulted in was a bug so minor,

4743
03:27:54,360 --> 03:27:57,360
it was only noticed when I documented my run in extreme detail

4744
03:27:57,360 --> 03:27:59,360
and double checked all the math to make sure I wasn't making any mistakes.

4745
03:27:59,360 --> 03:28:03,360
So I think we can afford him a few lines of spaghetti code in exchange for a finished game.

4746
03:28:03,360 --> 03:28:07,360
Also, hey, hey, hey, now that the PCP is officially a game development podcast,

4747
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:10,360
I've said before and I'll say again that you should organize a PCP game jam.

4748
03:28:10,360 --> 03:28:12,360
It's really easy to create one on itch.io.

4749
03:28:12,360 --> 03:28:17,360
Maybe it could be like a week or two instead of 48 hours to be flexible with people's schedules.

4750
03:28:17,360 --> 03:28:19,360
You could do a shekels for heckles where you played jam entries.

4751
03:28:19,360 --> 03:28:22,360
It could be themed however you like or with no theme at all.

4752
03:28:22,360 --> 03:28:25,360
Maybe nobody will participate, but hey, I'd like to at least.

4753
03:28:26,360 --> 03:28:29,360
Those are some good ideas, actually.

4754
03:28:29,360 --> 03:28:31,360
That was a well-presented voice mail.

4755
03:28:31,360 --> 03:28:34,360
I'm impressed by how eloquent and fast that was.

4756
03:28:34,360 --> 03:28:38,360
Yeah, I think, and I don't mean to toot my own horn,

4757
03:28:38,360 --> 03:28:43,360
but I think you were correct that like, yeah, maybe my code's not optimal,

4758
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:46,360
but it works, so like whatever.

4759
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:50,360
I did what I had to do to get it working and guess what I did.

4760
03:28:50,360 --> 03:28:52,360
If it works, it works.

4761
03:28:52,360 --> 03:28:54,360
I think this is I'll Die.

4762
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:56,360
I think this is...

4763
03:28:57,360 --> 03:29:00,360
I think it was I'll Die who found that bug, so I think this is I'll Die.

4764
03:29:00,360 --> 03:29:01,360
Sure.

4765
03:29:01,360 --> 03:29:03,360
I hope I'm not wrong.

4766
03:29:03,360 --> 03:29:06,360
Good voice mail, I enjoy it, even though I have no idea what you're talking about.

4767
03:29:09,360 --> 03:29:11,360
Organizing a game jam.

4768
03:29:11,360 --> 03:29:15,360
Honestly, honestly, that's kind of a compelling idea.

4769
03:29:15,360 --> 03:29:19,360
PCP doing something outside of recording podcasts? Who would it be?

4770
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:22,360
And I've never even considered it before,

4771
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:29,360
but since we're all gamesmen now, it kind of makes sense,

4772
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:33,360
and maybe we could do it.

4773
03:29:35,360 --> 03:29:37,360
I guess you can just do it on itch.

4774
03:29:37,360 --> 03:29:39,360
I don't always have to look into how you do it,

4775
03:29:39,360 --> 03:29:42,360
but I'm listening.

4776
03:29:42,360 --> 03:29:45,360
Good voice mail, if you can believe an actually good voice mail.

4777
03:29:45,360 --> 03:29:46,360
Oh my God.

4778
03:29:46,360 --> 03:29:48,360
In the sea.

4779
03:29:48,360 --> 03:29:50,360
In the sea of utter crap.

4780
03:29:50,360 --> 03:29:52,360
In this utter garbage.

4781
03:29:52,360 --> 03:29:56,360
That's a fucking filth.

4782
03:29:58,360 --> 03:30:00,360
Next one is called,

4783
03:30:00,360 --> 03:30:03,360
and also video game more like video come.

4784
03:30:03,360 --> 03:30:05,360
Three, two, one, go.

4785
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:07,360
Also, I left the voice mail last week about Pyre,

4786
03:30:07,360 --> 03:30:10,360
but I want to second the other person's voice mail about Transistor.

4787
03:30:10,360 --> 03:30:13,360
It's the game that turned me into a super giant stand.

4788
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:15,360
It's super short, it's super dense,

4789
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:17,360
and everything about it makes me come,

4790
03:30:17,360 --> 03:30:19,360
and it will make you come too.

4791
03:30:19,360 --> 03:30:21,360
Sounds good. Maybe I should try it.

4792
03:30:21,360 --> 03:30:23,360
I was thinking about playing Transistor.

4793
03:30:23,360 --> 03:30:25,360
I saw it's got a lady in it,

4794
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:27,360
and it's by the Hades guys.

4795
03:30:27,360 --> 03:30:29,360
So I was like, yeah, go on.

4796
03:30:29,360 --> 03:30:32,360
I didn't know hardly anything about it.

4797
03:30:32,360 --> 03:30:34,360
You know, I saw Bastion, and I was like,

4798
03:30:34,360 --> 03:30:36,360
okay, it looks all right.

4799
03:30:36,360 --> 03:30:38,360
And then I saw Transistor, and I was like,

4800
03:30:38,360 --> 03:30:40,360
oh, it's a new one by those guys.

4801
03:30:40,360 --> 03:30:42,360
Yeah, it looks all right.

4802
03:30:42,360 --> 03:30:44,360
It means I like Hades a lot. That's cool.

4803
03:30:44,360 --> 03:30:47,360
And you describe it as short and dense,

4804
03:30:47,360 --> 03:30:50,360
which are two of my favorite things a thing can be.

4805
03:30:50,360 --> 03:30:53,360
So that's good.

4806
03:30:53,360 --> 03:30:56,360
You're talking my language right now.

4807
03:30:56,360 --> 03:30:58,360
All right, I'm thinking about it.

4808
03:30:58,360 --> 03:30:59,360
Hell yeah.

4809
03:30:59,360 --> 03:31:01,360
You're giving me a lot to think about this week.

4810
03:31:01,360 --> 03:31:04,360
I'll die. Well done.

4811
03:31:04,360 --> 03:31:09,360
Next one is called Transracialism

4812
03:31:09,360 --> 03:31:12,360
from Sonic3oST at gmail.com.

4813
03:31:12,360 --> 03:31:16,360
Three, two, one, go.

4814
03:31:16,360 --> 03:31:19,360
Michael Jackson is pretty much transracial.

4815
03:31:19,360 --> 03:31:22,360
How could you forget about him?

4816
03:31:22,360 --> 03:31:26,360
Yeah, I guess so.

4817
03:31:26,360 --> 03:31:29,360
They said is instead of was.

4818
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:30,360
That's true.

4819
03:31:30,360 --> 03:31:35,360
I don't know if he ever said anything to that effect

4820
03:31:35,360 --> 03:31:39,360
or what his opinion about any of that was.

4821
03:31:39,360 --> 03:31:42,360
I'm not sure.

4822
03:31:42,360 --> 03:31:44,360
Maybe he would have said something relevant,

4823
03:31:44,360 --> 03:31:47,360
and I just don't know.

4824
03:31:47,360 --> 03:31:49,360
Did he claim to be white or something like that?

4825
03:31:49,360 --> 03:31:51,360
I don't know.

4826
03:31:51,360 --> 03:31:52,360
I don't know.

4827
03:31:52,360 --> 03:31:54,360
I think I heard something about it just being trying

4828
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:56,360
to distance himself from his family.

4829
03:31:56,360 --> 03:32:01,360
I know he wasn't too keen on his father and stuff.

4830
03:32:01,360 --> 03:32:03,360
That's why I remember.

4831
03:32:03,360 --> 03:32:08,360
God, that is horrifying though.

4832
03:32:08,360 --> 03:32:11,360
Okay, serious question.

4833
03:32:11,360 --> 03:32:15,360
Why is he the only human being I'm aware of

4834
03:32:15,360 --> 03:32:17,360
that did that to himself?

4835
03:32:17,360 --> 03:32:20,360
Why is he the only one?

4836
03:32:20,360 --> 03:32:24,360
It is really weird, isn't it?

4837
03:32:24,360 --> 03:32:26,360
Super fucking weird.

4838
03:32:26,360 --> 03:32:29,360
If he didn't exist, you wouldn't know it was possible.

4839
03:32:29,360 --> 03:32:32,360
No, that's right.

4840
03:32:32,360 --> 03:32:38,360
Same with Elon Musk and hair transplants.

4841
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:41,360
Face, face, face.

4842
03:32:41,360 --> 03:32:42,360
Yeah.

4843
03:32:42,360 --> 03:32:44,360
Damn, when you really think about it,

4844
03:32:44,360 --> 03:32:46,360
it's a little weird and horrifying,

4845
03:32:46,360 --> 03:32:48,360
and I'm confused now that I think about it.

4846
03:32:48,360 --> 03:32:51,360
I don't know how it happened or why.

4847
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:53,360
I remember when I was a kid,

4848
03:32:53,360 --> 03:32:56,360
somebody just said he got in a big patch

4849
03:32:56,360 --> 03:33:01,360
of big tub of bleach inside there for a few hours.

4850
03:33:01,360 --> 03:33:03,360
Like Too Faced, but he fell all the way in.

4851
03:33:03,360 --> 03:33:05,360
Yeah, yeah.

4852
03:33:05,360 --> 03:33:09,360
And he did it on purpose because he hated himself or something.

4853
03:33:09,360 --> 03:33:10,360
I don't know.

4854
03:33:10,360 --> 03:33:13,360
That's what I heard when I was like six.

4855
03:33:13,360 --> 03:33:17,360
I mean, sure, I guess.

4856
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:20,360
Anyway, what was the question?

4857
03:33:20,360 --> 03:33:22,360
I don't know, whatever.

4858
03:33:22,360 --> 03:33:25,360
Why didn't you bring up Michael Jackson as a transracial person?

4859
03:33:25,360 --> 03:33:27,360
I don't know.

4860
03:33:27,360 --> 03:33:29,360
I didn't think of it.

4861
03:33:29,360 --> 03:33:31,360
Stupid.

4862
03:33:31,360 --> 03:33:33,360
Why do you think I didn't think?

4863
03:33:33,360 --> 03:33:35,360
Okay, next voicemail.

4864
03:33:35,360 --> 03:33:39,360
Listen to the baby's words.

4865
03:33:39,360 --> 03:33:41,360
They will not be repeated.

4866
03:33:41,360 --> 03:33:43,360
From Gibby, you are just the cutest

4867
03:33:43,360 --> 03:33:48,360
at kissybwisseykissue.com.

4868
03:33:48,360 --> 03:33:50,360
Three, two, one, go.

4869
03:33:50,360 --> 03:33:52,360
Hey, mate.

4870
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:54,360
The baby says first words.

4871
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:56,360
Oh, god, the baby.

4872
03:33:56,360 --> 03:33:59,360
Now he won't shut up.

4873
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:05,360
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

4874
03:34:05,360 --> 03:34:08,360
Fuck you, bin.

4875
03:34:08,360 --> 03:34:12,360
Here to summer.

4876
03:34:12,360 --> 03:34:15,360
Fuck the name of bin the saint.

4877
03:34:15,360 --> 03:34:21,360
It is a samurai of the Kawasaki clan.

4878
03:34:21,360 --> 03:34:25,360
I was born of revenge.

4879
03:34:25,360 --> 03:34:27,360
Excellent disguise.

4880
03:34:27,360 --> 03:34:32,360
Revenge, I will enact on you bin the saint.

4881
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:35,360
For stealing scroll.

4882
03:34:35,360 --> 03:34:40,360
Had you double checked, they find the print and scroll.

4883
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:43,360
You would have seen this technique

4884
03:34:43,360 --> 03:34:46,360
of being reborn

4885
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:49,360
through a baby.

4886
03:34:49,360 --> 03:34:54,360
Now I will exact my revenge on you bin the saint.

4887
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:58,360
Son, in the body of a baby.

4888
03:34:58,360 --> 03:35:02,360
Until next time.

4889
03:35:02,360 --> 03:35:06,360
Fuck the name of bin the saint.

4890
03:35:06,360 --> 03:35:12,360
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

4891
03:35:12,360 --> 03:35:14,360
So the samurai's powers have been expanded

4892
03:35:14,360 --> 03:35:16,360
to he can be reborn as a baby

4893
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:19,360
and also return to the baby form at the end.

4894
03:35:19,360 --> 03:35:24,360
He is, he is, okay, I guess in real life

4895
03:35:24,360 --> 03:35:28,360
May and Ethan's baby is canonically the samurai.

4896
03:35:28,360 --> 03:35:30,360
Oh, I didn't even catch that.

4897
03:35:30,360 --> 03:35:31,360
That's, okay.

4898
03:35:31,360 --> 03:35:33,360
Yeah, that was Ethan, that's Ethan.

4899
03:35:33,360 --> 03:35:35,360
Okay.

4900
03:35:35,360 --> 03:35:37,360
So I like it.

4901
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:38,360
Yeah, okay.

4902
03:35:38,360 --> 03:35:41,360
The baby is fucking, he's back for my ass.

4903
03:35:41,360 --> 03:35:44,360
And I don't know how, I don't know why

4904
03:35:44,360 --> 03:35:46,360
I thought I was gonna get away with it.

4905
03:35:46,360 --> 03:35:49,360
How's the samurai saga been going on now?

4906
03:35:49,360 --> 03:35:53,360
Gotta be more than a year, maybe two years.

4907
03:35:53,360 --> 03:35:54,360
Yeah.

4908
03:35:54,360 --> 03:35:56,360
Something like that.

4909
03:35:56,360 --> 03:35:58,360
I'm not sure.

4910
03:35:58,360 --> 03:36:00,360
I don't think that's the same samurai.

4911
03:36:00,360 --> 03:36:03,360
I think there's an idea of a samurai.

4912
03:36:03,360 --> 03:36:05,360
There's an idea of a samurai.

4913
03:36:05,360 --> 03:36:08,360
I know the original samurai is like,

4914
03:36:08,360 --> 03:36:12,360
has like COVID and pneumonia right now.

4915
03:36:12,360 --> 03:36:14,360
So I feel like maybe that wasn't them.

4916
03:36:14,360 --> 03:36:19,360
But I think I like this lore and I'm just gonna roll with it.

4917
03:36:19,360 --> 03:36:22,360
Did you see, I mentioned it in my discord,

4918
03:36:22,360 --> 03:36:24,360
the new goss about Ethan.

4919
03:36:24,360 --> 03:36:26,360
I think they just got married.

4920
03:36:26,360 --> 03:36:28,360
I think like they just got married.

4921
03:36:28,360 --> 03:36:30,360
Yeah.

4922
03:36:30,360 --> 03:36:34,360
Also, I saw someone punching him in the face.

4923
03:36:34,360 --> 03:36:36,360
I saw that somewhere.

4924
03:36:36,360 --> 03:36:38,360
I didn't watch the video, but I heard there was a video

4925
03:36:38,360 --> 03:36:39,360
of him getting punched in the face.

4926
03:36:39,360 --> 03:36:42,360
I know they were gonna get married at a bowling alley.

4927
03:36:42,360 --> 03:36:45,360
So I assume that that video is from the wedding.

4928
03:36:45,360 --> 03:36:46,360
Yeah.

4929
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:48,360
So I guess they're married now.

4930
03:36:48,360 --> 03:36:51,360
He was wearing a cowboy hat that said fed on it.

4931
03:36:51,360 --> 03:36:52,360
No, no.

4932
03:36:52,360 --> 03:36:55,360
He's wearing a cowboy hat and a shirt that said fed on it.

4933
03:36:55,360 --> 03:36:57,360
That is wedding, I guess.

4934
03:36:57,360 --> 03:37:00,360
I just heard that he date raped somebody.

4935
03:37:00,360 --> 03:37:01,360
Yeah.

4936
03:37:01,360 --> 03:37:04,360
That's the big one.

4937
03:37:04,360 --> 03:37:08,360
And that just came out like a little bit before the wedding.

4938
03:37:08,360 --> 03:37:10,360
But like the wedding just continued.

4939
03:37:10,360 --> 03:37:12,360
It's like, fuck it.

4940
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:15,360
But apparently he date raped a woman in Vegas

4941
03:37:15,360 --> 03:37:17,360
while Mae was pregnant.

4942
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:18,360
So...

4943
03:37:18,360 --> 03:37:20,360
But that's fine, whatever.

4944
03:37:20,360 --> 03:37:21,360
We'll just get married.

4945
03:37:21,360 --> 03:37:23,360
So life marches on.

4946
03:37:23,360 --> 03:37:24,360
Life marches on.

4947
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:27,360
The show must go on.

4948
03:37:27,360 --> 03:37:30,360
You got to break a few eggs, you know?

4949
03:37:30,360 --> 03:37:35,360
To remove some samurai's.

4950
03:37:35,360 --> 03:37:37,360
Exactly.

4951
03:37:37,360 --> 03:37:44,360
Next voicemail is how do you get good at Hades?

4952
03:37:44,360 --> 03:37:46,360
You just played a lot.

4953
03:37:46,360 --> 03:37:49,360
Anyway, three, two, one, go.

4954
03:37:49,360 --> 03:37:51,360
You beat it already, I heard.

4955
03:37:51,360 --> 03:37:54,360
How do you deal with the fact that everything you do

4956
03:37:54,360 --> 03:37:56,360
creates a huge right wave of energy?

4957
03:37:56,360 --> 03:37:57,360
What?

4958
03:37:57,360 --> 03:37:59,360
Be it waves with Poseidon or blades with Aries,

4959
03:37:59,360 --> 03:38:01,360
no matter how you play.

4960
03:38:01,360 --> 03:38:04,360
By the end you literally can't see enemies,

4961
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:07,360
so I die from something I could never see coming.

4962
03:38:10,360 --> 03:38:11,360
No.

4963
03:38:11,360 --> 03:38:13,360
I reject your hypothesis.

4964
03:38:13,360 --> 03:38:14,360
I don't think that's true.

4965
03:38:14,360 --> 03:38:15,360
I mean, I kind of know what you...

4966
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:20,360
I mean, by the end of the game, I am often not really like...

4967
03:38:20,360 --> 03:38:23,360
I'm usually not like focusing on an individual enemy

4968
03:38:23,360 --> 03:38:25,360
and like fighting them.

4969
03:38:25,360 --> 03:38:29,360
I'm usually like jumping into a group of enemies

4970
03:38:29,360 --> 03:38:33,360
and just exploding all my abilities as fast as I can.

4971
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:36,360
Do as much damage in as many places as possible.

4972
03:38:36,360 --> 03:38:39,360
They're just dashing to not be hit.

4973
03:38:39,360 --> 03:38:42,360
Yeah, late in a run there is definitely a lot of visual clutter,

4974
03:38:42,360 --> 03:38:44,360
but at that point you're putting out so much damage.

4975
03:38:44,360 --> 03:38:47,360
If you've built it well enough to not be able to tell

4976
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:49,360
what the fuck is happening, you're probably doing alright.

4977
03:38:49,360 --> 03:38:52,360
The only time I'm really worried about like,

4978
03:38:52,360 --> 03:38:54,360
oh, where are the enemies,

4979
03:38:54,360 --> 03:38:57,360
is usually in Elysium against the Great Shields

4980
03:38:57,360 --> 03:38:59,360
because I have to make sure I'm behind them.

4981
03:38:59,360 --> 03:39:01,360
But other than that,

4982
03:39:01,360 --> 03:39:04,360
I'm just jumping into the fucking pack.

4983
03:39:04,360 --> 03:39:06,360
I guess I try to keep away from like the chariots.

4984
03:39:06,360 --> 03:39:09,360
And the game has pretty good lock-on,

4985
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:12,360
like most of your time to build land unless you're playing with mouse and keyboard

4986
03:39:12,360 --> 03:39:16,360
in which case you have to be a bit more precise.

4987
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:17,360
Not every...

4988
03:39:17,360 --> 03:39:22,360
I mean, a lot of the times my best builds are not like shooting energy everywhere.

4989
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:25,360
A lot of my best builds are just about like,

4990
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:29,360
put everything, put all my boons,

4991
03:39:29,360 --> 03:39:31,360
just buff my attack.

4992
03:39:31,360 --> 03:39:34,360
So I just spam my basic attack.

4993
03:39:34,360 --> 03:39:36,360
That's how you get good.

4994
03:39:36,360 --> 03:39:41,360
Yeah, I'd say focus on either special or attack

4995
03:39:41,360 --> 03:39:44,360
and dump everything into that when you can.

4996
03:39:44,360 --> 03:39:47,360
Just pick one, depending on what you're using.

4997
03:39:47,360 --> 03:39:50,360
Cast maybe sometimes, but I don't really...

4998
03:39:50,360 --> 03:39:52,360
I don't really like casting Hades.

4999
03:39:52,360 --> 03:39:55,360
I don't know. I used to get to do that.

5000
03:39:55,360 --> 03:40:00,360
Usually the most useful thing about casting

5001
03:40:00,360 --> 03:40:03,360
is that it embeds the Bloodstone, which gives me the damage boost.

5002
03:40:03,360 --> 03:40:04,360
That's usually what I use.

5003
03:40:04,360 --> 03:40:08,360
I use it on bosses, but like during normal gameplay, I don't follow it usually.

5004
03:40:08,360 --> 03:40:11,360
Sometimes I like it when I have...

5005
03:40:11,360 --> 03:40:15,360
When you have a good thing like Trippy Shot or the Zeus,

5006
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:17,360
like cast like Bouncing Chain Lightning,

5007
03:40:17,360 --> 03:40:19,360
sometimes I like to have that...

5008
03:40:19,360 --> 03:40:23,360
It deals pretty good damage and a lot of times it can clear out a crowd pretty easily.

5009
03:40:23,360 --> 03:40:25,360
So sometimes I'll use it for that.

5010
03:40:25,360 --> 03:40:29,360
I've had one or two runs where I've just done focus casting,

5011
03:40:29,360 --> 03:40:31,360
just buff my cast as high as I can.

5012
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:32,360
It works.

5013
03:40:32,360 --> 03:40:34,360
Yeah, fair enough.

5014
03:40:34,360 --> 03:40:40,360
Anyway, just focus all your boons.

5015
03:40:40,360 --> 03:40:44,360
Try and focus your build on something and just go really hard

5016
03:40:44,360 --> 03:40:46,360
and buffing that thing and then just spam it.

5017
03:40:46,360 --> 03:40:48,360
Yeah, don't spread out your stuff.

5018
03:40:48,360 --> 03:40:52,360
Keep it concise and make one thing real good.

5019
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:54,360
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

5020
03:40:54,360 --> 03:41:00,360
Also, just grind darkness if you need a bit of a boost and level up at the mirror.

5021
03:41:00,360 --> 03:41:03,360
Grinding darkness, important.

5022
03:41:03,360 --> 03:41:08,360
Also, get the Hades aspect of...

5023
03:41:08,360 --> 03:41:11,360
What's the Spear's name?

5024
03:41:11,360 --> 03:41:14,360
Val something, the Eternal Spear, whatever.

5025
03:41:14,360 --> 03:41:17,360
Get the Hades aspect is the best.

5026
03:41:17,360 --> 03:41:19,360
Use the Spin Attack.

5027
03:41:19,360 --> 03:41:21,360
What he said.

5028
03:41:21,360 --> 03:41:24,360
Yeah.

5029
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:26,360
Oh my god.

5030
03:41:26,360 --> 03:41:28,360
Fucking...

5031
03:41:28,360 --> 03:41:30,360
The Arthur aspect.

5032
03:41:30,360 --> 03:41:32,360
It's so cool.

5033
03:41:32,360 --> 03:41:34,360
It's just so fucking cool.

5034
03:41:34,360 --> 03:41:36,360
He stands different.

5035
03:41:36,360 --> 03:41:39,360
When he has the Arthur aspect of the Stygian Blade,

5036
03:41:39,360 --> 03:41:41,360
he doesn't have his usual stand.

5037
03:41:41,360 --> 03:41:45,360
He stands perfectly straight and he holds the sword up with a great sword

5038
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:47,360
in a different stance.

5039
03:41:47,360 --> 03:41:49,360
Like guts.

5040
03:41:49,360 --> 03:41:50,360
Yeah, kinda.

5041
03:41:50,360 --> 03:41:51,360
Sweet.

5042
03:41:51,360 --> 03:41:53,360
A little bit.

5043
03:41:53,360 --> 03:41:56,360
Okay, next voicemail.

5044
03:41:56,360 --> 03:41:58,360
I'm losing my place.

5045
03:41:58,360 --> 03:42:02,360
That was 39, so number 40.

5046
03:42:02,360 --> 03:42:04,360
Oh, it's a Vokeru.

5047
03:42:04,360 --> 03:42:07,360
It's called Agree or Disagree.

5048
03:42:07,360 --> 03:42:10,360
Here's the link.

5049
03:42:10,360 --> 03:42:12,360
Wait, are you ready?

5050
03:42:12,360 --> 03:42:13,360
Yep.

5051
03:42:13,360 --> 03:42:15,360
Okay, three, two, one, go.

5052
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:27,360
What would be nice if Ben was gay?

5053
03:42:27,360 --> 03:42:30,360
Well, we got good news.

5054
03:42:30,360 --> 03:42:33,360
Ben is gonna go on Hades tonight.

5055
03:42:33,360 --> 03:42:35,360
I'm gonna fuck Thanatos eventually.

5056
03:42:35,360 --> 03:42:38,360
Fuck his step, bro, so you got your way.

5057
03:42:38,360 --> 03:42:42,360
And I do agree it would be nice.

5058
03:42:42,360 --> 03:42:46,360
It would be nice if only.

5059
03:42:46,360 --> 03:42:51,360
Well, it's like I always say, you know,

5060
03:42:51,360 --> 03:42:55,360
I've always preferred men sexually,

5061
03:42:55,360 --> 03:42:57,360
but unfortunately I'm just not gay,

5062
03:42:57,360 --> 03:43:00,360
so I just can't do anything about it.

5063
03:43:00,360 --> 03:43:02,360
So it's sad but true, you know,

5064
03:43:02,360 --> 03:43:04,360
so I'm with you, voicemailer,

5065
03:43:04,360 --> 03:43:08,360
but some things are just not meant to be.

5066
03:43:08,360 --> 03:43:11,360
Some rules were meant to be broken though, Ben.

5067
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:15,360
I don't necessarily know if that's true.

5068
03:43:15,360 --> 03:43:20,360
I think some social...

5069
03:43:20,360 --> 03:43:22,360
What's the phrase I'm looking for?

5070
03:43:22,360 --> 03:43:23,360
Some...

5071
03:43:23,360 --> 03:43:24,360
Expectations?

5072
03:43:24,360 --> 03:43:25,360
What's the constructs?

5073
03:43:25,360 --> 03:43:27,360
What's the thing that they call...

5074
03:43:27,360 --> 03:43:29,360
Some social constructs are meant to be

5075
03:43:29,360 --> 03:43:31,360
abided by unquestioningly.

5076
03:43:31,360 --> 03:43:33,360
True!

5077
03:43:33,360 --> 03:43:34,360
Sleeping in a bed?

5078
03:43:34,360 --> 03:43:36,360
Everyone does that.

5079
03:43:36,360 --> 03:43:37,360
Pooing in a toilet?

5080
03:43:37,360 --> 03:43:39,360
Everyone does that.

5081
03:43:39,360 --> 03:43:40,360
Now we're talking.

5082
03:43:40,360 --> 03:43:41,360
Go goblin mode.

5083
03:43:41,360 --> 03:43:43,360
What are you gonna poo in a sink?

5084
03:43:43,360 --> 03:43:45,360
I'm gonna shit in my bed and sleep in my toilet.

5085
03:43:45,360 --> 03:43:47,360
Yes!

5086
03:43:47,360 --> 03:43:49,360
That's the way.

5087
03:43:49,360 --> 03:43:51,360
Next one is called Sad Man.

5088
03:43:51,360 --> 03:43:54,360
Three, two, one, go.

5089
03:43:54,360 --> 03:43:56,360
I have just broken up with somebody.

5090
03:43:56,360 --> 03:43:59,360
Give me advice to feel better.

5091
03:43:59,360 --> 03:44:05,360
Is this a shrimp guy from laughing, smiling friends?

5092
03:44:05,360 --> 03:44:07,360
Sounds a little bit like him,

5093
03:44:07,360 --> 03:44:09,360
but I think that's just what English people sound like then.

5094
03:44:09,360 --> 03:44:11,360
Oh, fuck.

5095
03:44:11,360 --> 03:44:15,360
That's racist.

5096
03:44:15,360 --> 03:44:17,360
You broke up with someone.

5097
03:44:17,360 --> 03:44:20,360
Consume media you have previous attachment to

5098
03:44:20,360 --> 03:44:22,360
that gives you the one-fuzzies.

5099
03:44:22,360 --> 03:44:23,360
I don't know.

5100
03:44:23,360 --> 03:44:24,360
Yeah, that is that.

5101
03:44:24,360 --> 03:44:25,360
I don't know.

5102
03:44:25,360 --> 03:44:27,360
Just fucking do something cool.

5103
03:44:27,360 --> 03:44:28,360
Do something fun.

5104
03:44:28,360 --> 03:44:29,360
Yeah, do something epic.

5105
03:44:29,360 --> 03:44:32,360
Do a cool skateboard trick and then...

5106
03:44:32,360 --> 03:44:33,360
Yeah.

5107
03:44:33,360 --> 03:44:36,360
Do some shit that you didn't do.

5108
03:44:36,360 --> 03:44:40,360
Do some shit that's cool that you didn't do with your

5109
03:44:40,360 --> 03:44:42,360
former partner and then be like,

5110
03:44:42,360 --> 03:44:44,360
well, they sucked actually.

5111
03:44:44,360 --> 03:44:45,360
We never did this stuff.

5112
03:44:45,360 --> 03:44:47,360
Do something that they tried to do,

5113
03:44:47,360 --> 03:44:48,360
but they were really bad at it,

5114
03:44:48,360 --> 03:44:49,360
but then you do it way better and you go,

5115
03:44:49,360 --> 03:44:50,360
yeah, they did suck.

5116
03:44:50,360 --> 03:44:52,360
Why do I even care?

5117
03:44:52,360 --> 03:44:53,360
Yeah!

5118
03:44:53,360 --> 03:44:55,360
That's what you do.

5119
03:44:55,360 --> 03:44:58,360
Just make yourself hate them.

5120
03:44:58,360 --> 03:45:01,360
Just convince yourself they're the worst fucking person in the world.

5121
03:45:01,360 --> 03:45:03,360
That's what Ben did with Trixie.

5122
03:45:03,360 --> 03:45:04,360
It seems to work.

5123
03:45:04,360 --> 03:45:10,360
So, when we broke up, we ended our passionate romance.

5124
03:45:13,360 --> 03:45:15,360
Just fuck a bunch of whores.

5125
03:45:15,360 --> 03:45:16,360
That'll cheer you up.

5126
03:45:16,360 --> 03:45:17,360
Fuck a bunch of whores.

5127
03:45:17,360 --> 03:45:18,360
Yeah, I mean, why not?

5128
03:45:18,360 --> 03:45:20,360
Take a load of drugs.

5129
03:45:20,360 --> 03:45:21,360
Sure.

5130
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:24,360
Drive to the wrong side of the road with a whiskey bottle.

5131
03:45:24,360 --> 03:45:25,360
Now, hold on.

5132
03:45:25,360 --> 03:45:27,360
Now, hold on a second.

5133
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:29,360
We're getting far afield.

5134
03:45:29,360 --> 03:45:33,360
Buy a load of amiibos and then sell them for an exorbitant price.

5135
03:45:33,360 --> 03:45:38,360
Have you considered committing suicide in Minecraft?

5136
03:45:38,360 --> 03:45:39,360
Cheers, yeah.

5137
03:45:39,360 --> 03:45:40,360
And then you go, that doesn't feel good.

5138
03:45:40,360 --> 03:45:41,360
That'll make you feel better.

5139
03:45:41,360 --> 03:45:42,360
I wouldn't do that in real life.

5140
03:45:42,360 --> 03:45:47,360
If you're inconsolably unhappy, you know,

5141
03:45:47,360 --> 03:45:52,360
the sweet decor of the grave beckons.

5142
03:45:52,360 --> 03:45:53,360
In Minecraft.

5143
03:45:53,360 --> 03:45:54,360
The sweet oblivion.

5144
03:45:54,360 --> 03:45:55,360
Not in real life.

5145
03:45:55,360 --> 03:45:57,360
In Minecraft, of course.

5146
03:45:57,360 --> 03:46:01,360
If you ever feel really sad, let yourself lose a run of Hades right at the end

5147
03:46:01,360 --> 03:46:05,360
and then you'll be like, damn, why was I sad about that other thing?

5148
03:46:05,360 --> 03:46:07,360
Yeah, just, you're stupid.

5149
03:46:07,360 --> 03:46:12,360
You're stupid ex never fucking built, you know, an all Artemis.

5150
03:46:12,360 --> 03:46:13,360
You know, just critting everything.

5151
03:46:13,360 --> 03:46:17,360
There's so much damage on that fucking Artemis' call, you know.

5152
03:46:17,360 --> 03:46:18,360
It's insane.

5153
03:46:18,360 --> 03:46:20,360
Just eats Hades' entire health bar.

5154
03:46:20,360 --> 03:46:21,360
Read chapter.

5155
03:46:21,360 --> 03:46:22,360
You think she could do that?

5156
03:46:22,360 --> 03:46:23,360
They could do that?

5157
03:46:23,360 --> 03:46:24,360
You never, never.

5158
03:46:24,360 --> 03:46:27,360
Read chapter 1045 of One Piece and go, look at it.

5159
03:46:27,360 --> 03:46:35,360
Get online and then get online and go, I can't fucking believe it's not rubber.

5160
03:46:35,360 --> 03:46:37,360
That'll take your mind off.

5161
03:46:37,360 --> 03:46:42,360
Yeah, there's lots to be, lots to get excited about right now.

5162
03:46:42,360 --> 03:46:44,360
It's a good time to be single.

5163
03:46:44,360 --> 03:46:48,360
Talk to a friend, I don't know.

5164
03:46:48,360 --> 03:46:52,360
Yeah, I mean, I guess if all else fails.

5165
03:46:52,360 --> 03:46:56,360
If you fail to distract yourself with product and media.

5166
03:46:56,360 --> 03:46:58,360
We covered all the bases there.

5167
03:46:58,360 --> 03:47:00,360
Yep, that should be all you need.

5168
03:47:00,360 --> 03:47:01,360
And that's all you need.

5169
03:47:01,360 --> 03:47:03,360
In that order.

5170
03:47:03,360 --> 03:47:05,360
You should be all set.

5171
03:47:05,360 --> 03:47:09,360
Okay, next, we have about, I think we have about a dozen to go.

5172
03:47:09,360 --> 03:47:12,360
So, we're getting there.

5173
03:47:12,360 --> 03:47:18,360
Next one is called, how are your three, two, one go?

5174
03:47:18,360 --> 03:47:20,360
Hey guys, how are you doing today?

5175
03:47:20,360 --> 03:47:22,360
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

5176
03:47:22,360 --> 03:47:25,360
I'm actually, I'm actually starting to feel very strange about this man.

5177
03:47:26,360 --> 03:47:28,360
At least it was short.

5178
03:47:28,360 --> 03:47:33,360
But next one is very strange about this man.

5179
03:47:33,360 --> 03:47:35,360
That's how I feel about Thanatos.

5180
03:47:35,360 --> 03:47:37,360
That's what I said.

5181
03:47:37,360 --> 03:47:47,360
Every time I see his bulging trapezius muscle just exploding out from behind his muscular arm.

5182
03:47:47,360 --> 03:47:49,360
He goes, hello, Zag.

5183
03:47:49,360 --> 03:47:52,360
That could hold me if he were so inclined.

5184
03:47:52,360 --> 03:47:54,360
Sure.

5185
03:47:54,360 --> 03:47:56,360
Hey, Zagman.

5186
03:47:56,360 --> 03:47:58,360
Hey, how are you doing?

5187
03:47:58,360 --> 03:48:00,360
Hey, drink some wine, bro.

5188
03:48:00,360 --> 03:48:02,360
Why don't you drink some wine?

5189
03:48:02,360 --> 03:48:04,360
My bro.

5190
03:48:04,360 --> 03:48:06,360
He says, you're a proven loser.

5191
03:48:06,360 --> 03:48:08,360
I won the competition.

5192
03:48:08,360 --> 03:48:13,360
You know, when you go in the room and you have to kill more enemies than him?

5193
03:48:13,360 --> 03:48:16,360
Hey, yeah, yeah.

5194
03:48:16,360 --> 03:48:20,360
He calls you a proven loser.

5195
03:48:20,360 --> 03:48:21,360
He does.

5196
03:48:21,360 --> 03:48:22,360
Yeah, I remember that.

5197
03:48:22,360 --> 03:48:24,360
It just made me want to date him even more.

5198
03:48:24,360 --> 03:48:29,360
He want to turn the game off and then can play about one piece of Chapter 1045 on the Internet.

5199
03:48:29,360 --> 03:48:32,360
He just gave me something to prove.

5200
03:48:32,360 --> 03:48:35,360
Next one is called, did I post it there?

5201
03:48:35,360 --> 03:48:36,360
Yes, I did.

5202
03:48:36,360 --> 03:48:38,360
It is called, my evil plan is underway.

5203
03:48:38,360 --> 03:48:40,360
Three, two, one, go.

5204
03:48:48,360 --> 03:48:50,360
I can't do it.

5205
03:48:50,360 --> 03:48:51,360
I can't fucking do it.

5206
03:48:51,360 --> 03:48:54,360
I'm doing voice jail ding dong for voice jail.

5207
03:48:54,360 --> 03:48:55,360
It's over.

5208
03:48:55,360 --> 03:48:56,360
No more.

5209
03:48:56,360 --> 03:48:57,360
No more.

5210
03:48:57,360 --> 03:48:58,360
Goodbye.

5211
03:48:58,360 --> 03:48:59,360
The end.

5212
03:48:59,360 --> 03:49:00,360
I'm not laughing.

5213
03:49:00,360 --> 03:49:05,360
Put a wax seal on that and smell it to the king.

5214
03:49:05,360 --> 03:49:08,360
An ignoble end for this nonsense.

5215
03:49:08,360 --> 03:49:09,360
I'm irritated.

5216
03:49:09,360 --> 03:49:11,360
I'm in a bad mood.

5217
03:49:11,360 --> 03:49:12,360
Is that what?

5218
03:49:12,360 --> 03:49:13,360
Yeah, ignoble.

5219
03:49:13,360 --> 03:49:14,360
It is a word.

5220
03:49:14,360 --> 03:49:15,360
It is.

5221
03:49:15,360 --> 03:49:16,360
Ignoble.

5222
03:49:16,360 --> 03:49:17,360
Yes, ignoble.

5223
03:49:17,360 --> 03:49:20,360
Like a noble from the gig studio.

5224
03:49:21,360 --> 03:49:22,360
Yes.

5225
03:49:25,360 --> 03:49:30,360
IGN, OB, whatever.

5226
03:49:30,360 --> 03:49:32,360
How would you say the opposite of noble?

5227
03:49:32,360 --> 03:49:33,360
Unnoble.

5228
03:49:33,360 --> 03:49:34,360
Im noble.

5229
03:49:34,360 --> 03:49:35,360
No honor.

5230
03:49:35,360 --> 03:49:36,360
Non noble.

5231
03:49:36,360 --> 03:49:37,360
Ignoble.

5232
03:49:37,360 --> 03:49:39,360
There's a word for it.

5233
03:49:39,360 --> 03:49:40,360
Oh sure.

5234
03:49:40,360 --> 03:49:41,360
Go on.

5235
03:49:41,360 --> 03:49:42,360
Lecture me some more.

5236
03:49:42,360 --> 03:49:45,360
About the life which I invented.

5237
03:49:46,360 --> 03:49:49,360
And we perfected.

5238
03:49:49,360 --> 03:49:56,360
Next one is called, I don't know, it's a link studio project image made on cap, cap wing.

5239
03:49:56,360 --> 03:49:57,360
Is it a video?

5240
03:49:57,360 --> 03:49:58,360
Okay, it's me.

5241
03:49:58,360 --> 03:50:07,360
Oh, it's me from the documentary with my like face that I didn't complete shaving correctly on.

5242
03:50:07,360 --> 03:50:10,360
Where you just have just the neck beard.

5243
03:50:10,360 --> 03:50:11,360
Yeah.

5244
03:50:11,360 --> 03:50:15,360
And it's Obi-Wan Kenobi looking at it.

5245
03:50:15,360 --> 03:50:16,360
Is that Obi-Wan Kenobi?

5246
03:50:16,360 --> 03:50:19,360
Yeah, that's from the trailer for the new Star Wars TV show.

5247
03:50:19,360 --> 03:50:22,360
Listen, I know I look terrible.

5248
03:50:22,360 --> 03:50:26,360
I don't know why I only shaved half of my face that day.

5249
03:50:26,360 --> 03:50:29,360
I don't know what's wrong with me.

5250
03:50:29,360 --> 03:50:32,360
I'm not trying to make excuses.

5251
03:50:32,360 --> 03:50:36,360
I can't even tell what this image is meant to convey.

5252
03:50:36,360 --> 03:50:38,360
Like is he like upset?

5253
03:50:38,360 --> 03:50:40,360
Or is he like what?

5254
03:50:40,360 --> 03:50:42,360
Yeah, he's not.

5255
03:50:42,360 --> 03:50:45,360
I think he's probably saying what?

5256
03:50:45,360 --> 03:50:48,360
Yes, in that you and the Gregor sort of way.

5257
03:50:48,360 --> 03:50:50,360
What?

5258
03:50:50,360 --> 03:50:54,360
Ben Shave hasn't shaved his face.

5259
03:50:54,360 --> 03:50:55,360
He's right.

5260
03:50:55,360 --> 03:50:57,360
It's confusing.

5261
03:50:57,360 --> 03:50:58,360
I agree.

5262
03:50:58,360 --> 03:51:01,360
You should have used the picture of naked snake with the binoculars.

5263
03:51:01,360 --> 03:51:02,360
We're smiling.

5264
03:51:02,360 --> 03:51:03,360
Idiot.

5265
03:51:03,360 --> 03:51:05,360
Oh, yeah.

5266
03:51:05,360 --> 03:51:06,360
We scroll.

5267
03:51:06,360 --> 03:51:07,360
No, image.

5268
03:51:07,360 --> 03:51:09,360
Liquid Saber Spark.

5269
03:51:09,360 --> 03:51:11,360
Yeah, use this image.

5270
03:51:11,360 --> 03:51:12,360
Oh, wait.

5271
03:51:12,360 --> 03:51:13,360
That's you.

5272
03:51:13,360 --> 03:51:14,360
Sorry.

5273
03:51:14,360 --> 03:51:15,360
Okay.

5274
03:51:15,360 --> 03:51:16,360
No, that's yes.

5275
03:51:16,360 --> 03:51:17,360
There we go.

5276
03:51:17,360 --> 03:51:18,360
Much, much better.

5277
03:51:18,360 --> 03:51:23,360
Next one is called great artists steal greater artists outsource.

5278
03:51:23,360 --> 03:51:27,360
Three, two, one, go.

5279
03:51:27,360 --> 03:51:29,360
Hey, Ben St.

5280
03:51:29,360 --> 03:51:31,360
So I think you should publish your game.

5281
03:51:31,360 --> 03:51:32,360
That'd be a fun exercise.

5282
03:51:32,360 --> 03:51:36,360
Yeah, I think you should just take care of your copyright issue.

5283
03:51:36,360 --> 03:51:40,360
So, you know, just go on Fiverr, you know, get someone to make a legally

5284
03:51:40,360 --> 03:51:44,360
version of the song when it's like Bobby Prince.

5285
03:51:44,360 --> 03:51:46,360
You know, it's still sounds like it.

5286
03:51:46,360 --> 03:51:48,360
So it hits the proper beats.

5287
03:51:48,360 --> 03:51:52,360
Yeah, I know what a sound like is legally distinct.

5288
03:51:52,360 --> 03:51:54,360
Yeah, boomed out of being done.

5289
03:51:54,360 --> 03:51:56,360
Anyway, peace out.

5290
03:51:56,360 --> 03:51:57,360
So lame.

5291
03:51:57,360 --> 03:51:58,360
It's so lame.

5292
03:51:58,360 --> 03:52:03,360
Like, uh, make a song that sounds exactly like this other song.

5293
03:52:03,360 --> 03:52:04,360
Please.

5294
03:52:04,360 --> 03:52:06,360
It's like, it would be bad.

5295
03:52:06,360 --> 03:52:08,360
It wouldn't be as good.

5296
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:11,360
Like when you get commissioned, they send you a reference image of the character

5297
03:52:11,360 --> 03:52:13,360
in the exact pose that they want.

5298
03:52:13,360 --> 03:52:15,360
And it's like, well, what the fuck?

5299
03:52:15,360 --> 03:52:17,360
What do you need me to draw it for?

5300
03:52:17,360 --> 03:52:19,360
What do you need me to draw it again?

5301
03:52:19,360 --> 03:52:21,360
There, there it is.

5302
03:52:21,360 --> 03:52:22,360
You have it.

5303
03:52:22,360 --> 03:52:24,360
It's probably better than what I can do.

5304
03:52:24,360 --> 03:52:26,360
Uh, sure.

5305
03:52:26,360 --> 03:52:32,360
Um, this, I, yeah, I mean, you're not the first, you're not the first person

5306
03:52:32,360 --> 03:52:35,360
to give me this advice, but I, it's stupid.

5307
03:52:35,360 --> 03:52:36,360
So fucking stupid.

5308
03:52:36,360 --> 03:52:37,360
I don't know.

5309
03:52:37,360 --> 03:52:41,360
I, I think, I think I might just say fuck it.

5310
03:52:41,360 --> 03:52:46,360
And just like make an account, like make a new steam account.

5311
03:52:46,360 --> 03:52:48,360
What's the worst that would happen?

5312
03:52:48,360 --> 03:52:51,360
What's the worst that would happen if I like put it on steam?

5313
03:52:51,360 --> 03:52:52,360
It gets taken off steam.

5314
03:52:52,360 --> 03:52:53,360
They don't let me post it.

5315
03:52:53,360 --> 03:52:55,360
They get, it gets taken off of steam.

5316
03:52:55,360 --> 03:52:56,360
Like, okay.

5317
03:52:56,360 --> 03:53:02,360
Well, I guess I could just, that if that happens, then maybe I could make some sound

5318
03:53:02,360 --> 03:53:05,360
in the like songs and re, re-post it.

5319
03:53:05,360 --> 03:53:06,360
I guess.

5320
03:53:06,360 --> 03:53:07,360
Yeah.

5321
03:53:07,360 --> 03:53:08,360
Whatever.

5322
03:53:08,360 --> 03:53:10,360
Uh, I don't know.

5323
03:53:10,360 --> 03:53:12,360
I just seems dumb.

5324
03:53:12,360 --> 03:53:14,360
I don't want to do that.

5325
03:53:14,360 --> 03:53:16,360
I don't want to do this.

5326
03:53:16,360 --> 03:53:23,360
It seems, it honestly seems more dishonest to be like, hey, some guy make me a song that

5327
03:53:23,360 --> 03:53:26,360
sounds exactly like this other song, but is legally distinct.

5328
03:53:26,360 --> 03:53:30,360
And then put that in the game versus just putting that song and then in the credits

5329
03:53:30,360 --> 03:53:33,360
being like, yeah, I stole this music from this other game.

5330
03:53:33,360 --> 03:53:35,360
It feels more like stealing.

5331
03:53:35,360 --> 03:53:39,360
Because it's like, it's like when you make a forgery of a famous painting.

5332
03:53:39,360 --> 03:53:40,360
Yeah.

5333
03:53:40,360 --> 03:53:41,360
Replace it.

5334
03:53:41,360 --> 03:53:42,360
It's so dumb.

5335
03:53:42,360 --> 03:53:46,360
I mean, I understand that maybe this is the kind of thing that you have to do to get around

5336
03:53:46,360 --> 03:53:47,360
copyright issues.

5337
03:53:47,360 --> 03:53:49,360
But this is why we should just abolish copyright.

5338
03:53:49,360 --> 03:53:50,360
Yeah.

5339
03:53:50,360 --> 03:53:51,360
Uh, yeah.

5340
03:53:51,360 --> 03:53:55,360
The next one is from son of Marowak.

5341
03:53:55,360 --> 03:53:59,360
Uh, three, two, one, go.

5342
03:53:59,360 --> 03:54:05,360
I just watched an aesthetic critic video for the first time in two years.

5343
03:54:05,360 --> 03:54:06,360
Nice.

5344
03:54:06,360 --> 03:54:08,360
Big mistake.

5345
03:54:08,360 --> 03:54:10,360
Sorry, man.

5346
03:54:10,360 --> 03:54:11,360
Yeah.

5347
03:54:11,360 --> 03:54:12,360
Hummer.

5348
03:54:12,360 --> 03:54:13,360
You don't get better.

5349
03:54:13,360 --> 03:54:14,360
You don't get better.

5350
03:54:14,360 --> 03:54:18,360
This is not, it will not improve.

5351
03:54:18,360 --> 03:54:24,360
Uh, next one is that Tommy Oliver voicemail was pretty funny.

5352
03:54:24,360 --> 03:54:28,360
Three, two, one, go.

5353
03:54:28,360 --> 03:54:30,360
Okay.

5354
03:54:30,360 --> 03:54:39,360
So, you know, it's a little bit like a voicemail.

5355
03:54:39,360 --> 03:54:42,360
That's your good, huh?

5356
03:54:42,360 --> 03:54:43,360
Maybe.

5357
03:54:43,360 --> 03:54:45,360
He may be even boys.

5358
03:54:45,360 --> 03:54:47,360
What do you think?

5359
03:54:47,360 --> 03:54:48,360
Okay.

5360
03:54:48,360 --> 03:54:49,360
Bye.

5361
03:54:49,360 --> 03:54:50,360
Thanks.

5362
03:54:50,360 --> 03:54:51,360
Thanks.

5363
03:54:51,360 --> 03:54:52,360
Whatever.

5364
03:54:52,360 --> 03:54:53,360
Whatever.

5365
03:54:53,360 --> 03:54:54,360
What was that?

5366
03:54:54,360 --> 03:54:56,360
The five notes of Freddie's ambient fan noise in the background?

5367
03:54:56,360 --> 03:54:57,360
Why?

5368
03:54:57,360 --> 03:55:00,360
Was it like, was he meant to be like jacking off?

5369
03:55:00,360 --> 03:55:01,360
I don't know.

5370
03:55:01,360 --> 03:55:05,360
Was he, was he trying to give the impression that he was jacking off while making this voicemail?

5371
03:55:05,360 --> 03:55:06,360
Good for him.

5372
03:55:06,360 --> 03:55:07,360
Or them.

5373
03:55:07,360 --> 03:55:08,360
Or them.

5374
03:55:08,360 --> 03:55:09,360
Or they them.

5375
03:55:09,360 --> 03:55:10,360
There you go.

5376
03:55:10,360 --> 03:55:11,360
Much better.

5377
03:55:11,360 --> 03:55:12,360
Now, now you're learning.

5378
03:55:12,360 --> 03:55:13,360
I'll get there eventually.

5379
03:55:13,360 --> 03:55:19,360
Now we're learning, understanding, finally, you're becoming human.

5380
03:55:19,360 --> 03:55:21,360
I don't know about that.

5381
03:55:21,360 --> 03:55:23,360
I don't know about that, but sure.

5382
03:55:23,360 --> 03:55:27,360
Story, story from North America.

5383
03:55:27,360 --> 03:55:29,360
What the hell is North America?

5384
03:55:29,360 --> 03:55:33,360
Here's a story from North America.

5385
03:55:33,360 --> 03:55:36,360
There's both cup and taken outside.

5386
03:55:36,360 --> 03:55:37,360
No.

5387
03:55:37,360 --> 03:55:38,360
Okay.

5388
03:55:38,360 --> 03:55:39,360
No.

5389
03:55:39,360 --> 03:55:41,360
Give knows what I'm talking about.

5390
03:55:41,360 --> 03:55:42,360
Sure.

5391
03:55:42,360 --> 03:55:43,360
I'm sure she does.

5392
03:55:43,360 --> 03:55:44,360
I don't.

5393
03:55:44,360 --> 03:55:47,360
I don't even know what Digimon is really.

5394
03:55:47,360 --> 03:55:48,360
I'm sorry.

5395
03:55:48,360 --> 03:55:49,360
What?

5396
03:55:49,360 --> 03:55:52,360
It was a media property.

5397
03:55:52,360 --> 03:55:53,360
That's it.

5398
03:55:53,360 --> 03:55:54,360
Thanks.

5399
03:55:54,360 --> 03:55:55,360
That's the answer.

5400
03:55:55,360 --> 03:55:56,360
Now I'm informed.

5401
03:55:56,360 --> 03:55:57,360
Okay.

5402
03:55:57,360 --> 03:55:58,360
Now you know.

5403
03:55:58,360 --> 03:55:59,360
Now you know.

5404
03:55:59,360 --> 03:56:01,360
Next one is called, I was kidnapped.

5405
03:56:01,360 --> 03:56:02,360
Someone please help.

5406
03:56:02,360 --> 03:56:04,360
Oh God, I can't take it.

5407
03:56:04,360 --> 03:56:07,360
Three, two, one, go.

5408
03:56:07,360 --> 03:56:10,360
I think, I think they left.

5409
03:56:10,360 --> 03:56:13,360
Please, someone, they kidnapped me.

5410
03:56:13,360 --> 03:56:14,360
Please, someone come.

5411
03:56:14,360 --> 03:56:18,360
I thought you were my friend, but it seems we have a snitch.

5412
03:56:18,360 --> 03:56:19,360
Okay.

5413
03:56:19,360 --> 03:56:26,360
Then you will be with my pet and pets need training.

5414
03:56:26,360 --> 03:56:28,360
Engaging the one protocol.

5415
03:56:28,360 --> 03:56:29,360
No, no, no.

5416
03:56:29,360 --> 03:56:30,360
111.

5417
03:56:30,360 --> 03:56:31,360
111.

5418
03:56:31,360 --> 03:56:32,360
111.

5419
03:56:32,360 --> 03:56:33,360
111.

5420
03:56:33,360 --> 03:56:34,360
111.

5421
03:56:34,360 --> 03:56:35,360
111.

5422
03:56:35,360 --> 03:56:36,360
111.

5423
03:56:36,360 --> 03:56:37,360
111.

5424
03:56:37,360 --> 03:56:38,360
111.

5425
03:56:38,360 --> 03:56:39,360
111.

5426
03:56:39,360 --> 03:56:40,360
111.

5427
03:56:40,360 --> 03:56:41,360
111.

5428
03:56:41,360 --> 03:56:42,360
111.

5429
03:56:42,360 --> 03:56:44,360
What did I just said?

5430
03:56:44,360 --> 03:56:45,360
Okay.

5431
03:56:45,360 --> 03:56:49,360
So I guess that explains why the fan, I guess.

5432
03:56:49,360 --> 03:56:50,360
No.

5433
03:56:50,360 --> 03:56:52,360
I guess that explains something.

5434
03:56:52,360 --> 03:56:54,360
He was kidnapped.

5435
03:56:54,360 --> 03:56:55,360
No.

5436
03:56:55,360 --> 03:56:57,360
Let him out.

5437
03:56:57,360 --> 03:56:58,360
Okay.

5438
03:56:58,360 --> 03:56:59,360
Okay.

5439
03:56:59,360 --> 03:57:00,360
Let him out.

5440
03:57:00,360 --> 03:57:01,360
There was a DS again there.

5441
03:57:01,360 --> 03:57:02,360
I guess.

5442
03:57:02,360 --> 03:57:03,360
Come on.

5443
03:57:03,360 --> 03:57:04,360
Just be cool.

5444
03:57:04,360 --> 03:57:05,360
Was that Twilight?

5445
03:57:05,360 --> 03:57:06,360
It was Twilight Sparkle.

5446
03:57:06,360 --> 03:57:07,360
Okay.

5447
03:57:07,360 --> 03:57:10,360
I'll take your word for it.

5448
03:57:10,360 --> 03:57:16,360
Next one is called, what about sponsors?

5449
03:57:16,360 --> 03:57:21,360
Three, two, one, go.

5450
03:57:21,360 --> 03:57:25,360
And finally, I want to give a big, big shout out to Surfshark for sponsoring this video.

5451
03:57:25,360 --> 03:57:29,360
If you've been living under a rock or something and you don't already know, Surfshark is one

5452
03:57:29,360 --> 03:57:30,360
of the best Nord VPNs out there.

5453
03:57:30,360 --> 03:57:34,360
So if you're ever looking to learn the skill or build a website, head to the description

5454
03:57:34,360 --> 03:57:39,360
of this video and hit the link audible.com slash CJDX and you can get started right away

5455
03:57:39,360 --> 03:57:42,360
with hundreds of champions from 14 playable factions.

5456
03:57:42,360 --> 03:57:45,360
I've already saved $50 on purchases just from the last month.

5457
03:57:45,360 --> 03:57:47,360
It's genuinely my favorite pair of headphones now.

5458
03:57:47,360 --> 03:57:48,360
I really recommend them.

5459
03:57:48,360 --> 03:57:50,360
So yeah, thanks for watching to the end.

5460
03:57:50,360 --> 03:57:52,360
Let me know in the comments what you want to see me do next.

5461
03:57:52,360 --> 03:57:53,360
No promises.

5462
03:57:53,360 --> 03:57:56,360
I can't do everything, but I do read everything and I love hearing from you guys.

5463
03:57:56,360 --> 03:57:57,360
I guess that's it.

5464
03:57:57,360 --> 03:57:58,360
Try to be nice to yourself.

5465
03:57:58,360 --> 03:57:59,360
I'll see you next time.

5466
03:57:59,360 --> 03:58:00,360
Bye.

5467
03:58:00,360 --> 03:58:01,360
That's great.

5468
03:58:01,360 --> 03:58:02,360
Is CJDX a real YouTuber?

5469
03:58:02,360 --> 03:58:04,360
I have no idea.

5470
03:58:04,360 --> 03:58:06,360
But if so, that's a good bit.

5471
03:58:06,360 --> 03:58:07,360
I like that.

5472
03:58:07,360 --> 03:58:08,360
It's a good bit.

5473
03:58:08,360 --> 03:58:11,360
It was that guy, CJ...

5474
03:58:11,360 --> 03:58:12,360
CJ Something.

5475
03:58:12,360 --> 03:58:14,360
What was the full name?

5476
03:58:14,360 --> 03:58:15,360
The guy who made that...

5477
03:58:15,360 --> 03:58:20,360
He was making that history of the PCP series and he made the first episode.

5478
03:58:20,360 --> 03:58:23,360
I don't think he's CJDX though.

5479
03:58:23,360 --> 03:58:25,360
I think it's a different guy.

5480
03:58:25,360 --> 03:58:29,360
What's the opposite of an X?

5481
03:58:29,360 --> 03:58:30,360
A Y.

5482
03:58:30,360 --> 03:58:31,360
It says Pokemon.

5483
03:58:31,360 --> 03:58:32,360
Yeah.

5484
03:58:32,360 --> 03:58:33,360
CJ the Y.

5485
03:58:33,360 --> 03:58:36,360
That was the original username.

5486
03:58:36,360 --> 03:58:41,360
Next one is called IHOP.

5487
03:58:41,360 --> 03:58:42,360
There it is.

5488
03:58:42,360 --> 03:58:43,360
Three, two, one, go.

5489
03:58:43,360 --> 03:58:44,360
Hey guys.

5490
03:58:44,360 --> 03:58:45,360
How are you getting on today?

5491
03:58:45,360 --> 03:58:46,360
Fuck off.

5492
03:58:46,360 --> 03:58:48,360
I hope you're doing well.

5493
03:58:48,360 --> 03:58:49,360
I hope.

5494
03:58:49,360 --> 03:58:50,360
I hope.

5495
03:58:50,360 --> 03:58:51,360
Fuck off.

5496
03:58:51,360 --> 03:58:52,360
Yeah.

5497
03:58:52,360 --> 03:58:53,360
Next one is called Cybershell.

5498
03:58:53,360 --> 03:58:54,360
Three, two...

5499
03:58:54,360 --> 03:58:55,360
No, I didn't load it yet.

5500
03:58:55,360 --> 03:58:56,360
There we go.

5501
03:58:56,360 --> 03:58:57,360
Three, two, one, go.

5502
03:58:57,360 --> 03:59:03,360
I hope you're having a good day to give a guest or no, Tom.

5503
03:59:03,360 --> 03:59:05,360
Tom, I hope you're fucking on this time.

5504
03:59:05,360 --> 03:59:06,360
I'm gonna...

5505
03:59:06,360 --> 03:59:07,360
He's not.

5506
03:59:07,360 --> 03:59:08,360
Haha.

5507
03:59:08,360 --> 03:59:09,360
I can't...

5508
03:59:09,360 --> 03:59:10,360
Also fuck off.

5509
03:59:10,360 --> 03:59:11,360
Fuck.

5510
03:59:11,360 --> 03:59:12,360
God.

5511
03:59:12,360 --> 03:59:13,360
Waste my fucking time.

5512
03:59:13,360 --> 03:59:14,360
I hope.

5513
03:59:14,360 --> 03:59:15,360
I hope.

5514
03:59:15,360 --> 03:59:16,360
I hope.

5515
03:59:16,360 --> 03:59:17,360
I hope.

5516
03:59:17,360 --> 03:59:18,360
I hope.

5517
03:59:18,360 --> 03:59:19,360
I hope.

5518
03:59:19,360 --> 03:59:20,360
I hope.

5519
03:59:20,360 --> 03:59:21,360
I hope.

5520
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:23,360
Also fuck off.

5521
03:59:23,360 --> 03:59:24,360
Fuck.

5522
03:59:24,360 --> 03:59:25,360
God.

5523
03:59:25,360 --> 03:59:27,360
Waste my fucking time.

5524
03:59:27,360 --> 03:59:28,360
Why don't you?

5525
03:59:28,360 --> 03:59:30,360
I'm so glad I said before we started.

5526
03:59:30,360 --> 03:59:32,360
I bet you half of them are gonna be the same person.

5527
03:59:32,360 --> 03:59:33,360
You were...

5528
03:59:33,360 --> 03:59:34,360
I expected you...

5529
03:59:34,360 --> 03:59:36,360
I didn't expect you to be this right.

5530
03:59:36,360 --> 03:59:37,360
No, me neither.

5531
03:59:37,360 --> 03:59:38,360
Yeah.

5532
03:59:38,360 --> 03:59:41,360
I'm never confident in anything I do, but maybe I should be.

5533
03:59:41,360 --> 03:59:44,360
Next one is called Cybershell.

5534
03:59:44,360 --> 03:59:45,360
Three...

5535
03:59:45,360 --> 03:59:46,360
Wait.

5536
03:59:46,360 --> 03:59:47,360
No.

5537
03:59:47,360 --> 03:59:48,360
That last one was just called Cybershell.

5538
03:59:48,360 --> 03:59:50,360
And it had nothing to do with Cybershell.

5539
03:59:50,360 --> 03:59:51,360
God, you're right.

5540
03:59:51,360 --> 03:59:52,360
What the fuck?

5541
03:59:52,360 --> 03:59:53,360
It's clickbait.

5542
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:54,360
Next one is called...

5543
03:59:54,360 --> 03:59:55,360
Next one is called Opening.

5544
03:59:55,360 --> 03:59:57,360
Three, two, one, go.

5545
03:59:57,360 --> 03:59:58,360
No.

5546
03:59:58,360 --> 03:59:59,360
No.

5547
03:59:59,360 --> 04:00:00,360
No.

5548
04:00:00,360 --> 04:00:01,360
No.

5549
04:00:01,360 --> 04:00:02,360
I'm not listening to it.

5550
04:00:02,360 --> 04:00:03,360
I'm not doing it.

5551
04:00:03,360 --> 04:00:06,360
Voice jail means something, and it means I don't listen to your stupid voicemails.

5552
04:00:06,360 --> 04:00:08,360
You've lost your fucking voicemail privileges.

5553
04:00:08,360 --> 04:00:10,360
Ben, what if it's not the same person?

5554
04:00:10,360 --> 04:00:11,360
We have to give it a chance.

5555
04:00:11,360 --> 04:00:14,360
What if they just have a very similar microphone setup?

5556
04:00:14,360 --> 04:00:15,360
Well, they're...

5557
04:00:15,360 --> 04:00:19,360
Well, after listening to the entire 12 seconds right there, which I won't play,

5558
04:00:19,360 --> 04:00:25,360
Eleazar, don't play it, but I can tell you that this person has the same ethos.

5559
04:00:25,360 --> 04:00:26,360
Has the same MO.

5560
04:00:26,360 --> 04:00:27,360
I will agree.

5561
04:00:27,360 --> 04:00:29,360
That is a similar energy.

5562
04:00:29,360 --> 04:00:30,360
Yeah.

5563
04:00:30,360 --> 04:00:32,360
Next one is called...

5564
04:00:32,360 --> 04:00:35,360
I'll have to administer another fuck off.

5565
04:00:35,360 --> 04:00:38,360
Next one is called Well-Ben.

5566
04:00:38,360 --> 04:00:39,360
These are all the same.

5567
04:00:39,360 --> 04:00:40,360
These are all the same guys.

5568
04:00:40,360 --> 04:00:42,360
You could just tell by the titles.

5569
04:00:42,360 --> 04:00:43,360
I can tell by the title.

5570
04:00:43,360 --> 04:00:45,360
Three, two, one, go.

5571
04:00:45,360 --> 04:00:46,360
Ben, what?

5572
04:00:46,360 --> 04:00:47,360
No.

5573
04:00:47,360 --> 04:00:49,360
Next one is called...

5574
04:00:49,360 --> 04:00:51,360
Next one is called Well-Tom.

5575
04:00:51,360 --> 04:00:53,360
Three, two, one, go.

5576
04:00:53,360 --> 04:00:54,360
Oh, in fact.

5577
04:00:54,360 --> 04:00:55,360
Nope.

5578
04:00:55,360 --> 04:00:56,360
Okay.

5579
04:00:56,360 --> 04:00:57,360
Next one is called...

5580
04:00:57,360 --> 04:00:58,360
Not this time.

5581
04:00:58,360 --> 04:01:00,360
Not today, Satan.

5582
04:01:00,360 --> 04:01:02,360
Next one is called Love You.

5583
04:01:02,360 --> 04:01:04,360
Three, two, one, go.

5584
04:01:04,360 --> 04:01:05,360
There you go.

5585
04:01:05,360 --> 04:01:06,360
Nope.

5586
04:01:06,360 --> 04:01:07,360
Okay.

5587
04:01:07,360 --> 04:01:08,360
That's it.

5588
04:01:08,360 --> 04:01:09,360
That's the end.

5589
04:01:09,360 --> 04:01:10,360
That's the last voicemail.

5590
04:01:10,360 --> 04:01:11,360
All right.

5591
04:01:11,360 --> 04:01:12,360
Bing Bong or whatever your name is, you're in voice jail forever.

5592
04:01:12,360 --> 04:01:13,360
No more.

5593
04:01:13,360 --> 04:01:14,360
It's over.

5594
04:01:14,360 --> 04:01:15,360
It's done.

5595
04:01:15,360 --> 04:01:16,360
We've had enough.

5596
04:01:16,360 --> 04:01:18,360
Everyone else, thanks for your voicemail.

5597
04:01:18,360 --> 04:01:22,360
At least I hope we play one second from the start of all of those.

5598
04:01:22,360 --> 04:01:23,360
Yes.

5599
04:01:23,360 --> 04:01:24,360
Yes.

5600
04:01:24,360 --> 04:01:27,360
That's what I heard and that's what I want the audience to hear.

5601
04:01:27,360 --> 04:01:29,360
I want them to follow along.

5602
04:01:29,360 --> 04:01:30,360
Oh, God.

5603
04:01:30,360 --> 04:01:31,360
That was cool.

5604
04:01:31,360 --> 04:01:35,360
That got a little bit fun at the end there.

5605
04:01:35,360 --> 04:01:37,360
I guess I had some fun with it.

5606
04:01:37,360 --> 04:01:38,360
Yeah.

5607
04:01:38,360 --> 04:01:39,360
That was fun.

5608
04:01:39,360 --> 04:01:40,360
I suppose.

5609
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:43,360
I guess I enjoyed myself.

5610
04:01:43,360 --> 04:01:51,360
Well, I can't wait to go and make a nice ham, and cheese, and mustard, and tomato, and

5611
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:56,360
lettuce wrap for myself on a low carb, and a Bandarita wrap.

5612
04:01:56,360 --> 04:02:00,360
And fuck your stepbrother in a video game.

5613
04:02:00,360 --> 04:02:01,360
Yeah.

5614
04:02:01,360 --> 04:02:03,360
Well, you know.

5615
04:02:03,360 --> 04:02:05,360
Just one of those days.

5616
04:02:05,360 --> 04:02:06,360
What are you going to do?

5617
04:02:06,360 --> 04:02:07,360
I mean, they put it in the game.

5618
04:02:07,360 --> 04:02:09,360
I can't not do it.

5619
04:02:09,360 --> 04:02:10,360
That's free content.

5620
04:02:10,360 --> 04:02:12,360
You can't skip content.

5621
04:02:12,360 --> 04:02:17,360
It's free content that I paid for, but it's more content in the game.

5622
04:02:17,360 --> 04:02:18,360
Yes.

5623
04:02:18,360 --> 04:02:19,360
It's already paid for.

5624
04:02:19,360 --> 04:02:24,360
It would be pearls before swine if I didn't indulge myself.

5625
04:02:24,360 --> 04:02:28,360
You're wasting the pines for the edge of something.

5626
04:02:28,360 --> 04:02:31,360
I thought it was disappointed in the sex stuff.

5627
04:02:31,360 --> 04:02:39,360
Well, because like I gave Meg the last gift, the last ambrosia, and it was just like we

5628
04:02:39,360 --> 04:02:41,360
just had a drink in the lounge.

5629
04:02:41,360 --> 04:02:43,360
And I was like, are you joking me?

5630
04:02:43,360 --> 04:02:44,360
Like, is that it?

5631
04:02:44,360 --> 04:02:47,360
Like, that's what happens when you when you max out their heart.

5632
04:02:47,360 --> 04:02:50,360
You just have a drink in the lounge and you go, hey, maybe you're not so bad.

5633
04:02:50,360 --> 04:02:51,360
And that's it.

5634
04:02:51,360 --> 04:02:53,360
That's how you fucking date these people.

5635
04:02:53,360 --> 04:02:56,360
But then I got a cutscene later where it's sort of implied.

5636
04:02:56,360 --> 04:02:58,360
What are you not going to fucking put out, baby?

5637
04:02:58,360 --> 04:02:59,360
Jesus Christ.

5638
04:02:59,360 --> 04:03:00,360
You're not going to put out what?

5639
04:03:00,360 --> 04:03:01,360
What are you?

5640
04:03:01,360 --> 04:03:02,360
What are you not going to?

5641
04:03:02,360 --> 04:03:03,360
Let me fuck you.

5642
04:03:03,360 --> 04:03:04,360
You whore.

5643
04:03:04,360 --> 04:03:07,360
But then it's implied later.

5644
04:03:07,360 --> 04:03:12,360
Whip a Madonna, a Madonna.

5645
04:03:12,360 --> 04:03:16,360
They do a little fucking nasty in the past.

5646
04:03:16,360 --> 04:03:21,360
They do a little, they do a little, there's some whip sound effects and you go, aha,

5647
04:03:21,360 --> 04:03:22,360
I knew it.

5648
04:03:22,360 --> 04:03:23,360
Sure.

5649
04:03:23,360 --> 04:03:24,360
I knew she was into that.

5650
04:03:24,360 --> 04:03:25,360
She's into that stuff.

5651
04:03:25,360 --> 04:03:27,360
My suspicions confirmed.

5652
04:03:27,360 --> 04:03:29,360
Thanks, game.

5653
04:03:29,360 --> 04:03:30,360
It's fine.

5654
04:03:30,360 --> 04:03:32,360
I was like, okay, that's it's something.

5655
04:03:32,360 --> 04:03:34,360
At least at least it's something.

5656
04:03:34,360 --> 04:03:35,360
I clapped.

5657
04:03:35,360 --> 04:03:36,360
I clapped.

5658
04:03:36,360 --> 04:03:40,360
Excited to see what deuces is like, I guess.

5659
04:03:40,360 --> 04:03:41,360
Good.

5660
04:03:41,360 --> 04:03:43,360
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

5661
04:03:43,360 --> 04:03:46,360
It's funny and sweet.

5662
04:03:46,360 --> 04:03:47,360
I hope so.

5663
04:03:47,360 --> 04:03:48,360
It'll be good.

5664
04:03:48,360 --> 04:03:55,360
And then I guess I'll do Thanatos afterwards just because purely out of obligation, not

5665
04:03:55,360 --> 04:03:57,360
because I'm gay or anything, voicemailers.

5666
04:03:57,360 --> 04:04:00,360
I think we learned a lot today.

5667
04:04:00,360 --> 04:04:06,360
I've learned nothing about myself or anyone else.

5668
04:04:06,360 --> 04:04:09,360
I'm going to keep it that way.

5669
04:04:09,360 --> 04:04:10,360
All right.

5670
04:04:10,360 --> 04:04:12,360
Keep telling us.

5671
04:04:12,360 --> 04:04:18,360
Any final notes before we end the episode?

5672
04:04:18,360 --> 04:04:19,360
No.

5673
04:04:19,360 --> 04:04:20,360
Me?

5674
04:04:20,360 --> 04:04:23,360
Yeah, me either.

5675
04:04:23,360 --> 04:04:24,360
I'm Simsie.

5676
04:04:24,360 --> 04:04:25,360
Go to my Twitter account.

5677
04:04:25,360 --> 04:04:27,360
Look at my pictures.

5678
04:04:27,360 --> 04:04:30,360
Check out Simsie Fart on Twitter, right?

5679
04:04:30,360 --> 04:04:31,360
That's the app.

5680
04:04:31,360 --> 04:04:32,360
Yep.

5681
04:04:32,360 --> 04:04:33,360
Check out Simsie Fart.

5682
04:04:33,360 --> 04:04:35,360
Check out Simsie's art.

5683
04:04:35,360 --> 04:04:36,360
It's almost like.

5684
04:04:36,360 --> 04:04:37,360
It's almost like a pun.

5685
04:04:37,360 --> 04:04:38,360
The name.

5686
04:04:38,360 --> 04:04:39,360
It's almost like a pun.

5687
04:04:39,360 --> 04:04:42,360
It's almost like Simsie art was taken.

5688
04:04:42,360 --> 04:04:46,360
Okay, that's it.

5689
04:04:46,360 --> 04:04:47,360
That's the episode.

5690
04:04:47,360 --> 04:04:48,360
Ending recording.

5691
04:04:48,360 --> 04:04:49,360
Goodbye.

5692
04:04:49,360 --> 04:04:50,360
See you next week.

5693
04:04:50,360 --> 04:04:51,360
I'll put those bonus episodes up.

5694
04:04:51,360 --> 04:04:53,360
I promise.

5695
04:04:53,360 --> 04:04:59,360
I'll put that file on Patreon, my Patreon, my game source file as well.

5696
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:00,360
I'll do some stuff.

5697
04:05:00,360 --> 04:05:02,360
I'll do all kinds of important things that I should have done.

5698
04:05:02,360 --> 04:05:03,360
Okay.

5699
04:05:03,360 --> 04:05:04,360
It's my birthday.

5700
04:05:04,360 --> 04:05:05,360
Oh.

5701
04:05:05,360 --> 04:05:06,360
This week's my birthday.

5702
04:05:06,360 --> 04:05:07,360
By the time.

5703
04:05:07,360 --> 04:05:08,360
What day?

5704
04:05:08,360 --> 04:05:09,360
It's Thursday.

5705
04:05:09,360 --> 04:05:10,360
So by the time.

5706
04:05:10,360 --> 04:05:13,360
So this episode will go up the day after my birthday.

5707
04:05:13,360 --> 04:05:15,360
I think I'm going to get new glasses.

5708
04:05:15,360 --> 04:05:18,360
I think my parents are going to get me new glasses because mine are like really old.

5709
04:05:18,360 --> 04:05:20,360
Why don't you ask for like an Xbox or something?

5710
04:05:20,360 --> 04:05:21,360
You fucking idiot.

5711
04:05:21,360 --> 04:05:27,360
I don't want that shit.

5712
04:05:27,360 --> 04:05:28,360
I've got Noida.

5713
04:05:28,360 --> 04:05:29,360
That's all I need.

5714
04:05:29,360 --> 04:05:30,360
Sure.

5715
04:05:30,360 --> 04:05:32,360
But you don't have Elden Ring.

5716
04:05:32,360 --> 04:05:33,360
I don't have.

5717
04:05:33,360 --> 04:05:35,360
I should have asked for Elden Ring.

5718
04:05:35,360 --> 04:05:38,360
You should have asked your parents for a copy of Elden Ring.

5719
04:05:38,360 --> 04:05:40,360
Honestly, maybe.

5720
04:05:40,360 --> 04:05:42,360
They should.

5721
04:05:42,360 --> 04:05:46,360
Maybe they'll get me something else besides new glasses is not.

5722
04:05:46,360 --> 04:05:47,360
It's not that.

5723
04:05:47,360 --> 04:05:48,360
What's that?

5724
04:05:48,360 --> 04:05:49,360
Like a hundred bucks?

5725
04:05:49,360 --> 04:05:50,360
It's chump change.

5726
04:05:50,360 --> 04:05:51,360
Sure.

5727
04:05:51,360 --> 04:05:53,360
More, please.

5728
04:05:53,360 --> 04:05:55,360
Give me more.

5729
04:05:55,360 --> 04:05:58,360
Anyway, I just wanted to let everyone know what that's happening.

5730
04:05:58,360 --> 04:06:02,360
It'll be too late by the time this goes out to wish me a happy birthday.

5731
04:06:02,360 --> 04:06:03,360
You fucking losers.

5732
04:06:03,360 --> 04:06:04,360
Happy birthday, man.

5733
04:06:04,360 --> 04:06:05,360
You proven losers.

5734
04:06:05,360 --> 04:06:06,360
Thank you.

5735
04:06:06,360 --> 04:06:07,360
See, I remembered.

5736
04:06:07,360 --> 04:06:09,360
Nobody else remembered by this.

5737
04:06:09,360 --> 04:06:11,360
You're not a proven loser, Simpson.

5738
04:06:11,360 --> 04:06:13,360
You took the W.

5739
04:06:13,360 --> 04:06:17,360
I took the facts and I put them on the table.

5740
04:06:17,360 --> 04:06:19,360
That's right.

5741
04:06:20,360 --> 04:06:21,360
All right.

5742
04:06:21,360 --> 04:06:22,360
That's it.

5743
04:06:22,360 --> 04:06:23,360
Good night.

5744
04:06:23,360 --> 04:06:24,360
God bless.

5745
04:06:24,360 --> 04:06:25,360
See you next week.

5746
04:06:25,360 --> 04:06:26,360
Peace.

5747
04:06:26,360 --> 04:06:27,360
Bye.
