00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everybody and welcome to a Pro Crastinators Podcast. Nate's not with us this week for the

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,720
first time, but that's okay because we've got a special guest, friend of the show, Mr. Black

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,280
and Platinum himself, Nino. Hey, fuck all your, fuck all your favorites. We're SJWing the fucker

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,000
of the PCP. You people had too many white people, not enough PLC representatives. I've come here

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,440
to black up everything with my negronus, also the fact that I'm with my negronus. Yes, expect

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,160
this podcast to become 30% more urban and hip. You know, the demographics want more hip. We're

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
all just going to start rapping right in the middle of this one. We're all just going to start rapping.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:50,880
Yeah. All right. Yeah, it's true. Me and Tom are the only true white people here. We don't rap.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm Digi Bro and I've also got with me Ben Saint of Patreon. Ben Saint of Patreon.com

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,960
and Tommy Oliver. Tommy Oliver was originally in this podcast, but his audio file got corrupted

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,920
and therefore I had to try to edit him out of it entirely. So if at any point it seems like the

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,840
conversation jumps around really strangely, that's because I was editing around Tom. Sorry if it's

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,720
weird. I forgot to plug my channel. Okay, guys, you can follow me at Anime Editorial Nino,

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,280
you know, N-I-N-O-U-H. Go watch my YouTube video. I'm not just a rapper and a black person. I actually

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,040
do stuff on YouTube. Yeah. They wouldn't have brought me on for any other reason. They brought

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
me on because they knew me and they knew that I did YouTube stuff. All right, thank you. No,

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,320
we needed someone to do a halftime show in the middle of the podcast. So today's topic, which

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,240
Nino suggested. Second topic I've suggested, by the way. Yeah, you suggested last week's,

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,920
or the one that was released last week. Yeah. This topic is, you introduce it.

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Well, basically, the topic is our internet origin story. The story of how everyone on this podcast

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,640
or the people who are currently doing the podcast became familiar with the internet because if,

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
you know, everyone, if you're watching this, obviously, you know how to use the fucking

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,720
internet. Everyone has their own really intimate and personal way they use it. For example, let

24
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,840
me take you through how I wake up in the morning. Like, I'll get, I'll talk about how I've got to

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,520
this point, but I'll take you through how I wake up in the morning and use the internet. When I

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,960
wake up, I usually close out the tabs of N-Hentai I used the night before. I open up a new tab of

27
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,600
to check out all of the stuff, you know, to check out all the gaming news that is or isn't happening.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,200
I go on 4chan, probably look at a few shitposts. I go on Twitter to see if anyone's been calling

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,040
me out today. And then I go into my discord and I start talking shit with all my friends.

30
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,320
That's how, that's how I use the internet right now. And everyone else has that you,

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,440
watching this, you have your own, the life of a troll. It's like some life story.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
We've all got our, we've all got our own little internet fingerprint. We've all got a little,

33
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,440
a little internet snowflake, a little fractal spiral, spiral, you know, life, life pattern

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,200
of internet usage. Yeah. And basically, and basically the point of this podcast is now I've

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,520
shown, I've talked a little bit about where I am with how I use the internet. And this podcast

36
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,400
is how everybody got, got to where they are, how we got to this point, how we learned to torrent

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,360
stuff, how we learned to, how we learned to watch and watch anime online and stuff. Everybody

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
has a really interesting story. And I feel like everybody has a really cool way to express it.

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,200
So who wants to go first? Oh man. I feel like everybody, I feel like everybody on this podcast

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,440
has new grounds in their story at some point. No, not me. You'll be surprised. I definitely was,

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,680
I definitely was on new grounds for a while. I avoided new grounds like the plague because

42
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,360
as I understood it, that was the place where there were dicks. Oh boy. Like literal dicks.

43
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,080
For me growing up, I was like, all the seedy side of the internet, like I was afraid of.

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh, you want to know, you want to know none of that. You want it to be all pure and just...

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,560
Well, I grew up, I grew up pretty sheltered from like both like violence and sex stuff. Like,

46
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
not out of my parents like actively sheltering me, but it was more like they kind of like,

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,200
I was very like, if my parents told me something was bad, my instinct was not to then seek it out.

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,480
It was to go, oh, it's bad. Okay. And then not look at it, you know. It's like, I'd never looked at

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,800
like stuff that my parents kind of said like, oh, this isn't for you. This is for adults. And I'm

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,000
like, oh, well, I'm not an adult. I'm a kid. I'm not going to look at that. I mean, I discovered

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,680
4chan and new grounds specifically because people told me they were terrible places full of terrible

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,720
things, which made me go seek after them. Yeah, I avoided them forever. I've only been on new grounds

53
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,280
like two or three times just to look at like Egoraptor's profile when I became a fan of him later.

54
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,000
You got some, there are some great, there are some legitimately great flash games on there. There

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
are a couple of real masters. Oh, you know what? I played Endeavor. Oh, I fucking love Endeavor,

56
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,280
dude. Holy shit. I fucking love Endeavor. Oh my god, I can't believe somebody else knows Endeavor.

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,120
Ben, we've talked about it before. I can't remember any of the names of them. I can't remember

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,200
any of the actual names of the games, but I played pretty much every possible side-scrolling action

59
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,160
game and every possible dating sim that new grounds had to offer, every single one of them,

60
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,080
all of them. I'm younger than all of you guys, so I found it particularly early when I was like

61
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,480
seven years old, but I'll get to my story. Tom, continue yours. Well, yeah, I want to know, Tom,

62
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:00,320
how did you find new grounds to end up with your... No, Jack's blade is a huge digi. Digi is a... Well,

63
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,320
no. Oh, no, no, no, no. A barometer. Are you going to say I'm a nigg whisperer? Exactly. I was about

64
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,560
to say, no, no, no. What I was about to say was, if you want to know what black people like,

65
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,520
measure up to what Digi likes to a certain degree, because he has so many nigger tendencies for a

66
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,480
white person, it's not even funny. I have, through talking to Digi, the nigger tendencies I've picked

67
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,920
up in him, he's one of the only people in the anime community next to Lou from Lou Talks Anime

68
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,800
that I can just talk to about hip hop for hours. We're just talking yesterday about a bunch of

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
rappers. Who's the one you recommended, Cakes to Kill Out? Yeah, we're just talking about a bunch

70
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,840
of rappers yesterday. I was telling him how YG is the bad end of Good Kid Mad City and Kendrick

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,640
is the true end. You know, but I feel like Lou is into like, white people rap music though,

72
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,440
because every time he recommends me something, it's always like a rap rock song, and I'm always like,

73
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,880
He's a fan of a lot of old school battle rap as well, so he is part of that scene as well.

74
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't want to get too much into the rap stuff, so I'll get back to your internet story.

75
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,880
I gotta say, I only have a brief story for that period, because I also had Dial Up up until

76
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,120
2006, but I just didn't really know about internet video or downloading until around the time that

77
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,360
I got broadband or whatever. The only internet video I remember having that experience with,

78
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:36,080
of loading it all day, was AMV Hell 3, which is an hour-long AMV thing that I'm sure you've all

79
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,000
probably seen parts of at least. It was really big in the early 2000s, and back then the AMV

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,600
community was mostly file sharing stuff. People would make AMVs and then torrent them back and

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,960
forth, or whatever the old peer-to-peer them, or whatever. I guess that's what torrenting is?

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,560
Yeah, like Lime Wire. And so that's how AMVs were before YouTube, and then there was these AMV

83
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
Hell compilations, and AMV Hell 3 was this giant, epic, collaborative effort between all these

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,640
different people. It was an hour-long, and I don't remember what streaming host it used,

85
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,360
but it was available for streaming online, and I've watched it, and it would be like

86
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
me and Victor would watch it, and we watched it multiple times this way, and it would just be

87
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,320
this all-night endeavor, because you could load enough. Each joke was about 30 seconds long,

88
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,200
so you could basically pause the video and sit there for two or three minutes, and then maybe

89
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,320
play a little bit of that joke, and it would be just enough that you could get a laugh and then

90
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,840
wait some more, and it was literally all night. It would take to watch AMV Hell 3,

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,600
but it was so fucking good that we've fucking dealt with it.

92
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,720
I remember lying in bed on the weekends and waiting until I thought that my parents would be

93
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,640
asleep, so I could sneak downstairs and turn on my fucking dial-up internet and let the connect

94
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,360
the internet and hope that the fucking loudass beat it, didn't wake up my parents so that I could

95
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,800
get on the internet and jack it to pornography. That's my internet story.

96
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,760
Okay, the thing is with the whole issue of internet speed, because time progresses and

97
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,560
technology gets better, so internet speed is definitely a part of all of our internet stories,

98
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,240
but I feel like I've been uniquely affected by speed, because unlike basically everyone in

99
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,880
this cast, I didn't grow up in a first world country. I grew up in a mixture between Ghana,

100
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,640
Nigeria, and Togo, as well as the UK. I grew up in the UK to a certain amount of time.

101
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
The worst country of the world.

102
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,960
As well as the UK. I was born in the UK, I grew up there, and then I moved when I was very young

103
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,840
to Ghana, and I stayed there until, so basically my first experience with the internet was when

104
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,320
I was still living in the UK, and my dad would always say, Jimmy, we're going to the office,

105
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,360
because he didn't want to leave me at home, and my mom was also at work, both my parents used to

106
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,920
work, and my dad would say, we're going to the office, and I would hate going with him to the

107
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,800
office, because it's like all they have there are computers, and when I was a kid, computers,

108
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,760
don't suck! Who cares about computers? I want to sit at home and watch Dragon Ball Z, so he would

109
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,760
drag me over. I'm picturing you in that don't hug me, I'm scared when the computer comes to

110
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,680
teach you about the wonders of the internet. Yeah, who cares about computers? I went there,

111
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,160
and I sat down at my dad's desk, because he would never actually use his desk while I was there,

112
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,360
he would always be in a meeting or something, because whenever he would bring me, he would

113
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,560
always know that the only thing I would have to do was be on a computer, so all I knew how to do

114
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,600
at one point was play pinball on Windows 98, so I was just playing pinball all the time, then one

115
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,000
of my dad's employees came and said, oh Jimmy, let me teach you about this thing called the internet,

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,560
and I was just like selling drugs to children. Exactly, selling drugs to children. Let me teach

117
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,240
you about it, because this was, I think, 1999, 2000, I was like five, around there, five or six,

118
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,440
I was really little, so he then put on, I don't remember where it was, but he just put on the

119
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,880
website for, he was like, tell me what TV shows you like, and I was like, okay, I like, you know,

120
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,160
I think I said Sailor Moon or something, so he pulled up the website. And he shook his head

121
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,120
sadly and turned back to the computer. Yeah, exactly, oh no, but like, he asked me also,

122
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
how do you spell that, so he looked it up, and then pulled up the website for Sailor Moon, and he

123
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,480
was like, you can look at pictures of all the best shows you like, and I was just like, you know

124
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
what, this is something to do, I get to look at pictures of TV shows I like, so the internet,

125
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,160
the internet hadn't been sold on me yet, and it was not until like, a little bit later, about a

126
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,560
few years later, then one of my dad's younger employees, this guy was, I think, at the time,

127
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:15,760
I think it was like, 20, so he was, so this guy's an early adult, he's probably got an

128
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,360
anime blog, and we're probably all fans of it, so like, this guy, he comes like, Jimmy, let me

129
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
teach you about this site called Newgrounds, and that's what the doors got, that's what the doors

130
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,960
got blown over. Dude, you had some sick, sick ass adults in your life, dude. Yeah, like, oh man,

131
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,560
like. Yeah, you're the only person I've talked to who didn't learn about Newgrounds from like,

132
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,200
someone in middle school. No, no, no, adults taught me about Newgrounds, man, I was out,

133
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,480
no one in my school knew about the internet. I think the average person finds out about Newgrounds

134
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,960
some fat obnoxious white kid in your middle school, so he thinks he's really funny by repeating

135
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,280
everything you see in comics. By repeating all of those shit, but all the fucking lines from

136
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,640
Homestar Runner and all that shit, fuck man. Yeah, well someone who's gonna come up to you and describe

137
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,080
every Newgrounds video they watch, you know, and then Dick came out of the cereal box.

138
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,960
I remember, like he says, Jimmy, I know you like the Mega Man games, let me show you this one game,

139
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,240
and I remember the first game I ever played on Newgrounds, it was this, like, weird time attack

140
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,840
side-scrolling Mega Man game called Zero Race, where you controlled zero from the Mega Man X games

141
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,320
and you just had to complete time challenges, and I would play that, like, I would play that game

142
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,600
diligently for hours. So now, instead of, like, Jimmy, let's go to the office, it would be,

143
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
dad, let's go to the office, so I could go and play, I could go and play, like, you know,

144
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,040
whatever. And then I remember I started finding the other stuff on Newgrounds, and I know you've

145
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,240
completely co-opted Tom's fucking time to tell his story. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Tom, Tom, you can,

146
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
you can finish, I'll get back, I'll get back to the other stuff on Newgrounds when you're done.

147
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh man, Shaw Shaw's part, man too, Shaw Shaw, man, I can't tell you how many fucking, like,

148
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,160
stick figure, like, stick figure stories. Oh wait, I know what you're talking about. Yeah.

149
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah, the super violent stick figure cartoons, right, and they don't always be sent to fucking,

150
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,120
to new metal songs. Holy shit, that takes me back. Oh my god, I watched a ton of those, because,

151
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,520
see, the era, like, my cousin, I had an older cousin, my cousin Boyd, who's like four years older

152
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,080
than me, and he knew a lot more of those, like, you know, flash cartoon sites and stuff like that,

153
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,080
like, the stuff that I avoided, because it was, like, too adult and stuff, but he would show me

154
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,240
tons of those violent stick figure cartoons, which are a fucking blast, because it's just,

155
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,440
it'll always just be, like, some extremely long, violent fight scene. God, what was the one where

156
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
it was like, the character was supposed to be, like, a beast? He had, like, Wolverine claws,

157
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,440
and it was like, some, like, they created some, like, genetic monster in a, in a lab, and each

158
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,520
episode of the show would be, like, some scenario where he ends up around all these people, and

159
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,520
it'll start playing a disturbed song, and he'll murder everyone, or, like, a slipknot song, and

160
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,480
this guy'll just fucking kill all these people, and it was so cool. Sounds pretty cool. My, my, my,

161
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,280
my favorite, my favorite was for the Shao Shao series, and the Shao Shao series is this, like,

162
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,720
long-winded, I think, at the time, when I stopped watching it, it got up to, like, eight or nine

163
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,080
parts, and the first one was so simple, it was just two stick figures fighting each other, right,

164
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,200
and they just had this really well-choreographed battle together, and then it just kept getting

165
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,240
progressively more and more crazy, where one of the most iconic ones is, like, their levels to,

166
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,880
like, a building, and this one stick figure goes through all, like, five levels of this building,

167
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,760
and murders, brutally murders hundreds of these stick figure guys in such, like, grandiose fashion,

168
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,600
and it was so crazy to see. It's such a thing, it's all detailed, right? Like, every punch and kick

169
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,320
is, like, is, like, unique and stuff, where it just, like, goes through this whole big scenario.

170
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,120
Did you guys have the same reaction to those that I did, which is to then draw

171
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,760
fuckloads of stick figure fight scenes? Yes, yes. Because I, I did a lot of, uh, flip books, like,

172
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,560
I would just take, I would draw, like, just on the bottom corner of the page of a book,

173
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,800
like, a bunch of stick figure fights, and just, and, yeah, I always wanted it to be like that,

174
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,120
where it was, like, every attack was unique, and the characters would do all these crazy moves and

175
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,040
shit. I drew lots and lots of, like, action stick figure comics in, uh, early 2000s. Because I feel

176
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,520
like that's part, like, because, aside from the internet, like, and aside from Sha Sha, when I was

177
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,480
growing up, my cousins were all, like, super, they were my cousins, a lot of my cousins were Otaku,

178
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
and a lot of my cousins were also really big kung fu movie nerds, and they would bring all of these,

179
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,680
and not just, like, the Jackie Chan Bruce Lee ones, they would bring all of these really obscure,

180
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,640
like, tapes from China, in the original Chinese with no subtitles, and would just sit and watch

181
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,560
for hours, just these absolutely insane, like, I remember we, one of my cousins had the flying

182
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,680
guillotine, and I was just like, this guy throws this thing, like, yeah, like, he, he, he, those

183
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,600
movies were great, so like, this guy throws the thing, and you just, and the, all of these fight

184
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,080
scenes were absolutely fucking great, so I feel like when I started seeing that, that kind of stuff,

185
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,080
that was obviously inspired by all of these, like, kung fu movies from China, like, in the form of all

186
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,240
these stick figure fights, that was one of my eight, my entryways into just being like, this is

187
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,760
fucking awesome, and that probably was also what later led me to being anime is fucking awesome,

188
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,760
but that's, that's, that's later on in the story, we won't get there yet. Tom, continue with yours.

189
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,400
Oh man, Lime Wire is, all of these things are flooding back, like, Lime Wire is another, like,

190
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,200
I feel like everybody's internet story, because of just how the internet evolves, and how it evolved

191
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,360
everybody has these topstones that just, like, everybody who was around in the,

192
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,000
like, I think for all of us, we've all been on the internet since the mid-2000s, and I know even

193
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,280
though you're younger than the rest of us, you started so young, whereas I think that, like,

194
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,320
for a lot of people your age who didn't get into it until like the 2010s, probably don't know what

195
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,120
any of this shit we're talking about. Well, yeah, a lot of my friends probably didn't get, don't

196
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,480
know what Lime Wire is, but man, shit, like, well, I want, I want to continue with mine,

197
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
but only after Tom's finished his, like, because I have a few things to say.

198
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,680
Not to co-opt, but I gotta say, this, I can, I think I remember that I, I, I,

199
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,200
Lime Wired the Fooly Cooly soundtrack. Everybody did.

200
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
I needed that. I bought the, I, I own the Fooly Cooly soundtrack.

201
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,200
Everybody Lime Wired the Fooly Cooly, I, I Lime Wired.

202
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,080
I painted it at a store and bought it. I remember Lime Wiring, like, pretty much

203
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,400
every single, every single song that, every single, like, different version of Charla

204
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,920
Hedjala that was ever done. Like, this was way back in the day, because I, I looked up

205
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Charla Hedjala, because I, I, I grew up with the, with the English dub, and then I heard

206
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,440
the Japanese theme song. I was like, I love this song. Let me get on Lime Wire. And like,

207
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,600
18 different versions popped up. And I was like, let me get them all. And I was just like,

208
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
yeah, I just downloaded every single one.

209
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Well, I got to talk about Lime Wire. Mine's different, because once again, I, I grew up

210
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,040
more sheltered. And I was familiar with Lime Wire from like, 2001, because my mom got into

211
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,000
the internet at around the same time I did. And she was a huge System of a Down fan.

212
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,560
Like, she was obsessed with that band. And she would like hang out in their forums and stuff.

213
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,760
And so she found out about Lime Wire as a way to download, like, System of a Down had

214
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,480
shit tons of unreleased music that was online, like all these demos and, and B-sides and shit.

215
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,520
And eventually they made, like they released an album called Steal This Album, which was just a

216
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,680
collection of like music that people kept stealing off of Lime Wire. And they were just like,

217
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,360
fucking here it is on a CD. But um, so we had, like my mom would download all the System of a Down

218
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,600
music. And some of it wasn't even them. Some of it would be like guest spots of them or just bands

219
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,800
that sounded a lot like System of a Down and people mislabeled it and stuff. Like the most famous one...

220
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:12,400
Yeah. Right. And the, the one that was the most famous is like, uh, A Legend of Zelda?

221
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's, it's, it sounds like, it sounds a bit like Surge from System of a Down

222
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,280
singing this album. I was, I was convinced, I was convinced that it was him. But we had that on our,

223
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
our CDs. So she had all these burn CDs and System of a Down songs. But like,

224
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,240
I didn't know how to use Lime Wire myself. And I know my dad had been downloading like,

225
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,720
porn on there and shit. But uh... Oh, let me talk about porn on Lime Wire, man. Because I remember...

226
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
We'll get to it. But so what would ruin this forever for me though? And like, because again,

227
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,040
I never used it myself. But when I was like, uh, I want to say 12 or 13, I think 13,

228
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,440
my mom bought me a computer for my birthday. So I had my own computer. And that's another,

229
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,040
that's another important touchstone when each of us got our own personal computer.

230
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,920
Yeah. Well, here's the thing. It was ruined immediately because I got my own computer and

231
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,920
all I used it for was like, message boards, just like using the internet, you know, I didn't know

232
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,040
any other purpose for it and listening to music on there. But my cousin Boyd, the one I mentioned

233
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,120
before, he started downloading tons of shit on Lime Wire on my computer. He would come over to my

234
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,280
computer and download all this shit. So within like six months of me owning this computer, it became

235
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,760
just destroyed with viruses. Like you could not load up anything. It was practically useless.

236
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,480
So I couldn't even get online with it anymore. And we didn't know how to fix it. And I didn't

237
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,080
know how to communicate to my parents what the problem was, you know, so basically that computer

238
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,720
was good for about six months. And then it was never usable for anything but listening to music

239
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,120
again. And like writing, I would use it to write like poetry and listen to music. That was it.

240
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Oh, oh my god. Oh my fucking god. Let me just let me just rant about that for two goddamn seconds.

241
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,880
Yeah, like when I was even when I up until maybe like two or three years ago, because like, you know,

242
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,560
since I graduated college, I've sort of been in and out of living at my parents house. Like I live

243
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,680
there for six months and then go away for six months and come back for a year or whatever and

244
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,880
go away for a year. Yeah, my dad was the same thing. He had the Wi-Fi on a timer so that it

245
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,160
would automatically go off after like midnight or something. And I was because I don't know,

246
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,000
he just didn't believe in me staying up past like midnight or whatever. He wanted to enforce

247
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,160
like a strict schedule. To this day, to this day, to this day, I'm not allowed to take my laptop to

248
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,800
my bedroom in my house that I can't live in. Oh my god, dude. In the house that I can't like,

249
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,600
that's the reason why I have to go downstairs to the basement to record because I can't take up to

250
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,920
my bedroom because they say, oh, you'll never come out your room and you'll never talk to anybody.

251
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,320
And it's like, well, okay. And like, oh, but you, and also if you take it to your room,

252
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,600
we don't know what time you'll sleep. All right then. But they still allow me to stay,

253
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,080
they still allow me to stay in the fucking computer room and be up until like 3 a.m.

254
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
So it doesn't even matter what time I sleep. And I have my phone in my room. So it's the same

255
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,880
exact thing. It's, but yeah, I understand. I understand technology. I mean, because like,

256
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,000
okay, should I pick up where I left off of mine now? Or if you want, sure. Yeah. So like, as I said,

257
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,160
at that point, I was on Newgrounds and I started finding the other stuff on Newgrounds and everybody

258
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,440
knows what the other stuff is. Dayton Sims and Hentai. Fun fact, I learned about Hentai before

259
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,000
I learned about what anime was. Like I had been watching anime, but I didn't necessarily know

260
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,280
like a term or like a what to call it or anything. But I learned what Hentai was in detail and understood

261
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,600
all the ins and outs of it long before I actually learned what anime was. So I was looking through

262
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:55,520
all of these like, you know, different things like just dating Sims as well as just game games that

263
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:04,160
I don't know how anyone could play fucking dating Sims on Newgrounds. It was it was it was again,

264
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,840
again, you have to understand, I was like seven or eight. I was a kid. I'd know I'd like free time

265
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,160
out the wazoo at free time. I was just following whatever I could want to do. So I started looking

266
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:24,240
at all this and it really just brought my mind really open really early. And it kind of made me

267
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,080
it kind of made me an outcast in school because I didn't because like I knew I wasn't supposed to

268
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,560
talk about it. I knew I wasn't supposed to actually like be interacting with other people about what

269
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,920
I'd been seeing on this weird internet site. So I kind of didn't have anything in common with the

270
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,040
kids with the other kids, even though like I wanted to it was it was it was you were like always

271
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,960
for a certain time, I really was always on you. But the crazy thing is I never went to the forums

272
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,000
here's another thing. I never had any internet exclusive friends up until about four years ago.

273
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,200
Like for my entire life, I never met anyone on the internet because I even though I was so free

274
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,960
to I was so willing to do whatever I wanted, I will the mind the mindset was don't make friends

275
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,200
with people on the internet because you'll get in trouble with your parents or they'll find like

276
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,600
it was it was the thing with that you said like except the only thing that took was don't don't

277
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,960
don't talk to people over the internet. Don't talk to strangers on the internet.

278
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,160
That's the that's the one thing that kind of stuck with me up until recently.

279
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,160
But yeah, so like the idea that then then came like when I grew a little bit older and I started

280
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,160
learning a lot more and then I start because the thing about what I used the internet for was games.

281
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,280
I played a lot of games on the internet. I was always looking for I was on mini clip all the time.

282
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,240
I was on new grounds playing all the new you see that new you know who just did a fucking review.

283
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,280
Oh yeah, I saw that was a trip. I was a trip. I looked at him. He posted a new review. That was

284
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,280
a trip when he was going through like that was I was seeing my life flash before my eyes as he

285
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:04,160
was doing that. So like I never even heard of mini clip before. Before you could see me. I want to

286
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,120
like because again, a lot of our viewers listeners might be younger and might not have lived through

287
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,800
this part of the history because what really is fascinating like I think the biggest change between

288
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,960
like 10 years ago and now is that 10 years ago you were always told do not put any personal

289
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,400
information. Yes, that is so true. Don't give out your name. So that's how that's why all of us

290
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,640
about anything. That's the reason why all of us have crazy weird names. That's the reason right

291
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,280
and I was actually about to get into that. That's how user user names are. Are you not still supposed

292
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,760
to put personal I don't think it's true anymore because I'm seeing you. Yeah. Facebook you can't

293
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,880
you literally can't use I mean you can but you're not supposed to use fake names on Facebook or

294
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,960
Google Plus. The way I see it now is people like us who are anime fans, who are nerds,

295
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,200
who are people who have like either internet followings or just do fun stuff on the internet or

296
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,480
like play a lot of video games. We all make up our own names and those identities are kind of separate.

297
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,120
Then we have our Facebook identities where we all use our real names and that's where you know

298
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,600
because our families see those which is why we'd never update them and like that's because that's

299
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,600
the reason why I quit Facebook because my mom is on it and like because so you don't you don't really

300
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,800
want to show that side but then because you don't really even interact with that side it's less you

301
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,960
but the side that is more you is the side where you're using a crazy weird internet name and that

302
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,160
kind of brings me I mean oh yeah like to compare now to then like right now we're in a podcast where

303
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,800
we've got Ben St and Tom Oliver and both of those are like not their real names but they're

304
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,520
halfway there like they're practically their real names and everyone knows that you're Jimmy

305
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,480
and most people probably know my real name but like 10 years ago no one would be using a name

306
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,160
that was anywhere near their real name like you would not be like you know using a name that's like

307
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,280
a vague version of your real name exactly which is why which is why like Digi Bro you know yeah

308
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,480
which is why like Digi Bro is so far off from Conrad and why Nino is so far off from Jimmy

309
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,200
because it's like I remember I was playing I wanted to the reason I got this Nino name because

310
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,000
everyone asked me this question and I like giving this like origin story like it also ties into like

311
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,600
the origin story because I would play a lot of games and one game one game that really typifies my

312
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,240
experience with the internet is the arctic games like the battle those arctic battle you know games

313
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,480
like the dragon the dragon fables the adventure quests or the the met quests never heard of

314
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
yeah I know you guys I mean you guys probably haven't heard of them but like I've heard of

315
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,240
adventure quests yeah those games those games are really big oh adventure quests oh god damn

316
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,200
fucking damn adventure quests holy shit just fucking shoot me in the fucking head dude

317
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,040
yes I knew you guys would have just shoot me starring David Spade god damn it yes like those

318
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,520
games were such an important like I don't like they're all shit they're all absolute garbage

319
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,680
but those games were such an important part of my childhood and my experience with the internet

320
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,840
but like dude thank you for reminding me about it playing adventure quests in high school during

321
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,760
study period and my fucking library computer you know what's what I would do I'm shocked that

322
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,000
none of us were runescape players I because yeah I hated runescape I because I kept hearing about it

323
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:32,160
I didn't like yeah yeah yeah if if we had hippocrite here he was a big runescape player

324
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,680
yeah because I remember okay so like like when I know comes from is I was trying to play adventure

325
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,600
quest and every name out because another annoying thing about the internet back in the day was

326
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,760
you're putting a name and it was already taken that's that still gets to me so then I was like you

327
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,800
know what I'm gonna make a name that's never ever going to be taken online again so I put

328
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,560
six letters that were absolute gibberish that could sound like a name together and that's when

329
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,920
Nino came from and I've turned it I've turned it in to the empire I've turned it in to me to the

330
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:08,000
massive to the massive identity it is today it's your brand now it's my brand so that whole

331
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,280
nine zero thing doesn't actually mean anything it's just your name the okay the nine the nine zero

332
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,680
that I add the nine zero because people always mispronounce NINOUH when they first hear it like

333
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,080
I knew that your name was you know like I just thought that there was some deeper meaning

334
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,760
yeah also because oh no nine nine nine zero is my like nine ninety is my favorite number

335
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,160
nine ninety and four are my favorite numbers those are my two favorite numbers but like it's

336
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,680
nine very interesting choices yeah well I have a philosophy I have a philosophical reason for

337
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,880
ninety but I'm not gonna actually get into that it's so weird it's I said it while I was drunk

338
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:50,240
one time I don't want to dig back in my brain for it but um like so playing these games kind of just

339
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,480
pushed me into understanding because that was one of my first brushes with anime because I would read

340
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:04,800
the blog of the guy who made the arctic games and he said oh we we use such as like I remember he said

341
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,440
I like to use the record of lotus war as a reference for this part of the game and something

342
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,560
I was like what is record of lotus war look that up on the internet found out what that was

343
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,840
and again I that was also another part of how I started learning today when I learned google

344
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I would just type in random things and I would find them like I would just find

345
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,880
hours upon hours worth worth of just information and stuff that I could just read about and it

346
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,480
was the most interesting thing because I was like some like nine zero at this point I was like nine

347
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,800
ten and all that all I was doing was just on the internet occasionally looking at hentai

348
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,760
occasionally looking at like naked cartoons that I would you know I would watch on tv and then

349
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:55,360
and then I would also just be playing a bunch of weird obscured shitty 2d games online and

350
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,640
it was around that point that I started to actually truly discover anime because I was in school one

351
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:11,040
day and this was Naruto took my school by stone I don't know how but Naruto I was living in Ghana

352
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:18,000
at the time right so it was at home all of our internet sucked because Ghana and internet is trash

353
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,720
but our school had this really special router that made it a little bit better so if people

354
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,840
wanted to watch videos they would all just go and use it on there so we I remember everybody one

355
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,240
day I just saw everybody was on youtube looking at you know clips of Naruto and it was like what's

356
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,360
what's going on like what like what like why why why is everyone looking at this weird Chinese

357
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,000
cartoon or whatever so I would ask them oh so what is this oh it's Naruto go go go on youtube and look

358
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,120
up and I look I decided to look up and I was like oh Naruto isn't that cool but what really got me was

359
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,960
was when I found was when I like played this you know Bleach game on PSP at my friend's house

360
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,160
and then I was like you know what let me look this up on the internet because I didn't know Bleach

361
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,440
had an anime either so I looked up Bleach and I found Bleach on youtube and that's like from

362
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,600
from then on I just started watching it and watching it it's funny I was like in my head I'm like wait

363
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,080
Bleach was on adult swim and then I remembered you were in Ghana yeah no no no here's the crazy

364
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,440
thing here's another crazy thing anime on TV not a thing when you live in Africa when you grew up in

365
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,480
Africa yeah that's not that crazy I'm not surprised by that I'm pulling the slightest yeah like

366
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,280
but the thing is we had we had loads of TV shows we had like band 10 we had um we had pretty much

367
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,400
anime yeah we had pretty much every Cartoon Network show and Disney show like Tom's leaving

368
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,640
but I can't tell if he already took off did you want to take off the microphone still on or not

369
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,160
he said he said he said he said he's gonna leave the recording going in case he just wants to

370
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,760
drop back in I think he didn't mute his microphone I think you can mute him well no but what if he

371
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,800
comes back well someone someone type in the chat when you get back when you get back like you

372
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,280
on mute just will tell us or I mean I don't know it's weird um but yeah so yeah I did it okay okay

373
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:12,320
yeah um wait let me go back let me go back in time let me take you on a journey yeah to me

374
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,360
in high school home star runner oh man greatest of all internet I know I mentioned this and that

375
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,520
just like you did you like it and I feel like I I can't I can't let it go I gotta go back uh

376
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,200
yeah I was I mean I was kind of on Newgrounds a bit I didn't make a habit of going there all the time

377
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,680
but I uh yeah my one of my friends he was always quoting this he was always like quoting something

378
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,760
and some like love you puff my smell was like hey man what are you talking about and he showed me

379
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,080
home star and I was wicked into home so I bought a t-shirt I bought home star and a t-shirt so I

380
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,800
wore them to school all the time it was basically the best thing ever and you made online purchases

381
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,920
in the mid-2000s I guess I did I think I asked for them for birthday presents that's another thing

382
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,160
when you're like money over the internet was the is the most weird situation because when I was a

383
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,560
kid spending money on things over the internet was such an alien concept to me which is why like

384
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,360
people ask me jimmy you pay for a cultural account as well as you and you also still

385
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,080
torrent anime it's like because I can't get the torrenting like I can't get the download mindset

386
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,800
out of my head because when you when you live when you live in Ghana when you live in Africa

387
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,000
like and you're growing up you you're you're they don't ship to you they don't ship anything to you

388
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,320
like they won't do like there are there are pure like there are some pure boxes but here's the

389
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,320
craze the funny stuff I know you guys have heard the whole Nigerian prince thing like the whole

390
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,120
you know type of thing oh god did you know what Nigeria is?

391
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,920
guess guess what happens when you owe me 10,000

392
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,480
guess what happens when loads of people from your country make a bunch of scams and end up on American

393
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,720
news your country gets blacklisted and countries around you get blacklisted on amazon and a bunch

394
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,960
of other sites so to this day a bunch of my cousins and family can't order things on amazon

395
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,200
which is absolutely fucking mental so that's wicked fuck yeah so so but like you they can

396
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,520
still order through some means like they they ship it's it's it's much more trouble than it's

397
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,200
scorched earth policy yeah it's like the whole fucking country well I mean because okay here's

398
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,120
is a weird tangent because my uncle used to be one of those guys who used to scam people I'm sorry

399
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm sorry like it's it's it's it's a real thing and like people really people really did it like

400
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,880
people he made a lot of money doing it but like my uncle used to be one of those guys who used to do it

401
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,360
and he told me stories about guys who he told me stories about guys who would like trick really

402
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,480
big business men into thinking they were ladies on the internet and like seducing seducing them

403
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,320
and telling them a bunch of crazy things and the other thing is they would they would then

404
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:05,040
seduce a bunch of rich ladies and then convince them to come to Nigeria and give them money in person

405
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,720
it was those these stories are fucking mental I know these kind because there's it's a lot of like

406
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,840
like uh like I've seen some of this second hand where it'll be like um like middle-aged women who

407
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,120
are like lonely at home and they start talking to like exotic foreigners from like Morocco and

408
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,640
yeah yeah you know and those those people have ulterior motives and they just want like a way

409
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,040
to get to the US you know which is why like which is why I feel like I have a being Nigerian also

410
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,800
being British what family Nigerian like I have this weird unique perspective when I see something

411
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,120
shifty on the internet and this has been instilled in me like from a very young age when I see

412
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,920
something shifty on the internet I I immediately call call you know call it on bullshit like

413
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,680
loads of people for example you know tinder right like the whole tinder thing oh I know a thing

414
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,040
yeah people didn't really catch like people in my college Ben well-laid patreon saint over here

415
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,480
but yeah um people didn't really know about the whole bot thing on tinder like until like yeah

416
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,760
people don't people didn't know that there were bots on tinder until like oh bots yeah I heard

417
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:27,760
but no I heard but sorry yeah the accent the accent guys I'm sorry I'm sorry but um yeah people

418
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,400
didn't know that there were like uh botted accounts in my in my in my college and I would I would be the

419
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,800
one to tell them no no like this is a bot because look all of them are pictures there's no description

420
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,920
and she's talking to you first it's a fucking trap like yeah it's a fucking trap so like I feel

421
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,280
like I was the only person who was able to figure that out purely because my childhood had indicated

422
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,360
and because the people I was raised with had indicated me into knowing like they had just

423
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,360
instigated me into knowing that oh yeah this is the you know this is how the shifty side of the

424
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,320
internet works don't trust it especially if you get really really shady friend you know friend

425
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,480
because on Facebook people people to this day don't understand that that's a bad sign it's like

426
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,920
it's weird like um last thing last thing about homestar runner when I asked my mom for for

427
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,880
homestar runner t-shirts and she she purchased me t-shirts for my birthday or whatever I remember

428
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,400
she said she was like Ben you know you should you should you should create you should make

429
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,960
something like this you should make content on the internet I mean she didn't use those words

430
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,800
but she was like this is a lucrative business here I am spending money

431
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,040
on these people that made some funny cartoon on the internet you should do something like that

432
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,720
and I was like haha yeah right mom not a damn shame I know right and now look at me now look at me

433
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,560
making content on the internet I want you to make I want you to make a t-shirt where Vincent is

434
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,840
vaping and like and like and like the the smoke the smoke from Vincent's vape just makes a logo

435
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:06,720
the vapors and then that's the t-shirt I I really need to sell a t-shirt even one t-shirt I just

436
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,520
need one oh you know what you know what I know I'll if you'll if you'll buy the first one if I if I

437
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,880
can pony up cash yeah definitely if I have one if I have one guaranteed sale it'll all be worth it

438
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,120
it'll all be worth it but definitely like done like a vapors t-shirt would be would be pretty cool

439
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,320
the digi bro t-shirt would be cool too I should fucking make it I can't yeah I can't I was thinking

440
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,520
I should make a t-shirt myself and I was like I can't put Huey Freeman on the t-shirt that's

441
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,840
copyrights since I feel like uh all of us are sort of getting towards the the like late 2000s

442
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,920
now in our stories I think I should run through my whole everything up to that point so I can

443
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,040
catch up with everybody so like so I got into the internet like pretty early like 2001 ish

444
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,720
maybe earlier well I mean I actually my parents for whatever reason and I really don't understand

445
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,680
why because they are they were not tech savvy at all until like deep into the 2000s maybe even the

446
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,640
2010s but like for whatever reason they just wanted to be like early adopters of new things so they

447
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,600
bought a computer because your parents are based as fuck that's why yeah they got they got a windows

448
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,920
me uh computer in like 98 see that's but the funny thing is like because they're not tech savvy at

449
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,080
all like they will get whatever the new thing is without having any idea if it's good or bad or

450
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,120
like how people feel about it they just because they'll walk into like Best Buy and be like

451
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,160
what's the the new computer and they'll you know Best Buy is just going to push whatever the fucking

452
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,000
newest thing is that's going to make them the most money see they bought a windows me computer

453
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,360
which uh historically is frowned upon as one of the worst operating systems I think but uh they

454
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:54,560
wouldn't have known that and I remember as like a little kid in the 90s I would I guess use like

455
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:03,200
lycos or uh yahoo or whatever like the early search engines and I would ask jeeves yeah I would search

456
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,800
I would I wonder how those ask jeeves guys feel like I want to just how they feel the fuck out

457
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,920
I feel like there's kids watching this like what the fuck is ask jeeves like who the fuck is this

458
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,560
jeeves man back in back in the day there was another search engine called ask jeeves and they

459
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,880
were going head to head with google guess who won yeah go yeah if you want to find out about ask

460
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:35,360
jeeves just google it so yeah in the late 90s like my first memories of what I would use the computer

461
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,360
for is I would search like beast wars and like I don't know if I was on like their official website

462
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,920
or whatever but they'd have like little like thumbnails of screenshots from the show and I

463
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,280
would just print those out like we had a printer like a color printer and I would just print out

464
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,000
all these fucking like a whole sheet of paper with just a little thumbnail like a youtube thumbnail

465
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,480
sized picture of something from beast wars because that was my favorite show and I thought it was

466
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,320
like so cool to have like all these and I had like a I had just like a stack of printed out

467
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,520
beast wars pictures in my room and then later when I got into pokemon I would spend a lot of time

468
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,600
on the pokemon website because they had like a full pokedex on there and at one point I like drew

469
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,240
all the pokemon from the pokedex and they had all this other shit but like at that point it was

470
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,320
just like you know website like I knew about a website connected to a show kind of like what

471
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:33,680
jimmy was saying earlier yeah and then like um I don't know exactly how I like discovered the

472
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,160
concept of forums again I think my mom was getting into the matter at the same time in 2001 but I

473
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,600
was really into yugioh and I found a yugioh forum um so I made an account there I think my name was

474
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,400
just like a string of ones like it was that kind of thing like I would forget my password all the

475
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,360
time because it would be something stupid and I just make a bunch of new accounts for the names

476
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:00,160
or just more ones um and then I would post on this yugioh forum and then like I was there for a

477
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,120
little while and then I think my cousin started getting into the internet around the same time

478
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:11,840
and he would like do use it for research on anime because we got into anime in like 01 and 02 and so

479
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:17,760
like he would start actually you know what this is all 2002 jump jump it forward a year uh he would

480
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,000
start like uh trying to find new information about anime and stuff and I think he found like anime

481
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,280
news network around the time he found uh he found he would find these different forums and so we both

482
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:36,160
became a part of a forum called otaku boards and I would spend all fucking day on otaku boards

483
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,040
like all I did was read and post there and um there were like a few other like anime forums but

484
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,880
otaku boards was my favorite one because they had more of like a tightly knit community where people

485
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,120
kind of knew who each other were whereas a lot of the other ones would just be like people posting

486
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:56,000
into the void um there was like anime suki forums I found that like a little bit later uh but yeah

487
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,600
I was like really big into forums because it was a place where you could like share your thoughts

488
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,840
on things and read what other people are saying and I loved knowing about like what what what people

489
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,080
are like into you know like all the anime we would watch would be like stuff that people were

490
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,200
recommending in the forums so like we knew about Eva because everyone would talk about Evan Gellion

491
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,920
and how it's like supposedly the best anime ever so like we went out and bought the DVDs and and

492
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,680
Helsing was really popular for some reason so like like yeah that was a huge part of me getting

493
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,400
into anime was through forums and then of course like I said he was using line wire and ruining my

494
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,360
computers um and then like I discovered the game FAQs forums and would hang out in there uh and

495
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,320
talk about Tales of Symphonia because like every game has its own forum on game FAQs so I got really

496
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,760
obsessed with the Tales of Symphonia forums and then from there me and a few people from that

497
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,040
started up like a freeboards thing where it was like just you know like 10 people on this forum

498
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:01,040
and let me tell you there is nothing in this world that is probably worse for a 14 year old

499
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:08,800
than being a part of like a tightly knit group of teenagers on the internet so so it just so

500
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,840
happened that we started this forum like right around the time that I was becoming like really

501
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,800
depressed uh my parents uh were fighting a lot like their marriage wasn't going so well um I I

502
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,760
we we switched I switched schools like we moved to the ghetto and this was when I went to a school

503
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,320
where I was like the only white kid there and I didn't make any friends so I would just hole up

504
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,960
in my mom's office because she was one who had a computer and I would sit on the forums all day

505
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,840
and we had the the fucking worst internet connection because we couldn't afford it at the time so like

506
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:47,440
it would take like two and a half minutes to load a page like of a forum so what I would do is I

507
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,600
would get into conversations with people on like this message board and like I would type a message

508
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,240
and hit send and then just sit there waiting you know and just and then I would reload the

509
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,640
page every couple of minutes until they would respond and just talk to people that way and

510
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,520
like I was in all these like everyone had like all these emotional relationships and stuff it's

511
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,240
like a bad anime like it whenever you see those romantic comedy shows where it's like everyone's

512
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,400
in love with someone else and the relationships keep changing like that's what it was like

513
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,240
were there were there girls in that group there were but I'm pretty like there was one girl in

514
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:27,520
there that I was like in love with and in retrospect I am convinced was a troll like I am 100%

515
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:34,080
convinced that they were running like a really high level trolling operation on me like I'm

516
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,640
convinced of it I don't have any evidence but like it just seems that way from like looking back on

517
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,680
it with what I know now it's like yeah I'm pretty sure this is like an extensive trolling operation

518
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,280
yeah I feel like despite despite everybody despite everything I said about not actually

519
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,840
making any friends on the internet and not actually talking to anyone there was this one girl who

520
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,440
wasn't necessarily she wasn't necessarily like someone I met through a forum she was like a

521
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,920
friend of a friend but yeah the only interaction I ever I've ever had with her in my entire life

522
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,760
is through the internet like he introduced me to her through Facebook and then we moved from

523
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,800
Facebook to MSN and I don't know if kids there's another thing kids aren't gonna fucking know about

524
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:25,040
back before Skype was a thing guys MSN MSN messenger was lit I was an AIM guy myself

525
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:35,040
oh yeah those AIM Yahoo MSN and fucking AOL Skype killed them all Skype murdered every single one

526
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:41,040
of them everyone in my high school we all we when we weren't in school we would talk through AIM

527
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,680
yeah like it used to be really segmented it used to be really segmented and then Skype came and

528
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,720
just wiped them all and now discord is slowly coming and just wiping off Skype so like it's uh

529
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:01,360
I remember uh I was I was really into fanfiction.net oh man I I printed out I printed out fan fiction

530
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,880
stories that I found of interest including some saucy ones uh many saucy ones actually I printed

531
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,840
out some uh a legend of Dragoon uh saucy fanfiction and I had a big thick folder I took it to school

532
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:19,040
and I showed my friends I was like look at these saucy fan fictions my friends uh well are you

533
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,880
are you not are you not entertained around that's around that period is when I was writing saucy

534
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:33,360
fan fictions and posting them to fanfiction.net I hope oh god I never found it did you ever

535
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,480
read Tales of Symphonia fanfics oh no never I feel like I feel like did you just like oh well

536
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:45,920
you know and that was my old stomping ground back in the day so so through those forums is how I

537
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,240
learned about like you know a lot of internet stuff like again fanfiction.net was a was what I

538
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,040
knew about and like mostly websites because like I never got into like the whole downloading and

539
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,000
shit just because like my internet was so bad and like online gaming was a total mystery to me

540
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,760
because that the idea of having a good enough connection to do anything like that online was

541
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,080
you know not a thing I feel like I feel like the more I now that I've moved to America and I'm

542
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:18,400
starting to look back on my life and my childhood I'm learning that more and more of my personal

543
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:25,440
gripes and grievances are very very tied into where I grew up because when I was growing up in

544
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,880
Ghana and like I would again Ghana Nigeria to go like oh I say grown up in Ghana but I was

545
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,520
growing up in like three different countries but it's weird like when I was growing up there

546
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,880
it was like I had a console I would play video games my parents would like I would never buy them

547
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,640
there but like my parents would always travel to like America or England and buy me video games

548
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,120
all the time and I'll be playing I'll play pretty much all the same games you guys played

549
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,640
you know had a regular childhood and everything but like I would never play them online every single

550
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,720
game I tried to play online the internet was way too slow for it to work I I could never like

551
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,800
actually spend enough time or actually like actively be you know concerned enough with the

552
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,600
internet to try and play games the types of games I liked playing would were usually single player

553
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:18,880
games so I gravitated away from online gaming so yeah so oh let me finish this a little bit

554
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:25,600
yeah sure go ahead like the the whole concept of online gaming to me felt really pointless and alien

555
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,760
for the longest time and up until now I'm seeing people say that online gaming is the only true

556
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:39,520
way to play video games like the fuck it is like I don't I don't I don't get the online gaming meme

557
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:46,240
why can't it die like that that should be please time travel me back time travel me back to that

558
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,640
fucking podcast online gaming is a meme that needs to die I think we actually did bring that

559
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,560
that part didn't we I don't think you did I had a bunch of I had a bunch of friends when I was in

560
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,600
I don't know how a teenager or whatever that played Ragnarok online and I went up and I and I

561
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,880
thought that the graphics looked really cool it was like it looked like online a little fancier

562
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,200
yeah it looked really cool and I really wanted to play it but like I couldn't fucking make it work

563
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,160
on my computer for whatever reason I actually I did event I did eventually get a final fantasy

564
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,040
it was 11 the online one yeah yeah I did eventually get final fantasy 11 it was like a big event me

565
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,760
and me and Nate both got it and we were both like wicked stoked to play it but like it was it was

566
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,520
terrible I mean it was bad for me I could not be asked to fucking form up a part I didn't want to

567
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,720
fuck around complicated ass game I just wanted to play it solo and build up a character and have

568
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,040
a cool looking red mage with a big red hat that's all I wanted but I did not want to fuck around

569
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,000
building parties and grinding and all that shit so I gave up I gave up online was actually the first

570
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,320
online game that I did play and that was in like 03 which is way before I knew how those things

571
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,920
worked but again my cousin was around and like we would get these I don't remember how I'm assuming

572
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,480
it had something to do with the anime stuff that we were buying but we would get these like free

573
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:08,480
trials for for Ragnarok like a seven day free trial disc kind of thing like in the mail I guess

574
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,600
probably with like anime magazines I don't know but um yeah I had like these trial discs for that

575
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,800
so I actually got to play that um like very briefly in those years and I thought it was the

576
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,080
by far the coolest thing that had ever happened in the universe like it was fucking awesome the

577
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:29,360
music alone in that game is incredible and I did eventually get to play it later because like

578
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,720
you know after this part that I'm talking about like for me it was like 2006 the internet opened

579
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,920
up massively because this was when we moved out of the ghetto we moved into a nicer house we finally

580
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,040
got like decent internet for the first time and it was like all at once uh YouTube started being a

581
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,640
thing and I found out about that through like again like people literally just linking videos on forums

582
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,120
I was like what is this thing you know um so I got I found out about YouTube then uh we had a good

583
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,840
enough connection that we started playing um World of Warcraft uh because Victor really wanted to

584
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:08,720
play it and he got my parents bought him for his birthday a mac book or not book but uh a mac computer

585
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,760
um it was like one of the first generations where they had the the computer built into the screen

586
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,240
so it's like a fatter screen than the ones they have now but it's not oh yeah yeah yeah I think

587
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,120
my aunt has one of those my aunt has one of those that they don't they don't actually have like a

588
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,640
standard cpu like tower they have just a screen and it's all in there yeah I remember those yeah

589
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,360
so she so he had one of those and they got it for him because like they told the people at Best Buy

590
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:40,880
that he wanted to like make like movies and stuff on it you know oh boy again again the mac is for art

591
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:48,320
meme the mac is for art meme it wasn't even the mac is for art meme it was that they showed my parents

592
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:54,080
like i-movie and garage band and my parents were in like photo booth which are like the you know

593
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:00,240
stock programs it comes with i-movie is like you can put clip it's like the windows movie maker of

594
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,560
no no no I have I've used i-movie i-movie is a it's like a tiny team to step up from windows

595
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,200
movie maker but it's still shit like well the the best thing about i-movie is that you could record

596
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,840
in the program and the mac they got him had a built-in uh camera on top so like a built-in webcam

597
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,560
so you can actually record directly into i-movie we made a bunch of dumb like action figure movies

598
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,200
that way and then uh it had photo booth which was like you could take a picture and do like all the

599
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,600
weird little distortion effects like the instagram type shit but that was enough that they showed

600
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,320
that to my parents in the store and they were so impressed with those effects that like you could

601
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,880
make you could take a picture and make it black and white it was like mind-blowing to them so they

602
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,320
bought this mac computer for Vic and he would play world of warcraft on it and uh

603
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,520
and then basically because my computer had again had been ruined so it couldn't go online at all

604
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,840
and what i would do is i would get on victor's computer while he was at school um and like

605
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:05,200
like he was in middle school and i was starting high school so like there was a two hour point

606
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,400
before he would get home after i got home and then i would also wake up early in the morning

607
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:17,200
and i'd gotten on to did any of you guys read megatocchio back in the day uh back in the day

608
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:24,240
i like megatocchio the website yeah the web webcomic oh the webcomic yeah i think i think

609
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:30,240
i did i think i've at least heard of it yeah megatocchio was a big webcomic from the uh like

610
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,520
2003 which i read a lot of those back i've read like all of sluggy freelance and all of megatocchio

611
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,640
and like a bunch of those old webcomics um but i was really into megatocchio back then and then

612
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:47,280
i got back into it in 2000 like late 2006 early 2007 and i started hanging out in the forums

613
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,120
because i figured out they had a forum there oh this is one of those OELs okay yeah it's an OEL

614
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:00,480
manga and it's like the OEL manga like the the first like big popular one um yeah my friend

615
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,720
who who does comics now he he told he told me about this yeah continue yeah um and it was

616
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,640
because the thing about megatocchio is that it was like it was an OEL but whereas most of those

617
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,760
are inspired by people who grew up on like DBZ and shit like that like the guy who wrote megatocchio

618
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,400
was a fucking otaku and like the biggest influences on it were canon and air the visual novels like

619
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,600
this is way before those had anime adaptations he would talk about canon all the fucking time

620
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,640
and like it wasn't until 2006 that that became a popular anime show you know like now everyone

621
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:40,960
knows what aclanat is but back then that was really obscure shit so uh so this dude was like

622
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,840
you know hugely visual novel influenced and um and as a result like the people in the forums

623
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,200
were like to this day like a lot of the biggest anime fans that i follow are people i knew from

624
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,640
the megatocchio forums and like through those forums it just so happened that like everyone

625
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,880
had an anime blog and they were all on wordpress and uh even the guy who was the admin of the forums

626
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,520
um the guy named omo uh who i still follow his fucking anime blog to this day um they all had

627
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,480
these anime blogs and i saw all those and i decided to make my own anime blog just kind of to follow

628
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,800
the crowd you know and it was through them that i found out about like both like internet streaming

629
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:29,440
of anime and that it was being subtitled by fans because up till this point i had only seen anime

630
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,800
either through cartoon network or through buying dvds and um i didn't know at all that you could

631
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:41,600
download it or watch it online so they were telling me like you know about all these shows that were

632
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:47,200
brand new that uh just started um in japan hold on i have to unmute tom real quick oh okay he's back

633
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,600
he's back hey tom he's back um yeah so so you so you caught up to like i won't say caught up but

634
00:58:53,600 --> 00:59:01,280
like you were in on the front lines of the airing shows kind of thing fairly early yeah well i mean

635
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,920
for for a lot of those people in the megatocchio forums a lot of them were like older anime fans

636
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,520
who'd been trading tapes in the 90s like that kind of shit you know so they were just all so you were

637
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:18,320
so you just stumbled upon second boomers you just yeah i i somehow randomly managed to like the first

638
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,120
anime community i was really a part of it was like a good even split between people who were like new

639
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,600
like me who were just finding out about like new airing shows or had been into it for like a couple

640
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:32,160
of years and then other people who were like long time people who'd been torrenting for

641
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,680
fucking since it was a thing to torrent you know so like everyone in here like really knew their

642
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,640
shit and they were talking about these these new airing shows and like um you know i just found

643
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,720
out about like haruhi and i i watched all of haruhi on youtube in like probably 240p or something

644
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,680
like that and like uh because this was before copyright was oh man like that's that's that's

645
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,400
another that's another conjuncture point watching anime on youtube kids yeah remember when you could

646
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:06,560
watch anime on youtube remember what that was oh god yeah but um one two one three

647
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,840
with the stuff these guys were watching it was stuff that was you know it was only getting

648
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,160
fansubbed and no one else on the internet had heard of it so you really had to be someone who

649
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,560
like knew about these shows if you wanted to watch them but there was a site that had pretty much

650
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:28,080
every fansubbed anime on it it was if this was not the best streaming site in terms of like quality

651
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:34,640
of video or uh being able to full screen if you didn't have a paid account you had to watch if you

652
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,560
didn't have a paid account on this illegal website you had to watch everything in a tiny little screen

653
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:45,760
in like the minimum quality and it was like it was like especially small and you had to watch

654
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,200
everything that way but this website had every fucking anime on it get yeah guess what the name

655
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,000
were these the early days of crunchy roll this was crunchy roll in 2007 of course it was the most

656
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:06,320
illegal website in the world crunchy roll which had every anime ever on it so i watched like all

657
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:13,920
these shows that like all these obscure anime come yeah well that's the thing i think the reason

658
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,600
that crunchy roll was able to become legitimate so easily is because they had a pay structure in place

659
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,480
because even though it was illegal they you had to have an account to like watch stuff in certain

660
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,400
ways so i think because they already had like a system of paying for their content it was very

661
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,880
easy for them to legitimize it you know the point that really it's like something that happened very

662
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,520
recently that just fucked with my head i saw a television ad for crunchy roll while i was watching

663
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,720
it yeah with anamon agucci said yeah and i was watching awesome and then i was like watching like

664
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,680
stuff like sao and a bunch of shows that would that will never get on american tv in this ad

665
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,640
and i was just like fucking holy shit i saw that ad not on card to network i saw it on like regular

666
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,080
tv like my parents were watching tv and it was on and i was like what the fuck crunchy roll i think

667
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:08,080
it's for you for you you were there in the genesis of that shit like dude jimmy did you know that

668
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:14,320
crunchy roll is about to start doing dvds and blu rays like they're licensing now i think because

669
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,440
they said apparently they're gonna dub cabinary and release it on dvd oh man i just read that the

670
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,840
other day so yeah that's how far they've come but yeah so it was like crunchy roll and a few

671
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:32,880
other like wherever i could find the episodes of these shows um and then like everything this is

672
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:39,360
like the fire nation attacked moment for me like the moment because when crunchy roll started taking

673
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,920
out everyone else like no no no uh the the fire nation attack moment came later in 2007 so at

674
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,440
this point i you know i've learned about anime blogs i've made all these friends with these

675
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,400
people who know all this just deeper stuff about anime and like i think there's like when you want

676
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,920
i think all of us can generally agree that a big part of this is finding out about something and

677
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,000
wanting it and then having to go learn how to get it like you find out about oh there's anime

678
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:10,800
that's being fansub that comes out in japan right now and so now your mission in life is to learn

679
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,080
how to get it you know like for example like i was just talking earlier like before the podcast

680
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:21,920
started about watching about reading a bunch of comic books and like start getting into getting

681
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,520
back into comics and learning how comics worked like it was it kind of you know it was kind of

682
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,120
nostalgic because i was learning how to get into a thing i wanted to do that you kind of have to

683
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,360
jump through hoops for because you have to you have to you have to download a bunch you have to

684
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,760
download a bunch of fucking cbrs off the internet and if they're not in cbr form you have to download

685
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,040
image sets then convert them to cbr form and then put them on your phone or no then download

686
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,600
comic book readers a bunch of crazies i think that what what i think is the biggest difference

687
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,560
between what the internet is now and what it was in the 2000s and i think it was like i think the

688
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:01,360
internet continued developing in the same direction through the whole 2000s until the very end and then

689
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,600
in like 2010 it completely snapped and went in the opposite direction but this is what i think

690
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:11,200
people who are new to the internet won't understand is that nowadays the internet is all about

691
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,080
streamlining and putting everything in one place and it used to be that the internet was about

692
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:22,560
having to go fucking everywhere to find something exactly because yes everyone had their own website

693
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,120
for example for example who here used to who here used to read manga week to week on like you

694
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:35,360
know like maybe it would be bleach it'll be now it'll be whatever we had yeah in my school when

695
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:41,920
i was growing up we had like hardcore analytical arguments one manga lets you enlarge the picture

696
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,840
this way does this way no no no no no no no no no no no no no manga volume is the best thing

697
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:56,320
is like did she says there were so many places you could go to yeah like everybody had their

698
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,280
place to go everybody had their like there was anime advice there was anime like those

699
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:07,840
dude i gotta say this is not really related but the i remember the first time i ever saw an hd

700
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:14,720
video stream like when youtube first rolled it out and it was fucking um jizz in my pants by

701
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,800
lonely island like the official music video was like full hd and i remember seeing it and it was

702
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:26,640
like blowing my mind into pieces because it was so good looking the thing is i like when i when

703
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,280
they first rolled that out when they first rolled that out like the you know actually let me this

704
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,960
oh okay here's a weird dichotomy actually this is a weird part of my internet story my my trips to

705
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:43,120
america before i started living here that that's a very interesting part because every time it

706
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:48,880
will you know okay maybe i'll use mmo logic for this if i was leveling up regularly and grinding

707
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,600
regularly when i was in Ghana and that was the normal progression every time i moved to america

708
01:05:53,600 --> 01:06:00,720
it was like free exp day because i would go there i would come here and the internet was faster

709
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,640
because i was already savvy on how to get around the internet my only big block was the fact that

710
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:10,240
it was fucking slow now i already knew where to watch all the all the anime i wanted oh you

711
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,560
you guys are talking about how yeah you guys are talking about how like you know you would never

712
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:20,240
you would leave videos on from morning till evening i told you this but i remember loading

713
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:26,640
eight episodes of shaman king before i went to school coming back and yeah i remember specifically

714
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:33,520
that with uh spaceship operators because the whole show was on youtube and i opened up tabs of

715
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,520
every video and left them running the whole time i was at school and then came home and marathoned

716
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:45,360
the show um and that was in 07 but like oh sorry uh yeah well to get through the rest of this uh

717
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,640
part of my story like through all those uh forums and stuff like through mega tokyo and other forums

718
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,120
like that i started to find like the best part was that people would always link you to some like

719
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:00,480
database somewhere like uh anime news network is like the reason i've always known so much

720
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,520
shit about the backgrounds of like anime people is because i would just go to anime news network

721
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,160
and like read the whole staff lists of shows and stuff because they've they've they've consistently

722
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:16,560
yeah consistently they like i don't like the staff and they don't like me no no the people who run

723
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:21,920
anime news network are terrible but they are generally a great encyclopedia site it's a very

724
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,080
good encyclopedia like they they they have very they have very do you want to know why because

725
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:31,600
they get a bunch of interns who speak japanese and they just like they just i will say that my anime

726
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:38,240
list is slowly catching up with their encyclopedia but anna is still way more useful in general but

727
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,080
but mal has pictures for everything and that makes it a lot easier to find shit but uh but

728
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:50,000
anyway um and then there was like encyclopedia metalum which like is a metal encyclopedia and

729
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:56,160
pretentious metal fans will always tell you that if it's not listed on that website it's not metal

730
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,800
so if you if there's some band that you think is metal and it's not listed there it's not metal but

731
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,920
they have thousands and thousands of metal bands is baby metal there is baby metal there uh i'm not

732
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,920
sure i haven't checked they probably are because they're definitely metal but like i would go on

733
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,200
there and just search like uh like the category of avant-garde metal and then just listen to every

734
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:21,040
band on there so like a lot of how i the reason i have such a like ridiculously broad like knowledge

735
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,160
with most of the stuff i'm interested in is that i would just go to these like encyclopedia sites and

736
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,640
then just look up everything and i wanted to have all the knowledge that's the reason why people

737
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,000
ask me like how do you know so much about tokusatsu video games comment books etc bro fucking wikis

738
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,800
man exactly just go like i remember when i was a kid go fucking research when i was a kid i would

739
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,960
open up wicked because the thing is i would do a lot of reading because that was the only thing

740
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,880
i could consistently do easily without because video was out of the question when you're when

741
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,560
you're living in Ghana video was it because it would take too long to load so if something had a

742
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,800
video that had to that to watch like i couldn't watch anime but i could read about a whole

743
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:01,920
ton of them like i could i could read about a whole shit that's why i like i it's so rare for

744
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,480
someone to name an anime and i've never heard of it even if i haven't seen it like i probably know

745
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:11,680
what it's about because i've done so much research but like so i would i'll just sit down and read

746
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:18,080
for hours like old comic book stories from like the 80s and that's how i learned so much about

747
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,440
the flash that's how i learned so much about spider-man that's how i read through wikipedia

748
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:30,400
like through wikipedia text the entire clone saga which i then recently actually read through it the

749
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,000
comic book version i'll read the wikipedia version if you want that story the comic books are actually

750
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,120
completely fucking terrible anyway to get back to how like chaotic the internet was at the time

751
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,560
though like when because when i finally got into fansubs like torrenting had you know it'd become

752
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,520
a big thing but there was a lot of fansub groups who had been around since like the irc days and

753
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:58,160
they were like they were like really like i remember um live evil which is i think they're

754
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,360
still around um they they do like obscure 80s stuff and like they had put out this video for

755
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,600
the first episode of kimigure orange road and they put in like this whole intro at the start

756
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,200
where they were explaining like how people used to like watch kimigure orange road like by

757
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,400
shipping tapes around the world and like you know like hard coding fansubs onto the fucking tapes

758
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:24,640
like onto the actual yeah people don't people don't people don't realize like back i man i've

759
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,440
said this so many times if i could if i had the resources if i had like the the know how resources

760
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:39,920
and people to know i would organize a giant long form no giant long form like documentary on the

761
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,640
history of fansubbing yeah that would be great like like if you've got otaku no video does a

762
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,760
little bit of it yeah it does a little bit of it but i want i want i want i want like fucking a

763
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,200
giant long form because this is guy that this guy otaku do otaku guy or something otaking

764
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:01,760
otaking he made a weird little like you know opinionated video on what was wrong with fansubs

765
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,880
in his brief slide and actually that does factor into our into our story because there was a point

766
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:14,160
in fansubbing where they would fucking sub the complete wrong way they would fucking add all of

767
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:20,640
the weird japanese text in and oh yeah see you know translator notes out the wazoo it was it was

768
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,040
actually a mess and now it's become a lot more streamlined because of sites like crunchyroll

769
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,680
who right well that's kind of what i'm getting to is like with that live evil group like they

770
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:34,000
would talk they talked about how that history and then they were like very adamantly like

771
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,360
you have to come to our irc to download our shows because to them there was like the sense of

772
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,680
community was like a big part of like why they did fansubbing and that was true for a lot of

773
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:50,320
fansub groups and so like in the 2000s there was this huge shift where because like everyone wanted

774
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,880
stuff faster so fansub groups were were trying to pick up their speed and get stuff out as quick as

775
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:01,120
possible and everyone was torrenting and we had sites like tokyo toshokan and nia torrents which

776
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:07,120
are still around which are where like the big anime resource sites didn't baka didn't baka bt come

777
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,080
around around that time as well yeah and baka bt has always been like the one that's like great for

778
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,360
archiving shows like they have lots of full shows from like like they'll have the full highest quality

779
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,000
version of the show and uh they always had a rule where if you're a member you have to have like a

780
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,360
good seating ratio or else you get blocked um which happened to me a few times but yeah uh so so

781
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,360
there was these different torrent sites and like because people would just go there because they

782
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,240
would have you know every torrent then no one would talk to the fansubbers and people kept

783
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,560
getting more demanding of the fansubs people would complain that they weren't going fast enough people

784
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,280
would uh you know not really care about who's doing it they just want the product and so

785
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:54,000
like fansubbers hated it they hated the speed subbing culture because it was getting away from

786
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,160
like what you know what they had seen it as but then one streaming showed up it just killed all of

787
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:04,400
it because there was no point anymore because everyone wants stuff immediately and so if it gets

788
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:09,520
simulcast on Funimation and Crunchyroll and like even if the subs aren't the best like because there's

789
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,440
a lot of people who hate those subs for whatever reason because they can't understand Japanese

790
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,960
well enough for it not to matter like I can but the show comes out on Crunchyroll and then immediately

791
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,320
gets ripped by horrible subs and immediately put on uh Tokyo Toshio and that's everyone's

792
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,480
gonna watch it yeah on yeah that's how but a crazy thing is that kind of reminds me about

793
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,960
something that's been happening to me recently because I've been watching this Japanese action

794
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,680
series called High and Low it's a live action it's a live action martial arts series about

795
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:44,240
delinquent gangs in Tokyo and the the only person you can fucking get this show from there's only

796
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:49,440
one person you can get the show from in English only one person translating it because if you go

797
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:54,640
to kiss kiss asian which is like the drama site for where they have all the common writer stuff

798
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,480
they don't have all of the second season there's only one person on the internet who subbed

799
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:06,000
everything so far and her name is Yuri or Stormichu and I found this person by a complete

800
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,840
accident and they run a little tumblr site where she lists she'll list of raw she'll list a hard

801
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,160
sub version she'll she just you know and she talks to you about the she even has a thing where

802
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:22,240
you can watch and she has like her like commentary in in sub form along the top of the series along

803
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:27,040
top of the show and like I talked to on face on on on twitter sometimes I send her messages like oh

804
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:31,760
wow this episode was great and I was like shit this reminds me of like back when I was a kid

805
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,760
talking to the fansubbers right this reminds me it was yeah it was a blast from the past I I mean

806
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,880
I had to I for me and I finally getting to that moment I mentioned earlier that I completely

807
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,080
didn't actually say what it was the big explosion moment for me was when I met my friend Donsan

808
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:54,880
who I talked about in the never going outside podcast that he was the most internet savvy guy

809
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,360
ever because all he did was read everything on the internet because he was a hikikomori so he

810
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,400
taught like as soon as I met him like I knew about torrents but I didn't know how they worked

811
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,400
something like he was disgusted that I was watching streams he was like he was like uh how can you

812
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:17,040
watch in low quality you need it to be HD which HD at the time meant 480p but I will I will never

813
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:22,560
forget that the first thing he taught me how to do I downloaded shakugan no shana and I watched all

814
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,960
of it in downloads and it was the most beautiful show I'd ever seen because it was like oh my god

815
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,320
this looks amazing and so I got really into torrenting and I would because I picked this up from him

816
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,480
that uh you know this was before external hard drives were really cheap but what he would do is

817
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:48,480
he would buy stacks of CDs and DVDs and just burn en mass like anime downloads onto them as storage

818
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,840
so like I I did the same thing I have like all these old DVDs of like you know like suku yomi and

819
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,200
like all these 2006 era shows that I downloaded and like burn to CDs and they're all sitting

820
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:05,920
somewhere I remember yeah I remember when I first learned how to use torrents right

821
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:12,640
like obviously the idea of that like when I was young when I was younger the idea of downloading

822
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:18,000
something sodding off to go watch youtube and like in 20 minutes it would be done was a was a dream

823
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,040
that was a dream what you would do when I was a kid you'd that you'd wait till everyone's about

824
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:29,840
to sleep start the torrent go to bed wake up and it's it's halfway done that's what torrents would

825
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,200
take me like days like if I was downloading the whole show it was gonna be a few days before I got

826
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,400
to watch it you were nurturing it it was like you were nurturing it it was like it was like a like

827
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,840
a little project like you're taking care of it took a long time for like it wasn't until really like

828
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,200
the last year that it got like way better for me because of the fact that as internet speeds were

829
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:58,400
picking up so too were the file sizes yeah exactly there was a time where one episode of anime was

830
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:07,040
like under a hundred megabytes and now it's like half a gig at minimum you know so well I mean if

831
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:13,680
you watch all everything at 1080 yeah it's half a gig but I sell for 720 because I do too because

832
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:20,400
most anime doesn't actually broadcast in 1080 like yeah it looks like a movie then you gotta I

833
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,840
remember when I fucking downloaded paprika and it was like 10 gigs and I was like what the fuck

834
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:32,400
like this is not possible there's no way oh man that's not that's not the really didn't care for it

835
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,000
oh you've expressed that on the show before but I haven't seen it it's been talking up 10 gigs of

836
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,280
my fucking hard drive for 10 years it's acceptable it's an acceptable no because no okay so where

837
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:52,160
everything picked up for me like was the late 2000s because I was in boarding school and again

838
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,800
this wasn't because of any friend this wasn't because of any like you know mystical otaku

839
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:02,160
otaku person who came into my life and whisked me away into a magical land of weird bonus like I

840
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:07,600
this felt like this was more because I was getting fewer and fewer friends I was being driven more

841
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:13,520
and more into the depths of the internet like because I was in boarding school and I hated everyone

842
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,000
and well I mean being friends with don son didn't take me out of the internet at all because we

843
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,760
only talked online like he was a hikikomori like even though he lived in my town we didn't hang out

844
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,760
as much as we just sat on yahoo messenger all day and like message each other and like and it wasn't

845
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,000
just that he took because he taught me a lot of different stuff like I threw him I figured out

846
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,960
exactly how to use IRC and I would use that to like download manga and stuff and at one point I was

847
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:45,920
part of a scanslation team uh you know with an IRC channel um which you just go through you just

848
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:52,400
go through all the motions of being a weird yeah the internet right I had I I was a I was a proof

849
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,680
reader for a group called rice ball issues where I would just take the stuff and make it sound better

850
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:06,320
in English and uh fun fact and this is before anyone had heard of anything that this author had

851
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:14,880
ever done in the in the u.s. no no no no I knew about him by this point I was the proof reader

852
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,640
and this is if you go if you go read this chapter online on any of the websites I've checked and it's

853
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:28,880
it's the one I proof read uh excel world chapter one reiki kawahara's excel world uh the guy who

854
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:36,240
would go on to make sword on your most your most hated fucking show of all time I I proof read

855
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:42,560
chapter one of that and I got you're bound by you're bound to him forever yeah but I want I want

856
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,920
everyone in the audience to know this if you've ever read chapter one of that of that comic like

857
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,640
they were telling me because I I wanted to write like a lot of swears into it like in places where

858
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,880
it made sense and like I did get like they let me there was like a punk character and they let me go

859
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:03,360
all out with making him swear like crazy but there's a part where the fat kid like uh he gets like

860
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,240
this lunch made for him by this cute girl and he's a piece of shit so he throws the lunch on the ground

861
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:14,720
and he runs away and the way the framing of the panel is the only translation that would fit there

862
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:21,760
was I'm so fucked up the shinji ikari and I really wanted that there and they wouldn't let me because

863
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,640
they said he wouldn't swear because his language isn't that like you know and I was like oh fuck you

864
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:32,240
so if you're reading that go read it and change it in your head make him say I'm so fucked up there

865
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:39,680
it fits so perfectly and I was always mad that they made me change that um let me tell a story

866
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,520
of my internet life this is the greatest story this is the greatest deed I ever did this is the

867
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:51,840
ultimate chapter of my life I'll never top this this is the story of how I bend saint uh like

868
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:59,680
saint george slaying the dragon uh slew slew the dragon kin I slew the other kin forums

869
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:06,320
oh what did you what do you mean by slew well I'll tell you digi I'll tell you how this went down

870
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:12,560
I was on 4chan in like probably 2007 2008 now I never got hugely into 4chan culture I was never a

871
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,920
big poster but it did expose me to a lot of the shit that was out there and I came to understand

872
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:24,000
the other kin and what they were and the the concept of the other kin filled me with more

873
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,360
intellectual rage than than anything had up to that point just the just the way that they would

874
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:34,560
play fast and loose with their definitions the way that they would twist their words to to change

875
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,120
their reality to be what they wanted it to be the way that they could they could just define

876
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,080
being a dragon to be whatever they wanted it to so they could say oh I'm a dragon I'm a fairy

877
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,080
it made me so mad so of course I had to go and be with them on the internet so I went and I found

878
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:56,960
the other kin forums and I logged in and I made a fucking manifesto of a serial killer and I and I

879
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:02,880
made and I made like a persona for myself I was I was an angel kin and I went in there and I told

880
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,680
them guys I think I'm an angel and they were like this is where ben saint comes from by chance

881
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,240
probably all wrapped up in the same sort of neuroses so I so I was like I think I feel like a

882
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:19,920
connection to heaven and stuff I'm an angel kin and they were like cool totally and so I I started

883
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,600
telling them stories for my life and and but I started I started making shit up I started being

884
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:32,640
like today today I close my eyes and I and I felt my phantom wings I felt like you know six wings

885
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:38,320
from my back and they were like cool cool and then I was like today I today I passed my hand over

886
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,040
the hand over my friend and I blessed him with knowledge and he got a 100 this is exactly the

887
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:49,840
kind of trolling that I think was happening to me with that goal like it was exactly this brand

888
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,880
of trolling that I was experiencing and and I just I just got more and more out there with that I

889
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,480
said today I closed I can I can see with my eyes closed I can tell the future I have legitimate

890
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,520
superpowers I was like guys I have fucking superpowers hold up for just a second hold up for

891
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,920
just a second I'm looking I'm looking at the first chapter of excel world right now and I'm seeing

892
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,600
this guy I don't see this character say Arita you pigly little bitch don't fuck around with me

893
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:25,360
that's how you know I translated that you pig like a bitch only I would have put that that's pretty

894
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:32,880
good oh boy I gotta say wait proofreader said that said that said that was that something

895
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:39,200
that was you all right all right all right all right anyway anyway the point is eventually I got

896
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,120
banned right because they eventually figured out I was a troll because I was just because I was just

897
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,760
a superhero I was just telling them an actual superhero origin story I see but I wasn't giving up

898
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,360
I came back and I had a new identity and this time I was a mind I was a mind flayer from Dungeons

899
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,080
and Dragons I had the soul of a mind flayer and the thing about that is that it's not a

900
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,040
mythological creature Gary Gygax just made it up in the 70s it's like totally invented from whole

901
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:08,640
cloth but I pretended that it had this big mythical backstory eventually I got banned then I came back

902
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:14,880
with another persona and this persona I was I was I was a Japanese kami I was a spirit but the

903
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:23,840
spirit was of what I was a spirit of fatness I was a guy who just who just loved to eat I was

904
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,960
just like yes I that would be a thing that would be a Japanese deity there's a god of everything

905
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:34,560
yeah I weigh like 600 pounds and I'm only gonna get fatter I love being fat I love how fat I am

906
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,840
I'm going to become more fat and I identify personally on a spiritual level with my fat

907
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,560
that would get you double that would get you double love from both the the otherkin community

908
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:51,040
and the and like the people who are proud to be fucking fat yeah yeah yeah yeah and they found

909
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:56,240
this very offensive I was I was banned for that too and I was I was just fed up I was like these

910
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,920
fucks these fucking assholes won't let me express myself these these these people just these people

911
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,320
don't care about truth these people only care about but they just want sit to be the way they

912
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,040
want it to be and someone comes in with a different opinion and a different viewpoint and it scares

913
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,600
them and they hate it so I went on 4chan and I don't remember how I did it but the point is I

914
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,800
whipped up people into a fucking frenzy and I had and I organized a raid and they invaded

915
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:28,800
the otherkin forums and they literally got the raid you yes I yes I and I have and I destroyed

916
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,920
their so I temporarily disabled their servers and it was it was the best thing that ever happened

917
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,600
I know were you a part of this other kid raid right it's one of those things that you hear about

918
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,800
that everyone talks about is like hey you remember when do they like no people say like they remember

919
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:49,280
when they went 4chan raided the fucking other kid no people will be like I remember I heard it back

920
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,840
when it might have happened more than once yeah I don't know if I was like did the only one yeah

921
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,080
no I want yeah I'm sure I'm sure you want the only one but like I remember this happened around

922
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:03,920
4chan does have a long memory they remember everything yeah fucking made a part of 4chan 4chan

923
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:09,840
I remember like I used to hear a lot during 2014 while the tumblr raid was going on those are like

924
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,760
well what so hey guys post your favorite raids that we've ever done and then someone was like oh

925
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,280
yeah the otherkin forum raids were pretty good oh yeah those those faggots couldn't even handle

926
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,880
anything we shut down their servers for a whole week I was like oh wow that's pretty cool it's

927
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:25,680
to hear that you were like part of one of those was is that what I want yeah I gave them I I gave

928
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,600
I had like I had like a jolly rod because I was wicked big into one piece I had a jolly

929
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,280
rod made for myself I gave them out and like had people like people were like spamming the

930
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:41,840
otherkin forums with that image oh man it was it was it was a truly a truly wonderful time to be

931
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:50,080
me the saint pirates beware beware of the heavens the heaven scribe pirates the heaven scribe pirates

932
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:56,400
beware if you were yeah I was a fucking yeah I was a fucking nerd oh man oh so like okay but

933
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:02,080
like one one again I didn't really finish the story but one thing that really changed my perception

934
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,280
was when I moved when I not moved to America but like moving to America did a whole another thing

935
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:12,960
but when I started coming over to America for vacation I would that was when I first really

936
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:18,080
got into YouTube and like before all I would use YouTube for was to watch anime like that was all

937
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:23,200
YouTube that was the only benefit it had for me it was to watch uh three days grace videos

938
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,320
AMVs and uh an anime that was all I wanted that was that's all I wanted from it just a bunch of

939
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:36,800
weird punk grace yeah really shitty punk rock anime and AMVs sometimes AMVs brought both of

940
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:43,440
those things together but like um so I would and then when I came to America I found out about the

941
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:49,200
it's kind of like I got the classical education in internet memes that was I feel like that's what

942
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:54,960
happened I like when I the first time I came was 2008 so I got no 2006 so I got a classical

943
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,160
education in internet memes that's when I got my Numa Numa that's when I got my that's when

944
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:10,240
I got my 2006 no no no no oh yeah it is yeah it is that all yeah that is star wars lightsaber

945
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,960
kid Numa Numa yeah all of all of that stuff all of that stuff like

946
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:31,360
fuck who's the the gay black guy song the one oh yes oh what what in the but what in the but

947
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:36,880
what what in the oh fucking hell man I got this is probably would have been like 2008 yeah this

948
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:43,280
all this yeah because I remember I came 2006 2008 2009 and those three specific years I would get

949
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:48,400
such a jump in knowledge about what fucking like you had a whole year's worth of new

950
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:58,640
yes oh yes exactly oh man fucking all of these shitty internet memes what drip fed to me I think

951
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:04,480
I think shoot the whoop is the old is the oldest meme that I ever knew I think that was the first

952
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,640
meme I ever came into contact with like

953
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:18,160
oh badger badger badger badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom yeah yeah like then

954
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:28,080
unless you count lol cats as a meme I think and then even me on cut was one of the memes that I

955
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:34,320
fucking go into an education like from that era that 2005 era that I was saying I wasn't really

956
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:41,120
into internet videos yet I I forgot that I did have a phase of getting really into albino black sheep

957
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:47,840
because like everyone knew like ebombs world at the time and like new grounds I had always heard

958
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,480
that ebombs world was a terrible place and you get viruses and there'd be dicks everywhere but like a

959
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:57,360
lot of the content on like a lot of the best stuff on ebombs world was all stolen from other places

960
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:04,400
and albino black sheep was this place that uh that I don't remember the name of the type of uh videos

961
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:10,320
they did but it was um like they had a bunch of videos where it'd be like like almost like

962
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:15,520
magazine cutout look to it where it'd be like just a bunch of like random celebrities and funny memes

963
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,840
and stuff like in these videos and they were some of them were fucking hilarious there's one called

964
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,280
French erotic film that I recommend everybody look up it's just a fun little song about Colin

965
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:32,400
mockery uh and a bunch of memes and uh it's great but like yeah like I got really into

966
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,200
that for a brief period and that was also I think where end of the world came from which is an internet

967
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:47,280
classic uh you guys remember legendary frog uh no legendary frog was a fucking peat piece of

968
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:53,280
shit god damn it so terrible in hindsight I think uh I think the llama song might have come from

969
01:30:53,280 --> 01:31:00,880
albino black sheep yeah I I mean I don't know I'm not looking like I'm not embarrassed to have

970
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,400
liked homestar runner but I am embarrassed to have like legendary frog do any of you remember a video

971
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:14,160
called gonads and strife yes that's from albino black sheep as well gonads in the lightning in

972
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:23,920
the lightning in the rain I remember I remember fucking uh okay like also the idea of going into

973
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,800
the internet and finding like just the deepest going deeper and deeper into some stuff that like

974
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,600
you know nobody else is looking at but you're just there being entirely enamored by it for example

975
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:40,560
this is something I no one's ever been able to relate with me on I was I was a I know I was a

976
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:48,640
giant fan of this weird flash cartoon about not about knuckles it was it was like not it was like

977
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:52,960
a sprite flash cartoon like it was a bunch of sprites they took sprites from the sonic games

978
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:58,240
and a bunch of other like scarpcom video games and they made like a giant series it was called

979
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:03,680
knuckles adventure in fact let me fucking look this shit up because it's I I I

980
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,680
I

981
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,560
eight bit theater Tom did you read eight bit theater back in the day

982
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,720
you know what that was the one about the final fantasy characters right yeah I'll I was so into

983
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:22,320
eight bit theater I fucking bought that guy's book I bought his novel and it fucking sucked

984
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:27,840
even as a kid I knew that I could I was reading his novel and I was like this is a terrible book

985
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,960
this is an incredibly poorly written novel Brian Clevenger fuck you Brian Clevenger

986
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:40,320
I had six volumes of mega tokyo say dark horse would release it and I fuck me with a stick it's

987
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,440
still fucking there everybody go look up knuckles adventure it was demote to

988
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:54,560
no like no way the videos are still fucking there oh here's mine here's mine along those lines

989
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:59,840
oh fuck I don't even remember the name of it there was a web comic that I was like super

990
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:07,120
fucking into it was a sprite comic and oh my god I can't remember the name of it it was like

991
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:13,520
it was like it was like a goofy comedy adventure type thing but it was one where like as it went

992
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,960
along the story you know got darker and more violent and serious but always while having like a sort

993
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,440
of tongue-in-cheek attitude I just remember thinking that like in terms of writing quality I always

994
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:28,960
felt like it was the best web comic I had found but I can't fucking remember the name I'd like

995
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:35,280
you guys just to just give a little bit of a look to this because I like I opened up and the first

996
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:42,480
five seconds encapsulate why I was so into it as a kid because I will watch the first five seconds

997
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:52,320
of knuckles adventure oh my god what am I in for oh my this is so it's so amazing it's yeah it's

998
01:33:52,640 --> 01:34:02,480
amazing the one word for it it's so amazing it's got Inuyasha in it holy shit I would have loved

999
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:10,000
this this is the kind of shit I was so into as a kid I would have absolutely loved this I know

1000
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:19,760
like this oh man this was my shit look at this I'm able I would have definitely loved that because

1001
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:26,000
you could tell as soon as I saw Inuyasha I would have been fucking sore exactly because knuckles

1002
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,280
is cool enough but like Inuyasha they all had special reasons as to why they were in the same

1003
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:37,040
universe and they all had like personality quirks and different interpretations based on how it was

1004
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:43,520
the fucking nut your shit man I'm just like now that I look back on it I'm probably one of about

1005
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,000
like a hundred people in total who ever gave a fuck about this you know what I mean like

1006
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:53,360
it this this was something that on the internet that nobody would have given a fuck about well

1007
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:58,720
see I'm right like Jimmy that leads me well into a into a point that I wanted to make about why I

1008
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:05,760
got into 4chan and like okay like for me it because like 2008 or so was like the height of my like

1009
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,080
I don't want to say dark web but like knowing I think we should yeah you should stop I think

1010
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,040
we should all talk about how we all got into 4chan because those are all interesting stories

1011
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:19,040
I don't know that Ben or Tom is particularly into 4chan but uh yeah I think I already kind of

1012
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,680
said like I heard that it was a terrible place for terrible people I checked it out and read it

1013
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:29,040
like a bit here and there I never really got that into it although I did kind of get into draw fag

1014
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:34,320
threads on tg I talked about this in my interview I would someone drew me my dnd character on tg

1015
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:38,480
and it was amazing and I hung around there and would like do a little sprite art of other people's

1016
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:44,000
characters for a while uh so yeah for a while t I would go on tg once in a while but that was

1017
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,320
about it for 4chan um well for me like because I had I had a I had like a friend who was a big

1018
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:55,840
time 4chaner but he was like a beatard and he was like a you know troll who like liked 4chan for

1019
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:01,120
the the insanity of it you know it's like I was familiar with 4chan mostly as like a place I would

1020
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:06,000
never want to go because it was all going to be pictures of weird gross shit and I'd seen like

1021
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,120
little like I'd seen people who did like 4chan pilgrimages and what they came back with and I'd

1022
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:16,160
seen tub girl and that haunted my nightmares uh which for those who don't know was like a picture

1023
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:22,000
of a woman in a bathtub like shitting piss out of her ass and just just go to ask jves and type what

1024
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:28,560
is tub girl and then yeah uh and like and like shitting dick uh the classic shitting dick nipples

1025
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:33,520
um which is exactly what it sounds like so like I always thought of 4chan as being like that but

1026
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,840
then like at some point I found out about the anime board and that it was just a place where people

1027
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:45,120
just fucking talk about anime and what's what I have always loved about 4chan is that you can find

1028
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:53,840
someone who's into fucking anything you can think of like no matter how obscure your taste is someone

1029
01:36:53,840 --> 01:37:00,720
on there knows about it and so like I remember there was a time it was it was when a certain magical

1030
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:05,840
index was airing and that show wasn't that popular at the time that it was it was relatively popular

1031
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,240
but my favorite character was last order which is like this little lolly girl who is uh like the

1032
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,880
lolly version of misaka who's the well-known character from the show and like I just really

1033
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:21,200
wanted like fan art of last order and I go on like 4chan and start a thread about her and like

1034
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:25,920
every piece of it that was in existence got posted there like all these people who like last order

1035
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,640
were there and I was like nowhere else on the internet will I get this in no forum in no social

1036
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:36,320
media site could I like bring up like maybe now I could because I'm like famous I could like bring

1037
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,920
something up on Twitter and people would know what I'm talking about but like at the time

1038
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,840
that was the only way I could have a conversation about this obscure thing and like

1039
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:50,880
was last order the inspiration for dark holy uh no not no dark holy actually

1040
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:57,360
was before her uh before last order but it's my naming convention is the same type of naming

1041
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:05,120
it sounds like the same kind of name yeah it's also a lolly yeah mine was more influenced by like

1042
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,320
everything I like has stupid names like you know a lot of the anime I've been into is like

1043
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:16,720
weird naming conventions but anyway uh the the biggest one that I got into on 4chan was there's

1044
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:24,880
this character called bico b i k k o and she was like she had one arm and one leg and one

1045
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:32,080
eye I think and she was always smoking and she could play guitar and like for whatever reason

1046
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:37,200
that just sounds like you know that whole thing about you were telling me about aesthetic persona

1047
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,920
yeah that just sounds like the most fucking obscure aesthetic persona I've ever heard of

1048
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:48,640
she was like what the thing is that she was a character from this dojinshi by uh like just a

1049
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:52,880
self-published comic not like a porn one but it was just self-published comic by this guy called

1050
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:59,600
romantic fool 1990 or something like that and uh he had published this comic with this character

1051
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:09,760
in like the mid-2000s and no one could find this comic because apparently he had sold all the copies

1052
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:16,080
including the master copy so he did not have it anymore and no one who had it was like I guess

1053
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,840
willing to break the binding or just didn't realize that it had become like the character was

1054
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,480
becoming a phenomenon but for whatever reason people had found out about the character design

1055
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:29,520
and like the vague ideas of her backstory and like there was a lot of like art of her like with

1056
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:36,000
like uh like marijuana iconography for some reason I've seen this character before yeah

1057
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:43,120
she became popular on like guru chan because she's like a you know sort of a gourd character I guess

1058
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:48,400
and like uh and so like every once in a while there'd be a threat about her and like she ended up

1059
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:54,000
over time getting like tons of fan art just because people loved this character idea so much

1060
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,800
that there was like all this all this fan art of bico and like people imagining what her situation

1061
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:03,600
was like and stuff but like pretty early into that when there was just like a decent handful of stuff

1062
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:10,160
then there was a threat about it on 4chan and I was like hey what if we organized making our own

1063
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:16,400
dojinchi about bico and like you know incorporating all the elements we know about her and just like

1064
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:22,480
do a daily life story and then there will be an actual bico story out there and like I actually

1065
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:26,960
got people organized enough that we made an IRC channel and we were like planning it out

1066
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:31,920
and I was gonna like we we had all these ideas did I ever come to anything like it came close

1067
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:37,440
because I was gonna draw storyboards and then there was this artist girl who uh like offered to do

1068
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,760
you know was gonna do the art and like she had drawn a bunch of like preliminary sketches and

1069
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,560
stuff which looked kind of cool and like I had sent uh she had like a very distinct like scratchy

1070
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,520
art style which I'm of course into but it wasn't like great but uh I had sent her the storyboards

1071
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,240
and then she just never ended up finishing a page but it was like kind of a like a lot of people

1072
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:00,000
knew about it and like people would keep coming back to the because I posted about it on my blog

1073
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,160
and people would keep coming back they're like hey is this still a thing and I'm like nope but

1074
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:12,560
eventually years down the line someone finally scanned the be the real uh comic but fun fact

1075
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:18,640
that I found out like much later along the line the guy who did drew that comic is also the artist

1076
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:25,040
of izuna legend of the unemployed ninja like those games hold up hold up because I just looked up

1077
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,480
I just looked up because when you say these things and this is the great thing about the

1078
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:35,120
internet nothing ever fucking dies right I just looked up bico and right after the her twitter

1079
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:42,720
account is my blog it's it's this is bico and you can help us bring her to life my sword is

1080
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:49,600
unbelievably dull.wordpress.co holy shit so yeah this is why the internet is great like you nothing

1081
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:56,640
ever fucking dies right but that character is so obscure that like you know that there's probably

1082
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:01,920
10 people who knew about her and I organized them all to try to make a comic but it it didn't come

1083
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,800
to fruition but now that comic is out there and she's become like in the time since then the

1084
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,960
character has become way more popular like there's there's fucking hundreds of fan arts of her out

1085
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:17,600
there on on the subject of web comics when we were talking about this a little bit oh boy one of the

1086
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:26,000
well one of the biggest like like key moments I think in in in where I've come to be in my place

1087
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:32,640
on the internet I think looking back was uh control all delete oh okay I thought I thought you're

1088
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:36,800
gonna say something else all right they're gonna bring where you I think I think I know what you

1089
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:43,440
yeah they are bringing a different web comic that we've all I am gonna it's related okay okay because

1090
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,960
I came to I can't all right I was on something awful I would browse the something awful forums

1091
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,280
for a while in like I don't know 2010 or 2011 or something seems like a lot of the internet

1092
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,600
came from there didn't the entire concept of let's plays originate from something awful

1093
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:05,120
I think they did I think well okay the the four chain guy the reason why was yeah the reason why

1094
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:10,480
something awful and fortune are both like oh wait something awful used to be a really big deal and

1095
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:15,600
I think I think when I was on there was a little bit past its heyday but still they had these long

1096
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:21,680
threads devoted entirely to hating on control all delete and every time control all delete came out

1097
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,160
with a new comic people would post the new comic everyone would just page in pages of shitting

1098
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:32,400
on it talking about how terrible the new punchline was and how and how terrible the art was and like

1099
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:37,760
rewriting it and reconfiguring it and just redoing the whole thing to try and make it a little good

1100
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:42,800
try and see how the author fucked up and how they could maybe undo the terrible terrible crime

1101
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:49,200
come back sorry I okay cool um anyway I would browse these threads all the time and just look

1102
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:54,640
at this fucking asshole artist and then hate on him and people would talk about other shitty

1103
01:43:54,640 --> 01:44:01,200
artists and of course uh sonichu and christian western chairman always got into sonichu yeah

1104
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:06,960
though those control all delete hate threads were how I got into sonichu oh man uh and

1105
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,680
you know I guess that's the end of the story no but another the weird thing is the weird thing is

1106
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:19,440
like like the reason why a lot of the internet came from both fortune and something awful I think

1107
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:26,800
it's because for a long time when you know how everyone had heard of like new grounds fortune

1108
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,440
something awful back in the day like everyone had heard of those places so because everyone had

1109
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:37,760
heard of those places or a lot of the people who were inclined to be at the forefront of

1110
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:45,040
dare I say internet culture were the people who perused these places so so not through well not

1111
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:51,440
through the basis of the fact that I'll continue I was gonna say I guess because I think did you

1112
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:56,720
said before nowadays the internet is all about places that aggregate constantly yeah so I guess

1113
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:03,440
like before there were formal places like for that like youtube and and stuff uh and maybe tumblr

1114
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:08,560
or something I mean for like forums like that and for chan and maybe new grounds and stuff

1115
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:13,600
were places where you could go to find lots of stuff all in one place yeah that was that was kind

1116
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,320
of that was kind of the thing so like and all the creative people who would happen to be there would

1117
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:22,880
would end up making these things and those things would be shared aromatically and they would become

1118
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,960
in in and of themselves like the troll face for example those things would in and of themselves

1119
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,600
just become just like things that get shared repeatedly and just spread all across and it

1120
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:37,280
was just some random fucking drawing some dude made for a thread sometime that I guarantee you the

1121
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:42,720
guy who made the quote unquote troll face did not did not like think to themselves I'm going to turn

1122
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:48,160
this into a worldwide phenomenon with this like he fucking drew a random ass weird like annoying

1123
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:52,160
little face that he thought was funny and just posted it and people thought it was funny and

1124
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:57,680
kept posting it that's I feel like that's the reason why that's the reason why the idea of a forced

1125
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:02,640
meme is so annoying to some people because memes in and of themselves are supposed to be kind of

1126
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:08,000
pure like that's another important part of the internet like a meme is supposed to be a thing

1127
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,520
that just happens it's supposed to spark like wildfire like things don't just things spring up

1128
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:19,520
out the ether and just now everyone's talking about it the the reason why I had to tell that

1129
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:25,360
control alt delete hate thread story and like the the point of that is that like getting into

1130
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:30,320
sonichu was like like sonichu and chris wesson channel it was like a huge it was an entire

1131
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:36,400
chapter of my internet life like for like for like over a year I was on the sonichu forums like

1132
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:41,840
or the on the sonichu wiki like monitoring this guy's life and monitoring all the developments

1133
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:48,160
of the son I was of the sonichu fandom for lack of a better word like I was I was deep I was deep

1134
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:54,720
fucking in to that shit oh my goodness gracious um I don't know I just I just had to say that

1135
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:59,040
because I wanted people to know that like that's the point the point is that this was a full a

1136
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:05,520
full chapter the I even tried I even I even got into amateur game development I started making

1137
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:10,400
I started making an rpg maker game and I did tons and tons of sprite art for a game that I never

1138
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:14,880
even got close to finishing that was going to be based on his life it was called christian

1139
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:22,480
weston chandler's adult chronicles uh yep I definitely like that's a sad chapter of my

1140
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:28,880
there's a big part of me that like really misses the the feeling of like going out in the internet

1141
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:34,640
and finding something that was just not like anything else because like I think that because

1142
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:40,560
we've centralized everything now where it's like you've got youtube facebook twitter tumblr uh you

1143
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,760
know and then like a few other social media type sites like I think that on the one hand

1144
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,760
it's allowed us to like perfect a lot of the content and like make stuff that's better than

1145
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,400
it's ever been before but I also think it necessarily like pushes everyone to making

1146
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:59,040
stuff that's kind of the same like everyone tailored to what that's kind of tailored towards

1147
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,520
you know that's actually makes sense because one of one of my friends I think you guys know him

1148
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:10,480
his name's Elijah uh like you know Elijah's a guy who just he's he's uh uh remember that video I

1149
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,800
posted where the guy it was just a guy on the phone sending me a bunch of yeah it was that if

1150
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:19,760
that's my friend Elijah that is that guy the guy with the really shitty opinions so I remember

1151
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:25,440
Elijah was trying to get me into the anime world order podcast and they're a really great podcast

1152
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:31,360
and I was explaining to him like why I had never gotten into them recently because I didn't read

1153
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,520
them I didn't like listen to them back in the day and I didn't listen to them now because they're

1154
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,880
not on YouTube and I told them that that's like that's exactly why I haven't started I've known

1155
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,280
about anime order for 10 years and I've never listened to it because back in the day I didn't

1156
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:51,840
know what a podcast was and like how to actually listen to it and then and like the guy I had

1157
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:57,200
always I had always heard that they were like very like anti moe type guys you know and I was like

1158
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:02,560
really into moe back then so like I was kind of like oh fuck those guys and then like over time

1159
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:07,200
I was like man they're still going that's that's probably like one of the best anime shows on the

1160
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:12,240
I'm willing to bet these guys really know their stuff more than anybody else these guys these guys

1161
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:16,720
like no like I listen to I've listened to a couple of them ever since Elijah wouldn't fucking stop

1162
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:22,400
telling me to go listen to them and to be honest listening to them has filled me with almost as

1163
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,960
much knowledge as fucking listening to just you talk or like listening to what listening to

1164
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,360
Elijah's or listen to some other friend Darryl Soret is a part of that podcast right yeah Darryl Soret

1165
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:36,560
is like he's the head guy I mean Darryl Soret's a guy who for anyone or audience who doesn't know

1166
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,240
about him not only has he been an anime blogger forever he has more knowledge about anything

1167
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:45,120
than anyone else in the world he runs like a million panels at like at anime conventions like

1168
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:49,200
every year at Otacon there will be like a ton of Darryl Soret panels and I make a point to go to

1169
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:53,440
those because they are by far the most interesting panels there in terms of just like breadth of

1170
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:58,960
knowledge uh and he also writes for Otaku USA he even knows about pro wrestling yeah he even knows

1171
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:03,200
about fucking pro wrestling and it's crazy he writes for Otaku USA which is like the only

1172
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:08,720
still running anime magazine in the US and he writes for like anime news network sometimes

1173
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:12,960
he's really he's written articles for so many places and I was telling him that he's not on

1174
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:18,560
YouTube yeah that's the craziest thing like he's not like I was telling Elijah he's not on YouTube

1175
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:23,840
so I haven't listened to him and Elijah was furious at this concept because and it's it's

1176
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:29,120
kind of based on what you just said earlier because Elijah is much older than me and Elijah's been on

1177
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,880
the internet for a lot long well he's been on the internet as deeper than I have for a lot longer

1178
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,760
and he is still in that mindset of there's a billion different places where you get a billion

1179
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:45,920
different things and Elijah he can't fucking fathom why somebody would shut out another part

1180
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,400
just because they're not on this site because he's like I mean

1181
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:56,320
right yeah like I like I mean in fairness I have gone out of my way for biggest problem in the

1182
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,400
universe like I go to the website and now both hosts have their own shows that I go to their

1183
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:05,040
websites for that but like with anime world order it's also that it's been running for so long

1184
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:10,480
that it's like it's daunting to think about the idea that like because you know even if it's not

1185
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:15,600
a sequential podcast there's gotta be a million memes and inside jokes and stuff that they

1186
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:21,360
talk about regularly well I've listened to a couple of them I've listened to a couple of them I

1187
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:25,600
didn't really I listened to the one about initial D which has taught me more about initial D than

1188
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:33,120
I've ever actually wanted to know right but like like it isn't really like that but I can I feel

1189
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,320
like if I listen to a few more I definitely get that like for example if for example the first

1190
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:42,960
person what if someone was picking this podcast for the first time will not know what well late is

1191
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:49,120
yeah they will all teach them like oh yeah Ben could definitely teach them how to be well laid

1192
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:55,280
or they probably don't get why we keep saying patreon.com slash ben saint or yeah

1193
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,160
they don't need to know why they just need to they just need to go there and and pledge they just

1194
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:06,720
need to repeat repeat it over and over again I think I probably am using oh why did you say

1195
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:12,320
simultaneously all the time that's a that's a very inside meme that nobody really knows I think

1196
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:19,600
that I am probably legitimately I think my life has probably been markedly worse all this time

1197
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,600
because I haven't been listening to anime world order and I feel like it would probably improve

1198
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:30,320
my entire life to listen to it but if I feel like it would like they are like they're a really good

1199
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:35,520
anime podcast I think actually I think the real reason I haven't listened is that I'm afraid of how

1200
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:40,640
stupid I'll feel for not having listened to them when I first found out about them in like 2007

1201
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:47,280
and I'll feel so bad that I didn't know talking about talking about web comics and podcasts oh boy

1202
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,280
here's an internet thing penny arcade definitely everyone knows penny arcade in my opinion it

1203
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:59,760
kind of sucks and isn't very funny I agree but they have a podcast and sometimes when they're when

1204
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:07,040
they record themselves thinking of the comic and they're like they're they're banter with each other

1205
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:11,600
and their conversations about like what's going on in gaming news and like what's going on in their

1206
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:19,200
lives as they're thinking of the comic and writing the comic is is awesome it's so great I can't

1207
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:24,080
even though I don't recommend anyone read penny arcade but I highly recommend everyone listen to

1208
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:30,000
the penny arcade podcast it is gaban i don't know gaban taiko are like two of my favorite dudes

1209
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,960
to listen to because just wicked fun actually that's how she that's how she gonna suck they're

1210
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:40,080
such cool guys they seem a way cooler than like because the characters in penny arcade seem like

1211
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:45,920
total douchebags and like penny arcade is so much worse than them I don't understand because it

1212
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:50,960
comes from that era it comes from an era when like web comic characters were usually thinly

1213
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:55,280
veiled versions of the real people so you see those characters and you're like these guys must

1214
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:00,960
be total douchebags but then they are not like their characters really yeah I think there is some

1215
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,760
element of that like the format is just outdated but like it's just what they do so they're not

1216
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:11,120
gonna change it it's the old is the old tim buckley control out delete style like fucking I mean I

1217
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:16,080
I mean that's a whole another level I mean penny arcade is the worst web I'm sorry not penny arcade

1218
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:22,160
control out delete is the worst penny arcade is just kind of mediocre and not very funny

1219
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:27,600
but okay and that actually brings me to another chapter of my fucking internet existence I remember

1220
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:33,680
one time like I was on vacation in Nigeria and my dad took me to Abuja which is the capital where

1221
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:42,160
one of my childhood friends stayed and he was a huge fan of Tegua Tig that guy with the glasses

1222
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:48,640
yeah I had sure and he introduced me to the nostalgia critic and he introduced me to a

1223
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:54,480
bunch of other content creators like Linkara and you know just a bunch of that guy that dude in

1224
01:54:54,480 --> 01:55:01,040
the suede all all all of those people so I became a fan through him and I started watching a lot of

1225
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:07,840
nostalgia critic and that that again was another like window into another chapter of the internet

1226
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:14,480
like people people talk about Tegua Tig now like it was a weird otherworldly thing but people need

1227
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:22,080
to understand it still seems like a yeah no but that like for better for worse for a long time

1228
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:27,360
in internet content creation that was the that was the golden ticket that was the high water

1229
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:34,000
yes and and I gotta say it's really lowered the bar for everyone yeah because of because of how

1230
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,080
shit they are everyone else thinks it's okay to be that shit and the terrible thing is it's true

1231
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:45,680
because that's what people accept because they were because they were the first big collective

1232
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:51,520
to get to that point people have just been like oh if it's as good as Tegua Tig then I can I could

1233
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:57,760
run with it they were the first ones to do it so they didn't have to do it well but that established

1234
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:03,440
the go the standard as you don't have to do it well and then so then it then like another if you

1235
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:08,480
can't tell I kind I kind of hate Tegua Tig oh no no no I think we all do I think it's like no no no

1236
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:14,480
okay I think the PCP can absolutely go to war with Tegua Tig because I think we all hate them

1237
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:21,120
to me to me is genuinely an actual personal gripes issue because I I really hate Jesu Otaku

1238
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:26,640
like personal this is on a personal level me and her I mean me and him I think since he's he

1239
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:34,640
him is now a guy it's complicated like it's I don't yeah like I despise that entire group

1240
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:42,480
same as I know I know that Jeff was a big fan of of Jesu Otaku and like that inspired him to

1241
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:47,840
make videos both of us both of us hate them both of us hate her now because she inspired both of

1242
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:54,560
us she inspired both of us on how on to on making youtube videos my inspirations for youtube actually

1243
01:56:54,560 --> 01:57:00,320
were movie bob gigak who's now one of my close friends yeah movie bob gigak extra credits zero

1244
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:04,480
punctuation and Jesu Otaku those are like the people those are like the things that push me on

1245
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:09,200
how to make content now make content that's like nothing like I just want to say I know that like

1246
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:14,000
I know that there was a time when Jesu Otaku was a big deal because of the fact that like

1247
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,760
she was the she was the only person doing anime videos it was her and gigak it was her and gigak

1248
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:24,080
who was the only person doing anime reviews on youtube and everyone liked the deck out the

1249
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:29,520
glass of style but as someone who only found her later like I was you know it relatively early

1250
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,080
into getting into internet videos someone like was like oh what about Jesu Otaku and like I watched

1251
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:39,920
like her last like review and I was like this is fucking terrible like yeah everything I would

1252
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:46,320
not want her attitude the smarmy attitude she had about anime the dismissiveness over like

1253
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:51,760
yes fan service elements and sage who is the ugliest man who's ever decided to show his face

1254
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:56,960
on camera and has the longest opinions in the world okay you see he was he was a guest in the video

1255
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:03,360
that there's a there's a there's footage right you know who gigak is you know gunt right gunt went

1256
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:08,400
to alcon which is a convention in england and a bunch of that guy with the glasses people were there

1257
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:16,160
and sage was doing a live showing of his Evangelion review and the camera pans towards gunt and you

1258
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:20,640
can just see the death in his like the death glare he's giving sage

1259
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:27,120
i didn't see what's amazing for those who don't know sage is like infamous for the fact that he

1260
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:34,880
really hates end of Evangelion and like has like he has this whole like position on it i guess that

1261
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:42,000
is just like entirely wrong like he just and also doesn't okay okay so basically basically he is

1262
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:48,000
when i say i like to use the term second boomer a lot right like did you's heard me say a lot

1263
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,960
when i say second boomer i mean people who grew up who grew up on anime in the second boom which is

1264
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:58,480
the early 90s where they got stuff like a quira ghost in the shell all the cool sci-fi stuff

1265
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:03,920
and sage fashions himself he he builds himself up as that kind of person oh i only talk about

1266
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:10,000
90s anime i'm pretty sure he's too young to even have been around yeah like i only talk about 90s

1267
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,600
anime i only talk about like the action stuff and all that and power to you i like action stuff too

1268
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:20,480
but the way he approaches it and the way he talks about modern anime as if there's nothing good

1269
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:25,440
coming out now like he's he's one of those people yeah one of the that he's one of the anime stuff

1270
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,720
he's a relic from an era like there was a point because this is what for chan was when i first

1271
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:37,120
got into a for chan was constant fighting over whether anime was going to shit because there was

1272
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:43,360
the whole like anime fans from the 90s and and early 2000s were really like genre fans like

1273
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:48,160
there were people who were into anime because it was sci-fi and action and had all these masculine

1274
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:52,160
things and so when anime became like they started having all these cute girls and stuff this is

1275
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:57,840
where we get people like that anime snob who like despises modern anime even though it's just base

1276
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:02,880
it's not anime has gotten no worse in terms of quality the problem is that it's just a yeah it's

1277
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:08,080
different the genres are different yeah it used to be that there was a lot of sci-fi and now

1278
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:13,360
sci-fi is not an interesting genre anymore because we all understand now now now we're in

1279
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:18,960
now we're in the fantasy era yeah we're kind of in the fantasy era and like and so it just

1280
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:24,400
so happened the genres changed and like so during the that the period where that change was happening

1281
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:29,520
anime fandom was nothing but people arguing over whether anime was going to shit that's all it was

1282
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:36,400
the whole late 2000s was just people arguing about whether or not moe was good or shit and

1283
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:41,840
like i don't think anime discourse really made any progress at the time like that's why

1284
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:47,040
like people look at someone like me coming out now and like my stuff seems so much more like

1285
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:52,400
heady than most of what people have gotten because for so long anime has just been literally arguing

1286
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:58,320
over whether or not something is even good not like explaining why it's good which is interesting

1287
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:03,360
but you know just like arguing over the quality of shows because the old guard of anime fans feel

1288
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:07,600
like has such a different taste in genres from the new and even i didn't i didn't necessarily

1289
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:11,600
understand how to discuss that like this is a weird tangent but like we'll get back on top but

1290
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:15,520
like i didn't know how to discuss that that's why i have this really odd video on my channel

1291
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:21,760
called the importance of animation and it's a stupid video but one thing i do pride on my

1292
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:27,440
younger self is that even back then i knew that we were in a wrong headed place when it came

1293
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:32,480
to discussing anime like when every time somebody will talk about an action scene they'll say oh it

1294
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:37,200
has good animation or it has bad animation fuck it talk about what makes it good or bad right talk

1295
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:41,360
about talk about the camera angles talk about like talk about the aesthetic of it talk about what it

1296
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:46,000
makes you feel talk about how justify your opinion like what this justify your opinion and like none

1297
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,480
of that was coming through in any of the even of the people i really liked even of the people at

1298
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:55,360
the time even though now i really don't follow their content anymore so guys like glass reflections

1299
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:59,760
guys like uh jesso taku as we had mentioned earlier even though i used to be huge fans of

1300
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,560
them back then they didn't fucking talk about any of that and they would just like give her like

1301
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:12,800
look at how dumb this show is it's it's it's dumb it's not good jessel taku jessel taku every

1302
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,960
now and then every now and then she would let her film school side she would let her film school

1303
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:21,440
side show and she would get into a little bit of that like in her black cat review she talks

1304
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:24,640
hold on jimmy we're getting too deep into your rules here

1305
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:32,320
fuck okay okay so fine let me let me get back i think we should probably be wrapping this up

1306
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:36,960
soon because i think we're getting pretty close to the end here's here's my here's my take on all

1307
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:43,920
of this here's my here's my closing thoughts anime shit or not shit we'll have plenty of time to

1308
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:54,080
sort it out after our after our beautiful white western god smites japan with holy fire and lightning

1309
02:02:54,640 --> 02:03:03,120
for the terrible sin of creating fully kooli too wow oh god we still don't i i i'm still like in that

1310
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:08,720
denial stage where i don't believe fully kooli too will really happen like until oh it's happening

1311
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:13,280
it's happening it won't it will it will because japan will be nothing but a smoldering crater

1312
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,120
really because because the righteous a righteous god would not let you know the sad thing is that i

1313
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:24,160
have now seen evidence that it will happen because i watched the first episode of the new berserk

1314
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:33,760
anime and after that no travesty is too farfetched like i've been i've been i've been i've been

1315
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:40,160
sending my righteous prayers my righteous prayers every night have reached his holy

1316
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:45,520
oh by the way by the way before we get back on track like we need to do we need to do a week

1317
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:50,960
are we being out on the fucking new season because oh yeah this this new berserk is gonna be is

1318
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,360
definitely gonna be a point is gonna be a point to touch on but yeah okay back on my internet story

1319
02:03:55,360 --> 02:04:00,000
i'm gonna zoom through it now because i'm gonna go from the 2010s up until now all right so

1320
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,040
2011 is an important year in my life one of the most important years like 2011 is like the

1321
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:14,640
keystone in my life forever june 18th 20 june 18th 2011 was the day i first set foot in america

1322
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:22,480
to start living here and at that point i obviously at that point i was i was about 16 so i was of

1323
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:28,880
the age where i understood how the internet worked i nothing that i know in terms of how to maneuver

1324
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:35,840
the internet has changed in that time but the one thing that has changed is my attitude towards

1325
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:42,240
the things i see because now i'm much i'm much more open to interacting with other people

1326
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:48,480
which opened up an entirely new dimension in terms of like just the internet in general which

1327
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:53,200
like which could even be its own other podcast in terms of internet friends like that that i've

1328
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:59,840
proposed to other people but like the idea of going on the internet meeting people talking to

1329
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:04,640
them about stuff that you're into which is stuff that you guys had been doing much you know much

1330
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:09,760
earlier than i did but something that i had only been doing up until like fairly recently within

1331
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:16,480
the last five years and it kind of made me understand opinions a bit differently because

1332
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:21,920
back when i was younger i didn't have like i would watch anime and i just i just be like i like this i

1333
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:27,040
don't like this there was nobody who i could share that opinion with like i had no like growing up

1334
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:32,320
in Ghana i had no friends who watched anime the closest i had were like this one dude who like

1335
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:38,080
Naruto when i was in boarding school and my cousins who live in america who i would see like once

1336
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:43,120
every two years and who know who i now live with but like my cousins who live in america made fun

1337
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:47,760
of me for my name yeah i went over to their house for christmas one year and i and i put on like

1338
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:52,080
tsunami or something i was watching raroni kenshin oh boy and they were like dude what are you

1339
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:57,360
watching dude these these are just cartoons for japanese people or whatever and i was like you

1340
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:05,440
you stupid baka gaijin scum oh you don't understand the majesty of the japanese animation folded a

1341
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:15,760
thousand times longer and gaming and gaming oh that was me another important another important

1342
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:20,480
part of how i've started to interact with the internet is torrenting video games because torrenting

1343
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:26,160
video like torrenting anime was one thing torrenting video games is a new dimension man yeah like

1344
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:30,560
the level to the level of video games i've played within the last five years has increased

1345
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:36,320
exponentially not just because of stuff like that you can get on your computer through emulators

1346
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:41,360
through like just a bunch of different means i've been i've played games because of the internet

1347
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:47,360
i've played games now that i would have never been able to play as a kid because i had a pal ps2

1348
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:51,760
i had a pal ps2 and ntsc games wouldn't work on them meaning games bought from america wouldn't

1349
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:57,600
work on my ps2 so now i've been able to open up my entire i feel like i feel like how old people

1350
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:02,000
feel when they're able to like when they have a bunch of money and they can just spend money on

1351
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:07,680
shit that they couldn't do as kids right i feel like that oh yeah i feel like that now as like as

1352
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:14,880
like an early that's how dude i you know my first console was the n64 and i never had a ps1

1353
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:22,800
and i got a ps2 late so like everything before the ps2 era of gaming like i only got into because

1354
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:27,440
of emulators like i'd never touched like a super nintendo and now i've played like probably 100

1355
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:33,600
super nintendo games as a result of emulation that's another really important facet of the

1356
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:39,920
internet being able to get stuff that you couldn't possibly have even come close to getting

1357
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:44,000
in any other means while you're growing up that's one reason why the internet is like amazing and

1358
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,920
another another really important facet of the internet is news like we get news now i get all

1359
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:55,600
my news from twitter yeah what you guys never watch the news but i i usually find out what's

1360
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:01,280
like if something's going on eventually like if it's something mainstream happening like

1361
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:05,600
Guillermo del Toro is going to tweet about it and i'll find out about it from him because he does

1362
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:10,800
a lot of like relief effort tweeting and if it's more like political than all the fucking uh

1363
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:17,280
like liberals i follow will tweet about it if i if i see someone tweeting news i fucking mute him

1364
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:23,040
i don't care because i don't want i don't want that shit in my life my dad my dad is a my dad's

1365
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:27,200
an like i don't want to say this because it's gonna sound weird but my dad's an intellectual

1366
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:31,920
right he's one of those kinds of people he he loves to read he he's written books that's not

1367
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:36,720
weird that's that's cool yeah he's he's written books he's uh he's done he's done talks and stuff

1368
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:41,600
he even has a TED talk online if you i'm not gonna tell anyone to find it uh but like he

1369
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:46,800
what's what's it about it's about it's about the difference between it's about the inter-correlation

1370
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:52,320
between uh activism and politics and political between political activism and political action

1371
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:55,920
whether or not they're intertwined dude my dad's a politician it doesn't matter but like uh

1372
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:01,920
he when when he was when he was uh when every time i would when i was living with him he would

1373
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:06,720
always buy newspapers every morning every on the way to school on the way to school we'd always

1374
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:11,040
stop by a newspaper stand and he'd always buy one and i'll be like why does that always buy

1375
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:15,360
newspapers like why does he need newspapers all the fucking time and because he didn't have read

1376
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:20,800
it yeah and then now that i'm older i i'm like the first thing i do when i wake up is i check

1377
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:25,440
kamatsu for gaming news i check twitter for like my life for just stuff i have all other stuff i

1378
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:29,600
check crunch roll news i check anime news network then i start perusing like youtube to see if anyone

1379
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,280
was made in videos about current events then i start looking through the you know internet just

1380
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:39,760
to see regular current events and i'm like fuck i have become my father yeah like through the internet

1381
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:45,840
i have become my father i i go to reddit and i go to r slash the procrastinators to see who's posted

1382
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,240
new shit and that's that's my news and then i'm done i i want to jump on something you said a

1383
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:54,160
minute ago jimmy just briefly because you were talking about learning about like other people

1384
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:59,200
having opinions and stuff and yeah like for me because like i said i started on forums which is

1385
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:04,000
all about you know different people sharing their opinions and what eventually drove me off of forums

1386
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:10,720
because i have absolutely no interest in that kind of thing anymore um is the realization that i didn't

1387
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:16,400
care about anyone else's opinions and that other people didn't care enough about my opinions because

1388
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:22,160
like we'd have a thread about a new show like a new episode comes out and like i'd post in the thread

1389
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:27,440
and then no one would actually respond to my post everyone was just sharing their thoughts on the

1390
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:33,840
episode and i was like well i wanted to talk about like my impressions i didn't want to just hear

1391
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,960
everyone's impressions with no one responding to each other so then that's why like i got really

1392
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:43,920
into my anime blog because if i wrote about an episode on there then the comments were only

1393
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,120
gonna be about my reaction to the episode and like discussing the points i've brought up so

1394
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:53,840
eventually i just felt like i wasn't getting anything out of forums and i was getting everything

1395
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:59,520
out of blogging and that's why i just totally moved in that direction and never looked back

1396
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:04,640
like i've never gone i think forums are fucking pointless now like even like you know somewhere

1397
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:10,640
like our anime like they have halfway decent discussions but it's about uh like specifically

1398
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:15,280
if it's one of my videos getting posted up there then it's a discussion of my video whereas

1399
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:20,800
there's no way i would jump in on like you know new episode of the show is out let's all discuss it

1400
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:26,240
because they have those posts on there and i'm like no i don't fucking care like it's too broad

1401
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:31,600
you know i'd rather talk about my own opinions so yeah my sear my sheer self-centeredness drove

1402
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:37,840
me off of forums and it drove you into making youtube videos oh boy like i mean the reason i

1403
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:44,640
got driven like into using the internet for like content creation it was kind of because

1404
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:50,240
well okay it was it was kind of because through internet videos i felt like i was learning how

1405
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:55,040
to make them i was like i learned how not to make internet videos through that guy with the glasses

1406
02:11:55,040 --> 02:12:00,800
i learned i got my start on learning how to make internet videos with this one video that

1407
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,720
gantt put out called oh so you want to be a content creator and he made he just gives

1408
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:09,440
these really brief introduction i was like just write a script basically what it boils down to is

1409
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:14,720
write a script record the audio find a video editor put the footage in there and release the video

1410
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:21,440
and to be honest if you want to get into video making write a script record the audio put that's

1411
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:27,680
that that is really the bare bones of what we do and that kind of is what like learning that kind

1412
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:34,160
of stuff from the internet brought me to where i am today and it's it's kind of crazy to think

1413
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:39,760
all the stuff i've learned every single part of the internet that i've learned is now kind of like

1414
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:46,880
my little weird it's kind of like my little weird like background and you know education on how to

1415
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:52,880
do youtube because all the stuff i've done like from torrenting anime uh look at all led us up to

1416
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:57,520
this it all led us up to this point like using the internet to research information all that stuff

1417
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,200
yeah we gotta we gotta start wrapping this up tom you said you had something you wanted a question

1418
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:06,080
you wanted to present when you got back right yeah it's kind of crazy because we used it feels

1419
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:11,520
and this sounds really like edgy if you if you want to put it this way but like all of us grew up in

1420
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:18,560
the wild west all of us grew up in the wild west of the internet like it was it was not in any way

1421
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:23,600
safe it was not in any way less like it was way more decentralized something that i have found

1422
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:29,440
something that i found disturbing is like i'll find like i i tend to like content that's not

1423
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,920
like you know like whitewashed right like i don't i don't expect to necessarily always even agree

1424
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:42,480
with everything i'm seeing but like i enjoy a lot of stuff like musically right like music is still

1425
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:47,920
pretty out there and the new releases will come out that are totally weird and abrasive and interesting

1426
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:55,600
and like whenever i hear something like that i'm always like man you could not do this on youtube

1427
02:13:55,600 --> 02:14:00,240
like you could not have a career of making something that's totally out there because

1428
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:05,200
no one will find you people will only like people come to youtube for very specific things and when

1429
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:09,200
they click on your videos they have very specific expectations you want you want to know the crazy

1430
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:14,720
thing it's kind of like to speak on that youtube thing like even though you guys probably haven't

1431
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:20,960
been making content on youtube like you got you guys started a right like doing a bunch of pony

1432
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:26,560
stuff right but and around that time yeah i'm sorry i'm not supposed to bring that up well i started

1433
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:34,880
no no 2007 personally doing like weird videos but yeah so like but the thing is back back then to

1434
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:41,120
make to get someone over i mean to get someone you know like a bet a bigger channel like to put

1435
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:46,000
someone up you know at the same level you were to like promote someone else was a lot easier

1436
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:51,200
because there were video responses if you if someone you're someone you'll subscribe to you see

1437
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:55,280
what they're liking and you see what what they're commenting on other people's videos so then it's

1438
02:14:55,280 --> 02:15:00,320
like oh what is it what's he doing i want to see what he's doing now youtube has kind of gotten rid

1439
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:05,600
of all that and kind of streamlined it so that only the people who are already big or can get big

1440
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:12,640
easily based on very easily digestible content stay big and get shown which is kind of probably

1441
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:16,880
you know is a kind of weird tom what's the rest of your question is there more we'll continue

1442
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:22,400
to yeah i that's what that's what that's what fortune that's what fortune tries to be yeah fortune

1443
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:27,440
tries to retain some of that chaos huge rubber banding effect where like because especially

1444
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:33,120
for people who are making like the weird or stuff who are gonna start like being like i don't want

1445
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:38,560
to be on youtube anymore and there are like a lot of audiences will follow you know i think that if

1446
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:47,280
i think that um people who have large audiences when they migrate like they stand to lose a huge

1447
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:53,440
amount of their audience but they will still bring a lot of people with them and they will those people

1448
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:58,480
will move and they will change the way their attitudes are about stuff and i think that

1449
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:06,720
like there's gonna be a point where uh you know like for me personally i have a a fairly sizable

1450
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:12,320
audience but not nearly enough that i can take huge risks with it you know like i can post i can

1451
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:16,160
post whatever weird shit i want on my digiroctor dark channel and people won't complain too much

1452
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:22,240
unless i was to go on like some weird racist tirade or something like that most of the stuff i do

1453
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:28,080
online is not going to have a major effect on me but like if i had a like a really huge audience

1454
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:33,600
the kind where i could cut off 90 percent of it and i'd still be like like imagine if i had

1455
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:41,520
10 times the subs i had now and then but i only need the amount that i have now then alienating

1456
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:48,080
90 percent of my audience is no longer a problem and so as long as i feel like i can carry 10 percent

1457
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:52,240
of it then i could go wherever i want and do whatever i want and i would feel comfortable with

1458
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:57,040
that and i think that that's the kind of stuff that like if i got to that level and i wanted to

1459
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:02,960
do something really different and i was like you know what youtube is too strict and what it allows

1460
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:09,440
me to do i want to you know launch my own platform and do my own unique art that's not like what the

1461
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:15,200
youtube formula is then i would do that and i would carry whatever small percentage of my audience

1462
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:20,400
i can with me and go off to do this other thing and i think that we might start seeing that if

1463
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:27,200
like if a channel with a million subs is like hey youtube is too restrictive and i want to do

1464
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:32,400
something a little different then let's all go over here and you know enough people will follow them

1465
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:36,240
i mean i don't know how long do you think it would take for google to buy it out

1466
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:40,560
before what how long do you think how long do you think it would take before google buys it out

1467
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:45,520
well i mean i'm not talking about like making a new youtube like i think we'll see more people

1468
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:50,640
just making their own websites again you know like we'll go back to having a that guy with the

1469
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:57,120
glasses collective or i mean a lot of those people they still have the website infrastructure there

1470
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,800
like you know like john shran's group like normal boots you know like there's this whole

1471
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:04,320
group called normal boots they have their own website with their own video hosting but

1472
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:09,040
nobody goes there because everyone's on youtube but if those if john shran packed up his bags and

1473
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:16,080
said i'm leaving youtube i'm going to post my stuff on normal boots fuck youtube then like

1474
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:21,840
he'll lose a huge amount of his audience but he has so many viewers that he can still you know he

1475
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:26,880
could still live off of it even if people like even if he was forcing people to go to another site

1476
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:33,600
and like well i mean a lot i think i think someone like i think someone like yms that will happen

1477
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,520
like when yms gets big enough because he's he's fairly big he's got like 400 000 subs if yms ever

1478
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:43,520
got to a point where he was making enough money and had a big enough following that he could

1479
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:48,480
justifiably leave youtube he would do it in a fucking heartbeat because he hates youtube and

1480
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:54,640
he'd be will he'd be like oh i've got enough audience yeah exactly yeah

1481
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:02,640
right i mean i've said this before all the time where like i'm like there's a lot of like i don't

1482
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:07,920
care that much if my videos don't make it onto youtube because that's not where my money comes

1483
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:12,240
from and like i've had times where like a video got blocked and i'm like all right well i'm gonna

1484
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:18,080
put it on daily motion give it to my patrons and then you know fight fight the claim on youtube till

1485
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:22,240
the video comes back but as long as i'm making the money it doesn't matter where it is you know as

1486
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:27,840
long as my patrons can find it so i really think that is what's going to eventually

1487
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:32,400
demit like when when youtube gets to a point where it keeps enforcing these new rules and like

1488
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:36,080
in some ways youtube's getting better they're trying to they're trying to make copyright

1489
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:41,520
better for people but i think that if youtube ever fucks us over everyone's gonna just fucking leave

1490
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:45,360
everyone with a big enough audience is just gonna take off and go be a patreon somewhere

1491
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:54,320
yeah that actually that actually does sound like a genuine like a genuine like uh evolution

1492
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:58,800
evolutionary step that the internet is gonna take well i feel like we're a bit far off from it at

1493
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:03,040
this point like because right now i feel like we are in the golden age of youtube it just depends

1494
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:08,400
on if things get really bad like if the censorship stuff gets like crushingly bad then people will

1495
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:13,440
leave if they start telling us that we have to release videos on youtube red or like content

1496
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:18,960
creators if they want to make money have to release on youtube red that would be nah that like

1497
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:24,800
i would quit then i mean i would i would love to be off youtube not even for any like particularly

1498
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:30,480
logical reasons other than just i want autonomy like i really value that personally like being

1499
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:34,800
able to have control over all my that's why i've never joined like an mcn or anything like that you

1500
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:40,160
know i mean yeah that's another that's another thing i'm trying i'm trying to get out of my mcn

1501
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:45,280
trying to get out of my mcn right now i'm trying to like leave but apparently something that they

1502
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,960
didn't put in the fine print because they said you can leave anytime you want but then what they

1503
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:52,640
actually meant was that you can leave anytime you want when your contract when your contract

1504
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:57,840
runs out and they never they never tell you when your contract fucking runs out so what i had to

1505
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:02,480
learn i sent an email can i fucking leave now and then not obviously not in those words because

1506
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:06,960
i'm actually trying to leave i don't want them to like eliminate my account but like they'll like

1507
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:12,800
they'll like oh yeah you can leave on december 30th and i'm just like wow fuck you like seriously

1508
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:16,480
lawyer up dog don't you doesn't your dad know some lawyers or something you could get on that

1509
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:21,600
oh man i don't think it's like a big deal i feel like it's not it's not that big of a deal right

1510
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:27,120
now like i'll wait i'll wait till december and just leave them yeah like trying to file suit against

1511
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:31,600
them would probably take at least well i mean i think like threatening to file a suit against

1512
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:37,200
probably get them to just be like all right that's that's fair yeah depending on what network it is

1513
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:44,800
yeah and uh yeah i've already fucked youtube i've already i've already taken my huge following

1514
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:50,960
and just and just fucked right off to the black boy that is saintcomics.com and youtube will never

1515
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:54,240
be the same and like youtube will never stop feeling that loss there's something to me is very

1516
02:21:54,240 --> 02:22:00,240
precious about like like precious and like like a legit not precious like in a condescending way

1517
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:04,320
but precious like legitimately not precious like the movie there's something very precious to me

1518
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:11,040
about when i get to go to like saintcomics.com or uh tom what was your fucking site called again

1519
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:18,800
sorcerousloss.com what else would it be called well you barely ever update the damn thing so i

1520
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:24,320
haven't had a lot of cause to i have gone there like five times and read through those same six

1521
02:22:24,320 --> 02:22:31,280
pages again but um i mean i mean i mean i'm always going to mspainadventures.com yeah i used to go

1522
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:34,400
there you know that's the home of homes like there's no there's nowhere else to go for that you know

1523
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:40,800
if i type the letter t into my browser then it either auto completes twitter or the biggest

1524
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:45,120
problem in the universe or now i'm trying to convince it to send me to the dick show instead

1525
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:50,800
because the biggest problem isn't a fucking website anymore and uh or you know the maddox network i

1526
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:57,760
really like that i like being able to go to a website and it has its own feel and look to it

1527
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:03,760
sorcerousloss is a beautiful website um it's weird because it's weird because it's it's almost the

1528
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:09,120
opposite for me because i've been seeing all these content creators that i used to follow on

1529
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:13,360
multiple different sites for example i used to follow movie bob i used to follow extra credits i

1530
02:23:13,360 --> 02:23:19,280
used to follow yatsi and now they're all on youtube now they're all i've never i have never

1531
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:24,480
watched yatsi on youtube i go to the escapist i have it on my yeah i've had the escapist is like

1532
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:30,000
the third bookmark on my bar because i watch it every single week for like because i because i

1533
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,120
always remember that like i always remember that the escapist always was a they always recently

1534
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:40,480
they let their youtube videos be a week behind but i think they let their videos catch up recently

1535
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:46,080
i i i don't care about that it's just like a thing for me that like i've been watching it on

1536
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:50,560
the escapist all this time and that feels right and i also sometimes would go and read like critical

1537
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:55,520
miss or something uh while i'm on there but also something like a quick thing like i used to go

1538
02:23:55,520 --> 02:24:00,560
to the escapist and the entire weekly content schedule would be full now you go to the escapist

1539
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:06,560
and it's just they fired everybody they fired everybody i used to while i was on the site i'd

1540
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:12,080
watch uh yatsi i'd watch movie bob's both of his shows sometimes i'd watch jimquisition and like

1541
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:17,120
those guys are all gone now but anyway i guess uh and they haven't hired anyone new yeah we're

1542
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:24,240
wrapping up i'd run a week i'd run a weekly animation if i yeah no i thought about that i

1543
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:28,800
thought about pitching myself to the escapist before back when i was like not sure if i wanted to be

1544
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:35,840
uh indy forever um yeah but yeah so that's our podcast that's how we became net savvy i guess uh

1545
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:38,800
and you should too i i guess

1546
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:49,120
i'm a little bit concerned that in this world of homogenized information and everyone going

1547
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:54,960
to the same websites that it doesn't teach people as much about how to like navigate the internet

1548
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:59,600
and i i do like even though i think fourchan or a bunch of douchebags about their no spoon feeding

1549
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:04,560
policy because they take it too too much of an extreme i do think it's a great lesson that like

1550
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:09,040
if you go on fourchan and someone posts a picture and you say source then they're going to fucking

1551
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:13,840
look at you like an idiot because you can reverse image search you just right click on an image and

1552
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:19,520
click search google for this image and it will find you what that image is and like if you go on fourchan

1553
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:24,960
for five minutes you're gonna learn that because everyone holds to it so strongly but if you don't

1554
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:30,320
then you might never know and there's so much more faggot like i can find anything on the internet

1555
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:34,640
because i've been given the tools and when i have people like leave comments on my videos that are

1556
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:41,440
like how do i find this anime and i'm like google is right there just type watch and the name of the

1557
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:46,160
show and you're done and it's like i've known that forever but some people don't even realize that

1558
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:51,920
that it's that easy you know and so i worry that as we move towards everyone being on youtube and

1559
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:57,760
everyone being on twitter that people will will not pick up these skills on how to find

1560
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:02,880
interesting stuff on the internet and uh i value those skills personally

1561
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:07,520
