00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello everyone, it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint, this is Gibbontake.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello, I'm still a little sick, so I might be coffin.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nice. We've got a guest today. We've got Deadly Comics, whose animations many of you, I feel like, might have seen around for a pretty long time now. Hi, Deadly.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Whoa, hello. How did I get here?

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't know.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How did you get into our review?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Everything that happened in the past several weeks is just a complete blank, and I don't know why you're here or who you are. Why don't you explain who you are?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I should have thought this far ahead, at least.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's okay.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You have a YouTube channel where you do really cute and high production animations with little furries. Little furry people.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And they're great.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think the earliest stuff of yours I ever saw was some MLP stuff back in the pony days. I think you did a Scootaloo, right? There was one of, like, Scootaloo in her bedroom. Am I?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, I remember that one from back in the day.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I remember the fucking Gibbontake GIF you did of me jumping up and down.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Eleazar, put that on screen. Find it.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Find it. I forgot where it is. I'm sure I've saved it somewhere.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Must have it somewhere.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Some DVD or something. I don't know. I really liked your character design. I just had to animate that hair flopping around.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know how it is.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I do.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Most recently, I remember, I saw the one that you did where the golf ball goes down the golf hole and the fish is down there and says things.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right? That was you, right?

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I also saw, a little before that, I caught, it was the one with Twilight and Mordecai on the road singing that Muppet song.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Right? Yeah.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That one was awesome. By the way, that one got, I mean, I know you didn't write the song, but like, that song, from watching that animation, that song got stuck.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It actually still, I still think about it because I saw that animation and that song is really catchy.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I'll just say, while I'm gushing about it, I'll say the bit where, the bit where they say Cabot and they hold up the cheese is really funny.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I watched that over and over again.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The little one frame, with the little like one frame moment where Twilight holds up the Cabot cheese.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then there's like, they just really fast look at the camera like, and then just move on.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That, that, that's not in the original, that's not in the original, that's not a joke the Muppets make.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That was you, so good job.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm glad you liked the one original part of the video.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thanks, yep, the only one.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Uh, there's like, there's a mixed media too, because it was like, it was like a, it was like a real like, like toy set, right?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was like a physical like car set and they animated the characters in it, right?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, I got, um, I thought it would be, where did that start?

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I thought it would be really funny if Twilight Sparkle had a car, so I looked it up and she did.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It does have a car, a toy car.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I thought it, Hasbro made one?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, like a little RC controlled car.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's, let me find it, lol.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know, I thought it would be funny if she like had one in the show to promote the toy or something.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They should, they should have made an episode, they should have made like a drag racing episode.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That would have been great.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Um, Gabe, did you see that one? The one I'm talking about?

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I, I, I must have, because I'm subscribed, I guess I forgot exactly what it was.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The most recent one with the, with the, uh, the little fish and, uh, I can't remember.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh no, I'm so bad.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, deadlycomics.com.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now websites have dated, I'm sorry.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Uh, two days ago, Grand Tour, that's the one.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I just saw that, that came out.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, there's a new one?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, it's so.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I haven't seen it.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's a new one.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, it told me.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It got the little, little furry people.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And they're on like a, a cool like tree house.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And I don't know who these characters are.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't know if there's like a continuity that I've been like missing.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What's, uh, what's, what's up?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's up with all your animations, huh?

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's, what's going on?

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, what's the deal with that?

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's the deal with that?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Uh, those cartoons is called cool times.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's why I'm focusing on to like have a, try to have like more of a

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
narrative ongoing thing.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Um, so it's like all these characters live together in this like

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
repurposed lighthouse on a mysterious island.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And they're like all part of some sort of, some sort of company.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But it's unclear exactly what the company does.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's kind of like, uh, like as a kid pretending to play business,

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
like pretending to have a company, uh, it's kind of like that.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But what if that happened, but, you know, it was on a bigger scale.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It just like kept going somehow.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That was the kind of loose idea behind having all these characters

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
together and just doing weird, uh, stupid things.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Uh, yeah.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm seeing cool times in vivo those two years ago where she's on the

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
little piano.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is this, is this, is this the car?

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm posting the car.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ask the car.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Nice.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Very nice.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's like little voice clips when you press the button.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Holy shit.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Little car noises.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Holy shit.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, I'm scrolling through now and I see the moon right along.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm like, yes, I did watch that.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is a whole year ago.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Animation takes so long.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's fucked up.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I was going to do the whole song, but like, by the time I got to a point,

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
like the meme was already long dead.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Was it, was it like a meme at the time?

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Was it when I started it?

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It was.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
With Twilight and Mordecai singing two halves of a song.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
With Emma's paint.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Like, like somebody drew them singing a song.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, the airplanes and then the airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think the thing that Elon and Grimes had as their Twitter pfp.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I did.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think so.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Unless everyone's lying to me.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I look, I don't know.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Look, I don't know anymore.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I mean.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But okay.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But not that song.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Not specifically that song was not a meme, but the Mordecai and Twilight was a meme.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It sprung from that post though.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'd never, I'd never heard that song before because I've never seen.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is it the great, the great Muppet Capers?

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is that the one it's from?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's from the Muppet movie.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Like the original is this cover is from like a tribute album kind of thing.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's, I know it's, I know it's a cover, but it's by like, it's by like My Chemical Romance

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
or Green Day or something.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Alkaline Trio.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Alkaline Trio.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Which is a band I don't know anything about besides that one song.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Shit.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What was that?

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was going to say something.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Cover for me.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Duh.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Duh.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Duh.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh wait.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I get it.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to see.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll see the new one.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You went to uni or college for animation I assume based on, based on a few of your like

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
short films that are out here.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Those were like school films.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I went to school of visual arts in New York.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How was that?

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And that was a time.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, I never know what to say.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was a time.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It was a time.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
One of the colleges of all time.

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Did it, do you think it like hypercharged your animation skills?

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think, I'd say so.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just like having the structure to have time to make stuff is good.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And having people to show it to and get feedback from.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's good.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That stuff's good.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I went to animation school and I, I really enjoyed the, the sort of atmosphere of everybody

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
doing the same specific niche thing.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So there's always like, ah, talking about it, like getting a project together.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because I always have big projects, big ideas, but in a place like that is actually possible

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to make stuff.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And the stuff you made is like really cool.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like really like avant-garde out there, but also cutesy.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I love your films too.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Spider One is a fave, is absolutely a fave.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, thanks.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking through.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There's actually, I'm realizing, I'm realizing how many of your animations I have not seen

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
actually as I'm scrolling through this list.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's not like there's a lot.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So it wouldn't take any time to catch up.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, it feels like there's a lot.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I mean, I'm still scrolling.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I remember Rabbit Runner.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I remember when that came out.

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh yeah.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That was, I think I got like all my weeb shit out into one video.

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I never had to put anime stuff in the cartoon again.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey, I see you just released a plush.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I tried to.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It did not reach its funding goal.

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, really?

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I know the feeling.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, I shouldn't have said anything.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I had fun making the video though.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Which one was that?

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The Confined Bee?

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, it's What Has Science Done.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh yeah.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, that's so sad.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's such a cute little guy.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is the campaign over?

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So there was like an earlier campaign, which was successful for like a deadly comics plush.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But then the company makeshift decided to like re-do a bunch of plushes, but with like

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
cyborg parts for Cyber Monday.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh.

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Which is kind of.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's why.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's, I mean, an interesting choice for your character here.

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean, it doesn't make much sense.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No.

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Which is probably why not enough people bought the thing.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's a bit.

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And also like people who bought the plush, you know, they only need to buy another one

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
just because this has some gold bits on it.

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Definitely.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So it's like, nah, I'm not.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Wait, so did the company just tell you like, hey, so we're, we were gonna, you wanted to

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
make this plush, but like we're here to tell you that like, no, we won't make the one you

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
wanted to make.

237
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We're making one with gold robot parts on it.

238
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And there's nothing you can do about it.

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm a little confused.

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, well, no, they made the first plush.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There was another plush campaign, which was successful.

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

243
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay.

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And then they like did this other ones so they could like reuse the, the schematics of

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the plush to like do another run of them, but with gold bits.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Good.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Good.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I see.

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Can I still buy the plush?

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, no.

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know if I can.

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like the original.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, no, that's long gone.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Dang it.

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's a cute little character.

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I like him.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey, I'm glad you think so.

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh my God, you did a review.

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You did a movie review.

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Not really.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Deadly comics reviews.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The cat returns.

263
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's 30 seconds long.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wait, it gives in it.

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What?

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What the fuck?

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I just hovered over the thumbnail and I saw you from years ago.

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The cat returns.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, I am in that.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What the fuck?

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think you commented on it.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's a six year old video.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's, I'm just, I'm just watching it.

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm just watching this review.

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We're 10, we're 10 seconds into the 32nd review and the review hasn't started yet.

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What the fuck?

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think the video.

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
20 seconds and I still don't know what you thought of the movie.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I think it's clear from how it's edited when I thought of the movie.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay, I think you might have thought of this good shit.

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah.

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
All right.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, now I know.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay.

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, no, and then YouTube recommended me a Night Mind video afterwards.

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I hate Night Mind.

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's wrong with Night Mind?

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I hate Night Mind.

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What's wrong with Night Mind?

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't like his voice.

293
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't like his voice.

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
His voice is so fake.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's the, and the competition is stiff.

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The competition is stiff, but Night Mind has the fakest voice I've ever heard and it's disgusting.

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's sickening.

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's not.

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It makes me want to grow up.

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I met him in person and he talks like that in real life.

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't care.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't care.

304
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't care.

305
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That doesn't change my opinion at all.

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He's still faking it, even if it's not, even if it's real.

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Following the classic PlayStation style, there's a company released a stupid video game in 2002.

308
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I love stupid video games.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It made a million dollars, but was the game haunted?

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No, but people on a forum said so.

311
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What do you think about that, viewers?

312
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't, he doesn't, no.

313
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not natural.

314
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's not natural.

315
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Maybe he talks like that in person, but he's faking it.

316
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Fuck you, Night Mind.

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I hate you.

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm there for the spooky video game, whatever.

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Night Mind is just a poor man's Nightmare Masterclass, so there.

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Wow.

321
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Vicious.

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah.

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
All right.

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You know who else I hate?

326
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Unique Namosaurus.

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I hate that guy.

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, yeah.

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay.

330
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, we don't have to say anything else about that.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We don't need to do the hate.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You know what I hate?

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
People.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Specific people.

335
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let me just read you off a list.

336
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let me just read you off a list of people I'm mad at.

337
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay, I won't.

338
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Read your nice people list.

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Read a list of good things you recommend in love.

340
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't have one of those.

341
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I really should have one of those.

342
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I would recommend Daily Comics.

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Whoa.

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll check him out.

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's a furry shit, though.

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's weird.

348
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's perverse.

349
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Unnatural.

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Definitely.

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's almost as unnatural as Night Mind.

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Who is a furry?

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Is that true?

354
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait, am I thinking of someone else?

355
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, I'm not.

356
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, I wouldn't know.

357
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How's everyone's week been?

358
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, good.

359
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What have you been up to?

360
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I wrote down some notes, but I genuinely couldn't think of anything.

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay.

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I have a lot of question marks.

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, I tried to write notes.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Like, what happened since last week?

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm like, oh, shit.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, I finished a commission.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's it.

368
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hooray.

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay.

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I guess it's getting sparklier around here.

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I did talk about getting the decorations up.

372
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's still things to put up that sparkly lights around.

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It snowed.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't know if I talked about that.

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It snowed and I made a snow person.

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It snowed here too.

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Just a little bit.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is that your first snow of the year?

379
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah.

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't always get snow during Christmas time.

381
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sometimes it waits until February and then it snows.

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But we got some.

383
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Deadly, where do you live?

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Are you American?

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yep, I'm in Brooklyn.

386
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, okay.

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's snow here yet.

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're not even far from me.

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're like a two-hour drive from me.

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, yeah?

392
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Two or three.

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm in Boston.

394
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, cool.

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Very nice.

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Very nice.

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Did you get snow recently?

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No.

399
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There's snow in Boston, though.

400
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, a little bit.

401
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Just one night and then it was mostly melted by the next day.

402
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So that was cool, I guess.

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Didn't have to shovel.

404
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I had a family.

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
My family did their Christmas Eve get together early.

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We did it yesterday.

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That was all right.

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That was kind of fun.

409
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
A bunch of my cousins have kids now.

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So there were a bunch of little kids running around.

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And honestly, I appreciated it because it was sort of something to distract everyone.

412
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They didn't have to spend too long talking about what you've been up to, where you live

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
now, what's your job.

414
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
How much closer are you to the grave?

415
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
How much closer are you to the grave?

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you ready to put a down payment on a house yet?

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
A bunch of my cousins have become landlords, which is like, I don't know what to say about

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that.

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah.

420
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like big complex landlords or like a little two-family house landlord?

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So whatever.

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm not going to be like, well, I think you should get the gulag, even though it would

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
be really funny.

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I don't say that.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm just like, hmm, whatever.

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's just funny to hear them be like, yeah, I had a tenant who was a veteran who was running

427
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
like an illegal gunsmithing business out of my basement.

428
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And then his girlfriend and him broke up and she rescinded all their like gun licenses.

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And so the cops came and kicked my door down.

430
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's like, yeah, okay.

431
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a pretty good story.

432
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I know a guy who's a landlord and he talks about teaching his son to be a landlord because

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that's the only way to make money.

434
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What's there to teach?

435
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But it was just interesting because I said, yeah, I'm not going to be a landlord.

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But it was just interesting because it's like, yeah, I guess like there's so many people

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
who like going into the landlording.

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Like if I think everybody should be a landlord, but you know, if they're our own building.

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hey, yeah, you know, we've got all these empty houses and all these homeless people.

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We should make, they shouldn't be allowed to live in them, but we should make those homeless

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
people own those houses.

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We should give them the houses not to live in, but to rent so they can have an income.

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They can rent those houses to other people that can afford to live in them.

444
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What do we think?

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Make the homeless into landlords.

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is like one problem with another.

447
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll workshop it.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is like when they brought in the weasels to deal with all the snakes and then they

449
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
just had a weasel infestation.

450
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And then they brought in the foxes to deal with the weasels and then they brought the

451
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
bears to deal with the foxes.

452
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And then they brought the gorillas to deal with the bears.

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And the gorillas reigned supreme.

454
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No.

455
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Then they brought the rhinoceroses.

456
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes.

457
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

458
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And they were bigger.

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Then they brought in the blue whales.

460
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, we saw a video of, you know, those like giant, I don't know if it's a whale shark,

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but they're that big fish that feed by like they go up to the surface of the water and

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
they open their mouths and they just like...

463
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, they slurp up.

464
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah.

465
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I saw a video of like a bunch of like people were just like swimming in like the beach and

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
like they have like a little like rowboat.

467
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And this fucking like one of those came up and it just started like sucking water up.

468
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like it might have sucked someone into it.

469
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It looks so fucking scary.

470
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

471
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Like it's like...

472
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It started screaming.

473
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's like, yeah, I would scream.

474
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It looks so like powerful.

475
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's like the real version of like being scared that the swimming pool filter is going to

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
suck you up and destroy you.

477
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Although it could actually happen.

478
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Although it wasn't as big as I thought.

479
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Like looking at it, I'm not sure if it actually, if that one actually could have like fully

480
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
swallowed a person.

481
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It seemed like it could have.

482
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It was hard to tell.

483
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's like the size of a couch its mouth.

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If not, you get stuck and then drown anyways.

485
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So it's still a little scary.

486
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I wonder if, I wonder if it tried to suck you up because it's not meant to eat something

487
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
human size.

488
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I wonder if like a medium sized one, it would just kind of like sort of like cough if it

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
tried to suck you up.

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It would probably spit you out.

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

492
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Like realistic.

493
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh shit.

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a rock.

495
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I got it.

496
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I can't swallow that.

497
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I hope that's what would happen.

498
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
God.

499
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know where the rock is.

500
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Rocks don't float.

501
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Maybe a piece of driftwood.

503
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Maybe, maybe very, very small rock.

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Only very small rocks float.

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's a, that's a Monty Python joke.

506
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The spongy rock.

508
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
One of those, one of those volcanic rocks.

509
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It'd be, it'd be one of those rocks with the funny jellyfish on it from Subnautica that

510
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
make the rocks float.

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You know that?

512
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I haven't played Subnautica.

513
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh my God.

514
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's, if you are scared of the ocean, it's the perfect way to die.

515
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

516
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The perfect way.

517
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah.

518
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I think I would be very scared.

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I've seen Subnautica and it's like, I know that like most of the creatures are not that

520
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
scary looking, but it's still, I think it would, I feel like it would be scary.

521
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's the fear of the unknown.

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The sound design is like very impressive.

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And if you've got like headphones in, you don't know what's going to kill you or what

524
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
can kill you, but you'll hear noises and you don't know what they do, what they mean.

525
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And, you know, when the sun goes down, the sea is completely pitch black unless you have

526
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
a torch.

527
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So you are, you are very scared all the time.

528
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Something like that.

529
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Until you aren't.

530
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Something looming out of the, out of the depths of the ocean beneath me coming up to like

531
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
get me is like, is one of the scariest things that I can think of.

532
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's why it was very, it was really scary.

533
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, in Outer Wilds with the freaking, the anglerfish coming out of the mists and the

534
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
bramble.

535
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's just scary.

536
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But anyway, why did it, why was I talking about that?

537
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Why did it bring up that fish?

538
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, you brought up the fish.

539
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah, scary fish.

540
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That video.

541
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Scary fish.

542
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's it.

543
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I was talking to one of my cousins.

544
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
One of my cousins did ask me a little bit about, a couple of people asked me how I've

545
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
been working on and I mentioned, because you know, I've been talking about finishing that

546
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
slime and punishment book for years now and I told them, yeah, I still haven't finished

547
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it.

548
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And some of them told me, some of them asked me what else I've been doing and I mentioned

549
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
the video.

550
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Nobody asked me what the video was.

551
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So I didn't have to explain it.

552
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It was an eight hour long video explaining the history of Mega Man.

553
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So that was a relief.

554
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But one cousin did ask me like, how does YouTube work?

555
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
How do you make money off that?

556
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And I explained like how ad revenue works.

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And then he walked away and I was like, that was a nightmare.

558
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That was the worst conversation I've ever had.

559
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm glad nobody else asked me about it.

560
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's it.

561
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Hell yeah.

562
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hell yeah.

563
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Glad.

564
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I missed out on a, I don't know if I talked about this last time, but I missed out on a

565
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
family get together because I was sick.

566
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh.

567
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I mean, I did want to see people, but apparently it was really awkward.

568
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So I'm glad I didn't.

569
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Why was it awkward?

570
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't know.

571
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It was just one of those, it was like a, it was grandpa's birthday dinner.

572
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
He's 90.

573
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And so they were going to go to a restaurant to get nice food and talk.

574
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But my dad has like an electric car and where they were going didn't really have that many

575
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
charging stations.

576
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So it was kind of a nightmare trying to find a charging station so they could charge so

577
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
they could come back.

578
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And it was freezing cold and it was snowing and apparently the restaurant food sucked.

579
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And it was just sort of like one of those weird long tables where if you're sitting at

580
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the wrong end, you currently talk to anybody.

581
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So it was like, dang, dodged a bullet, I guess.

582
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I did throw up though.

583
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So, you know, I was not feeling great, but I think I would have felt worse.

584
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
If I had gone.

585
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I missed, I missed my, last year I missed Christmas because of, because I got the coronavirus.

586
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So, not this year.

587
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Not this year, unless I got it then and now I'll miss Christmas because of it.

588
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Because some one of my stupid relatives had it.

589
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Lol.

590
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know.

591
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That's all I got to say about that.

592
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's it.

593
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That's it.

594
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
How's your week been, Deadly?

595
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, Deadly.

596
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What's up?

597
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This whole time I'm trying to think about what the heck happened and I can't remember.

598
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What do you spend your days doing?

599
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What's a typical week look like?

600
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
A typical week?

601
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Let's see.

602
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I work from home so I don't ever leave.

603
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I work for a studio doing storyboard revisions.

604
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh.

605
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Which is fun.

606
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Which is good and fun.

607
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I didn't know you did that.

608
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

609
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I draw little characters, fix little mistakes at acting and stuff.

610
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't ever talk to people clearly.

611
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Do you, do you mind if I ask like what studio or what your storyboards are for?

612
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah, sure.

613
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's a studio called Titmouse in New York.

614
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Titmouse?

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's like, Titmouse.

616
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Is it, is it family friendly?

617
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Some of it.

618
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's a bird.

619
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's a bird.

620
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The Titmouse bird.

621
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You don't know about the bird?

622
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I've heard of it.

623
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I've heard rumors.

624
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's a real thing.

625
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Is it like Motor City?

626
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
They did, what else did they do?

627
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Big mouth.

628
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, they did big mouth.

629
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Did you, did you work on big mouth?

630
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I did not.

631
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Good.

632
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't like it.

633
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Star Trek Lower Decks.

634
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I've heard of Motor City.

635
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, there's a lot of things on here.

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Have you, have you worked on anything that we would have heard of?

637
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Um, ever watched Ball Masters on Adult Swim?

638
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
No.

639
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Just by the, um, the, um, Super Jail creator.

640
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh.

641
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And they also did some Super Jail, like early on.

642
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But I interned on Ball Masters and then, uh, went through that, started storyboard revisionisting

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
on a show called Ducking Goose, which is like a preschool show on Apple TV.

644
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And now I'm a revisionist on a show called Kiff that's coming to, uh, Disney Channel.

645
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's not out yet?

646
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Not yet.

647
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Hmm.

648
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay.

649
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
This, this studio seems to be involved with a heck of a lot of shows.

650
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's very interesting.

651
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm on their website right now.

652
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm scrolling through this big thing.

653
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm seeing, uh-

654
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I got Neo-Yokio in here.

655
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm seeing Ducking Goose books.

656
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I assume this show is like based on the, oh no, it's the, I see it on YouTube.

657
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Huh.

658
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Well, that's very interesting.

659
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, that's very impressive.

660
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Look at you with your big studio job.

661
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah.

662
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Well, well, well.

663
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Look at you.

664
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Big man coming on our podcast and flexing.

665
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That is real job.

666
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm a little, little cog in this big machine of animation.

667
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's right.

668
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I've gotten like no say in the creative direction of shows.

669
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I'm not to blame if they're good or not.

670
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Even though I think they are.

671
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I absolve myself of all responsibility.

672
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm lucky that I haven't had to work on something that I like don't care about at all.

673
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I know that's just a part of working in animation is that you're going to get jobs that you just don't like.

674
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

675
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But you got to, you got to do your best, I guess.

676
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You got to do it.

677
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That's fair.

678
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's pretty neat.

679
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
That's pretty neat though.

680
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Ball mat.

681
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I've never heard of ball masters, but it kind of looks funny.

682
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know.

683
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Kind of looks a little bit interesting.

684
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I like the style.

685
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's very, it's very scratchy.

686
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's very like notebook doodly.

687
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah.

688
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah.

689
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah.

690
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah.

691
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's a little bit like mob psycho-ish.

692
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Kind of.

693
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
A little bit.

694
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I don't know if this was before or after that.

695
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

696
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay.

697
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
All right.

698
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We're good.

699
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let me tell you a story about my, let me tell you an embarrassing story that sucked for me.

700
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It was just yesterday.

701
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It was on my way home from my stupid family Christmas party.

702
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There was a, there was this girl waiting at the bus stop.

703
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And you know, I just asked her, I just asked like, hey, are you waiting for the 64?

704
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And she just said, yeah.

705
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And then she just, and then she just starts talking to me.

706
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
She just starts asking me like questions about like, you know, where are you going?

707
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Do you live around here?

708
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And I'm like, oh, okay.

709
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I just started answering.

710
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm like, yeah, I live around here.

711
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
She's like, what do you do for work?

712
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm like, oh, I'm a freelancer.

713
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What do you do?

714
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Do you go to school?

715
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
She was like a Turkish.

716
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
She was like a, she was from Turkey.

717
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
She was visiting America while she was learning English or something.

718
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I was like, okay.

719
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
All right.

720
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And she said, you know, she just likes to talk to people and like to like talk to

721
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Americans practice English.

722
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And I said, okay, cool.

723
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah.

724
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It was nice.

725
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And then so, you know, then what, what did you do to fumble this?

726
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I killed her.

727
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I buried her in the, she, she went under the bus.

728
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm sorry.

729
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
She went under the wheels.

730
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I couldn't save her.

731
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
No.

732
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Well, she, where was it going?

733
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Okay.

734
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That's my bus comes.

735
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And it's my bus.

736
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I'm like, okay.

737
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So I go to get on and she is like, uh, uh, she seems like unsure.

738
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And I'm like, is this your bus too?

739
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And she, I don't remember what she said.

740
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And I kind of just was like, well, okay.

741
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And I, and I got on.

742
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And then she also got on even though it wasn't her bus, I think.

743
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And I was like, okay.

744
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And I said, I hope this is going in the right direction.

745
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And she said, yeah, it is.

746
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, it is.

747
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I was like, okay.

748
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Um, so I don't know, it was a short bus ride on the bus ride.

749
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I was like, does this girl like me?

750
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Is this, is she following me?

751
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Is she interested?

752
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And so I just asked her like, Hey, well, would you want to meet up sometime in the

753
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
future?

754
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Would you want to meet for, I don't know, have a drink or have a coffee or something?

755
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And she just kind of like laugh nervously.

756
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like she didn't give an answer to that.

757
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And I said, okay.

758
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Well, we don't have to do that.

759
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, all right.

760
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Nice, nice meeting you.

761
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Uh, uh, you know, good luck with your studies.

762
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And I got off the bus.

763
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And I, I don't know.

764
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Uh,

765
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I think that's, that's not that embarrassing.

766
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah.

767
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,500
I guess, I guess I don't feel like I did anything particularly wrong, but I, I, I guess she

768
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,000
was just be, I guess she was just being friendly, which is like fine and cool.

769
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,400
But like, man, she should seem like she showed a lot of interest and she even got on a bus

770
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,000
with me that was not her bus.

771
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,280
And I was like, why would you just, why would you do that for a random stranger that you

772
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
were just practicing your English on?

773
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,080
I feel like I, I feel like I had reason.

774
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,280
I feel, you know what?

775
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,640
No, I was right.

776
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,280
I was right to ask, you know what was perfectly reasonable thing to do actually.

777
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Maybe perfectly, perfectly sane, perfectly cogent response that I had to that situation

778
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,680
as a matter of fact.

779
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,360
Maybe in Turkey, that's just how they, they do things, you know, if you're talking to

780
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,280
someone, you can't stop talking, you got to talk forever.

781
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Yeah.

782
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
You got to get on that wrong bus.

783
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,280
I, I guess we didn't even, we didn't even like say much on the bus.

784
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,580
I don't know why she did that.

785
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:15,600
She seemed to not, she seemed to not know what bus she was even waiting for.

786
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
What's your name?

787
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,200
Her name was like, it was like, it was, it was pronounced weird, it was like booze, booze

788
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,440
or something, booze, I had to, she like, you know, it has one of those like, are those

789
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,280
rhodic sounds that we don't say in English, you know what I mean?

790
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,920
You know what I fucking mean?

791
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:41,960
Um, I don't know, that was yesterday and, um, you know, what's, what's the point?

792
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,240
What's even the point of anything anymore?

793
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
You know?

794
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,000
You can't end every thought with what's the point of anything.

795
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,200
We'll see, we'll see about that.

796
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,960
You say that, but I'll prove you wrong.

797
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,760
But what is the point though, actually, no, stop, stop dodging the question.

798
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
I don't know.

799
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,000
Getting on the bus, going to your disc, deadly, deadly comics.

800
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm glad you're here.

801
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,960
Why don't girls like me?

802
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,800
It sounds like, explain it to me.

803
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,080
She liked you enough to chat it up with you.

804
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,200
Maybe there was just something lost in translation.

805
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
I don't know.

806
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
It's not good enough.

807
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I wasn't there.

808
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I think it's good enough.

809
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
It's not good enough.

810
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,520
Thank you for your input, but it's not good enough.

811
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
You're wrong.

812
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Okay.

813
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,320
Well, that was, all right.

814
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
You know what?

815
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
That was fine, actually.

816
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:41,440
Um, uh, well, just thought I'd share my one and only anecdote, um, up until yesterday.

817
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,040
Up until yesterday, I also have done nothing, uh, I pretty much, I pretty much wasted this

818
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
past week.

819
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,560
I know I said I had to work on that book and getting it done.

820
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
I, I like didn't.

821
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,280
I did that for like one day.

822
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,600
It's just, it's just, it's cold and I just, it's just too cold.

823
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:08,720
And the heating is off more often now because of like, uh, oil prices, Ukraine, specifically

824
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:17,920
the UK's like, stupid, uh, like not taxing of the billion dollar, like oil companies.

825
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,920
Just despite the fact that they're, they're making record profits right now and we have

826
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,280
our own oil we can get, uh, it, you know, the Russia's war in Ukraine should not be

827
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,920
affecting the price of stuff so much, but they're just letting it affect the price so

828
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,120
much, uh, so that people die in their millions.

829
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,400
That's, that's what they're doing.

830
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
They're making me too cold.

831
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,640
So I can't, I can't do my little drawings and it's, it's sad.

832
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,360
They're doing it specifically to prevent you from doing your little drawings and you

833
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,760
can't, you can't let them win.

834
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,560
I tried to draw a little drawing and I was just like, ooh, no, I can't, I can't have

835
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,320
my hand outside of my blanket holding a stylus.

836
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Got to put it back in there.

837
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,520
Got to hide it in this blanket.

838
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
Speaking of, that's my week.

839
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,040
Speaking of blankets and being cold, I watched my dinner with Andre yesterday.

840
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Well, yesterday, I split it between yesterday and the day before.

841
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,960
Because it just randomly came across my YouTube recommendations.

842
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
It was called your dinner with Andre.

843
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
It was the video.

844
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,240
It was on a channel with 600 subscribers.

845
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,520
It had like 150,000 views.

846
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,360
It's just called your dinner with Andre, but it's just an unedited upload of my

847
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,080
dinner with Andre.

848
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,320
Have you seen this film?

849
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,680
No, I have not.

850
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,080
You are you familiar, are you familiar with it?

851
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,640
Nope.

852
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:39,960
Nope.

853
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,800
It's a, it's a Wallace, Sean and Andre Gregory.

854
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,360
And it's pretty much just them sitting down to dinner and, and they just talk for

855
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,880
like an hour and hour and a half.

856
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,160
And that's the movie.

857
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,320
And Andre or, uh-huh?

858
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,960
Is it just them talking as themselves?

859
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,560
Just them talking.

860
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,200
They're, they're, they're, no, they're, they're technically playing characters.

861
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,440
They're, they're, they're characters have their real names, but they are not playing

862
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,200
themselves.

863
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,920
Andre is playing a version of himself who had all these weird, like spiritual

864
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,360
awakening experiences in like the forests of Poland or whatever.

865
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,520
And he's describing to Wallace all these, uh, all these things.

866
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:32,520
Um, wall, wall is Sean, by the way, is the guy who, uh, played fizz, fizzig in, um,

867
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,800
the, uh, the princess bride.

868
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah.

869
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,720
I know him.

870
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:36,800
Yeah.

871
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,640
I don't know Andre.

872
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,240
Uh, yeah, I didn't know Andre from other stuff either.

873
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,800
I know him mostly from my dinner with Andre.

874
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,280
Um, you know, wall, wall is Sean's character in them.

875
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm not sure if it's, if he's badly written or if he's written to be

876
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,280
infuriating, but he is like the worst conversationalists ever.

877
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,240
He just sits that he just listens to Andre explain to him like these most like

878
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,680
bizarre, like, uh, psychedelic experiences.

879
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,720
And that he's like, and then he's just like, and he'll just like smirk and

880
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,920
literally not say anything and then go back to eating his soup.

881
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,480
And then he'll be like, uh, so what happened next?

882
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,080
And like, that's, that's what he says.

883
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,000
Fuck you, wall.

884
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,600
So what happened?

885
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,560
There's a couple of times that he breaks in with his own, with his own like input,

886
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,560
but it literally takes like an hour into the movie before he replies with

887
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,840
anything other than, so what else did you do?

888
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,280
That's kind of like, I'm thinking about it, but it's, it feels like a

889
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,880
conversation couldn't hold an entire movie length.

890
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,080
But we talk for like hours on this podcast.

891
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,880
We talk, yeah.

892
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,320
Like conversations take a lot longer.

893
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,560
And then I'm thinking, wait a minute, how the fuck do they fit conversations

894
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,040
into movies normally with scenes?

895
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,120
Right.

896
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
How the hell do they do that?

897
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:01,960
Right.

898
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,520
You like, you can't, you can't put like a real

899
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:12,040
I think this is kind of like, I think there's, you know, last year I went on

900
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,320
this kick of watching movies that were just about people talking.

901
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,800
I asked people on Twitter for recommendations of movies where people

902
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,320
just talk and that's all that happens.

903
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,640
And I watched a bunch of them and most of them I liked.

904
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,920
And yeah, I think there's something that's very, that's very, uh, uh, very

905
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,000
artificial about like the way that like characters interact with each other in

906
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
just, in like normal movies, cause normal, normal movies, like nobody can just

907
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,840
have like a conversation with each other.

908
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,520
Because yeah, every scene has to be over in like a minute 30.

909
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,520
And that's just not real life.

910
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Uh, I get the very cliffs notes.

911
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,520
It's very stilted.

912
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,840
Yeah.

913
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,880
It's very condensed and stilted and very like theatrical.

914
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,880
And that's why just like in real life, just like in real life, every

915
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,480
conversation that I has has to progress the plot or else what's the point, right?

916
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,720
You can't, you can't talk to a Turkish lady on the bus or the bus stop without

917
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,880
it leading to like, like a, you know, setting up for act two.

918
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,600
Why, why didn't it do nothing happen?

919
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,880
Yeah, this would be called a drop plot point.

920
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,360
This was in the film.

921
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,480
Yeah.

922
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,800
That was, you know, in reviewing, reviewing, uh, you know, Ben's life, uh,

923
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:35,320
release date, uh, 1988 to, uh, to, uh, nine to 2022.

924
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,480
Yeah.

925
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,000
That scene with Buzra on the bus, like total plot called a sack.

926
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,680
Nope.

927
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,000
Should have been, should have been cut from the final edit.

928
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,040
Wait, wait, I don't like the audience doesn't want their time wasted.

929
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,080
So, but think about what it says about Ben's character.

930
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,680
Yeah, no, it's character building.

931
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,720
It's like we're painting, you know, it's not about progressing the plot.

932
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
It's a character piece.

933
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,560
It's a character study of a pitiful waste of a man who's a waste of his life.

934
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,320
And he has nothing to offer society.

935
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:03,760
Right.

936
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,600
It's about, it's about establishing that.

937
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,200
It's about painting a picture for the audience.

938
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,360
You Philistine appreciate it.

939
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,640
Exactly.

940
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,440
What's your act three going to be, Ben?

941
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,280
Oh, God.

942
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,280
Well, I guess, I don't know.

943
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
We'll just, we'll just have to see.

944
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,680
Um, you know, anyway, I thought watching, watching my dinner with Andre, I was like,

945
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,560
they should do, I should, I should do what they did with the worst, the worst idea ever,

946
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,360
podcast or whatever it's called, where they watched, um, grownups to every week.

947
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,640
And then they commented on new things they noticed in grownups too.

948
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,600
What if we did that with my dinner with Andre?

949
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
We could call it my podcast with Andre.

950
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:59,080
Every week, you're just like, Hey, I noticed that like, it's weird how it's weird how Wally

951
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:06,520
just like casually brings up that story about the wait, like the woman, that woman who fell

952
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,680
out of her hospital bed and, and like became, became a, you know, paralyzed.

953
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,240
Like, wait, he, I didn't realize that was Andre's mom.

954
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,880
We, at the, at the first, I thought he was, he was talking about someone else's mom, but

955
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,560
then later he brings it up and he's talking about Andre's mom, plot hole, uh, uh, stuff

956
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,040
like that.

957
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,440
Um, sounds like a terrible idea.

958
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,360
It sounds too cyclical for me, like people talking about, people talking about people

959
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,360
having the same conversation, people having the same conversation, noticing things about

960
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,760
the same conversation over and over again.

961
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,520
I think, I kind of think the movie is ass.

962
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,160
I kind of think it's bad.

963
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,200
I kind of think that's not true.

964
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,680
It's not bad, but I do think that there's parts mostly Wally where he's speaking in

965
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,440
a way that does not sound to me like a real person talking.

966
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,760
It sounds scripted in a way that is like, okay, here's the part where we have him make

967
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,280
a point.

968
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,840
Here's the part where we have him push back on like, here, here, here's the part where

969
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,520
we have him expound a worldview that the audience has meant to shake their heads out and say,

970
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,040
ugh, disgusting, despicable.

971
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,280
You know, how dare, how dare he?

972
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,560
They should make a sequel called My Edibles with Andre.

973
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,600
They're both, they're both still alive.

974
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,000
They're both very old.

975
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,760
He should do some big weeds.

976
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,720
See if it's different.

977
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,720
That's the conversation I want to hear.

978
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,600
Let me call it like, like my, my, my blunt rotation with Andre.

979
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,880
My bong with Andre.

980
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,200
My puff, puff pass with Andre.

981
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,680
That's all I got.

982
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,040
That's all I got.

983
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,160
Well, it was nice having you on deadly.

984
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,400
Is that it?

985
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,920
No, I didn't say anything.

986
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,360
It's all time.

987
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,520
Well, I haven't, I have no, I have no notes this week.

988
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,720
I'm just, I'm just spitball and I'm trying to think of everything.

989
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,600
Well, I got a question.

990
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,520
I got a question for deadly comics.

991
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,880
Maybe this is widely known already and I just haven't looked into it.

992
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,160
But did you have a comic that was deadly?

993
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,920
Is that why you're named deadly comics?

994
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
That's a great question.

995
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,680
The comic wasn't deadly.

996
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,440
I think that just came from like being a little kid in school and wanting to have a

997
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,920
comic company named a deadly comic because I thought that sounded cool.

998
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,520
That is cool.

999
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,560
Now it's just a username that doesn't mean anything.

1000
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,960
Your, your cartoons are not.

1001
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to.

1002
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,840
They're just not that deadly.

1003
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,640
They just don't, they just don't come off as particularly deadly to me.

1004
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,920
When I see the little raccoons and cats and stuff, rabbits, little dinosaur, man.

1005
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,560
Not yet.

1006
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,120
I just think this can change.

1007
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,040
Oh, no, there's going to be blood and hyper realistic blood in the new one.

1008
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,760
We'll see.

1009
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,400
We'll see.

1010
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,120
OK, well, I'm unsettled.

1011
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,440
The deadliest comic is the one you weren't expecting.

1012
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,720
But did you, did you, I mean, you're an animator.

1013
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,160
Did you used to draw comics?

1014
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,680
Oh, yeah.

1015
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,400
Oh, yeah.

1016
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,280
Before I knew I could animate instead.

1017
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,600
I see.

1018
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,480
That's funny because I did the opposite.

1019
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,200
I tried animating because I thought that was what I was good at.

1020
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,040
But in-betweens are annoying.

1021
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,440
And I prefer just drawing the one frame.

1022
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,480
So I just do that in a comic forum.

1023
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,160
I don't know.

1024
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,160
In-betweens for me are like therapeutic.

1025
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,760
I think they can be.

1026
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,400
Yeah.

1027
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,640
Comics and animation are so close, though.

1028
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,160
I heard a quote somewhere like that everyone in animation wants to do comics

1029
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,120
and everyone in comics wants to do animation.

1030
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,400
That's so funny.

1031
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,600
It is kind of like a storyboard.

1032
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,960
It's just sort of like not framed in a screen form.

1033
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,480
You can change the shape of the.

1034
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,280
True, yeah, yeah.

1035
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,880
And it kind of, your head puts in the in-betweens.

1036
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,800
That's how it works.

1037
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,840
Your head fills in the space that's not there.

1038
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,800
I've read, what is it called?

1039
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,520
Is it drawing words and writing pictures?

1040
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,160
The one by Scott McLeod?

1041
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
Oh, that's Understanding Comics.

1042
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,960
That's the one I read.

1043
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,760
I think he has two.

1044
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,960
I think he has another one.

1045
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,560
He has a bunch, yeah.

1046
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,640
Yeah.

1047
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,720
I've seen bits of those.

1048
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,040
I still haven't sat down and read each either one of them.

1049
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,000
I know I've read one of them.

1050
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,280
I might have read both.

1051
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,400
I think there's one called Understanding Comics.

1052
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,480
I've definitely read Understanding Comics and there's also,

1053
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,040
I think he's another one called Drawing Words and Writing Pictures.

1054
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,480
And yeah, you know, I think in that he sort of explains that like

1055
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,640
the comic kind of happens in between the panels.

1056
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,000
Like the action of it is when your mind is sort of filling in

1057
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,640
the movement in between.

1058
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,800
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,360
Yeah, that's sort of the, when at all, where the magic happens.

1060
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,560
That's what I really like about like an action scene in a comic where I'm,

1061
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,400
I try, well, I don't try, but I always subconsciously want to think of it

1062
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,840
as like an animation.

1063
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,880
And then I'm, I'm like showing just the important bits.

1064
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,200
So like you can infer how the person moved their hand to get to the next

1065
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,680
panel from the previous panel, even though the camera is like,

1066
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,120
is a different position.

1067
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,920
It's like, if this was a storyboard, you could turn it into like a full

1068
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,480
like motion would be like, it would work.

1069
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,680
And that's what they do with, you know, every, every manga ever.

1070
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,640
That's how the animation adaptation, a lot of them are like super close

1071
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,960
because the comics are already so, so clear in the posing and the staging

1072
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,520
and everything.

1073
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:07,720
Mm hmm.

1074
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,680
Mm hmm.

1075
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:17,640
Yeah, kind of, kind of similar, kind of, kind of sort of use similar

1076
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,120
conventions in both, both mediums.

1077
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,640
Isn't that interesting?

1078
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,000
Isn't that, isn't that neat?

1079
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,400
Um, I'm sure no one's drawn a comparison before.

1080
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
Mm hmm.

1081
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,640
Yes, we were, I think we're really smart.

1082
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,440
I think that like, do you think that maybe like the same guy like invented

1083
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,080
both things?

1084
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,000
Well, like Disney or Tezuka, I was thinking of Tezuka.

1085
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,320
I was thinking, I was thinking of Tezuka.

1086
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,480
Does Tezuka do animation?

1087
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,800
Well, I know he's the manga boy, but like, I

1088
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,720
don't know whether he's specifically animated.

1089
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,880
Well, wasn't it him that sort of, uh, invent, like made up the convention

1090
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,360
of animating on threes to save budget?

1091
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,680
That's what I've heard, yeah, with those old Astro boys and everything.

1092
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:09,760
Yeah.

1093
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,560
He definitely would have been involved.

1094
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,280
Yeah, I guess.

1095
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,200
Uh, I mean, I, yeah, I guess I don't know if he like, if he like drew like cells

1096
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,760
himself or anything like that.

1097
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,480
Maybe he didn't.

1098
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,360
Um, I think he did.

1099
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,360
He's got like, I know he's done some cool experimental short films and stuff.

1100
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,600
Oh yeah.

1101
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,640
But he had like a whole studio for the, like the anime series, things like that.

1102
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,960
Just like, just like, uh, just like George Lucas.

1103
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,480
And now, now he makes secret personal films just for himself that no one

1104
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,280
will ever see.

1105
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,160
Is that true?

1106
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,760
Well, that's what he, that's what he says in interviews.

1107
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,880
It's like, so what are you doing now that like you're a, you're washed up and

1108
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,040
he's like, Oh, you know, I'm making, I'm making a small personal experimental

1109
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,360
films that will never be seen by the public.

1110
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,360
And it's like, okay.

1111
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,560
Okay.

1112
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,040
Got it.

1113
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,680
Okay.

1114
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,240
Whatever.

1115
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,400
Have fun.

1116
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,200
I guess like doing stop motion with green plastic army, man.

1117
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
It's a whole new medium.

1118
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,600
It's a whole new artistic medium.

1119
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,880
It's never been tried.

1120
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,560
Um,

1121
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,160
I'm still, I'm still looking at the image search for ball masters.

1122
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,120
So,

1123
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,960
this girl with the green hair is pretty.

1124
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,600
I don't want to have sex with her.

1125
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,800
Shut up.

1126
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,280
Good luck.

1127
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,840
Okay.

1128
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,640
I'm sorry.

1129
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,960
I apologize.

1130
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,880
Deadly.

1131
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,360
How, cause I know you were like, at least you knew about me cause you drew that

1132
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,920
gif, how did you find out about this, this group?

1133
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,520
Um, I guess through you, I think I saw your things through, um, like a crown prince

1134
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,920
animation that she did with like Dr.

1135
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,760
Wolfe and stuff.

1136
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,800
Oh, crown prince.

1137
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,240
Yes.

1138
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,080
Of course.

1139
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,520
Talk about a blast from the past.

1140
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,440
Talk about it.

1141
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:08,920
Yeah.

1142
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,360
Was, we're just giving a, was it a moment with Dr.

1143
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:12,680
Wolfe?

1144
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:20,760
Uh, you know, I'm trying to think, I think, I remember there was a crown prince, like

1145
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,040
animation thing she did.

1146
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,240
And then I edited part of it to link it to something.

1147
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,000
I don't know what I have.

1148
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,120
There's, there's, yeah, I remember it.

1149
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,680
I remember I was in there and then I touched a painting and I got zipped into the

1150
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,320
moment with Dr.

1151
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,160
Wolfe, which was drawn by her, I think.

1152
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,320
Yeah.

1153
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,240
That sounds familiar.

1154
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Cause it wasn't me who drew it.

1155
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,280
I drew the, the voice of reason one, the original.

1156
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,520
Oh, that's right.

1157
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Oh my God, you drew the original.

1158
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,280
How you, you started it.

1159
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,120
I started it.

1160
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,760
You started the madness.

1161
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,560
I forgot about that, but that's true.

1162
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,600
Oh my God.

1163
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,640
But the first one, the first one was funny.

1164
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,360
The first one was like a joke.

1165
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,880
I know it was like a reason, like obviously, like knew it was like, oh,

1166
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,720
it's so fucking silly, the idea of going to a wolf to talk about like your,

1167
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,880
your, your manic, your, your, your, your, your cycle, the psychological

1168
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,880
problems of your OC, like, like the cycle of the problems of your OC and

1169
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,600
hating like friendship is witchcraft or something.

1170
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,560
Yeah.

1171
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,760
Like, like he knows, he knew it was silly.

1172
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,400
And so he wrote it to me that way.

1173
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,840
And I, it's a funny bit to bring your OC into a therapist and have your OC do

1174
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,760
like discuss their like character quirks, as though they're like a

1175
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,720
psychological like neurosis that they have to try and overcome.

1176
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,880
Like that's a funny bit.

1177
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,320
And then immediately they drop it and they just are coming in to be like,

1178
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm bullied at school for being a brony.

1179
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,160
And I need this YouTuber to explain to me what I should do about that or whatever.

1180
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,480
And it just became the worst thing ever.

1181
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:06,080
I forget what the crown prince one, like the, my one, like I forgot what

1182
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,280
I said in my one.

1183
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah.

1184
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,800
I don't think it was that good.

1185
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,200
It was nicely animated, though.

1186
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,400
That was, that was the fun part.

1187
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,280
I mean, mine was about Phantom Horn, uh, base.

1188
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,040
I mean, that was, that was in the era of Phantom Horn, where he was just

1189
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,640
unironically a like, haha, aren't SJW stupid, like guy.

1190
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,160
So his, his thing is literally like, people miss species me and that's a problem.

1191
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,840
But also like, haha, isn't it funny that that would be a problem someone would have?

1192
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,600
Well, so, you know, pretty, pretty cool, pretty awesome.

1193
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,120
Pretty great.

1194
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,240
I'm looking at his channel and he's still, he's still cooking.

1195
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,280
He's still cooking.

1196
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,400
Let him cook.

1197
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,080
Good for him.

1198
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,080
Let him cook.

1199
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,960
I don't see the therapist things much anymore.

1200
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,960
It seems like it's more just, you know, talking about the show and stuff.

1201
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,240
Yeah, I think I, I would assume he pivoted to talking about the CG stuff.

1202
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,680
Yeah, as you see in that.

1203
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,240
I saw the movie.

1204
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
I saw the movie.

1205
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,240
I don't think I don't know much about the show.

1206
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,160
I assume it's just the characters from the movie having like little moments,

1207
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,760
little fun things.

1208
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,560
Oh my God, analysis anarchy.

1209
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,160
They're still so prominent.

1210
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,080
Eight days, eight days ago, they did another analysis anarchy.

1211
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,920
The longest running series in YouTube history will be analysis anarchy.

1212
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,560
OK, all right.

1213
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,720
Mercifully, it doesn't seem like it's that popular anymore.

1214
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,160
It only got, it only got nine K views in the, in the week it's been out.

1215
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,240
So nine thousands, a lot of people.

1216
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,160
I know, but it used to be, it used to be a lot more.

1217
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,360
I scroll down a little bit.

1218
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,000
There's more analysis anarchy and it's like 30 K, 31 K.

1219
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:58,600
TF2 analysis, TF2 analysis, season seven, the movie part one.

1220
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:05,480
Wait, what TF2 analysis, season seven, the movie part one three weeks ago,

1221
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,480
an hour long, five thousand views.

1222
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
OK, what?

1223
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,720
It's when they say TF2 analysis, do they mean analysis anarchy?

1224
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,880
Yes, that's why it's been so confusing.

1225
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,000
It's why do they, why don't they call it analysis is the analysis

1226
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,560
community of MLP and they play TF2 together.

1227
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,120
So it's TF2 analysis for short, which confuses everybody

1228
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,720
because that's not what it sounds like.

1229
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,720
It's not, no, it's this doesn't make any fucking sense.

1230
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,200
The show, am I crazy?

1231
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,840
Is the show not called analysis anarchy?

1232
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,600
It was initially TF2 analysis anarchy.

1233
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:54,040
So why is this compilation called TF2 analysis?

1234
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:01,480
Per colon quotation mark, season seven, the movie, parentheses, part one.

1235
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,800
End quotation mark.

1236
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,840
Why?

1237
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,240
I mean, why not?

1238
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,320
I guess it's not going to bring in more viewers, but the people

1239
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,680
that know are going to know what they're clicking on.

1240
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,720
Look, I just look, maybe I'm I'm sorry.

1241
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,680
I might be the only one that cares about this.

1242
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,760
I just why did they take a word out of the title of the show

1243
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,040
when they they've always done that, though, they always do.

1244
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,320
They talk, they say TF2 analysis, like, like interchangeably with analysis anarchy.

1245
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,480
Maybe anarchy gets their video demonetized or something.

1246
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,560
I guess I shouldn't complain because we are the PCP, but our logo

1247
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,000
has always been TPC.

1248
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,040
So I have no, I have, right, I have no room to complain.

1249
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,240
Okay, it's fine.

1250
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,040
Okay, so, so that's how you found me through the Crown Prince video.

1251
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,440
Yeah, and then I just went to every possible way I could, you know,

1252
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,720
listen to your voice some more.

1253
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,160
That's true.

1254
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,640
Oh, no, it's true.

1255
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,440
It's true.

1256
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,960
And then I found the PCP and then everything collapsed.

1257
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,840
And then we have a pandemic.

1258
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:25,600
And then surely, surely more time elapsed between those two things.

1259
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,760
Does that mean you've seen my comics?

1260
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,200
I have some of them, some of them.

1261
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,560
For some reason, I have, I don't spend a lot of time reading web

1262
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,640
comics anymore, but I got the load of ghost books and it's on my shelf.

1263
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,760
Yes, I remember.

1264
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,800
Oh, hell yeah, you bought one of those.

1265
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,480
Hell yeah.

1266
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
Yeah, that's good stuff.

1267
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,160
How many of my comics did you buy?

1268
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:50,840
Ben.

1269
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,320
No, I know.

1270
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,720
Ellie is our cut this.

1271
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,720
Ellie is our cut this far.

1272
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,040
Ben's taking the biggest L of his career.

1273
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,280
Don't actually know you mostly for your Winnie the Pooh videos.

1274
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,080
What?

1275
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,640
Really?

1276
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,360
That's true.

1277
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:05,960
It's true.

1278
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,960
I love those videos.

1279
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
No one talks about them.

1280
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,640
That's actually really funny.

1281
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,960
Yeah, you created a niche and then you filled that niche.

1282
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,720
Yeah, and then you disappeared.

1283
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,160
I still do mean to go back and finish.

1284
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:19,600
You know what?

1285
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:25,640
Maybe I should, I have never entirely abandoned the thought that I will

1286
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,560
finish at least season one of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

1287
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,280
It's good.

1288
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,200
I want you to get to my favorite episode.

1289
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,680
Which one's that?

1290
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,680
It's called Party Pooper.

1291
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:46,880
Rapid throws a party, but is too controlling, too hard-headed about it.

1292
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,520
So it's no fun for anyone.

1293
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,040
I don't know.

1294
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,920
I don't know if I remember that one.

1295
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,120
I'm not sure if I've seen that one.

1296
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,080
I don't even know what season it is.

1297
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,640
Like as a kid, I had a VHS with three episodes on it.

1298
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,960
And as a kid, I thought that's all that there was.

1299
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,240
And then just stand up.

1300
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,560
There was, you know, more episodes, a whole show.

1301
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,360
Yeah.

1302
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,520
So I just would just re-watch three episodes over and over.

1303
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,640
But after watching your videos, they like founded on Disney Plus

1304
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,240
and have been watching the rest of it.

1305
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,200
Oh, my God.

1306
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,480
It's a good show.

1307
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,400
That's very interesting.

1308
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,160
I think it was.

1309
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,320
It was a pretty good show, you know, for what it was.

1310
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,440
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

1311
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,280
I do I haven't been thinking about it that much lately, but like I would.

1312
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,120
I've told people before that, like, I will eventually finish season one.

1313
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,680
There's not even that much more of season one, honestly.

1314
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,080
I could probably just do it.

1315
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,480
You know, I've been I've been thinking, though, about.

1316
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,720
You know what I want to do?

1317
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:53,280
And I think I think I missed an opportunity by not streaming myself

1318
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,080
playing the Mega Man games while I was getting ready for the Mega Man video.

1319
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,360
I think I want to start streaming myself playing the battle network games

1320
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,600
in preparation for whenever I eventually do

1321
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,040
like the battle network continuity lecture.

1322
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,760
Because I'm definitely going to do that at some point.

1323
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,800
So I definitely need to play those games.

1324
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,800
So I might as well stream them.

1325
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,600
So I need to get like better internet so I can actually stream without it

1326
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,840
like crashing all the time.

1327
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,160
So yeah, that's my that's my next that's my next big move.

1328
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,480
That's my next power play.

1329
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,120
My memory of battle network is watching people who own that game play it.

1330
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,720
And I then understand why why you were in a grid

1331
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,760
and why you couldn't run around and shoot things.

1332
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,320
Yeah, I've I've never played one.

1333
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,480
I've seen it and I guess I I guess I understand that it's like a strategic.

1334
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,680
It's like a strategy RPG, but like on a very small grid, basically.

1335
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,760
That makes sense.

1336
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,200
And I think there's card mechanics that I think it might be a little bit

1337
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,800
like give or play chain of memories. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1338
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,640
I think there might sort of be like you have cards in your deck

1339
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,240
that you play like attacks and chain of memories, but it's on a grid, I think.

1340
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,200
OK, I don't think my my child brain would not have been able to comprehend that.

1341
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,120
I mean, I cards and a grid.

1342
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,320
No, thank you.

1343
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,680
I mean, I did manage to play chain of memories when it was new,

1344
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,880
although I was not that young for that.

1345
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,320
I think I think I probably

1346
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,760
I think I probably could have gotten into battle network if if I had tried it

1347
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:38,920
at the time, but I was more into the action jump and shoot man of zero,

1348
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,840
which I think was coming out around the same time.

1349
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,040
And, you know, I had a limited budget for video games.

1350
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,960
I wasn't allowed to play battle network

1351
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,680
because of all the violence in the world.

1352
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,280
Battling was is too much too dangerous.

1353
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,720
That's not true. That's not true.

1354
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,280
And networking.

1355
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,600
I was so scared of socializing and I couldn't.

1356
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,280
I wasn't allowed to play Mega Man because my parents thought it was

1357
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,160
unfeminist, like we already have men that are already, you know,

1358
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,000
just a press environment.

1359
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,640
Why we don't need Mega Man to do it even more.

1360
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,800
And they were with a mega picture, yeah.

1361
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,960
And to this day, we only have one female robot master.

1362
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,360
Two, if you count role.

1363
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,560
What the fuck are we talking about?

1364
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,080
Oh, finding each other on YouTube and stuff.

1365
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,200
Well, I don't know anything.

1366
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,480
I remember feeling like really cool when my little give and take channel

1367
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,360
got like subscribers from people who are like big like you.

1368
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,600
Deadly Comics had a lot of views on like your Scootaloo animations

1369
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,520
and you were like loads of subscribers.

1370
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,680
And I was like, oh, my God, Deadly Comics follows me.

1371
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,640
You were more subscribers than I was.

1372
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,880
I was more, you know,

1373
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,320
I was more ecstatic when I saw you upload the give and take jump.

1374
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,200
Oh, yeah. Oh, what was that?

1375
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,840
Oh, no, it was just for like.

1376
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,800
I got the GIF and then I put like a Led Zeppelin song on it.

1377
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,840
And I think Led Zeppelin took it down or something.

1378
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,920
Hey, hey, did you know that like on YouTube are our channels at

1379
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,920
is at the procrastinators 9667?

1380
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,920
Is that something they gave to you?

1381
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,680
I guess they like a guy in the email saying that YouTube has handles now

1382
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,200
and that you could select your handle.

1383
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,240
They've had them.

1384
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,320
I don't remember ever selecting it.

1385
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,920
I don't know why ours is 9667.

1386
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,840
I feel like maybe it used to be just at the procrastinators

1387
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,920
and maybe it got changed after the Brad Garlinghouse hack.

1388
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,880
Oh, probably that sucks.

1389
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,440
That's stupid.

1390
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,520
I don't like that.

1391
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,560
Maybe there's a way to change it back.

1392
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,600
I I was just looking at the channel, though,

1393
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,360
because I am I'm actually right on the cusp.

1394
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:14,080
I have almost my channel has almost surpassed the PCP in subscribers.

1395
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,960
I think the PCP is a twenty five point two K.

1396
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,680
I am at like twenty five point one K.

1397
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,000
Well, so any day now, the only thing that could beat you was yourself.

1398
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Exactly. I cheated on the game, but myself hypocrite.

1399
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,840
I think Pita like twenty K.

1400
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,200
I've been Ben St. Channel had been at twenty K for a long time,

1401
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,080
and now it got a big couple, couple thousand more recently.

1402
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,840
So cha-ching cha-ching.

1403
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,960
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,640
Did I mention that Chugga Conroy added me on Twitter?

1405
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,880
I saw that.

1406
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah, I know Chugga Conroy from like gaming stuff,

1407
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,720
but I wasn't an avid watcher.

1408
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,240
I just know I just know the name.

1409
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,160
I just know he's a big name.

1410
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,560
And so I tried to ask him if he he's

1411
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,560
well, he said on Twitter that he would he would love

1412
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,200
he said he would pay good money to be in the audience for a lecture.

1413
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,760
And I was like, oh, shit.

1414
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,920
So I tried to ask him if you wanted to come on the podcast

1415
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,720
and I didn't get a response, which is too bad because like the same.

1416
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,160
It's not the same as a big like, no, it's not the same.

1417
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,520
Well, I mean, I mean, I wasn't going to do another lecture with an audience.

1418
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,680
I wasn't planning on it.

1419
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:40,160
So like maybe maybe you could check out Conroy could pay the big money

1420
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,520
to just sit in front of you while you do your next lecture.

1421
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,480
Could he just give me big money?

1422
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,280
And that's it.

1423
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,640
Could he just give me some good money?

1424
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,240
You just invite him to your house.

1425
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,840
He sits down.

1426
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,600
What if we just did that?

1427
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:00,800
I mean, honestly, if you wanted, if like him and maybe a couple other people,

1428
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,760
maybe like Cybershell and maybe like a few others.

1429
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,160
I mean, I guess we could just organize a lecture thing.

1430
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,240
Anyway, I would still be down to come to America to sit at a lecture.

1431
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,360
The only reason it didn't work last time because it's a covid happened.

1432
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,520
I got covid.

1433
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,280
Yeah. I mean, we could do that, I guess.

1434
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,280
What's the next topic?

1435
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,200
Just for fun.

1436
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,480
Well, I don't know.

1437
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,200
I would have to pick something else because I was going to do.

1438
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,640
Well, I don't want to get I don't want to get into it.

1439
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,640
Tf2 analysis anarchy.

1440
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,560
Oh, my. You know what?

1441
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,400
You know what?

1442
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,440
I thought about it many times, but it's just like that.

1443
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,920
You would have to watch it.

1444
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,640
There's 16 hours of tf.

1445
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,640
There's probably like wait, no, there's not.

1446
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,480
Well, there's there's probably like seven hours.

1447
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,080
There's probably like there's probably like five to seven hours.

1448
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,800
There's seven five to seven too many.

1449
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,200
It would be it actually would be really funny.

1450
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm going to put that on.

1451
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,520
I'm going to put that on.

1452
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,720
No, I'm going to put that on the list, actually.

1453
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,160
I care about my mental health too much.

1454
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,840
How many people would?

1455
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,920
It would have to be people clicking on it who know what the tf2 analysis thing is.

1456
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,240
How many people are there?

1457
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,200
I mean, it could be an introductory thing.

1458
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,640
Like that's true.

1459
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,920
Like a weird niche of Brony subculture.

1460
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,560
Like, hello, everyone.

1461
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,480
I'm here to talk to you about this stupid thing that's insane that it exists.

1462
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,680
Now, that's now that's what the Brony lecture should have been.

1463
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,440
Is explaining like, who is Dr. Wolf?

1464
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,880
Who is Josh Scorcher?

1465
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,480
Who is I love Kim possible?

1466
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,480
A lot. Who is Silverquill?

1467
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,920
Where are they now? Yeah.

1468
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,720
Oh, they're still there.

1469
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
Yeah, they haven't gone anywhere.

1470
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,720
Uh, and take.

1471
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,640
Oh, where is Gibbon take?

1472
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,200
That's like, I mean, you almost like like a compelling idea

1473
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,720
in sort of the same vein of like, like what is like unicorn jelly

1474
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,720
and pastel defender heliotrope?

1475
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,920
Like, like what is this bizarre like, what is the rift?

1476
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,240
What is the rift cafe?

1477
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,400
The story, the history of the rift cafe.

1478
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,680
That's a much better Brony lecture than the actual Brony lecture was,

1479
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,680
which is just talking about was actually available.

1480
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,040
Brony knowledge was actually just a history of the PCP.

1481
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,480
Yeah, publicly available.

1482
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,120
Brony knowledge mixed with how did the PCP form, which is like fine.

1483
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:32,560
Um, I made a new fucking RuneScape video.

1484
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,080
That's one thing I did.

1485
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,400
Oh, why?

1486
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
It's a it's a it's only a little thing.

1487
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:43,560
Um, just as an update, because I finally I chopped enough of the trees

1488
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,960
for my fletching challenge.

1489
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,600
Oh, very good.

1490
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,400
It was twenty eight thousand something you logs.

1491
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,120
And they're in my bank.

1492
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,280
And I just showed the people that I did that.

1493
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,600
And I laughed in insanely.

1494
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,480
I coughed and then I laughed and I was insane about like, what the fuck?

1495
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,320
And then I then I then that's it.

1496
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,840
It sounds very, very in character for you.

1497
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's not much.

1498
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,200
I just felt like like I didn't know what milestones to make.

1499
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,440
It was a very small milestone.

1500
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,400
But the next milestone will probably be like two years in the future

1501
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,200
because of the amount of coal I need to get.

1502
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,920
And the amount of time I'm willing to spend like focusing on that

1503
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,040
as opposed to having it in the background.

1504
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,960
I've been playing Noida again, and that's bad.

1505
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,000
Noida is a bad game.

1506
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,320
That's the one with all the sane and all the pixels.

1507
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,400
Yes, yes, the pixel sands.

1508
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,360
I wanted to play that.

1509
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,280
It looks fun.

1510
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,000
It is a good it's a good game and it's a fun game.

1511
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,560
But I like I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything,

1512
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,120
but I have kind of mastered it to the point that like

1513
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,960
win, lose, like whatever, playing it is pretty formulaic at this point.

1514
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,080
I know I know how to build a wand that wins the game.

1515
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:10,120
And it's just a question of like how how quick how quick do I get that wand?

1516
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,040
And then like, do I survive?

1517
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,840
Do do I do something stupid that kills me or do I not?

1518
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,520
So I'm not I'm not getting anything more out of it anymore.

1519
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,080
So I really should just stop playing it.

1520
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,040
And yet I and yet I continue

1521
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,480
because it still feels good when I get a wand that goes burr

1522
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:37,040
and just blasts out damage when it still gives me that visceral power feeling

1523
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,080
and I crave it.

1524
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,680
I just want to destroy my enemies.

1525
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,560
It's it lets me it lets me live that.

1526
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,800
Anyway, anyway,

1527
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,680
300,000 views on the Mega Man video, by the way,

1528
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,120
we passed 300,000 is a yay, yay.

1529
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,040
Thank you. I'm very happy.

1530
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,520
I'm very happy about it.

1531
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
300,000 times eight.

1532
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,800
Now, how many hours?

1533
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,960
Oh, actually, well, actually, the watch time,

1534
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,320
well, because the average view is not eight hours long, the total watch

1535
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,320
hours, cowards, the total watch time on the video is two hundred and twenty eight

1536
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,480
thousand hours.

1537
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,920
Fuck, which is two hundred and twenty eight thousand hours.

1538
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,400
In years.

1539
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,600
That's 26 years, 26 years of useful human

1540
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,360
endeavor and energy have been wasted.

1541
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,720
That's how long I've been alive.

1542
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,600
Yeah.

1543
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,120
Well, so either you do whatever you were doing or you watch Ben St.

1544
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,080
's lecture over and over again.

1545
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:49,360
My lecture is is is pretty much equal in value to your entire life.

1546
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,560
If I would say so, I would say so.

1547
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,040
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

1548
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,480
Hang on. I need to get a drink.

1549
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,640
I'll be one second.

1550
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,760
Just you and me now give and take.

1551
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,960
Oh, no. My dreams have come true.

1552
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,640
So did you you I guess you listen to the podcast?

1553
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:14,320
Yeah, I think I stopped at some point and then I came back

1554
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,600
and I didn't realize it had still been going all this time.

1555
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,160
This is an old podcast.

1556
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,040
Oh, we're still trekking.

1557
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,040
It's been it's been it's been 80 years.

1558
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,720
The we you know, I've been trying.

1559
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,520
I've been trying to create a vegetarian or vegan

1560
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,240
gummy alternative to the ones that I've been making

1561
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,000
because the ones because the ones that I've been making

1562
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,440
you know, they use gelatin, which is made with animal products.

1563
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,960
And my mom asked like if they're because I guess my sister has become a vegetarian

1564
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,040
and my mom asked if there was like a vegetarian way to make them.

1565
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,560
And I said, I don't know, maybe.

1566
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,680
So I've been trying to I tried to make them.

1567
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,840
I substituted agar agar for gelatin.

1568
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,480
And it works, but the consistency is completely different.

1569
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,080
And it's not bad, but it's not a gummy.

1570
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,120
So is it like not elastic?

1571
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,080
Yes, it's not elastic.

1572
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,560
It's it's just so soft.

1573
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,920
It's a very well, I would say it's stiffened.

1574
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,680
It's stiffened brittle.

1575
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,400
It's a stiff if it's a stiff, brittle sort of gel.

1576
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,440
And so I read about

1577
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,720
Xanthan gum can can help make it more elastic.

1578
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:41,040
So I tried adding some Xanthan gum and didn't didn't really like how it came out.

1579
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,200
There's another thing called locust bean gum, which I know I have it somewhere,

1580
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,160
but I can't fucking find my little tub of locust bean gum.

1581
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,360
That sounds disgusting.

1582
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,880
Well, yeah, but I mean like little beans that locusts

1583
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,560
build in their little factory.

1584
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,720
Well, I think it's a bean that maybe locusts eat them.

1585
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,600
Oh, you know, it's just it's it's the gum.

1586
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:12,800
It's it's the gum from some vegetable bean, much like much like Xanthan gum, I think.

1587
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,400
So yeah, it's not.

1588
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,440
It doesn't actually have anything to do with locusts.

1589
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,240
But I just I know I lost it.

1590
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,680
I lost it.

1591
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,440
Maybe they ate it.

1592
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,000
Oh, I mean, we had an inspector come into my house and inspect the place.

1593
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And apparently there are that I haven't seen the rat in a while.

1594
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,600
Also, there's a strange smell coming from the downstairs bathroom.

1595
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:46,440
And my suspicion is that the rat has died and is rotting and emitting a miasma.

1596
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,800
But none of us can find a corpse.

1597
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,880
So we're all sort of unsure where it's like fell down.

1598
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,080
The drain.

1599
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,360
Gross.

1600
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,800
I mean, that's that's a thing that can happen if you don't have the cover on the shower drain.

1601
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,320
Ew, maybe I'll check that.

1602
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,640
Maybe I'll check to see if that did happen.

1603
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,080
I think there's a cover on the shower drain, but I don't know.

1604
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,760
I don't use the downstairs bathroom.

1605
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,680
So maybe that's worth investigating.

1606
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,560
Anyway, it's really gross.

1607
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,440
An inspector came in, changed all the changed all the fire detectors.

1608
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,240
And now and now the fire detector on the first floor works, which is nice.

1609
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,720
But it goes off when I cook pizza in the oven.

1610
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,480
So that's bad.

1611
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,000
Hmm. Yeah, it's sad and makes me mad and upset.

1612
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,760
And also, I guess they found rat droppings around, which I don't know where they found those.

1613
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,880
I have not seen any rat droppings, and I do know what they look like.

1614
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,200
So I don't know where he saw them, but his note said that, like, there were some around.

1615
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,600
So that's too bad.

1616
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,400
That's very unfortunate.

1617
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,480
Should sweep the floor.

1618
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,480
The floor. Nobody has, like, swept the downstairs in a while.

1619
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,640
You should just do that.

1620
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,200
Be so easy and everyone would love me.

1621
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:09,920
Did I complain that I had to buy that I bought a huge, a huge box of toilet paper?

1622
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,320
You did last time.

1623
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,840
Nobody else buys a toilet paper.

1624
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,400
It's all on me.

1625
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,760
What would they do without me?

1626
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,320
They would die.

1627
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,560
They would have to get out without you smell bad.

1628
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,240
It would smell even worse than they smell now and they would die.

1629
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,760
Are you like in a townhouse kind of thing?

1630
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,480
Or like a. Yeah, I'm like splitting.

1631
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,040
I'm like splitting a condo with like five people.

1632
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,560
Oh, OK.

1633
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,120
So there's no, like, maintenance fellow who comes to clean.

1634
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,520
It's up to the tenants.

1635
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,880
No, there is no. There's no.

1636
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,520
Damn. Damn, that would be fancy.

1637
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,320
That would be fancy if we had a guy that came to clean the house.

1638
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,000
That's what we got for like what for you or whatever.

1639
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,720
Well, that's awesome. I'm jealous.

1640
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,040
Somebody just has to sweep the kitchen.

1641
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,080
Somebody just has to like sweep the kitchen in the front hallway.

1642
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,640
It's not even that that much work.

1643
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,640
I just wanted I've been meaning to just do it.

1644
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,840
You should you should live stream yourself sweeping,

1645
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,800
turning into content.

1646
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,880
I need I need we need to change.

1647
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,240
We need to change internet providers so that our

1648
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,240
my stream will not cut out.

1649
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,280
Fuck.

1650
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,000
That would be a really funny reason,

1651
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,280
like why nobody sweeps.

1652
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,920
It's like, yeah, I mean, I would sweep, but I can't stream it.

1653
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,720
Yeah. Oh, man.

1654
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,160
Another. Did I tell you that I've sent?

1655
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:36,920
Mention that like the boyfriend of the girl that lives here

1656
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,800
said that like he wants.

1657
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,240
Well, no, one of my roommates told me that he wants to start a podcast.

1658
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,760
And another one told me that he wants to start streaming

1659
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,680
himself playing like Magic the Gathering, because I guess he

1660
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,320
he claims to be quite skilled at Magic the Gathering.

1661
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,360
And I'm like, I can't I can't let these people know that I'm a podcaster.

1662
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,560
Right. I've revealed I've revealed too much.

1663
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,680
I've revealed too much by even mentioning to any of them that I like

1664
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,840
do stuff on YouTube.

1665
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,080
Like, I wish I I wish I didn't say that.

1666
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,680
They'd be like, Ben, could you could you help me with my setup?

1667
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,160
Because, you know, you you know about that stuff, right?

1668
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,120
You're like, you're like a tech guy.

1669
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,280
Never. Never. You're like a YouTube guy.

1670
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,760
You could figure it out for me.

1671
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,800
I do labor for free.

1672
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,240
I wouldn't that would that would be bad.

1673
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,760
That would be bad if they wanted me to like help with their setup.

1674
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,240
It would be even worse if they wanted to like.

1675
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,000
Collaborate or something.

1676
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,080
Can you imagine?

1677
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,040
Can you imagine if they want to like, hey,

1678
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,640
let me shout out shout out my shout out my Magic the Gathering based

1679
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,280
Twitch, Twitch channel, please.

1680
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,600
Oh, dear.

1681
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,400
You know, I'm just I'm just catastrophizing.

1682
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,320
I'm just imagining the worst possible scenario.

1683
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,960
Nobody nobody can know nobody can know that I'm a podcaster.

1684
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,840
I didn't mention you should you should sweep.

1685
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,000
I didn't mention it to that cousin who was asking about YouTube ad revenue.

1686
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,640
You should sweep the floor so that they think you're a janitor instead.

1687
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,440
Yeah, I'll tell them I quit.

1688
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,680
I'll tell them I quit the posting life and decided to.

1689
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,560
Return to the earth.

1690
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,920
You know, you know, something that irritated me,

1691
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:32,200
something that made me mad about my dinner with Andre was how shit it was.

1692
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:37,520
But also is that the guy Wallace Shawn,

1693
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,240
he's complaining about how poor he is.

1694
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,440
He's complaining about like, business is not good.

1695
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,000
I don't get any work.

1696
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,560
I'm a failed playwright and then and his his.

1697
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,560
The like the examples that they give for how how poor and and and unsuccessful

1698
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,480
he is is that his girlfriend has to work three nights a week.

1699
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,200
Like she doesn't even she doesn't even have a full time job.

1700
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,880
She has a part time job.

1701
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,040
Wow. Yeah.

1702
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:10,520
It's like most nowadays, most people just it's most people,

1703
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,920
just men and women, both partners just have a job.

1704
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,040
You just everyone has a job, right?

1705
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,040
Is this the 80s movie?

1706
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,600
Hmm, 70s or 80s?

1707
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,840
I'm so poor.

1708
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,840
I had to sell one of my 70 yachts.

1709
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,880
I'm so I'm so poor.

1710
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,120
I'm so poor.

1711
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,360
My girlfriend has to work.

1712
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,240
My girlfriend works a part time job.

1713
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,120
Oh, whoa, is me.

1714
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,560
Oh, I'm so poor.

1715
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,360
I usually don't go to this like extravagantly fancy restaurant,

1716
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,400
but like, it's fine.

1717
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,080
I will do that and I can afford it.

1718
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,360
It's OK, 1981.

1719
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,360
All right.

1720
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,080
There's more.

1721
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,000
There's more that I could say about that.

1722
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,200
There's more like weird little things in there that just hint at like.

1723
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,800
Just the the the the the economic differences in the economies of then versus now.

1724
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Yeah, ways that like.

1725
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,000
Think things that he thinks that.

1726
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,200
The way that you all is Sean is portrayed as like so poor in destitute.

1727
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,760
He's so like so down in his luck, but like he, you know, he he splits like

1728
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,720
he splits in New York.

1729
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,360
He splits it like a Manhattan, New York apartment with his girlfriend,

1730
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,880
who only works a part time job.

1731
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,760
Like, my God, I live I live in a much cheaper area

1732
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,520
and I split my house like seven ways.

1733
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,080
Like, dude.

1734
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:41,200
Dude, it's you know, it reminds me of like Homer Simpson,

1735
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,800
how like home the Simpsons are sort of like poor.

1736
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,480
They're down in their luck.

1737
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,040
They're they've got a giant house.

1738
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,080
They're a blue collar family, but they own a house.

1739
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,560
They have two cars that yeah, the mom doesn't work, etc.

1740
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,920
It's a hold over from an age when

1741
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,640
it was normal to have like a big old thing like that.

1742
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,960
It was it wasn't like that extravagant, actually.

1743
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,080
I know cringe, cringe.

1744
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,800
Those are the days.

1745
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,040
Do you think they're going to I'm pretty sure they will.

1746
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,760
But like the Simpsons doing like the

1747
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,760
constantly breaking the timeline stuff with like

1748
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,560
a new episode about Homer and Marge in the past of the 90s.

1749
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:28,280
Yeah, and then an episode of them of the past in the 2000s.

1750
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,160
Yeah, actually, they're going to have been zoomers this whole time.

1751
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,120
I mean, I hope the show doesn't continue that long.

1752
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,080
It will continue until 100 seasons.

1753
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,080
I kind of hope that it ends soon.

1754
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:50,680
I mean, I have heard people say that it is not as bad now as it was for a while,

1755
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,880
that it has sort of like embrace its.

1756
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,760
It's it's what it is as like new Simpsons and it's more trying to be its own

1757
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,960
modern thing instead of sort of.

1758
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:07,000
Aping its former self and that that's been good for it, I guess, I don't know.

1759
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,360
It's still it's you know, it's cringe to see it continue on.

1760
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,400
But it's already like they already had the Elon Musk is the greatest

1761
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,760
inventor of modern times episode.

1762
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:23,400
So like they've already got shamed themselves as much as they possibly can.

1763
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,200
So there's no lower they can go.

1764
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
They can only go up from here.

1765
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,920
At this point, I don't even really think of it as like a show you can watch.

1766
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,040
It's just sort of like.

1767
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,440
How can something go on for this long?

1768
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:41,200
Like, how is it continually getting greenlit for a new season?

1769
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,080
Like, obviously, it's a giant thing, but like it's so insane.

1770
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,880
Because people still watch it.

1771
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,880
I mean, not as many people.

1772
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,200
I just imagine the voice actors who have to.

1773
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:01,320
Do this one role and get paid extremely well for it, but only have this one thing to do.

1774
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:07,040
I mean, in the case of some of them like damaging their voice permanently in the process,

1775
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,040
like, do they are they very tired of it?

1776
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,760
I'm sure they rather do another thing.

1777
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,800
I know.

1778
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,760
I'm going to say no, like, because it's like you said, I'm sure it's like

1779
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,120
it's what they're known for.

1780
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:26,480
It's a very high profile role and I'm sure they get paid extremely well for it.

1781
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:33,880
And I mean, not saying that like voice acting is like not, you know, hard work in its own right,

1782
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,600
but like it's easier.

1783
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,040
I'm sure it's I'm sure, you know, recording lines for a 30 minute

1784
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:44,960
show is a lot easier than than the other jobs out there, even in entertainment.

1785
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:50,320
So I'm sure it's a very, very pretty, pretty cushy, pretty cushy position.

1786
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,760
That's probably why they've all been doing it for 35 years.

1787
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,160
Mega Man just turned 35.

1788
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,960
Yesterday was the anniversary.

1789
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,560
Wow. Oh, I saw the 17th about that.

1790
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:03,520
He's an old man.

1791
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,000
What did Capcom do to celebrate?

1792
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,480
I don't know what they did, but apparently there were no major like game

1793
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,640
announcements, which is which is too bad.

1794
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,800
That's that's that's unfortunate.

1795
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,560
But I think no one was really expecting one.

1796
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,600
So. Eh, nothing.

1797
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:27,480
Mega Man, 35th, maybe like Kotaku has like an article summarizing.

1798
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:32,280
Oh, here's one that says New Mega Man could be revealed for 35th anniversary.

1799
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,280
Yeah, I guess a lot of things could happen.

1800
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,480
That's not news.

1801
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,040
That's not news.

1802
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,760
It's not news.

1803
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:43,480
Wouldn't it be so fucked up if there was something to talk about today on the news?

1804
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,760
That'd be so fucked up.

1805
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,080
Let's talk about that.

1806
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,200
I don't really see any major announcements.

1807
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,720
I feel like there would be like.

1808
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,160
Higher search results, if there was anything noteworthy.

1809
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,960
I didn't I wasn't really paying that close attention.

1810
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,280
I figured I would hear about it if there was anything big.

1811
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:12,120
And they should do they should do their own like Smash Brothers universe,

1812
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,720
but just for Mega Man so that all the Mega Man characters can interact.

1813
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,360
It's a little little like crossover game.

1814
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,680
Like Power Rangers, every Red Ranger from every iteration of Power Rangers

1815
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,680
gets together for a special episode, but it's Mega Man instead.

1816
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,280
I mean, they had.

1817
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,360
Well, they had Mega Man, the power battle and Mega Man to the power fighters,

1818
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:42,080
which were like fighting games where your Mega Man against the robot masters.

1819
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,320
I mean, yeah, there's enough.

1820
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:49,240
There's enough robot masters that they probably could do that for sure.

1821
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,640
Are there any games where you can play as those guys?

1822
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:58,960
Um, well, I think in I think in like one of the remakes,

1823
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,440
like in Mega Man, powered up, I think you could play as some of the robot masters.

1824
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,360
Um, try to think.

1825
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,440
There should be a school like a high school anime

1826
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,880
visual novel with all the Mega Man.

1827
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,800
I don't, you know, I wonder if they're I wonder if the mangas and stuff

1828
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,040
like go more into like what does what does Rock do when he's not Mega Man?

1829
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,360
Like, does he go to school?

1830
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,520
Like, does he does he like blend in with society?

1831
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,040
Like, does he go shopping?

1832
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,080
Is he friends with Shinji?

1833
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,880
Shinji from Everingale?

1834
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,600
Is he friends with Shinji? Yeah.

1835
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,520
Yeah, he probably he probably would be now that you mentioned it.

1836
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,760
They're just doing like the the dejected like hanged heads.

1837
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,680
Like pose, but together.

1838
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,520
I don't know why that's so funny.

1839
01:28:54,720 --> 01:29:00,680
But but you know, they kind of hint in the games, they kind of hint at like,

1840
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:06,440
oh, yeah, when when he's not when he's not Mega Man, he's like Rock.

1841
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,960
And like as Rock, maybe he's just a normal kid.

1842
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,040
Does he just does he live a normal kid life?

1843
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,920
Like, does he have friends?

1844
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,840
Like, what's what's the deal?

1845
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,640
What game does he play?

1846
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,920
Yeah. And do you want that?

1847
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,440
Just read Astro Boy, because that's what that is.

1848
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,400
I know. True.

1849
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,840
I know. It's I've read a few.

1850
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,360
Mega Man literally just is they made Astro Boy again, but they made it a video game this time.

1851
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,840
Yeah, I need to read more Astro Boys.

1852
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,600
I tried to read all of them and I got like to the beginning.

1853
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,200
There's a few like little short stories.

1854
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,360
They're like, they're so odd.

1855
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:48,520
I would like to be fun to read some old Tezuka stuff.

1856
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
I've like never read any of it.

1857
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,160
It's really good. Blackjack, I highly recommend.

1858
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:59,120
It's like a like a medical drama, I guess.

1859
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,520
Yeah, I've seen your house.

1860
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,640
Exactly. I've seen the Blackjack movie.

1861
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,680
And it was OK.

1862
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,240
Yeah.

1863
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,800
Well, Blackjack is kind of like, isn't he kind of like an evil dude?

1864
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
He's sort of, I guess it's like a.

1865
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,120
I wouldn't say anti hero.

1866
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,560
Yeah, anti hero.

1867
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,080
Like he goes by his own rules.

1868
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:32,360
He's a unlicensed, a renegade and unlicensed doctor who charges insane amounts.

1869
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,480
But, you know, you know, it's what he's doing.

1870
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,440
He does.

1871
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,320
Like, oh, you got an uncurable disease.

1872
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:43,760
I have this experimental new technique using shuriken.

1873
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,360
I can throw them into your heart and they can fix everything.

1874
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,160
Nice. You have to trust me.

1875
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,360
No, no, thanks.

1876
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,120
Well, it looks like you're going to die from heart death or whatever you got.

1877
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,600
Damn it. Yeah.

1878
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,160
Fuck.

1879
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,400
I was getting off his back.

1880
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,160
He's got other patients.

1881
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,000
Got other fish to fry.

1882
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,520
And they got money.

1883
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,640
You got money to pay.

1884
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,760
Yeah, you don't get the you can't pay the bills.

1885
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,160
Then you then you then you keep then you retain your ills.

1886
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:17,960
That's that's what I always say.

1887
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,560
Did he do Usagi, Yajimbo, or is that someone else?

1888
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,880
That's someone else.

1889
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,720
That's like a I don't know if it's American, but it's.

1890
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,640
Somewhere it's somewhere somehow related to TMNT around that same time.

1891
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,760
Really? They cross over a lot.

1892
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,880
What? Yeah, I think it's like Usagi,

1893
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,000
Yajimbo is like from the early days of free comics.

1894
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,920
That just happened to get a bit popular.

1895
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,280
But is it? Wait, is it not Japanese?

1896
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,000
Japanese born American.

1897
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,880
Oh, OK.

1898
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,320
Stan, Stan Sakai, yeah, that's a guy.

1899
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:12,920
Oh, this looks cool.

1900
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,000
I haven't seen this before.

1901
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,720
OK, this is not I thought it was older.

1902
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,360
I was older than that.

1903
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,120
Maybe I'm you know, am I confusing it with is it like Wolf and Pup?

1904
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,720
Yeah, that's another old one.

1905
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,960
It's not Tezuka, but it's another like classical manga.

1906
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,360
What's that one about the like set?

1907
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:37,000
He's like a Ronin or he's like he's like a samurai,

1908
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,720
but it's not like a battle manga.

1909
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:43,440
It's just about like a samurai like hanging out at his house

1910
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,760
and like cheating on his wife and ignoring his kids.

1911
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,160
Is that Ring of Bell?

1912
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,280
I don't know this one.

1913
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,560
Oh, man, where did I hear about this one?

1914
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,840
Someone was talking about it and some.

1915
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:04,520
Oh, it's an old manga about a samurai

1916
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,720
cheating on his wife.

1917
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,760
Is it Hagure Gumo?

1918
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,480
Yes, this is it.

1919
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,600
Yes, this is it.

1920
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:19,640
Hagure Gumo is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by George Akiyama.

1921
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:24,320
Hagure Gumo literally vagrant cloud is a Japanese manga, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1922
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,360
Set at the end of the Edo period,

1923
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,640
it depicts clouds, clouds family with his wife, Turtle,

1924
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:37,080
their 11 year old son and eight year old daughter with his wife's name is Turtle.

1925
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,800
The clouds are always ignoring work and playing.

1926
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,880
Cloud is notorious for womanizing.

1927
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,880
OK, and that's the plot.

1928
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,320
Is this an old series or is this a new thing?

1929
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,560
It is from it's.

1930
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:53,280
Oh, my God, it ran from 1973 all the way

1931
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,920
for to 2017. Are you joking?

1932
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,160
Oh.

1933
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:02,720
How did it how did it run for 46 years?

1934
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,080
I guess he got around that samurai.

1935
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,400
Here's what it looks like.

1936
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,680
Someone in the comments, tell me where I heard about this.

1937
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,560
His name is cloud, maybe from Final Fantasy Seven.

1938
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,600
Yeah.

1939
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,720
George Akiyama is the author.

1940
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,840
Is that a normal, like George first name?

1941
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,640
I think that maybe is a Beatles.

1942
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,280
OK, his name is Joji, but I think that's like

1943
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,720
it's Americanized as George.

1944
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,080
Maybe he lived in America.

1945
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,800
His father was Korean and an artificial flower craftsman.

1946
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:49,240
Gay stupid.

1947
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,320
You know, flowers already exist.

1948
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,280
Hey, let me pick them.

1949
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,360
You know what? Just pluck them.

1950
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:55,840
If I, you know, you know what?

1951
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:00,280
To continue, let me do some more toxic masculinity.

1952
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:05,120
My I mentioned that the girl that lives here has this boyfriend.

1953
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:09,440
She's this guy who's like always here and they always cook together.

1954
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,720
And I got to say it's very effeminate.

1955
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:15,120
It's a very effeminate thing that he has this girlfriend

1956
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,640
and that he cooks dinner with her.

1957
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,120
It's just not it's just it's just not it's just not manly.

1958
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,800
Why depends on what they're cooking,

1959
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,640
like if it's a big it's just a big beef stew as a man.

1960
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,320
No, it's it's not it's not it's not manly.

1961
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,080
So wrong. Is there anything wrong

1962
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,920
with being an effeminate in the kitchen?

1963
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,080
Absolutely everything.

1964
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:41,720
No, I just I just seems seems like a big fucking waste of time.

1965
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,160
It just seems like every time I see them,

1966
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,800
they're always like cooking some shit in the kitchen.

1967
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,120
And it's like how many fucking hours a day do you spend

1968
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,920
preparing some nonsense, you idiots.

1969
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,160
Just put ham on a wrap and roll it up and eat it and be done.

1970
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,920
Be done with your with your garbage.

1971
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:02,960
I don't know.

1972
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,440
I think it's nice to be able to cook something.

1973
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,240
I think, you know what, it's fine every now and then.

1974
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:12,000
I don't know. I don't like I can't it just seems it just seems so tedious.

1975
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,400
It just seems like they make it's like such a big production.

1976
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,800
It's like that's what you spend your evening doing.

1977
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,200
It's like preparing shopping for the ingredients to prepare this meal

1978
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,160
and then preparing it and laying it all out meticulously

1979
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,240
and doing all these intricate steps to do to in order for it to

1980
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,280
and then you actually you just have to take the time to cook it.

1981
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,440
And then, you know, you plate it out and you eat it afterwards.

1982
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,520
And it's like that's your that's your evening.

1983
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,600
That that sucks if you're by yourself.

1984
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,080
But like if with two people, it takes not so long, I guess.

1985
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,120
Oh, are you saying that it could be a fun

1986
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,200
activity to spend with someone you love?

1987
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,520
Yeah, that's what I'm effeminate.

1988
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,640
That's what I mean. That's what I'm saying.

1989
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,440
You would say that, wouldn't you?

1990
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,440
Yeah.

1991
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,840
Sounds great.

1992
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,600
I like I'm going to keep shaming him for it.

1993
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,440
I'll never stop.

1994
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:10,040
You should be like me and make a pass at Turkish girls on the bus

1995
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:15,000
and get laughed at and kicked off the much manly.

1996
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,160
And now I don't have to waste my time cooking.

1997
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,560
Now I can just eat ham wraps and it's no problem.

1998
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,040
I'm I'm I'm I'm a man in the kitchen.

1999
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,760
I'm manly in the kitchen.

2000
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,840
I just mix my ingredients together.

2001
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,520
I add some Xanthan gum, add some Xanthan gum

2002
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,120
to my to my agar agar solution.

2003
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,480
And then I taste it and I say, you gross.

2004
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,120
It has a consistency of snot and boogers.

2005
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,320
And then I throw it away.

2006
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,280
And that's and that's and then it's done.

2007
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,720
You know what? It's not a big deal.

2008
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,320
It's not a big fucking federal issue.

2009
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,840
Oh, I just pulled a leg muscle.

2010
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,920
This is the new podcast talking point, everybody.

2011
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:05,680
Oh, no, which muscle was it the hamstring?

2012
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,480
Well, it's the one

2013
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,280
that goes under the knee and on the inside of the leg.

2014
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,480
Oh, I don't like that.

2015
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,200
It like sticks out.

2016
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,200
It's in a vulnerable position today.

2017
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,000
It's like it's under the knee and then up on the inner thigh area.

2018
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:23,720
It's sort of.

2019
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,240
Are you talking about the vastus medialis?

2020
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,280
Oh, that's the one.

2021
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,440
I don't know the names of the muscles.

2022
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,400
You know what? My, you know what?

2023
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,520
This is a perfect time for me to mention my favorite leg muscle,

2024
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,880
the sartorius.

2025
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,320
Artorius of the abyss.

2026
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,680
Yes, the sartorius of the abyss.

2027
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,720
I'll show you.

2028
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,400
I'll show you.

2029
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,480
It's I'll highlight it in red.

2030
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,800
It's it's this one.

2031
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,080
No, don't show me your muscles, Ben.

2032
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,680
It's this one right here.

2033
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,200
Is that the one that could be it?

2034
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,480
You say that one's your favorite.

2035
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,240
That's my favorite.

2036
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,800
Just because of what it does for you.

2037
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,400
No, I just think it looks cool.

2038
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,200
I'll stretch over like that.

2039
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,000
I have no idea.

2040
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,800
Yeah, how it how it just kind of like crosses over

2041
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,040
the over on top of the other ones.

2042
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,920
Looks pretty fruity to me.

2043
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,720
Fruity looks effeminate.

2044
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,040
Yeah. No, no.

2045
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,400
Need a perfectly cute muscle.

2046
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,160
That's the man I am.

2047
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,080
I don't know why. You know what?

2048
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:33,760
I'm just going to write.

2049
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,760
I'm just going to write.

2050
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,400
I'm just going to write.

2051
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,880
I'm just going to cope.

2052
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,600
I'm like I'm like I'm like the ugly.

2053
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:42,440
I'm like the ugliest, soyest, most beta male in my entire family.

2054
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,040
It's very sad. It makes me sad.

2055
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,760
It bums me out.

2056
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,080
I'm the shortest.

2057
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,360
I'm the shortest male of the.

2058
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,000
I'm the shortest male son of the shortest male

2059
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,360
uncle in the in the whole group.

2060
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,760
Everybody else is taller than me.

2061
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,520
And also just just just tougher looking.

2062
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,800
Just tougher. They got better chins.

2063
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,960
Even the women even the women are taller than me.

2064
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,800
What do I do? Help.

2065
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,400
That's always good when a woman is taller.

2066
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,880
Yeah, that's not a problem.

2067
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,480
Stupid, stupid.

2068
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
This is not my this is not my dad's side.

2069
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,520
All my all my all my cousins on my dad's side are like tall.

2070
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,680
Sucks. I don't like him.

2071
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,920
And then they also and also their landlords.

2072
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,120
Well, that's.

2073
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,280
You know, if you take estrogen,

2074
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,920
you'll get even shorter.

2075
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,880
I don't think that's true.

2076
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,800
It is. I've lost.

2077
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,600
I've lost half an inch since I started like two years ago.

2078
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,200
How?

2079
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:53,120
Because your bones, they they they get like weaker.

2080
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,920
I think I talked about this already,

2081
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:57,040
maybe not on the progress news podcast.

2082
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,840
But the effects of estrogen on the bones

2083
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:06,080
is that they become less strong and they shrink a tiny bit.

2084
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,240
Sounds over the course of your whole skeleton.

2085
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,080
You get a little shorter.

2086
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,600
Sounds awesome.

2087
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,840
So what you need to do is you need to chug testosterone.

2088
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,760
You need to get as much of that as you possibly can

2089
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,720
and just chug it to a dangerous amount.

2090
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:22,240
I guess that makes a lot of sense when you put it like that.

2091
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,920
That probably is what I should do.

2092
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,920
Yeah. Yeah.

2093
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,560
I don't know.

2094
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,960
You know, I'm just it's just beta.

2095
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,720
It's just very effeminate of me.

2096
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:37,960
And I just think that it's lame.

2097
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,840
It's nothing wrong with being beta.

2098
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,920
Nothing wrong with being a little effeminate soy boy.

2099
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,400
I'm so I'm a little effeminate soy boy.

2100
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:51,080
And that's it.

2101
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:51,680
That's it.

2102
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:53,160
Nothing wrong with being a tiny, cutesy.

2103
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:53,840
I'm just a loser.

2104
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,200
I'm just a big loser and everyone hates me.

2105
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,400
No. Yeah. Yeah.

2106
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,400
No, fake, false.

2107
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,680
I don't hate you. Yes, you do.

2108
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,000
Stupid.

2109
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:04,760
Prove it.

2110
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,800
Prove how I hate you.

2111
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,360
I.

2112
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,960
Fuck.

2113
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,080
I'm sure I'm sure there's a way.

2114
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:12,920
Deadly. Come on.

2115
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,480
Tell me you hate me.

2116
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,520
I could tell me I'm tell me I'm a little soy boy.

2117
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,040
But it's it's spent on me.

2118
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,640
If that's what you are, then I'm even worse.

2119
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,880
If that's I know you.

2120
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,400
I know you are.

2121
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,400
But what am I?

2122
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,480
Better. OK.

2123
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,120
Yeah.

2124
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,640
Daily affirmations.

2125
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:33,840
Um, I just, um,

2126
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,520
you're short king, Ben.

2127
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,560
Embrace it.

2128
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,120
I'm not even that short.

2129
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,760
I'm not even that shorter than you.

2130
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,360
You are shorter than me.

2131
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,880
I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I'm like pretty average.

2132
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,640
I'm like, maybe just slightly shy of the average height

2133
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,320
of the American male.

2134
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,880
And yet.

2135
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,360
I don't know, it's just it's just weird.

2136
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,560
Like everybody, all my all my cousins are like,

2137
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,520
all my cousins are like six foot two.

2138
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,800
It's really weird.

2139
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,000
I mean, my cousins are giants.

2140
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,560
Is that true?

2141
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:10,120
Yeah. Well, at least on the one side where my my uncle was

2142
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,960
like a big guy.

2143
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:16,960
He's a person now, but like, um, his sons are really,

2144
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,720
really tall, really big people.

2145
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:24,400
And I'm like, well, you know, I was small back then.

2146
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,880
I'm smaller now.

2147
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,880
And they were older.

2148
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,360
So I always thought it was like, oh, older people.

2149
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:33,160
Oh, they're just yeah, you know, they're older than me.

2150
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:33,960
So they're bigger.

2151
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:38,440
But no, it turns out that's just how people are just bigger.

2152
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,000
Yeah.

2153
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,960
Um, I mean, do you feel like they look down on you like

2154
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,120
literally and and metaphorically?

2155
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,680
Um, I don't know.

2156
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,040
Some sometimes I get the feeling, but it's sometimes I get

2157
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,440
that feeling, but I think it's a me thing.

2158
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,960
I think I don't think I don't think actually anyone actually.

2159
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,440
And it's not just it's not just that.

2160
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:06,240
It's not like, uh, uh, that like they're big or like better

2161
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,440
looking than me, although they are.

2162
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:12,120
But it's also it's also like, you know, they have real jobs

2163
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:16,680
and you know, own homes, are married, have kids, etc. etc.

2164
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,440
Yeah, that's that's just normal.

2165
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,440
Like I know it's normal.

2166
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:23,880
Like, uh, societal pressures.

2167
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:28,720
I know it's it's if you don't fit the mold that is set out for

2168
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:32,000
you to be like, this is how you do normal stuff for normal

2169
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,160
people. And you're like, ew, no, I don't want to do that.

2170
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,880
And then you end up on a divergent path.

2171
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,480
You're going to get pressured just by seeing other people

2172
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,600
doing the normal thing.

2173
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,360
I don't even I couldn't do that.

2174
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,800
I like I don't even really think that anyone is like, oh,

2175
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,920
Ben is such a is such a such a black sheep, such a such a

2176
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,560
fail son.

2177
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,760
I like I don't actually think anyone really even cares or

2178
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,840
thinks thinks about it like that.

2179
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:02,400
But I do get a little bit like everyone else like owns a

2180
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,520
house.

2181
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,720
God, I mean, that's fair to be upset about.

2182
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,520
It sucks that owning a house is not easy.

2183
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,120
Right.

2184
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,120
Well, you know, I'm just griping.

2185
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,600
There's only one thing to do.

2186
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,720
Buy a house.

2187
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,840
Build a house.

2188
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,560
Build a house.

2189
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,400
Yeah, build a build a bear.

2190
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,240
That's the other thing you could do.

2191
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,400
That's sure to help.

2192
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,440
You could build a bear.

2193
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,480
I could build that.

2194
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,200
That would that would solve all my issue.

2195
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:31,920
That damn it.

2196
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:33,600
Genius.

2197
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:34,480
Okay.

2198
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,080
It's like, hmm, which way?

2199
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,720
Miss Western man, build a bear or build a house?

2200
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,320
Buy a house or build a bear.

2201
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,360
Well, I've made I've made my choice.

2202
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:58,400
I have so many bears, I can build a house with them.

2203
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,760
Conquers the world, chief.

2204
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,440
Just hit, hit, hit, cacking.

2205
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:08,960
I don't know.

2206
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,240
Somebody else say something.

2207
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:10,720
Fuck you.

2208
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,560
Well, I mean, I don't really have anything else.

2209
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:22,800
That happened other than like kind of a bummer that I'm like,

2210
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,240
I'm running low on some HRT medication.

2211
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,880
And I'm like, okay, I got a restock.

2212
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,560
Got to get like another like 17 months worth of pills or whatever.

2213
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,040
But the site I used last time has been destroyed,

2214
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,840
been found and like just like they got them.

2215
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,320
They got them.

2216
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,520
They just they shut them down.

2217
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:40,560
Who did?

2218
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,080
I don't know.

2219
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,920
Just like the government's the police.

2220
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,920
It's just sort of a thing.

2221
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,960
It's not illegal to like buy medication from abroad,

2222
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,680
at least in the UK for estrogen and stuff.

2223
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,320
You can buy it.

2224
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,440
It's you could have it.

2225
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,360
You just can't buy it from British pharmacies

2226
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:05,840
because you need a prescription.

2227
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,680
And getting a prescription is like years long, decades long,

2228
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:13,840
like evil system that is designed to make you die

2229
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,760
and kill yourself before they give you any help.

2230
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:16,480
I see.

2231
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,920
So obviously I'm doing it by myself.

2232
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,120
I'm buying the medication.

2233
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:23,360
But the websites you buy it from,

2234
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,440
they get shut down like quite frequently.

2235
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,880
And I don't know where to get them right now.

2236
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,880
And I found this new site and I tried to buy some stuff and it,

2237
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,120
the money didn't go through.

2238
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,760
Like my money wasn't left.

2239
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,360
It wasn't taken from my account.

2240
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,600
So it's not like I was scammed.

2241
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,360
It's just something that's going wrong.

2242
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:44,320
I have to call them up.

2243
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:47,440
And it's just, it's just a little annoying.

2244
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:54,080
It's anxiety inducing, I guess is the way to put it.

2245
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,240
It's just sort of like, ah, fuck.

2246
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:57,440
You know, the longer this takes,

2247
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,720
the longer it'll take to get here.

2248
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,640
And I don't want to run out.

2249
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,880
I don't want to not have the things.

2250
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,960
Then I'll be off the stuff.

2251
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,840
Then what if my body masculinizes?

2252
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,000
Ah, it sucks.

2253
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,800
I don't, I don't know.

2254
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,200
Would that, would that happen?

2255
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,680
To an extent, yeah.

2256
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:21,920
I mean, if the estrogen in my body goes down over time

2257
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,600
and it's not replaced,

2258
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,760
then the testosterone will take more of an effect.

2259
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,200
And like parts of, you know, body hair will come back,

2260
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,120
facial hair will come back just a bit.

2261
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,400
Well, I mean, where are other,

2262
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:35,280
I mean, where are other UK based,

2263
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,040
special people like yourself getting there?

2264
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,520
I, I, it's one of those like,

2265
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:47,280
thinking about it is very stressful.

2266
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,480
So it won't take too long to figure it out.

2267
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,520
It's just like, oh God, no, I don't want to think about that.

2268
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,400
Oh, fuck.

2269
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,280
I understand.

2270
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,480
That's been, that's been a bit of a...

2271
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,800
Someone at my door, I gotta be right back, sorry.

2272
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,120
Okay.

2273
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,800
Did he say someone that has no...

2274
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,160
It's the hormone police.

2275
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,280
It's the hormone police.

2276
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:05,840
Good for them.

2277
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:07,760
Good for them.

2278
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,360
They're, they're, I'm glad they're working.

2279
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,960
I mean, sure.

2280
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,280
We can't just fire the hormone police

2281
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,880
because then they would be out of a job.

2282
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:18,480
Oh no.

2283
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,720
I have to keep policing hormones for the economy.

2284
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:27,120
You know what was really bugging me?

2285
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,960
I mean, there's, it's, it's like nothing new.

2286
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,680
It's just, there's lots of strikes happening right now.

2287
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:38,000
And like lots of strikes in lots of different fields in the UK.

2288
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,400
There's rails, worker strikes, there's ambulance strikes,

2289
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,680
there's nurses strikes, there's postal worker strikes,

2290
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:49,280
all of which are very important during the cold and Christmasy month.

2291
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,800
Is there a reason they're all happening at the same time?

2292
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:59,520
It's just because the, because of the Ukraine war, the price of living.

2293
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:05,760
Because the, because the gas companies don't have like a cap on how much they can charge.

2294
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,080
They're just charged as much as they fucking can.

2295
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:15,040
People are getting to a point where they can't use their, their heating

2296
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,560
and they can't like cook food really.

2297
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:19,440
And they can't buy things.

2298
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,200
They cut, they just have no money.

2299
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:28,640
And the, the pay for all of these people all over the country has not risen to match it.

2300
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:32,080
And so they're basically everybody all over the place.

2301
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,240
It's just said, we can't afford to live anymore.

2302
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,240
We literally can't afford to live.

2303
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,440
We're all going on strike.

2304
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,840
And I'm like, hell yes, please go on strike.

2305
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:40,240
I see.

2306
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:46,160
But then I see like politicians saying, don't they care about the,

2307
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,360
the sanctity of Christmas?

2308
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:51,840
Don't they care about like, yes, yes, Christmas pilled.

2309
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,800
They're like, this is supposed to be a nice holiday and they're ruining it for everyone.

2310
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:01,920
I'm like, the people who are negatively affected by, you know,

2311
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,200
not having enough money are also not going to have a good Christmas.

2312
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:06,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2313
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:06,880
Fuck you.

2314
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:11,760
The people, they're not letting down the country by going on strike.

2315
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,040
They are the country.

2316
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:13,280
Right.

2317
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,240
And you, yeah.

2318
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:14,800
I mean, of course.

2319
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,480
It's just so frustrating.

2320
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,360
That sucks.

2321
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:21,760
I mean, I think they kind of, I think we talked about, they kind of,

2322
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,720
they kind of crushed that like rail workers strike in America.

2323
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:25,840
Yeah.

2324
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,360
They didn't, they didn't get what they, they didn't get the sick leave that they wanted,

2325
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,480
which is pretty cringe.

2326
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:35,200
There was something else I wanted to say.

2327
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:35,760
Okay.

2328
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,200
It's not quite the same, but that really reminds me of the Elon thing from this week.

2329
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,440
Do you see the thing about like the tracking his jet?

2330
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:45,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2331
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,200
Deadly, are you, are you, are you following?

2332
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:51,760
I'm back now.

2333
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,160
Yeah.

2334
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,040
Yeah, I saw your back.

2335
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,040
Are you following Elon on Twitter?

2336
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,640
Are you familiar with his?

2337
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:57,520
I try not to.

2338
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:58,560
Yeah.

2339
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,440
It's just tiring.

2340
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,120
It is, it's, it's tiring, but I mean, I don't follow his account.

2341
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,080
Yeah.

2342
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,640
But certain things that he's doing is like,

2343
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:15,120
in like unbelievably like embarrassing for him, like it's so weird.

2344
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,720
It's funny because it seems like it's so, like it's so embarrassing,

2345
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,400
the hypocrisy is so naked.

2346
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,960
And yet like the, the fact that like it continues and that like consequences are

2347
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:30,320
not materializing for him is like so, it makes me really upset and it frustrates me

2348
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,840
almost more than it amuses me.

2349
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:40,880
Um, but, um, yeah, the, if he gets his comeuppance one day, then I'll look back on it very fondly,

2350
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,880
but if he never does, then I will just have been infuriated for nothing.

2351
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,960
But anyway, the thing this week where like, you know, he specifically said,

2352
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:54,640
I won't ban the account that posts my jet, my jets, like, uh, location.

2353
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:59,600
And then he did ban the account that posted the jets location.

2354
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,400
And then he did.

2355
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:07,360
And then he, and then he banned reporters who reported that he banned that account,

2356
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,200
which again is only public posting public information.

2357
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:15,600
And then the justification for this is first, he called them all doctors,

2358
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,200
even the people that merely reported on the fact that he banned the account.

2359
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,240
He called them all doctors because they were like referencing the fact that the account existed.

2360
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:29,680
And, and then he, and then he, he said that he said that the account had to be banned

2361
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:33,120
because like his kid was on, you know, it was assassination coordinates.

2362
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:37,280
It was updating his location in real time and it's a safety issue and they're putting him

2363
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,960
at risk and they're putting his family at risk.

2364
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,800
And it's so amazingly, amazingly annoying.

2365
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:47,360
I didn't really see that many people point out that like, if it's unsafe,

2366
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:53,760
like it's not, it's not fair to be like, you know, you can't post my jets info

2367
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,560
because that exposes my location.

2368
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,840
And it's like, well, no, nobody else uses a private jet.

2369
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,840
If you don't, it's public information where a jet is.

2370
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:09,200
If you don't want your location publicly revealed, you could simply not fly on a public jet.

2371
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:13,920
Like nobody's forced you to put your kid on the fucking jet and which supposedly endanger him.

2372
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,480
Like you endangered him by putting him on a jet who's like,

2373
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,200
if you think that's dangerous, that his location is known,

2374
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:22,560
you're the one that made that information public by putting him on the fucking jet.

2375
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:30,320
Man, it's multiple levels of like incompetence and misunderstanding of how anything works.

2376
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,000
I think the reason, I don't know whether this is true,

2377
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,880
but I get the feeling that the reason he suddenly started feeling scared for his life

2378
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,120
because of the Elon jet and stuff is because he went on that Dave Chappelle show

2379
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,440
and everyone booed him when he came on stage.

2380
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,360
I'm honestly surprised that that happened.

2381
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,600
I thought that I thought it was like Twitter that hates him.

2382
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:53,360
I didn't realize that like the real people hate him.

2383
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,320
I kind of thought the real people are just like neutral on him

2384
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,920
or think that he's cool because he was on the Simpsons.

2385
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:02,560
I mean, he's done so many like very publicly weird stupid things

2386
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,440
during the whole getting of Twitter.

2387
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:09,760
Yeah, but like I kind of thought that was like only Twitter people would care about that.

2388
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:12,160
I didn't think that like the average person would give a shit,

2389
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:18,080
but like, oh, he charged eight dollars for Twitter blue or something, right?

2390
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,840
I just kind of thought that wouldn't matter to like the average Dave Chappelle audience member.

2391
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,480
I suppose it is a bit weird.

2392
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:34,000
I feel like it's just because Twitter is so like linked with normal people

2393
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,280
as well as Twitter weirdos that anything that blows up on Twitter,

2394
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,000
especially with somebody who's so high profile that he bought,

2395
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,560
you know, he's in charge of the entire site.

2396
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,760
Like a lot more normal people are being exposed to the funny things that he's doing

2397
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:56,400
and the embarrassing things that he's doing to make more people just find it like through

2398
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,720
journalism or otherwise.

2399
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:01,920
I don't think the average person is like a regular Twitter user though.

2400
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:05,520
No, but like that's it's big news, right?

2401
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:10,320
BBC reports on Elon Musk's Twitter bullshit quite often.

2402
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:17,360
I see. I wonder if like, I wonder if like sometimes I'll go to my parents' house and

2403
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,840
they'll be watching like Colbert.

2404
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,480
Is it the late show with Colbert?

2405
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:27,600
I know he doesn't do the Colbert report anymore.

2406
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:28,560
Whatever.

2407
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,240
The Colbert report?

2408
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,160
Are you not familiar with the Colbert report?

2409
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,560
I thought it was the Colbert report.

2410
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,360
You, well, you've clearly never seen it then because no, it's the Colbert report.

2411
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,800
I mean, you know what it was, right?

2412
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,680
I thought it was the reports though, like the Colbert report.

2413
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:48,640
I mean, yes, it's spelled that way, but just like the T in Colbert is silent,

2414
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:53,440
they pronounce the, they pronounce the report silently as well.

2415
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:57,840
But there's a word called report, like, and it's spelled different.

2416
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:58,960
Yes.

2417
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:06,480
Look, look, I don't know what to tell you that they, they pronounced it the Colbert report.

2418
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,080
And you know, you know that the shtick of it was that he basically like,

2419
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:14,240
he was, he was basically like a satire of a right wing pundit, right?

2420
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,720
Vaguely, yes.

2421
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,880
Well, now, well, now he is no longer a satire.

2422
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,400
Now he's just a, now he's just a, just a lib.

2423
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,200
He's just a lib.

2424
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:28,960
But sometimes I'll see, I'll see my parents watching Colbert report and he'll say like,

2425
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,960
and he'll, you know, and he'll repeat back to me my, my DNC approved, you know, my liberal

2426
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:41,520
opinions, my, my, my safe, my safe Democrat communist opinions that have been filtered

2427
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,440
through, you know, global homo and fed back to me by George Soros.

2428
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,280
He'll say NFTs bad.

2429
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,000
He'll say, you know, Russia bad.

2430
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,800
He'll say, you know, transphobia bad.

2431
01:57:54,800 --> 01:58:02,320
And I'll say, and I'll say, yes, I love, I love it when I'm told what to think by the establishment.

2432
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:09,840
And then I'll, and then I'll take one microchip out of my NPC head and I'll put a new microchip

2433
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,280
into my NPC head and the cycle continues.

2434
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,000
And I'm glad my parents are getting their microchips from the right guys.

2435
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,040
What is what is the point that I'm trying to make?

2436
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:23,540
Okay.

2437
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:29,280
Deadly comics, what is your extreme political opinions?

2438
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,840
Yeah, what's your, I got so many.

2439
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,280
What's your most cancelable?

2440
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,240
What's your most cancel?

2441
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,960
What's your most cancelable opinion about trans people?

2442
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,760
It should be given.

2443
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,600
All gun rights revoked except the trans people.

2444
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:47,920
Okay.

2445
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:48,400
Oh, hell yeah.

2446
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:48,880
All right.

2447
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,200
Okay.

2448
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:49,760
You know what?

2449
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:50,080
All right.

2450
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:50,720
That's pretty good.

2451
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,360
That's pretty good.

2452
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,080
Guns are great.

2453
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:55,200
Only in the right hands.

2454
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,200
Gun girl.

2455
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,320
Gun girl.

2456
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,000
Um, okay.

2457
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:03,120
Good answer.

2458
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:05,360
Go on.

2459
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:06,000
Tell me more.

2460
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,440
Oh no.

2461
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,320
More, more takes, more takes.

2462
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,440
Who should be assassinated next?

2463
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:15,680
Let's see.

2464
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,040
I mean, there's so many.

2465
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,680
I know.

2466
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:20,800
It's a smorgasbord.

2467
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,560
Acornicopia.

2468
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:23,440
Yeah.

2469
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,720
Man.

2470
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,440
I'll give you a hint.

2471
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:31,120
It's um.

2472
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,480
It's been saying.

2473
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:34,960
I don't know.

2474
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,240
I actually have no idea.

2475
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,120
What does.

2476
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:39,680
There's no, there's no wrong answers really.

2477
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,760
When does murder become assassination?

2478
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,280
It has to be a public figure, right?

2479
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,240
Is that, is that the definition?

2480
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:47,600
I don't know.

2481
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,200
That's what it seems like.

2482
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,200
Like if you can't assassinate your roommate,

2483
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,720
if no one knows who your roommate is.

2484
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,720
I, hmm, that's a, you know, this is a question.

2485
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:00,160
This is a, I've always thought of assassination.

2486
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:05,840
Yes, as a public figure thing, but also as like premeditated to an extent that

2487
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:15,040
it's, it's for a specific like end rather than an emotional like I need this person dead.

2488
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:15,520
Okay.

2489
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,880
Well, according to.

2490
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:19,920
Like if you're, if you're just mad at someone and you kill them, that's murder.

2491
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:25,040
But if you have a political agenda and you need somebody dead, that's assassination.

2492
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:25,360
Okay.

2493
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:31,680
But assess like celebrities can be assassinated to even if it's not political.

2494
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:36,480
Do you think I would, I would call like the Jung Lenin shooting a murder though.

2495
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,960
Well, apparently according to dictionary.com assassination is murder,

2496
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,880
murder of an important person in a surprise attack for political or religious reasons.

2497
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:50,640
Okay.

2498
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:54,720
Wikipedia says it is the murder of a prominent or important person.

2499
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,840
Uh, well, that's it.

2500
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:58,880
That's all Wikipedia says.

2501
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,840
So Wikipedia doesn't even stipulate that it has to be like a surprise attack or for.

2502
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,120
I always think of an assassination as a, as a ninja coming in.

2503
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:12,640
Ninja coming in your room with a little, with a small katana.

2504
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:13,520
I forget what they're called.

2505
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,520
And then go.

2506
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,400
A Waki Zashi.

2507
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,840
Waki Zashi and they go on your neck.

2508
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:21,040
That's an assassination.

2509
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,840
That is, that should be the definition.

2510
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,840
That's a textbook assassination for sure.

2511
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,480
Premeditated act of assassination.

2512
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:34,400
Premeditated act of killing someone suddenly or secretively, especially a prominent person.

2513
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:34,960
Okay.

2514
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,640
Some of these definitions emphasize the secretiveness of the killing.

2515
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:41,840
Some of them emphasize the prominence of the victim.

2516
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:46,800
Some of them emphasize the, the political or religious like significance of the act itself.

2517
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,000
I think JFK was assassinated and John Lennon was murdered.

2518
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,280
Seems right.

2519
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:54,400
For some reason.

2520
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,720
Because John Lennon's killer was like just a weirdo.

2521
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,960
I mean, I, I could say, I could say.

2522
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,000
I don't think he had a point.

2523
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,560
He just sort of like, I want him, I just, I'm just going to kill him.

2524
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:09,120
Didn't he do it for like some satanic panic, like he's corrupting the youth kind of reasons?

2525
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,280
No, I'm not sure.

2526
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,400
I mean, John Lennon is prominent.

2527
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:17,040
So he is a, he is a prominent or important person.

2528
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:20,240
So by that metric, it could be an assassination.

2529
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:29,040
I guess, I guess the distinction I'm making is like, how, how like deranged are you as the killer?

2530
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:34,080
So if you are not deranged, so what you're saying is that assassination is murdered is good.

2531
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:42,800
No, assassination is murdered as cold blooded and emotionless for some, for some specific agenda.

2532
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:50,080
And murder is like, you can just, you could just, it could just happen.

2533
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:51,760
If you're, you know, a little crazy.

2534
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:57,120
Well, I mean, the guy tracked down John Lennon specifically to kill him.

2535
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:59,040
It wasn't like he just did it on a whim.

2536
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,840
Well, no, not the premeditated part of it is the same for both.

2537
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,920
But like the reason you decide to do it in the first place.

2538
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,520
Are you deranged or are you, are you putting politics into my murder?

2539
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,840
I hate it when there's politics in my murder.

2540
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,840
Murders these days are too political.

2541
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:20,880
Absolutely.

2542
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,320
We need to go back.

2543
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,600
Yeah, we used to have characters.

2544
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,120
We used to have Jack the Ripper.

2545
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:31,440
Used to have, you know, when they had like little, little things they did with the police,

2546
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,800
little notes and things they would leave.

2547
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:33,920
What happened to that?

2548
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:34,720
They were nice.

2549
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:36,240
They were nice and neutral.

2550
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:37,840
They were nice and neutral.

2551
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:42,320
They didn't, they didn't discriminate except when they only killed women or whatever.

2552
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:44,480
But you know, that's just, that's just good fun.

2553
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,800
Assassination classroom.

2554
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,600
That I used, I have so many of those comics.

2555
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,000
I never finished it.

2556
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,280
I've read some of it.

2557
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:05,840
I think, I think Mage got me to read it and I thought it was okay.

2558
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:09,280
I thought it was kind of neat, but I didn't stick with it.

2559
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,320
It's assassination classroom, the one with the main character who is a boy that looks

2560
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:17,600
extremely feminine because the author wanted it to be a girl.

2561
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:21,200
But the manga publisher says, no, we kind of have a female lead.

2562
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:23,200
I don't think so.

2563
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:29,920
I mean, that, I think that is, well, the character does look feminine.

2564
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,400
And no, that was like the backstory to it, though.

2565
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:35,360
I'm pretty sure that was the backstory to that.

2566
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:39,760
Assassination classroom is the one with like the yellow smiley alien guy.

2567
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:40,400
Yeah, yeah.

2568
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,880
But like the protagonist, like main character.

2569
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:46,160
Oh, I think he's a school person.

2570
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,960
Oh, I don't know.

2571
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,760
People ask, is assassination classroom inappropriate?

2572
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,000
For what?

2573
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:57,520
I don't know.

2574
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,000
It's just,

2575
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,960
I mean, you couldn't have that in a school, in a school library.

2576
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:01,840
Kids with guns.

2577
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,360
Yeah, it's not assassination.

2578
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:06,240
It keeps doing murder politically again.

2579
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:10,720
You can't have, you can't have depictions of guns in a school library.

2580
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I mean, not when the kids are holding them and shooting the teachers with it.

2581
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:18,880
Yeah, the rob pretending to shoot you.

2582
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:21,360
But she doesn't, but he doesn't actually get shot though.

2583
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:25,120
He dodges really quickly out of the, so like, it's fine.

2584
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:27,760
Yeah, assassination.

2585
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,680
Well, like, they don't want to give the kids ideas

2586
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:32,000
that they should try to assassinate their teachers.

2587
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:32,480
Come on.

2588
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:34,160
Come on.

2589
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,960
It's not me making the rules.

2590
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,560
I'm just saying how it is weak.

2591
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:41,920
Right.

2592
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:43,760
This is the, this is the guy.

2593
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,720
This is the male lead of the assassination classroom.

2594
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:49,680
Eating a snack, holding the gun.

2595
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,000
It's a knife snack.

2596
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:54,480
Well, I forget why I read it.

2597
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,680
So maybe it's incorrect, but it seems plausible.

2598
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:02,800
Like, oh, you can't have, you can't have a shounen mango with a female protagonist.

2599
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,880
We just don't do that over here because they don't.

2600
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:05,600
Can we?

2601
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:05,920
Do they?

2602
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:07,920
Do they not?

2603
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,040
The boy seems to be a boy.

2604
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:11,760
Yeah, well, it is shounen jump.

2605
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:13,360
Ain't it?

2606
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:15,360
Boys can't read things with girls in it.

2607
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:20,560
I'm trying to think if I can think of any shounen shows that have, I mean, um...

2608
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:23,600
There's lots of female characters.

2609
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:27,040
They're just always side characters or love interests or villains or whatever.

2610
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:31,200
I mean, I can think of some animes with female protagonists,

2611
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:35,200
but I'm not sure exactly which ones are shounen.

2612
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:39,440
Yeah, like you specifically because it was in shounen jump, like

2613
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,840
so shounen jump publisher.

2614
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:42,720
Yeah.

2615
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:46,160
That's what I heard, which is a funny story.

2616
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:50,320
And it means that this guy is extremely effeminate and cute.

2617
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,360
That's why I kind of wanted to read it, but I forgot.

2618
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,120
I sort of lost interest somewhere.

2619
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:01,840
I mean, Chrono Crusade has a female protagonist.

2620
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,600
I don't know if that is shounen.

2621
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:05,840
It probably is not from shounen jump.

2622
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:11,040
I'm looking at a bunch of shounen jump covers and yes, it's all fellas.

2623
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,200
As far as the eye can see.

2624
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:16,080
It's all boys.

2625
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:21,600
Well, now I'm wondering if there's ever been one with a girl.

2626
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,440
Not in shounen jump.

2627
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:24,480
I'm pretty sure.

2628
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:28,000
So look at this, the fucking ninja turtle looking cover.

2629
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,320
Yeah.

2630
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:33,440
Every cover is just that with a different color, like a different expression.

2631
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:38,000
This is the Japanese Watchman because of the smile.

2632
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:40,080
I guess so.

2633
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:47,360
I mean, Soul Eater has, I mean, it's got kind of like two protagonists and one of them is a girl.

2634
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:49,440
Was that shounen jump?

2635
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,160
I don't know if it's from jump.

2636
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:55,360
Yeah, I would say it's shounen, at least.

2637
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,480
It's definitely shounen.

2638
02:07:58,880 --> 02:07:59,760
Japanese manga.

2639
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,720
Published by Square Enix.

2640
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:05,200
Where is it?

2641
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:07,600
Where does it come from?

2642
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:13,120
Published by Square Enix in monthly shounen gang gang.

2643
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,400
What?

2644
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:18,320
Okay, so it's not shounen jump, but it is a shounen thing.

2645
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,600
Shounen gang gang?

2646
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:25,520
Monthly shounen gang gang is a manga in print owned by Square Enix Holdings.

2647
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:27,680
That's funny.

2648
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,240
Never heard of Square Enix doing non-video game stuff.

2649
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:33,680
Oh, I mean, that doesn't surprise me.

2650
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:35,680
They're like a pretty big company.

2651
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:39,520
They have their fingers in a lot of Japanese culture pies.

2652
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:45,760
I could go for some Japanese culture pie right about now.

2653
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,720
I don't think the Japanese know what a pie even is.

2654
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,400
I just don't think that that's a dish that they make.

2655
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:59,440
They have dumplings, they have funny bread.

2656
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,480
Exactly, exactly.

2657
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:05,360
If the Japanese were going to make a pie, they would just make it as a dumpling.

2658
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:09,760
They would just put blueberries and apples and cherries in a dumpling.

2659
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:11,760
That sounds great, actually.

2660
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,680
It probably could be pretty good, yeah.

2661
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:17,040
Yeah, little steamed fruit, is that such a thing?

2662
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:26,800
Sure, and I know this because in Pokemon, they eat fruit sandwiches, which are rice balls.

2663
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,880
I know cakes are big.

2664
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,880
Yeah, cakes are big.

2665
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:41,120
My mind is blown just thinking that, yeah, I've never seen a chicken pie with the pastry

2666
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,120
in a Japanese thing.

2667
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:44,080
I don't think they do it.

2668
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,480
I don't think they, I think it's a Western thing.

2669
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:51,440
Wow, well, it's a European thing, which is a Western thing.

2670
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:56,080
But also, surely they have pastry.

2671
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,680
I mean, of course.

2672
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:03,440
I mean, I'm sure they know what a pie is, and they could make one if they wanted to.

2673
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:06,240
I just don't think they do very often.

2674
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:11,360
And if they did, it would probably be like, oh yeah, this is like a European-style dish.

2675
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:17,200
I looked up pie in Japan, and the first result says Japanese consumers love pie.

2676
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:21,440
Boo, I don't care what they say.

2677
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:23,200
That doesn't fit my narrative.

2678
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:24,720
Okay, well.

2679
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:27,200
Pastries in Japan.

2680
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,080
I understand nice patisserie.

2681
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:35,200
They probably have a lot of French things and Swiss stuff, Swiss rolls.

2682
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,520
Wait, now I'm curious.

2683
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:39,600
But Japanese-y-fying, some of them.

2684
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:40,480
Wait, what does it say?

2685
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:41,840
A pie with filling.

2686
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:43,360
Do they have those?

2687
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:48,400
What does it say about Japanese people that eat pie?

2688
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:48,880
I want to know.

2689
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:50,880
Oh, I closed the page.

2690
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:51,600
Oh, come on.

2691
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,320
I'm looking up choco pie now.

2692
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:55,440
Oh, come on.

2693
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,720
I'll never know.

2694
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:58,000
My internet's broken again.

2695
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,680
My internet's broken again.

2696
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:04,800
Once again, even though this call is continuing without issue, my computer says,

2697
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,240
nope, you're not connected to the internet.

2698
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:08,480
You can't view web pages right now.

2699
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,240
A square choco pie.

2700
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:12,160
It's fluffy with marshmallow filling.

2701
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,640
I like the fact that they say it's fluffy.

2702
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:15,840
I don't know why that's funny to me.

2703
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:19,680
It's a good thing to have trademarked.

2704
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,640
They trademarked it's fluffy.

2705
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,080
I guess so.

2706
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:26,960
I want to bake something.

2707
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:28,400
I think I need that.

2708
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,080
I think I need a baking session.

2709
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:33,600
I need to make some muffins or cupcakes or something.

2710
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:34,240
Gingerbread.

2711
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:37,520
Maybe I could make a gingerbread thing for the Christmas.

2712
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,080
It's very effeminate.

2713
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:39,120
Yeah, thank you.

2714
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:43,600
Gingerbread house is going to start big.

2715
02:11:43,600 --> 02:11:46,720
Or gingerbread man, gingerbread woman.

2716
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:50,880
My dad has made gingerbread houses for Christmas party.

2717
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,160
Oh, centerpiece.

2718
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:55,280
But also you can grab it and tear it apart and eat it.

2719
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:57,680
So I know that's possible.

2720
02:11:57,680 --> 02:11:59,360
I could do that together.

2721
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:00,640
That'd be fun.

2722
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,000
Nice, yeah.

2723
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,640
What if I made a gingerbread...

2724
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,720
How do you do a gingerbread trans woman?

2725
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:12,240
They're just called two arms, two legs.

2726
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,600
How would you differentiate them?

2727
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:18,880
You start by making a man and then you turn it into a woman.

2728
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:22,000
By like adding a dress or something.

2729
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,360
I don't know, it's easy.

2730
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:25,680
But how would you do a gingerbread man?

2731
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:27,440
You do a penis in the middle.

2732
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,200
Yeah, and then you use three legs.

2733
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,840
And then you yank it off of there.

2734
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:33,920
You yank it off.

2735
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:39,680
To be a man, you must have honor and a penis.

2736
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:41,040
That's what Shin Chan says.

2737
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:44,080
Very regressive of him.

2738
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,160
Shin Chan.

2739
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:47,120
You remember Shin Chan.

2740
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:50,240
Is that the little tiny little guy?

2741
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:50,640
Yes.

2742
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:52,560
Dang.

2743
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:52,800
That's the one.

2744
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,480
I didn't know he was cringe.

2745
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:57,120
Such a transphobe, I know.

2746
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:57,840
Wait, you know who that is?

2747
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,960
It's the cartoon...

2748
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,920
It's the little kid, the little red shirt.

2749
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:03,440
The cartoon toddler, yeah.

2750
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,720
Who shows his little butt.

2751
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,160
I'm not sure if he's a toddler.

2752
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:06,800
I think he might be...

2753
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:09,440
I haven't read any of it.

2754
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:09,920
I'm not sure.

2755
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:11,440
I'm not exactly sure how old he's supposed to be.

2756
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:12,640
It's very unique looking.

2757
02:13:12,640 --> 02:13:12,800
Yeah.

2758
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,360
I like the style.

2759
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:18,400
He's got a game out on the switch that looks really good.

2760
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:21,920
You ever see the English dub of that show?

2761
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,640
Yeah, that's how I started it.

2762
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:30,400
That was where they redubbed it all with Americanized jokes.

2763
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,880
They changed a lot of it.

2764
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,760
But I think it's good and it works.

2765
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,640
And it's maybe funnier for it.

2766
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:40,560
They sort of like...

2767
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:42,320
I don't know.

2768
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:47,920
They kind of change it to be a little bit more goofy and fourth wall breaking.

2769
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:53,680
Whereas I think in Japan, it's a more straightforward family sitcom.

2770
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,280
Because I think some of the humor plays as a little more adult over here in America.

2771
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:03,440
Shinchin shown as disgusting little baby dick.

2772
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:07,040
It just doesn't play.

2773
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,040
So it just hits different.

2774
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:10,480
It just hits different over here.

2775
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:13,200
Oh yeah, you can put them PBS kids over here.

2776
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:13,680
I don't think so.

2777
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:13,840
I don't think so.

2778
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:15,360
It's got to be an adult show now.

2779
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:16,000
I think so.

2780
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,200
LaMalle.

2781
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,160
Merry Christmas.

2782
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,560
Is this the Christmas special?

2783
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:30,480
When is this coming out?

2784
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,920
This is close to Christmas when this comes out.

2785
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,120
Yeah, it's the week away now.

2786
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,040
It'll be the 23rd.

2787
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:37,200
It'll be the day before Christmas Eve.

2788
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,880
Christmas Eve Eve.

2789
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:48,640
My torrents are downloading at about half a megabyte per second and yet no internet lol.

2790
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,800
It's getting slipped up by the torch.

2791
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,200
I'm just so upset.

2792
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:57,200
It's just not fair.

2793
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,480
You know, it's like my internet.

2794
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,320
It's like my internet.

2795
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:10,240
You know, it likes me.

2796
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:11,600
It's showing clear interest in me.

2797
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:15,040
It's asking me questions about like, oh, do I live around here?

2798
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:17,280
Oh, you know, it's getting on my bus with me.

2799
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:22,240
But then when I ask if it wants to go out for coffee, it just laughs.

2800
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:30,400
Then I ask, can you show me the images in my discord channel?

2801
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:32,240
It just scoffs at me.

2802
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:32,960
It just scoffs.

2803
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,880
Well, what else?

2804
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,400
What else have we got to speak about?

2805
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:45,600
Well, now I'll never get to see this list of strongest female shown in characters.

2806
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:46,560
I was pulling up a list.

2807
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:48,320
I was going to go through the list and I was going to

2808
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:55,120
find some good counter examples, but I guess, I guess it maybe it did appear,

2809
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:56,400
but it was completely blank.

2810
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,760
Yeah, it won't look because it doesn't exist.

2811
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:03,040
I'm so stupid.

2812
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:03,920
I'm sure there's more.

2813
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:07,360
The only ones I can think of are Chrono Crusade and Soul Eater.

2814
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:09,600
I mean, obviously there are more.

2815
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:12,960
Chrono Crusade actually might be sign-in.

2816
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:16,320
That might be a little too adult.

2817
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:17,840
Not sure.

2818
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:18,320
Who cares?

2819
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:21,520
Are we moving on?

2820
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:21,760
Okay.

2821
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,120
What were you saying, Deadly?

2822
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:26,880
I forget.

2823
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:28,720
What was I saying?

2824
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,720
Oh yeah, something I watched recently.

2825
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:35,040
I want to know if anyone else has seen it.

2826
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,600
It's the Adult Swim Yule Log video.

2827
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:40,400
The Yule Log video.

2828
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:46,160
Is that like one that you put on for Christmas and it just burns the log all day?

2829
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:50,800
That's what you would expect from Yule Log video.

2830
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:52,800
I haven't seen this.

2831
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:56,080
I'm familiar with the genre, but no, I have not seen the Adult Swim one.

2832
02:16:56,720 --> 02:17:03,680
Okay, it's the kind of thing that is not a good thing to talk about because doing so would spoil it.

2833
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:08,560
Have you ever seen the short Too Many Cooks?

2834
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:09,760
Yes.

2835
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:11,360
Oh, yes, yes.

2836
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:14,560
It's the same creator had his hand in this.

2837
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:18,400
So if you enjoyed that, I recommend watching the Adult Swim Yule Log.

2838
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:21,840
That was all right.

2839
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:28,960
Am I right in thinking that's the guy who did that series on YouTube about a character who was trapped

2840
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,440
in an insane asylum and then there was a blue chair.

2841
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:36,400
There was a repeating motif.

2842
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:36,960
Blue chair?

2843
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:38,720
Are you talking about Alan Tutorial?

2844
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:41,120
Yeah, maybe.

2845
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,600
Alan Tutorial, that's not the same guy.

2846
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:47,120
Alan Rosnick though, he's got some crazy good stuff.

2847
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,920
He did an edited footage of a bear.

2848
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,560
I think that's one people know him for.

2849
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:57,520
He did May Please Enter.

2850
02:17:57,520 --> 02:17:58,640
He did a lot of cool stuff.

2851
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:02,400
But that's a different guy, I think.

2852
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:04,880
Dang, I thought it was the same guy.

2853
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:06,080
Yeah, Alan Tutorial.

2854
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:08,640
This was fucked.

2855
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:10,160
That was a great series.

2856
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:17,040
I love crazy stuff like this, like great minds coming up with

2857
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:22,320
such stuff and I'm watching it.

2858
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:24,480
That's what I like.

2859
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:25,760
I like crazy people.

2860
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,520
Crazy people, please make more art.

2861
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:29,840
This I recommend from him.

2862
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:32,240
May you please enter.

2863
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,680
It's a good story.

2864
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:37,760
How long is the Yule Log?

2865
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:39,760
It's like an hour and a half.

2866
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,360
Oh, okay.

2867
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,040
I found one that's like three minutes.

2868
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,400
Dang, it's on HBO Max.

2869
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:47,520
I see.

2870
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:49,280
Well, okay.

2871
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:51,520
Well, obviously I can't watch it right now then.

2872
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,320
Lol.

2873
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:53,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2874
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:53,520
Okay.

2875
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:55,840
Sell it down for it.

2876
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:56,640
That's all.

2877
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,200
That's all.

2878
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:58,560
Oh my gosh.

2879
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:00,080
Next discussion topic.

2880
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:01,120
I found the list.

2881
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,120
Oh, I finally get those shonen girls.

2882
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,200
I've never heard of that one.

2883
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:09,120
I've never heard of that one.

2884
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:11,280
I've never heard of that one.

2885
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:12,400
Yep.

2886
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:13,440
It's the sole leader girl.

2887
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,200
Never heard of that one.

2888
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:17,040
Never heard of that one.

2889
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:19,440
Search where they put the marketing budget.

2890
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:20,560
Never heard of that one.

2891
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:20,800
Yeah.

2892
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:21,120
Okay.

2893
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,440
Ryuko Matoi from Kill a Kill.

2894
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:25,440
Is that she?

2895
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,000
That's it.

2896
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:28,320
I mean, it's definitely not shonen jump.

2897
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:29,840
It's not saying in.

2898
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:33,680
I think you could argue it's shonen.

2899
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:34,400
Definitely.

2900
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:34,640
Yeah.

2901
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,400
She's a good candidate.

2902
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:37,040
I like her.

2903
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:38,480
I think that one's fair.

2904
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:40,800
Never heard of that one.

2905
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,880
Never heard of that one.

2906
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:43,520
I've never heard of that one.

2907
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:46,240
From like the Dragon Ball creators early work.

2908
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:48,720
Oh, Dr. Slump.

2909
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:49,040
Is that a thrill?

2910
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:50,560
Yeah, yeah.

2911
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:53,200
Is that a shonen?

2912
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:54,560
I thought it was just a comedy.

2913
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,480
That's a shonen jump comedy.

2914
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,600
Oh, it was on cut.

2915
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:58,320
Yeah.

2916
02:19:58,320 --> 02:19:58,720
Yeah.

2917
02:19:58,720 --> 02:19:59,520
Wait, what was it called?

2918
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:02,000
It's called Dr. Slump.

2919
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:02,560
Oh, yeah.

2920
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:02,720
Dr. Slump.

2921
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:03,280
Okay.

2922
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,200
Yeah, I've heard of it.

2923
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:06,800
I've never read it.

2924
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:09,440
I should read it at some point.

2925
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:12,480
It's clearly going to have like things like, oh, shit.

2926
02:20:12,480 --> 02:20:14,480
That's where that Dragon Ball thing came from.

2927
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:16,400
Over and over again.

2928
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:16,640
Yeah.

2929
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:20,800
All right, these are not.

2930
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:22,880
These are not fucking shonen.

2931
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:23,920
These lists sucks.

2932
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:24,720
Never mind.

2933
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:25,600
Okay.

2934
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:26,080
All right.

2935
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:27,280
That's just proven my point.

2936
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:27,840
There are none.

2937
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:31,360
Need more women.

2938
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,840
We need more Clarissa Gunsmokes and shonen jump.

2939
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:39,040
I guess I am wondering now if there's ever been a single one specifically from shonen jump.

2940
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:40,400
That would be interesting.

2941
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:45,680
There's probably been at least one and then it probably was a flop and they were like,

2942
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,440
well, I guess we'll never do that again.

2943
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:49,120
Yeah.

2944
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:55,040
There's something that just don't get like translated that don't last more than a few chapters.

2945
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:55,840
Yeah.

2946
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,440
We never find out about them.

2947
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,440
Yeah, for sure.

2948
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:05,200
Ooh, related 15 Naruto characters you definitely want as a roommate.

2949
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:06,480
I'm clicking that one.

2950
02:21:07,440 --> 02:21:12,320
Uh, Gara, because if you get sand in your between your toes, you could just get it right off.

2951
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:16,080
Well, Shikimaru, because he would be uninvasive.

2952
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,480
Neji, because he's clean and organized.

2953
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:23,120
Sakura, because she says what she feels and cares deeply for her friends.

2954
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:26,320
Choji, because he's a nice guy with great snacks.

2955
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:29,440
Kiba, because he has a lovable canine companion.

2956
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:31,840
Hinata, because she's nice and cooks amazing food.

2957
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:32,960
It's just every character.

2958
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:37,040
Naruto, because he would never say no to a trip to Ichiraku.

2959
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:38,400
I don't know what that means.

2960
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:39,600
Is that the ramen place?

2961
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:40,640
Probably.

2962
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:42,080
He would never say no to ramen.

2963
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,680
That's why you want him as a roommate.

2964
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:44,960
Great quality and a roommate.

2965
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:48,640
Kakashi, because he could teach you how to be cool.

2966
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:49,360
What the fuck?

2967
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:56,560
Tsunade's decades of life lessons lend themselves as interesting stories.

2968
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:57,360
That's awful.

2969
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:58,800
Konoha?

2970
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:03,920
Wait, the Konoha Gate guys would always be happy to hang

2971
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,480
just those two guys who don't even have names.

2972
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:08,160
Oh, Izumo and Kotetsu.

2973
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:11,840
Just because they're nice.

2974
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:15,040
Ebisu is highly responsible if a bit overbearing.

2975
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,800
Well, why is he a good roommate if he's a bit overbearing?

2976
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:22,800
Oh, we're getting higher up on the list, by the way.

2977
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:26,400
Konan, because he isn't such a bad person after all.

2978
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
He's in reverse order.

2979
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,280
A redeemed gara would be easy to get along with.

2980
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:36,400
Asuma Sarutobi is a cool uncle.

2981
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:41,200
And number one, Tenten always keeps her cool around others.

2982
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,280
I am going to shoot myself.

2983
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:46,960
That list started off almost tolerable.

2984
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:52,880
Maybe I missed something, but Tenten is almost a joke

2985
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:55,920
in that she basically has no lines in the entire manga.

2986
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,640
She doesn't say it, she doesn't have any,

2987
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:04,160
there's no exploration into her as a person at all.

2988
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:05,520
It's everyone else.

2989
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:09,840
She's just because they needed a third partner for Neji.

2990
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,320
Like, I'm sure there's like a couple lines saying,

2991
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:17,520
oh, she's nice or she does this and maybe she makes a face.

2992
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:20,560
But they never focus on her ever.

2993
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:22,880
Not that I can recall now, lol.

2994
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,920
She's the number one roommate

2995
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,640
because she always keeps her cool around others.

2996
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:29,840
Garbage.

2997
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:32,400
Maybe that's fair.

2998
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:34,560
Maybe the others are a little too extreme.

2999
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:36,240
They're all crazy.

3000
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:38,000
Why would you want to live with them?

3001
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,080
No, Shikimaru was right.

3002
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,200
The good one is right,

3003
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,200
because Shikimaru would just leave you alone

3004
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:44,400
and just not want to be bothered.

3005
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,520
Yeah, Shikimaru is good.

3006
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,720
Shikimaru and Neji.

3007
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:51,200
No, I think Neji would be.

3008
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,880
I think Neji would be a picky.

3009
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:54,880
He would like, he would like-

3010
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:56,400
Neji would be kind of cunty.

3011
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,880
He would be kind of cunty and he would be like, you know,

3012
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,680
why'd you leave, why'd you leave dishes,

3013
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:02,880
why'd you leave dishes in the sink?

3014
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:07,040
We agree that we would keep the common space clean at all times.

3015
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:11,520
You're violating the terms of our roommate agreement.

3016
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,640
You're violating the pact.

3017
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:17,600
Violating the pact, the main family wouldn't do this.

3018
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:23,120
The main family wouldn't leave dishes unscrubbed.

3019
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:25,440
Keep Kiba because he has a dog.

3020
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:27,120
That's awful.

3021
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,480
Okay, I've done, I'm done.

3022
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:29,280
No more, no more.

3023
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:31,440
He specifically has a move with his dog

3024
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,520
where he pisses all over the place.

3025
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:34,160
Is that true?

3026
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,160
Yeah, I think that's one of his comedy moves early on,

3027
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:40,000
where he's like, haha, I got a dog.

3028
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,040
Watch this.

3029
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,760
It's a trick I call the urination nation.

3030
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:44,800
Why doesn't he just-

3031
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,880
Spins around with dog pisses everywhere.

3032
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:48,160
Piss his own piss.

3033
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:49,600
If he just wants to piss on people,

3034
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,840
why doesn't he just pee himself?

3035
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,840
He may do that, I forget if he does.

3036
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:57,760
He acts like a dog, he's a real like-

3037
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:00,000
With his dog, he has twice the piss.

3038
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,000
Yeah.

3039
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:02,720
He's double the-

3040
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,000
Twice, that's a small dog.

3041
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:05,840
He gets bigger.

3042
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:08,720
Oh, I have not got that point yet.

3043
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:11,440
The time skip, he's a wolf dog.

3044
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:12,320
It becomes big.

3045
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,720
I'm thinking about early dog.

3046
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,880
I'm still early in the series.

3047
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:18,320
I'm behind on so many things.

3048
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:24,480
Wait, when did you get into watching or reading Naruto?

3049
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:26,880
Um, I guess a few weeks ago.

3050
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:28,800
I'm only at teaching exams now.

3051
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,800
Well, that's the best part.

3052
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:32,000
That's what everyone says.

3053
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,280
And I'm having a good time.

3054
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:34,320
That part's really good.

3055
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:39,040
And then, I don't know, it's okay up until the time skip.

3056
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:40,560
And then I think at, well, I don't know,

3057
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:43,120
the anime kind of falls apart after the time skip.

3058
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:44,880
It got really filler, heavy,

3059
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,720
and I stopped watching around there.

3060
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,600
I mean, I was young when I was watching it,

3061
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:52,800
so I watched everything without knowing what filler was.

3062
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:55,440
That's just like, why was the last like 50 episodes

3063
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:56,320
just about stuff?

3064
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,640
When are they gonna get back to Sasuke?

3065
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:01,440
When are they gonna get back to him?

3066
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:05,920
I don't know.

3067
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:06,560
Nobody knows.

3068
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,640
I'll enjoy it while I can then.

3069
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:14,160
Oh, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say

3070
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,160
it becomes shit.

3071
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,800
It just sort of keeps going

3072
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:24,960
and doesn't raise the stakes in a way that feels like,

3073
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:28,960
like the stakes are raised, but I just sort of like, eh,

3074
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:32,880
oh, oh, bigger and more powerful ninjas.

3075
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,600
Yeah, sure.

3076
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:38,960
It felt more scary in a battle with ninjas early on

3077
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:41,520
with like Zabusa.

3078
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:44,240
He's like, got a big sore and he'll fucking kill you.

3079
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:46,000
Yeah, Zabusa was pretty scary.

3080
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,040
It does feel like they're just scraping by a lot of the time.

3081
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:49,840
Yeah.

3082
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:52,800
And then later on, it's just sort of, I mean, that's the normal,

3083
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,600
that's the normal shonen thing with like power level scaling

3084
02:26:55,600 --> 02:27:01,600
where the things they are capable of doing far outstrip

3085
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,280
normal human capabilities,

3086
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:06,240
so you can't quite connect to the danger they're in anymore.

3087
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:09,600
Like if you see them take a thousand blows,

3088
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:16,160
like blows, it's hard to know how many more blows they can take,

3089
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:18,880
because I've never even taken one blow like that.

3090
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:20,160
I'd be killed instantly.

3091
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:22,720
Yes.

3092
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:24,160
Yes.

3093
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,800
Like, I like things to be grounded in reality.

3094
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:31,120
If a bullet is fired, it should be,

3095
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,360
it should, you should be scared of the character getting shot

3096
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:36,240
in the head and being,

3097
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:37,920
It should kill you if it hits you.

3098
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:39,360
Does this apply to one piece?

3099
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:42,240
Because I feel like the opposite happens there.

3100
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:44,560
I mean, I'm still early on,

3101
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:47,920
but none of the guys Luffy has faced so far

3102
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,760
seem to be much trouble for him.

3103
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:55,440
Ah, well, with that, it starts off like, he's super strong.

3104
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:57,680
In the same way that Dragon Ball starts off,

3105
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:59,280
Goku is just stronger than everyone,

3106
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,840
and it's kind of a comedy because of how strong he is,

3107
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,960
and he's a tiny little kid.

3108
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:07,040
But then it becomes more serious later on.

3109
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:08,480
And I think one piece does that.

3110
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:13,200
The first chapter, I think,

3111
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:16,400
Luffy gets shot with a bunch of bullets,

3112
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:20,320
like, ha, fuck you, or he gets shot with a bullet from a gun.

3113
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:21,600
And you think, oh, shit.

3114
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:25,760
But no, it goes, it stretches out inside him,

3115
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:27,360
and then he like unstretches,

3116
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:29,840
and he blasts the bullet back because he's made a rubber.

3117
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:31,360
How did that happen?

3118
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:34,800
And it's like, that's so crazy.

3119
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:36,000
Bullets can't hurt this guy.

3120
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,960
This guy's insane, but bullets very quickly

3121
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:40,720
don't become important after that.

3122
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,520
Yeah, it's the kind of joke you could only do once.

3123
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:46,400
How, wait, you're not very far into it.

3124
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:47,120
How far are you?

3125
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:52,400
I got pretty far in high school up until Chopper shows up,

3126
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,080
but then I forgot everything that happened

3127
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:58,320
because I went to college and learning pushed it all out of my mind.

3128
02:28:58,320 --> 02:28:59,440
So I'm starting over now.

3129
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:00,560
I see.

3130
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:04,080
Yeah, that's, I mean, that's, it's kind of far,

3131
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:05,600
but it's in the grand scheme of things.

3132
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:06,400
It's actually not that far.

3133
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,480
I know, it's not, it's not crazy far.

3134
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,640
It's only like 10 volumes or something.

3135
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:14,320
I think Chopper, Drum Island,

3136
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,560
I'm trying to think of like the first time it feels like

3137
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:19,040
it's actually like they could fucking all die.

3138
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:24,960
And I think it's, it's maybe like the giant island

3139
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:28,320
where Mr. Three gets them all in the wax.

3140
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:30,720
And it's unsure.

3141
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,360
It's like unclear how they're gonna get out of it.

3142
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:38,720
I don't, damn it.

3143
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,000
I mean, obviously there's danger.

3144
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,640
I don't like super like remember that very well.

3145
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,680
It's, it's the island with the two giants on it,

3146
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,720
Dorian Broggy.

3147
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:48,400
Oh, yes.

3148
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:48,960
They're fight.

3149
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:54,320
And then there being a, there's Miss, Miss.

3150
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:58,400
Oh, what's the little girl with the paint?

3151
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:02,800
It's called Miss Golden Week, I think.

3152
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:03,440
Yeah.

3153
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:04,800
Which is a Japanese holiday.

3154
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:07,680
And then Mr. Three who has the wax devil fruit.

3155
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:13,520
And they, and there also is like Miss Valentine

3156
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:14,800
and Mr. Something.

3157
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:16,640
Valentine is the spiky one, right?

3158
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:20,880
No, oh, Miss Wednesday.

3159
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:21,680
I can't remember.

3160
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:23,920
But she's the one who like changes her white

3161
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,080
and the guy who shoots boogers.

3162
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,120
Oh, hers is cool.

3163
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:30,800
Her fruit is cool, the weight, the weight changing one.

3164
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:31,840
Yeah.

3165
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:37,280
So those people are there and they're on this island

3166
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:40,960
with the giants and they get all separated with stuff.

3167
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:45,440
And then there's a part where Mr. Three makes this giant wax cake

3168
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:50,320
and he gets them all waxed up and they can't leave.

3169
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:56,320
And they're being turned into wax sculptures with this candle at the top.

3170
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:59,680
That's like raining down wax particles.

3171
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:03,760
And Zoro is like, well, I may as well strike a cool pose if I'm going to die.

3172
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:06,000
So he holds his sword up.

3173
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:09,040
I remember that very fondly.

3174
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:10,400
Yeah.

3175
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:12,960
That was a big like, oh, shit, is Zoro going to die?

3176
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:15,120
He tries to cut his own legs off to get out of there.

3177
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:24,640
I feel like I feel like I felt like they were in real danger like against

3178
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:30,080
I think, I mean, against, I think it was against Kuma.

3179
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:32,160
Or what's the one where like...

3180
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:36,080
Spoilers.

3181
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:38,080
Oh, yeah, never mind.

3182
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:42,880
I'm sure by the time I get there, I will have forgotten.

3183
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:43,840
Yeah.

3184
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:48,720
I only mentioned the giant island because that's past, that's before they meet Chopper.

3185
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:49,760
Right, right.

3186
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:51,680
I vaguely remember that.

3187
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:57,440
What can I say without spoiling too much?

3188
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:00,800
I like One Piece.

3189
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:03,120
Yeah, I like One Piece.

3190
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:04,560
It is so fucking good.

3191
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:11,200
Yeah, One Piece is not grounded in that way at all.

3192
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:16,800
Even early on, I remember watching the anime and there's like a moment where

3193
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:23,200
Nami changes her mind and decides to jump on the boat as they're leaving that little town.

3194
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:27,120
This is before Arlong Park or anything.

3195
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:29,360
Is there no new, there's no new chapter this week?

3196
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:32,000
No, this wasn't a bummer.

3197
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:32,640
It was on a break.

3198
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:33,760
Damn.

3199
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:38,400
But like she jumps and she jumps like 14 feet.

3200
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:45,440
Like it's just like a super long jump, but it's not like mentioned as like a

3201
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:48,800
superhuman feat of strength or special abilities.

3202
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:51,200
It's just sort of like, yeah, people can jump really a lot.

3203
02:32:52,800 --> 02:33:00,880
That's just sort of a thing in anime or manga where like the superpowers are so insane that

3204
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:04,400
like normal actions are also kind of like brought up to insanity.

3205
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:04,800
That's kind of why.

3206
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:08,720
They can jump off of the second story of a building and just land on the ground and not be

3207
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:10,560
like broken-legged.

3208
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:15,280
That's kind of why I feel like I wasn't that upset by the

3209
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:20,640
I won't say what it is, but like the reveal about that fruit, that one particular fruit,

3210
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:28,800
you know, the one didn't bother me that much because like we really already well past the

3211
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:33,840
point where like these characters are powerful to the point that like you can't really relate to

3212
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:34,400
them.

3213
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:40,560
They can like take cannonballs to the face and like mostly be fine nine out of 10 times.

3214
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:42,240
Yeah.

3215
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:47,920
I think what I really appreciate about One Piece is more so the emotional

3216
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:56,160
connections that they make and sort of the visceral like catharsis of seeing the bad guy

3217
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:59,520
get punched really hard after being a real shithead.

3218
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:05,440
It's I don't know how it's different from other shounen, but One Piece just does it really good.

3219
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:08,880
They set up the villain so that you're so happy when they get punched.

3220
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,160
Oh, man.

3221
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:12,080
I feel like in Naruto, it's a little.

3222
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:16,960
I really like there's a lot of emo stuff that's just sort of doesn't.

3223
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,360
What was the feel the same?

3224
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:20,400
Yeah.

3225
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:25,760
What was the name of the villain in the Fishman Island arc?

3226
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:28,480
Fishman Island.

3227
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:28,800
Yeah.

3228
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:31,760
That would be Hody Jones.

3229
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:32,640
Hody Jones.

3230
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:35,600
Hody Jones was so I hated him so much.

3231
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,760
They did such a good job of making me hate that guy.

3232
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:41,600
Oh, and Van der Decken.

3233
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:42,480
That was the other guy.

3234
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:44,560
Something Van der Decken.

3235
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:45,600
Who the fuck is that?

3236
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:52,320
Hody Jones was the Fishman and something Van der Decken was another Fishman who had the

3237
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:53,840
devil fruit of throwing.

3238
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:58,800
Oh, he could touch something and throw it at you and it would find you.

3239
02:34:58,800 --> 02:34:59,120
Yeah.

3240
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:01,680
I sort of remember this guy.

3241
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,480
Did he do anything?

3242
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:08,400
Yeah.

3243
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:15,120
He was the reason the boat, the Moby Dick or whatever it was called.

3244
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:19,520
Like the giant ship, the Noah's Ark.

3245
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:20,720
Yeah, that thing.

3246
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:27,200
He touched that boat and threw it and he threw it at Fishman Island and they had to stop it.

3247
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Oh, I forgot.

3248
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:31,920
I forgot.

3249
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:34,160
He's the reason that was happening.

3250
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:35,600
And I think Luffy punched it.

3251
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:38,400
Yeah, but Hody Jones was like the leader.

3252
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:43,760
He was the leader of the punk shark bastards or whatever they were called.

3253
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:46,800
No, not the Sun Pirates.

3254
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:47,680
Those are the good guys.

3255
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:49,600
The Fun Pirates.

3256
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:52,160
They're all Fun Pirates.

3257
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:53,680
What was the name?

3258
02:35:55,280 --> 02:36:01,360
Wasn't it like, oh, didn't they have, they had like a tattoo and then they covered it up with

3259
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:03,520
the Sun Pirate Tattoo, right?

3260
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:11,840
Yeah, the Fishman were slaves and they had a brand marked on them front by the Tenryubito.

3261
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:20,640
And so Fisher Tiger, like the freer of the Fishman slaves, the big boy, he turned that

3262
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:25,040
branding into a new logo that would be the Sun Pirate logo.

3263
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,720
Did Hody Jones, were they Sun Pirates too?

3264
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:30,160
I don't remember.

3265
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:35,920
I think they were like, they knew Arlong, who was a Sun Pirate guy.

3266
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:44,080
Yeah, I forget if like, maybe they, the Hody Jones guys were not actually Sun Pirates.

3267
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:45,280
I can't remember.

3268
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,520
I thought maybe they did something else with the tattoo.

3269
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:52,080
Looks like you're gonna have to read it again.

3270
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:54,480
I guess I'll have to read it all again.

3271
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:56,320
It's so great.

3272
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,600
It's so great.

3273
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:03,040
Oh, Hody Jones has, he's got like a different, he's got like a different tattoo.

3274
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:03,840
Like, look at this.

3275
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:08,160
Oh, he, oh, he's got like the big sun.

3276
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,960
He's got like the racist version of the Sun Pirates tattoo.

3277
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:13,680
Lol, so awesome.

3278
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:17,520
What a little, little bastard.

3279
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:22,000
Yeah, it's the sun, but on the inside is like the no humans.

3280
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,680
No humans, that's his thing.

3281
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:28,800
They love Hody Jones.

3282
02:37:30,320 --> 02:37:32,880
The most despicable villain.

3283
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:35,040
They all got great names.

3284
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:39,600
Yes, I love Otis naming conventions.

3285
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:41,920
They're just so satisfying.

3286
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:45,680
Like Thriller Bark as an island, as a ship.

3287
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:46,960
I love that.

3288
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:49,680
I just, I just love it.

3289
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:51,360
Skypia.

3290
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:53,920
Tell us how you really feel about it though.

3291
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,960
Um, uh, I hate it.

3292
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:58,160
Okay, that's cool.

3293
02:37:59,200 --> 02:37:59,680
Nice.

3294
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:03,600
I'm sad.

3295
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:04,000
I'm sad.

3296
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:04,960
There's no new episode.

3297
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:07,360
I didn't realize they were on break, bummer.

3298
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:10,960
I think it said break next week on the chapter.

3299
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:11,360
Oh, well.

3300
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:15,360
It's funny that Otis can just do that whenever he wants.

3301
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,160
What are they going to tell him?

3302
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:18,480
No.

3303
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:22,800
I mean, he's a hard-working guy, but yeah.

3304
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:29,280
I mean, many manga authors go on like hiatuses to like,

3305
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:35,360
to like just still, you know, take a break after like years of

3306
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:38,240
consistently producing high quality stuff.

3307
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:39,520
To take a break after years of coming.

3308
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:45,840
But Oda, Oda takes like a maximum like two weeks of a break sometimes.

3309
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:46,880
Yeah.

3310
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:52,560
Which is like, it's so, people still get mad about it, but it's like, it's unbelievable.

3311
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:58,080
How much good shit he's made consistently for how many years?

3312
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:00,720
Like 25 years?

3313
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,440
How long has it been?

3314
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:04,640
Uh, it's gotta be at least like 20 years.

3315
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:04,960
Yeah.

3316
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:10,800
1997.

3317
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:15,440
Uh, that's why that's, um,

3318
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,040
Check this out.

3319
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:21,680
23 years and then 22.

3320
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:23,360
Check it out.

3321
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:26,320
It's the Virgin, Hodey Jones versus the Chad Arlong.

3322
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:30,400
Racist for no reason.

3323
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:32,240
It has a good reason to hate humans.

3324
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:36,960
Uh, oh, that's right.

3325
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,800
Hodey Jones wasn't a slave.

3326
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:43,840
He was just, he was like of the generation after.

3327
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,480
Yeah.

3328
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:44,720
Yeah.

3329
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:50,320
He was the generation after he literally just like carried on hating humans for no reason at all.

3330
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:56,400
He just like, he just thought it was like what he should do as like part of like fishman culture.

3331
02:39:56,400 --> 02:40:00,080
Literally just like, we have to return to the good old days of hating humans.

3332
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:02,720
Cause like, I just think things, I know I wasn't born back then.

3333
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:04,720
I just think things were probably better back then.

3334
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:06,640
He's literally like that.

3335
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:10,160
Villain of the Ark where the series went from good to great.

3336
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:10,800
That's true.

3337
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:11,600
I think that's true.

3338
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:13,920
I, yeah, I would say that as well.

3339
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:18,560
I think at the time I remember thinking like, like the Arlong arc was where I was like, okay,

3340
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:22,240
I think, I think this is actually, I really like the series now.

3341
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:26,080
How long, when does that come about?

3342
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:27,680
That's, that's when Nami joins.

3343
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:29,440
That's when Nami joins.

3344
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:29,520
That's pretty early.

3345
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:31,520
It's in East Blue before the grand line.

3346
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:32,960
So that's pretty early on.

3347
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:35,360
But it's, it's such a cool moment cause it's.

3348
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:37,520
Yeah.

3349
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:43,680
It starts off goofy enough, but the, the, the villain is stronger than any other villain so far.

3350
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:53,280
And it's just, they build him up to be such a, like a ruthless person that couldn't,

3351
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:55,200
could not possibly be toppled.

3352
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,640
The whole town is scared of him.

3353
02:40:57,280 --> 02:41:00,320
And then Luffy and the boys, they just roll up.

3354
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:02,960
They barely know what's going on.

3355
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:04,800
Luffy has no idea and he doesn't want to know.

3356
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:07,520
He just knows that Nami's crying and he healed protector.

3357
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:13,520
So he goes into the, he just barges in to the bad, big bad like guy that has been built up.

3358
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:14,560
To be so dangerous.

3359
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:18,560
And then they just fight and he destroys the building and he destroys.

3360
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:22,720
Oh, and the moment, the moment where he kicks like Nami is like,

3361
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:29,280
like indentured servitude, slavery, like a map charting desk, kicks it out of the window

3362
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:34,880
and she sees it and he just destroys the room where they kept Nami like hostage

3363
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:36,480
and forced her to draw maps for them.

3364
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:43,280
And she starts crying and then, and they just, he just destroys everything

3365
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:48,320
and it comes out of the rubble and he asked Nami to join the crew or something.

3366
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:51,680
I like when he, I like when he just, just deflects how strong he is.

3367
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:57,680
He just like flips houses upside down just because he can do that.

3368
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:01,760
Yeah, they arrive and they're like, what's up with this street?

3369
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,200
All the houses are upside down.

3370
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,840
Oh, that's because of the fishmen.

3371
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:06,560
They're so strong.

3372
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:09,280
Or along just does that just to fuck with people.

3373
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:12,080
What an arc.

3374
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:12,880
Yeah.

3375
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:14,080
What a, what a story.

3376
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:14,320
Yeah.

3377
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:16,640
I don't know.

3378
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:20,480
I mean, the fishman, the fishman arc, I don't know if I'd call it a nothing arc,

3379
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:22,320
but it is like way too long.

3380
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,000
It's, it's, yeah, it's, it felt a little bloated, I think.

3381
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:28,320
Yeah.

3382
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:30,000
The fishman island.

3383
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:34,880
Much like Hody Jones himself with his big old puffer fish gut.

3384
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:38,000
No, no, it's a good, no, it's a good character though.

3385
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:42,560
I gotta get back to drawing Clarissa Gunsmoke.

3386
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:46,160
I gotta get back to make my stupid book.

3387
02:42:46,160 --> 02:42:50,400
I've only got, oh fuck, I've only got like a week and a half to finish it.

3388
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:52,160
Ha, ha, ha, I gotta draw a cover.

3389
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:52,640
Oh no.

3390
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:56,240
Everyone needs to like Clarissa Gunsmoke.

3391
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:58,000
She's such a female character.

3392
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,920
She's a leading role female character.

3393
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:03,280
You gotta get her put in Shonen Jump.

3394
02:43:03,280 --> 02:43:04,480
I gotta go to Shonen Jump.

3395
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:07,520
I say, hey, I know I'm not Japanese and I have a very odd art style

3396
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:10,480
for, for a manga, but put this in there.

3397
02:43:10,480 --> 02:43:14,080
Hey, I know that like you don't, yeah, first of all, not Japanese.

3398
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,080
Second of all, not a manga.

3399
02:43:16,080 --> 02:43:18,800
Second of all, female characters and you never do those.

3400
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,720
But I've got a genius plan.

3401
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:24,160
What if we had the first female character in a Shonen Jump manga

3402
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:25,840
and it was Western and it wasn't manga?

3403
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:27,840
And they're like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

3404
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,680
Oh my god, we've gotta do it.

3405
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:32,320
I never, nobody, I didn't think of this before.

3406
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:34,080
What if we broke convention?

3407
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:34,560
Ah!

3408
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:37,840
I'll be there.

3409
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:38,720
I'll be reading it.

3410
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:44,080
And then I'll go on, I'll go on all the Japanese forums

3411
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:45,360
and they'll say, oh, this sucks.

3412
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:46,080
Fucking woman.

3413
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:46,800
Yeah, but yeah, they'll say.

3414
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:47,920
But I won't be able to read it.

3415
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,840
I won't be able to read it, so I won't even feel bad.

3416
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:54,240
They'll say, they'll say, they'll say this lady's got bold ideas

3417
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,240
of taking this company in a new direction.

3418
02:43:56,240 --> 02:43:59,040
We're going to make her our assistant vice president.

3419
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,360
And then all, everyone on the forums is,

3420
02:44:01,360 --> 02:44:04,000
and then, and then everyone, everyone on the west

3421
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:07,200
is like, oh, oh, this crying soy face.

3422
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:08,960
It's like, oh, this new vice president.

3423
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:10,480
Oh, they put her manga in the thing.

3424
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:11,520
It's not even manga.

3425
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:12,800
Oh, it's a girl main character.

3426
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:14,480
Oh, this is not even Japanese.

3427
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:16,320
Oh, real Japanese people don't even know

3428
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:17,280
what trans people are.

3429
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:19,120
They're ruining culture.

3430
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:22,560
It's colonizing it.

3431
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,920
Oh no, I'm doing colonization.

3432
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:30,000
And that seems like it would be pretty fun.

3433
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,040
So let's do it.

3434
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:33,760
Yeah, that's my new goal is to take

3435
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:34,720
over, show and jump.

3436
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:41,360
Time to colonize with my British genes.

3437
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:43,760
I'm made for this.

3438
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:45,840
I'm made for destroying other cultures.

3439
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,840
This is what I was built for.

3440
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:52,240
It's good to see someone use colonization

3441
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:55,520
for good to destroy anime.

3442
02:44:56,480 --> 02:45:08,400
I'm feeling like are we getting on towards voicemail time?

3443
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,400
I think so.

3444
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:14,640
I don't want to kick you off deadly,

3445
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:17,040
but I mean, we are at almost three hours.

3446
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:20,800
And you would probably be bored by voicemails

3447
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:23,920
because they would not have anything to do with you.

3448
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:24,560
You know what I mean?

3449
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:28,640
It doesn't have to do with me for me to be not bored.

3450
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:31,360
Try to bully deadly comics off the show.

3451
02:45:31,360 --> 02:45:32,960
If you want to hang out for voicemails,

3452
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:34,240
I mean, yeah, okay, we can do that.

3453
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:38,720
I guess I just, you know, I just, you know,

3454
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:41,280
I just like to politely assume that our guests

3455
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:43,200
have better things to be doing.

3456
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:45,120
But I mean, if you don't, I guess.

3457
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:48,320
Not really.

3458
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:49,360
Okay, all right.

3459
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:50,480
Hell yeah.

3460
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:53,920
Let's grab a, let me do that then.

3461
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:56,960
Let's see how many we got this week.

3462
02:45:56,960 --> 02:45:57,760
Hopefully none.

3463
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:00,160
Oh my God.

3464
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:03,920
So people just record things and send them to you?

3465
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:08,480
Yeah, they just, we have a website called Speakpipe

3466
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:10,240
where people can just deposit.

3467
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:13,280
Yeah, it's basically like a voicemail service.

3468
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:17,760
Do you listen to them before you put them on the air?

3469
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:21,600
We used to, but no, under my leadership,

3470
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:24,640
we have adopted an anarchist philosophy

3471
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:28,480
where whatever's there is what gets listened to.

3472
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:29,760
Yeah.

3473
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:32,720
And if it sucks, that's too bad.

3474
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:33,600
Yeah.

3475
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:36,320
And spoiler alert, it usually sucks.

3476
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:39,840
No, that's not true.

3477
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:40,480
No, that's not true.

3478
02:46:40,480 --> 02:46:41,040
No, that's fine.

3479
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:41,760
No, we love it.

3480
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:42,720
We get some good ones.

3481
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:43,760
We do get some good ones.

3482
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:45,360
All right.

3483
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:46,080
Oh, hang on.

3484
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:46,400
Hang on.

3485
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:47,760
We got a message from Cheezy.

3486
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:48,880
Hey, can I jump in on this?

3487
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:50,320
I'm totally awake right now.

3488
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:51,280
Cheezy, you're too late.

3489
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:52,080
This is the end.

3490
02:46:53,120 --> 02:46:55,280
I guess, I guess we can.

3491
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:55,920
I don't mind.

3492
02:46:57,360 --> 02:46:59,200
Just for the questions segment.

3493
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,560
I get to meet a new person.

3494
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:02,560
What do you think, deadly?

3495
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:03,840
Should we let Cheezy jump in?

3496
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:06,000
I love to meet new people.

3497
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,280
I love to meet new people.

3498
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:08,320
Do you know who Cheezy is?

3499
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:09,920
I don't know.

3500
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:10,240
Okay.

3501
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:13,520
Well, he's a comic artist who is funny

3502
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:16,480
and he gets people mad at him on Twitter sometimes.

3503
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:17,680
He loves clowns.

3504
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:18,000
He loves clowns.

3505
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,200
He does love clowns.

3506
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:21,680
Who doesn't, right?

3507
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:22,080
Oh, yeah.

3508
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:26,000
But nobody loves them as much as Cheezy does.

3509
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,480
Hey, Cheezy, how you doing?

3510
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:29,760
I'm doing pretty good.

3511
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:32,000
You got any, what?

3512
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:33,600
What was that?

3513
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:39,120
I was going to say, do you got any updates this week?

3514
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:41,920
Do you have anything interesting happening in your week?

3515
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:44,400
Anything interesting?

3516
02:47:44,400 --> 02:47:48,240
Did anything interesting happen to you?

3517
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,000
In the week?

3518
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:53,440
Did anything interesting happen to me?

3519
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:54,000
Yes.

3520
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:54,320
Yes.

3521
02:47:54,320 --> 02:47:59,120
I'm asking if anything interesting happened to you this past week.

3522
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:01,040
Wait, wait, let me get this straight.

3523
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:05,440
You're asking, wait, hold up, hold up, wait, you're talking too fast.

3524
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:06,080
Wait.

3525
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:13,360
So you're asking me, me, if anything interesting happened to me

3526
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:17,120
in the past seven days?

3527
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:17,360
I am.

3528
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:18,640
Which you're asking for?

3529
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:18,960
Indeed.

3530
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:20,480
Okay, all right.

3531
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:22,800
Okay, anything interesting?

3532
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:23,280
Okay, no.

3533
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:26,240
Anything interesting?

3534
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:27,600
Anything.

3535
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:28,880
Anything.

3536
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:29,360
Anything.

3537
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:30,400
Anything.

3538
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:31,600
Anything.

3539
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:32,640
No rules.

3540
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:36,240
Any, how much longer, how much longer is this going to be?

3541
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:40,240
I just, I just want you to be clear because I don't want to say something and then I don't

3542
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:41,920
want you to be like, oh, you can count.

3543
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:45,360
We are, you have 10 seconds to answer the fucking question.

3544
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:51,040
This time limit wasn't imposed at the beginning.

3545
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:51,840
I don't like this.

3546
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,480
All right, so I guess, no?

3547
02:48:56,480 --> 02:49:00,320
Okay, well, maybe something interesting happened.

3548
02:49:00,320 --> 02:49:00,720
I don't know.

3549
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:02,400
My business.

3550
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:07,280
Let's listen to the first voicemail.

3551
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:10,960
The first voicemail is called Aiden.

3552
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:16,720
And it will be Aiden and a Benton.

3553
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:22,880
I have a cousin named Aiden who I saw yesterday, but his name is not spelled.

3554
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:26,480
Hey, I can't, I can't, it's not, it's not posting.

3555
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,600
It's not posting.

3556
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:28,320
Lol.

3557
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:29,600
Is there a, is there a cousin white?

3558
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,800
Is he like a white guy?

3559
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:30,880
Yeah.

3560
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:31,200
Yeah.

3561
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:31,520
Oh, okay.

3562
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:33,440
That's kind of cringe.

3563
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:35,760
I guess that's a pretty, I guess that's a pretty white name.

3564
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:38,000
All right, let's do it.

3565
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,680
Three, two, one, go.

3566
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:41,120
Hello.

3567
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:49,200
This is Aiden and I'm reporting from the Rowdy fuckers cop killers.

3568
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:58,000
And I was told by Marilyn to say hello to Ben and to call you a cop kisser.

3569
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:00,240
You are a cop kisser.

3570
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:01,520
Fuck you.

3571
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:03,040
You're a bitch.

3572
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:09,600
And finally, killers once again, bullying Ben

3573
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:10,560
as they should.

3574
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:12,320
Yeah, uh, I'm bullying you.

3575
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:13,680
You're a nerd.

3576
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:22,000
I bet you get wedgies at school and you never asked Veronica for her number.

3577
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:24,960
And you still get upset about it to this day.

3578
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:26,320
All right.

3579
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:26,480
Okay.

3580
02:50:26,480 --> 02:50:26,880
Bye.

3581
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,560
Y'all have a good podcast.

3582
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:39,440
But I asked, but I did, but I asked, but I asked Bousra, but I asked Bousra

3583
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:40,240
out for coffee.

3584
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:40,640
Okay.

3585
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:41,760
Look, I took my shot.

3586
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:46,880
Yeah, I didn't ask Veronica for her number, but you know, I learned from that mistake.

3587
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:49,280
I learned that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

3588
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:53,920
I'm more of a Betty kind of guy than a Veronica kind of guy.

3589
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:55,520
Which one's the blonde one?

3590
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:55,920
Betty.

3591
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:02,320
Is there like, wait, aren't they both like exactly the same except one is rich and the other's not?

3592
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:03,520
Okay.

3593
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:05,520
Betty is the girl next door.

3594
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:08,400
She's like your childhood friend ever.

3595
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:12,480
Veronica is implied to be like new to the school.

3596
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:15,280
But they're both just kind of like catty bitches.

3597
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:16,080
No, no.

3598
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:17,200
Veronica's more catty.

3599
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:24,480
But one of them is your another, the Japanese word, another Japanese word that I learned from Tim Rogers.

3600
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:30,880
The one that means your childhood friend from a time before you can even remember.

3601
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:34,400
And also you are in love, I guess.

3602
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:35,840
Yeah.

3603
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:38,000
Archie invented that.

3604
02:51:38,560 --> 02:51:39,600
Archie and Betty are that?

3605
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:40,960
Oh, that's so sweet.

3606
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:42,080
Yep.

3607
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:44,480
Yeah, they invented it.

3608
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:48,160
Another thing those Japanese stole from us.

3609
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:49,680
Tezuka stole the idea.

3610
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:52,480
Well, wait, was it Tezuka?

3611
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:55,280
Nah, wait, was it Tezuka who popularized that?

3612
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:55,840
That can't be.

3613
02:51:55,840 --> 02:51:56,960
No, I don't think so.

3614
02:51:56,960 --> 02:52:04,400
I don't think it even comes from like Osan, Osananajimi.

3615
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,200
I think that's what it means.

3616
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:11,680
You should, I got a suggestion for a new segment on the podcast.

3617
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:15,520
Each episode you learn a new Japanese word.

3618
02:52:16,480 --> 02:52:20,320
And then over a course of like 5,000 episodes, you will know Japanese.

3619
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:22,960
Only 5,000 words.

3620
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:24,960
Gib, you know what is actually better?

3621
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:28,400
Probably better than any of the action button reviews.

3622
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:31,360
If you haven't watched an action button review and you want to watch something by Tim Rogers,

3623
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:37,040
genuinely, you should watch the slow translation of Final Fantasy 7 is probably better than any of

3624
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:37,840
the action buttons.

3625
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:40,640
And that's a really good series.

3626
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:42,240
Okay.

3627
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:47,040
And that's where I learned the word Osananajimi.

3628
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:53,760
Looks like you need to rewatch.

3629
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:54,720
Nanna, nanna, nanna, nanna phone.

3630
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:02,080
Where did I put that, where did I put that link?

3631
02:53:02,640 --> 02:53:06,480
Alright, hey, I like that this killer is bullying me.

3632
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:07,680
You know what, it's good.

3633
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:09,280
I like, I like that spunk.

3634
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:10,480
I like that spirit.

3635
02:53:10,480 --> 02:53:12,320
I like to see the grit and gumption.

3636
02:53:12,320 --> 02:53:13,680
You passed the test.

3637
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:15,680
Yeah, good, good on you.

3638
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:16,720
Good, good effort.

3639
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:21,520
Let's see if I can actually listen to my fucking messages again.

3640
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,520
No, Gib, help.

3641
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:25,520
Oh, should I post the next one?

3642
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:26,320
Please.

3643
02:53:26,320 --> 02:53:28,880
Okay, the next one is called,

3644
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:34,480
By the Ways, Prince Isolation at Twitter.com.

3645
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:37,200
Wait, why is it down?

3646
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:39,520
Why did it, why did it post like this?

3647
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:41,680
Okay, it's not playing.

3648
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:43,920
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself.

3649
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:46,640
Oh, the second one?

3650
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:47,920
No, Ben, don't kill yourself.

3651
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:49,120
I'm gonna kill myself.

3652
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,160
So you just have sexy.

3653
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:51,120
Ha ha, don't do that.

3654
02:53:52,400 --> 02:53:58,240
I'll never, I'll never, I'll never, I'll never have coffee with Busuda and I'll never get to hear

3655
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:00,560
what Prince Isolation had to say in his speak pub.

3656
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:01,520
So what's the point?

3657
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:02,880
What's even the point of anything?

3658
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:08,720
Ben, the most beta move ever is to let Trixie outlive you.

3659
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:17,200
Really, what if she like makes like a 360 and she becomes the best YouTuber,

3660
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:19,440
the best anti-tuber again on YouTube, huh?

3661
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:24,960
Yeah, I should, I should, I should keep living just to make sure that that never happens.

3662
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:25,920
You're right.

3663
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:27,280
It's a little life going.

3664
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:28,640
I'll keep, yeah.

3665
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:29,840
You're the guy for them.

3666
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:33,840
It's a wonderful life, but instead you make like all the potential futures,

3667
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:36,960
you make like trans women's lives worse by staying alive.

3668
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:41,840
Well, that's, well, that's the, that's the plot of the Christmas.

3669
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:43,280
It's a terrible death.

3670
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:47,760
That's the, that's the plot of a Christmas, the Christmas special of married with children.

3671
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:48,560
You know about this?

3672
02:54:50,480 --> 02:54:54,480
In married with children, there's a, there's an, it's a wonderful life parody episode

3673
02:54:55,280 --> 02:55:02,160
and Al sees that in the world, in the, in the version of the world where he was never born,

3674
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:03,360
everything is better.

3675
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:07,840
And so it inspires him to, to keep on living because he, he hates them all and he wants to

3676
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:08,720
like punish them.

3677
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:10,800
I mean, he's like, I won't let them have that.

3678
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:12,160
I don't want good things for them.

3679
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:13,840
I'm going to come back to life and ruin it.

3680
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:15,280
And that's what he does.

3681
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:21,280
That's also the premise of the robot chicken skit where, where Wimpy from Popeyes

3682
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:23,520
killed, he's about to kill himself.

3683
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:28,000
But then the angel shows him the, the universe where he wasn't born and everything's better.

3684
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:32,480
All in all, it has like huge titties, Popeyes and Blutos aren't enemies no more.

3685
02:55:32,480 --> 02:55:33,600
Everything's going perfectly.

3686
02:55:34,240 --> 02:55:38,000
And the angel just kills and the angel just kills Wimpy instead.

3687
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:41,840
Oh wow, fairly odd parents did that as well.

3688
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:45,360
Well, that's the whole genre now is anti.

3689
02:55:46,240 --> 02:55:47,280
It's a wonderful life.

3690
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:51,840
Well, now, well, now I, well, now I have to wonder if, if whether married with children

3691
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:53,200
was even the first one to do it.

3692
02:55:54,800 --> 02:55:56,640
I mean, it feels like an obvious joke, right?

3693
02:55:58,400 --> 02:56:03,120
Like, yeah, it kind of does, but your presence makes things worse.

3694
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:08,320
I guess if you were, yeah, maybe no, now, hmm, I wonder.

3695
02:56:09,440 --> 02:56:12,160
Ben, if you didn't exist, Nate would have never gone into ponies.

3696
02:56:14,080 --> 02:56:16,400
Thus, those who would never have met Michelle.

3697
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:23,200
I wonder, I wonder, I mean, Charles Dickens was really popular even in his own time.

3698
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:26,480
I wonder if people were writing like parodies of it's a wonderful,

3699
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:28,640
wait, no, that's not by Charles Dickens.

3700
02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:30,640
No, it's a film.

3701
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:33,760
What was it from like the fifties?

3702
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:37,200
Uh, I, I think so.

3703
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:38,640
I mean, it was a, it was a big film.

3704
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:40,320
I wonder, I wonder if people were parrot.

3705
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:44,640
I wonder if whatever the, like the, the, the contemporary equivalent of like Saturday Night

3706
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:50,320
Live was at the time, did like a parody of it where they were like, ha, ha, what if,

3707
02:56:50,320 --> 02:56:54,000
when you die, if it was actually good, if you never survived, never lived.

3708
02:56:56,480 --> 02:56:57,120
Fascinating.

3709
02:56:57,920 --> 02:56:58,320
Ah, man.

3710
02:56:58,320 --> 02:56:59,600
Fascinating.

3711
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:03,840
For the longest time, I thought that it's a wonderful life was read in by, um,

3712
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:06,240
Rod Serlin, the creator of the Twilight Zone.

3713
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:08,080
But really, I was missing form.

3714
02:57:08,080 --> 02:57:08,720
I wasn't him.

3715
02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:10,880
I thought it was because like the whole premise feels like

3716
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:14,160
the Twilight Zone Christmas special almost.

3717
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:15,200
A little bit.

3718
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:15,520
Yeah.

3719
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:16,080
Yeah.

3720
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:16,560
Yeah.

3721
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:16,800
Yeah.

3722
02:57:16,800 --> 02:57:18,400
I see what you, I see what you're saying.

3723
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:19,600
1947.

3724
02:57:20,240 --> 02:57:22,400
That's like two years after World War II ended.

3725
02:57:22,960 --> 02:57:23,280
Yeah.

3726
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:27,040
And I saw they said it was communist propaganda.

3727
02:57:28,080 --> 02:57:28,800
Um, and they were right.

3728
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:30,400
It's a beautiful wife.

3729
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:33,040
It's a beautiful my wife.

3730
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:34,240
You know what I had?

3731
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:35,280
It's a beautiful my wife.

3732
02:57:35,280 --> 02:57:38,160
You know what I had yesterday at the my family Christmas party?

3733
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:38,720
Eggnog.

3734
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:40,400
Nice.

3735
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:40,880
With whiskey.

3736
02:57:40,880 --> 02:57:42,560
Was that, did it, did it have egg?

3737
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:44,560
I don't know if it had egg.

3738
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:50,400
I've been told conflicting things that, yes, Eggnog always has egg from other people.

3739
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:51,040
It's not true.

3740
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:52,320
It's not necessarily true.

3741
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:56,800
Commenters, please explain.

3742
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:02,640
I mean, maybe like tradition, the tradition, maybe the most traditional homemade kind.

3743
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:05,600
You guys heard that?

3744
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:07,120
Was that you?

3745
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:07,600
I did.

3746
02:58:07,600 --> 02:58:09,040
Was it you blowing your nose?

3747
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:11,760
No, that was my partner's sleep right now.

3748
02:58:12,880 --> 02:58:13,600
Was it a snore?

3749
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:15,360
Yeah, they were snoring.

3750
02:58:15,360 --> 02:58:16,320
Jesus Christ.

3751
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:17,600
Yep.

3752
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:18,640
I was a little tired.

3753
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:19,600
I mean, it worked late.

3754
02:58:20,720 --> 02:58:25,600
I was going to say, oh, Ben, you think you could, if I put a gun to your head.

3755
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:26,160
Yeah.

3756
02:58:26,880 --> 02:58:32,160
And I told you to rank your family members from everyone who showed up at the Christmas party.

3757
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:35,440
From like your, your favorite to your least favorite.

3758
02:58:35,440 --> 02:58:37,600
You think you can do it being a ranked them?

3759
02:58:38,320 --> 02:58:40,320
Yeah, but like, you don't know any of these people.

3760
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:41,760
It wouldn't mean anything.

3761
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:43,600
Ben, I'm the man with the gun.

3762
02:58:45,760 --> 02:58:50,560
The point is to, is to get you to say something that, oh, they might hear and they might be like.

3763
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:52,400
High tier.

3764
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:55,280
High tier.

3765
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:57,280
Zero.

3766
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:58,720
Cousin, cousin Maddie.

3767
02:58:59,520 --> 02:58:59,840
Base.

3768
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,520
Uncle Peter.

3769
02:59:02,320 --> 02:59:03,040
Cousin Al.

3770
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:07,680
Al's wife wrote, no, Al's wife Rose.

3771
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:10,320
Cousin Luke.

3772
02:59:12,320 --> 02:59:18,000
Uh, and then, uh, should we tell oblivion fall to jump in?

3773
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:21,360
You know, it's so funny.

3774
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:22,560
It could be making up those names.

3775
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:23,760
Yeah.

3776
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:28,400
Um, uh, Uncle George, Uncle Paul, Uncle Ringo.

3777
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:28,640
Okay.

3778
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:29,440
I would say, okay.

3779
02:59:29,440 --> 02:59:29,520
Okay.

3780
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:29,760
Okay.

3781
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:32,480
Pete, Peter's family is just better in general.

3782
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:36,320
Chris's family is okay, but Chris himself is kind of a weirdo.

3783
02:59:36,320 --> 02:59:41,360
Uh, your family member has family guy names.

3784
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:47,840
Oh, uncle Peter and at Lois and little cousin Stewie.

3785
02:59:48,400 --> 02:59:51,920
Uh, of, uh, so, uh, yeah.

3786
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:54,000
And then, uh, who, I mean, who else was even there?

3787
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,640
Um, I think that was pretty much it.

3788
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:59,760
Was it, was there, was there, I don't, am I forgetting?

3789
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:00,480
It was all them.

3790
03:00:00,480 --> 03:00:02,800
And it was all their like wives and it was all there.

3791
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:05,920
And then some of their kids, uh,

3792
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:07,440
Are you anyone's cool uncle?

3793
03:00:08,560 --> 03:00:12,720
I, I do have some, no, wait, I'm not, I'm nobody's uncle.

3794
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:16,960
I guess if my cousin has a kid, am I their great uncle or am I their like,

3795
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:19,280
I think that's, that's uncle once removed.

3796
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:21,600
I think I'm the second, I think I'm their second cousin.

3797
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:26,800
I think, I think me and my cousin's kids are second cousins to each other.

3798
03:00:28,480 --> 03:00:30,400
Hey, that's, that's uncle Ben.

3799
03:00:30,400 --> 03:00:31,440
Oh, what's so great about him?

3800
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:32,560
He's friends with Mary weather.

3801
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:33,280
Oh, he is.

3802
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:35,520
And then they go up to you and they punch you in your stomach.

3803
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:48,720
Um, uh, I mean, I mean, uh, and then I, I, I, I feel like, um, I feel like, uh,

3804
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:51,280
I kind of have to, I feel like I kind of have to put my uncles on a separate

3805
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:54,400
list for my cousins on a separate list for my cousin's spouses.

3806
03:00:55,360 --> 03:00:59,120
Uncle ranking as opposed to aunt ranking.

3807
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:03,360
So what's this voicemail say?

3808
03:01:04,320 --> 03:01:05,440
I don't know.

3809
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:08,160
I'm just, I'm just wasting time because I can't listen to it.

3810
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:10,240
Oh, you not, you cannot.

3811
03:01:11,280 --> 03:01:11,520
Yeah.

3812
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:16,640
I mean, I can just doesn't, just doesn't play.

3813
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:22,000
Dang, it just doesn't play and I can't download it from the website or anything,

3814
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:25,760
even though my internet is like perfectly functional.

3815
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:28,160
Download speed, uh, 300 kilobytes per second.

3816
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:29,040
It's perfectly healthy.

3817
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:32,160
Uh, well, what do we do?

3818
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:33,680
Should we listen to it for you?

3819
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:36,960
No, what if it's towards Ben?

3820
03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:39,920
Well, then we'll just lie.

3821
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:45,840
We should just, I mean, I think oblivion is, is, uh, is jumping in.

3822
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:48,080
So maybe he can save us.

3823
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:53,600
I'm looking, I'm looking up who a deadly comics is.

3824
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:54,240
You're popular.

3825
03:01:54,240 --> 03:01:56,320
You don't, you don't know deadly comics?

3826
03:01:56,320 --> 03:01:56,560
No.

3827
03:01:58,160 --> 03:01:59,360
Well, he didn't know you either.

3828
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:01,520
Well, I'm not surprised.

3829
03:02:02,720 --> 03:02:05,360
I do now and we're all best friends.

3830
03:02:05,360 --> 03:02:06,000
That's right.

3831
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:07,280
Stop lying to me.

3832
03:02:07,280 --> 03:02:09,600
No, you're lying.

3833
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:11,680
You're lying when you say that isn't true.

3834
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:13,280
You're lying to yourself.

3835
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:13,520
Yeah.

3836
03:02:14,160 --> 03:02:15,120
Let us in.

3837
03:02:15,120 --> 03:02:16,240
Cheesy, let us in.

3838
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:16,400
No.

3839
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:16,800
Open up.

3840
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:20,640
Oh, oh, I can hear it.

3841
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:21,600
Let's, let's listen to it.

3842
03:02:22,640 --> 03:02:22,960
Okay.

3843
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:23,280
Okay.

3844
03:02:23,280 --> 03:02:25,040
Three, two, one, go.

3845
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:28,720
By the way, if you're wondering,

3846
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:36,080
hmm, where is that big bottle on Kemic Man's back attached?

3847
03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:39,520
It doesn't seem that he has any straps.

3848
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:44,400
Is it perhaps bolted or glued to his back?

3849
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:48,560
No, actually you Philistine.

3850
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:55,280
Obviously it is supported at any and all times canonically by

3851
03:02:55,360 --> 03:02:58,720
Kemic Man's big, huge, fluptuous,

3852
03:02:59,600 --> 03:03:01,680
quirked up white boy ass.

3853
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:07,040
And that is canon and real.

3854
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:08,960
I said so.

3855
03:03:08,960 --> 03:03:10,880
I'm the creator and therefore.

3856
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:12,000
He gets to make these decisions.

3857
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:12,400
True.

3858
03:03:12,400 --> 03:03:13,120
True.

3859
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:13,840
True.

3860
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:14,320
Okay.

3861
03:03:14,320 --> 03:03:16,000
Well, thanks for clarifying.

3862
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:16,320
Yeah.

3863
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:17,920
I was wondering.

3864
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:21,600
So you got that, that crunked up white boy shelf.

3865
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:24,880
Did you see that video that was going around on Twitter of a girl

3866
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:31,040
riding a horse and her ass is like so big and like jiggling out of her like,

3867
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:33,360
like jeans and like her.

3868
03:03:33,360 --> 03:03:33,840
Link it.

3869
03:03:33,840 --> 03:03:34,560
Link it right now.

3870
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:34,960
Yes.

3871
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:35,920
I saw that exact.

3872
03:03:35,920 --> 03:03:36,000
Link it.

3873
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:36,160
Yeah.

3874
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:36,320
Yeah.

3875
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:37,920
Like I'm talking about.

3876
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:38,800
I saw it right now.

3877
03:03:38,800 --> 03:03:39,120
Like it.

3878
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:39,360
Please.

3879
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:39,680
Link it.

3880
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:41,920
Hey, actually I'm going to link it.

3881
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:43,280
I'll try to find it also.

3882
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:43,920
Hey, oblivion.

3883
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:44,560
Are you recording?

3884
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:45,440
Yes.

3885
03:03:45,440 --> 03:03:46,560
I started recording before I hopped in.

3886
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:46,640
Great.

3887
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:47,600
Great.

3888
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:48,240
Hello.

3889
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:48,720
Cool.

3890
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:49,040
Welcome.

3891
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:50,160
Nice to meet you.

3892
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:50,640
Hello.

3893
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:50,960
Yeah.

3894
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:54,160
Nice to meet you for the first time oblivion.

3895
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:58,160
So oblivion, you know, we have Cheesy and oblivion.

3896
03:03:58,160 --> 03:03:58,560
Have you not?

3897
03:03:58,560 --> 03:04:02,240
Yeah, we've been on Cheesy's podcast.

3898
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:02,960
He's crazy.

3899
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:03,680
He's dangerous.

3900
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:04,880
Stay away from him.

3901
03:04:04,880 --> 03:04:05,440
Yep.

3902
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:08,080
I am a crazy dangerous individual.

3903
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:10,320
Deadly.

3904
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:11,520
Do you know oblivion fall?

3905
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:14,320
Do you lie?

3906
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:15,760
I don't know if you know me.

3907
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:19,440
I thought you might have seen his animations around.

3908
03:04:20,480 --> 03:04:21,600
I may have.

3909
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:22,640
Yeah, we have.

3910
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:25,920
You ever seen that one video of the guy who puts a jar up his butt?

3911
03:04:27,120 --> 03:04:27,840
I haven't seen it.

3912
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:28,800
I don't know if you've seen it.

3913
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:30,560
Have you ever seen Lemon Party?

3914
03:04:31,760 --> 03:04:32,320
No.

3915
03:04:32,320 --> 03:04:33,040
That's not me.

3916
03:04:33,600 --> 03:04:36,320
Let's just say he hosted that party.

3917
03:04:36,320 --> 03:04:41,360
I'm trying to think because I used to, you know, I know you from like the My Little Pony days.

3918
03:04:41,360 --> 03:04:44,240
I was an animator in that community back then.

3919
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:46,800
And they probably have seen your stuff.

3920
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:49,760
Yeah, you must have the horse animations.

3921
03:04:50,800 --> 03:04:51,840
Yeah, I don't know.

3922
03:04:52,640 --> 03:04:53,680
It doesn't matter if you know me.

3923
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:54,720
I know you and you're good.

3924
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:55,520
You're good.

3925
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:56,320
You're cool.

3926
03:04:56,320 --> 03:04:58,160
You're based and epic.

3927
03:04:58,160 --> 03:04:58,400
Whoa.

3928
03:04:59,280 --> 03:05:00,800
Thanks for the kind words.

3929
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:02,240
You are all as well.

3930
03:05:02,960 --> 03:05:03,680
Wow.

3931
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:04,560
Pleasant people.

3932
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:11,920
I'm not sure if I can find this video.

3933
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:14,480
I mean, I don't know how to find it.

3934
03:05:15,280 --> 03:05:18,400
But then you busted my balls now.

3935
03:05:18,400 --> 03:05:19,440
It was pretty hot.

3936
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:22,160
You can't just talk about a jiggly butt.

3937
03:05:22,720 --> 03:05:23,200
Yeah.

3938
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:24,320
And not show.

3939
03:05:24,320 --> 03:05:26,240
I wish I could.

3940
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:27,840
You're hiding her from me.

3941
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:28,320
You are.

3942
03:05:28,320 --> 03:05:29,360
I saw it.

3943
03:05:29,360 --> 03:05:30,080
You foul beast.

3944
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:33,760
Oh, does someone's Twitter account and they had retweeted it?

3945
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:37,120
Libyan can confirm that it's true.

3946
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:37,920
I'm not lying.

3947
03:05:38,480 --> 03:05:41,520
Then you try to keep her to yourself, all to yourself then.

3948
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:43,040
You're all just going to have to take my word.

3949
03:05:43,760 --> 03:05:48,560
Her butt was like a giant pair of titties that don't fit, that are like falling out of the...

3950
03:05:49,280 --> 03:05:49,920
Don't...

3951
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:51,520
And her titties?

3952
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:52,640
They were like a giant butt.

3953
03:05:55,920 --> 03:05:56,560
Sure.

3954
03:05:56,560 --> 03:05:57,760
Oh my god.

3955
03:05:57,760 --> 03:06:00,240
Listen, I would help if I could, but I can't.

3956
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:00,960
It's out of my hands.

3957
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:02,560
Dang.

3958
03:06:02,560 --> 03:06:04,000
That butt's in the wild somewhere.

3959
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:05,440
It's out there.

3960
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:08,000
It's out there if you can find it.

3961
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:10,320
You're going to have my butt.

3962
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:12,560
I left it for you all in just one piece.

3963
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:14,240
Oh, I found it.

3964
03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:15,600
Yeah.

3965
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:16,240
How'd you find it?

3966
03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:16,800
Yeah.

3967
03:06:16,800 --> 03:06:22,960
I just typed big butt horse, horse riding butt or something.

3968
03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:24,720
That scene, I'm amazed.

3969
03:06:24,720 --> 03:06:27,120
I didn't think you could find it.

3970
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:27,920
We'll post it.

3971
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:28,320
We'll post it.

3972
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:32,160
Well, these are reposts, but I mean, it doesn't matter.

3973
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:32,240
It doesn't matter.

3974
03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:32,800
Close enough.

3975
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:33,680
I'll put it in chat.

3976
03:06:34,480 --> 03:06:41,600
In fact, I will press the button on my computer that lets me just download videos as mp4 is that way.

3977
03:06:42,320 --> 03:06:44,000
L.E.S.R. can easily put it in the edit.

3978
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:45,040
Bzoom.

3979
03:06:46,560 --> 03:06:47,040
W.

3980
03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:49,200
Oblivion with the W.

3981
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:52,960
What the hell?

3982
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:54,160
It's not loading for me.

3983
03:06:54,160 --> 03:06:55,520
Oh, it is like titties.

3984
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:56,560
Oh, you're right.

3985
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:58,960
Yeah, you should have said the thong made it look like titties.

3986
03:07:00,160 --> 03:07:02,080
I mean, I guess.

3987
03:07:02,800 --> 03:07:04,720
More in terms of the way that it's spilling over.

3988
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:08,640
Like it's made out of jelly, but there's zero muscle.

3989
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:09,520
It's all jelly.

3990
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:11,120
Nice.

3991
03:07:12,960 --> 03:07:13,520
Nice.

3992
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:14,400
I hate muscle.

3993
03:07:14,400 --> 03:07:15,360
I anti muscle.

3994
03:07:15,360 --> 03:07:16,000
Nice.

3995
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:16,320
OK.

3996
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:19,200
L.E.S.R. on regular show.

3997
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:20,320
Muscle man.

3998
03:07:20,320 --> 03:07:23,440
Yeah, it's just a bunch of girls on horses with their butts out.

3999
03:07:23,440 --> 03:07:26,160
Like this is this is the ideal future.

4000
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:31,680
But I need horses on on top of big butt girls is what I need.

4001
03:07:34,720 --> 03:07:35,040
All right.

4002
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:38,880
Well, now I would thoroughly derailed the voicemail segment.

4003
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:40,960
We got another voicemail.

4004
03:07:41,920 --> 03:07:42,240
Yeah.

4005
03:07:42,880 --> 03:07:44,560
We got yet more voicemails.

4006
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:47,440
This one's called on the topic of Tim Rogers.

4007
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:48,720
Can you listen to this one, Ben?

4008
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:52,160
Yeah, it's not.

4009
03:07:54,800 --> 03:07:55,920
It's not working.

4010
03:07:55,920 --> 03:07:56,800
It's not working.

4011
03:07:57,520 --> 03:07:58,240
Oh, wait.

4012
03:07:59,120 --> 03:07:59,600
Yes, it is.

4013
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:00,000
Yes, it is.

4014
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:00,480
Yes, it is.

4015
03:08:00,480 --> 03:08:01,680
OK, let's do it.

4016
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:02,480
Perfect.

4017
03:08:02,480 --> 03:08:04,240
OK, three, two, one, go.

4018
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:07,680
Tim Rogers videos are about a man's connection to art or a video game.

4019
03:08:08,320 --> 03:08:10,640
They are as much about him as they are about what he is reviewing.

4020
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:11,360
And that's all right.

4021
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:15,040
I see art as a two-step process, the creation and audience connection.

4022
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:18,480
This type of video is what Jacob Geller and H Bomber Guy do, too.

4023
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:22,000
I find it fascinating to listen to an interesting person explain their experience

4024
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,560
with a piece of art and it helps me to connect with art on a higher level, too.

4025
03:08:25,280 --> 03:08:27,920
As an aside, I think judging an artist based on their fan base

4026
03:08:27,920 --> 03:08:29,440
to be quite a strange way to approach it,

4027
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:33,040
which is what you seem to be doing with your negative interaction with that white knight.

4028
03:08:33,040 --> 03:08:35,440
Um, no, I mean, no.

4029
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:39,280
First of all, I agree with what you're saying about the point of the videos.

4030
03:08:39,280 --> 03:08:40,160
And yeah, I agree.

4031
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:41,120
And I feel that way, too.

4032
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:41,760
And it's fine.

4033
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:46,400
I'm not judging the videos based on that one,

4034
03:08:47,120 --> 03:08:48,640
the fact that some people are weird.

4035
03:08:49,280 --> 03:08:54,000
I'm just saying that some people that are fans of him are weird about it.

4036
03:08:54,640 --> 03:08:55,120
That's all.

4037
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:00,000
Yeah, I would agree with this statement.

4038
03:09:00,880 --> 03:09:05,280
But I do have a critique of Tim Rogers because I tried to watch one of his videos.

4039
03:09:07,440 --> 03:09:08,400
I can post it.

4040
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:10,640
I wrote a little thing.

4041
03:09:11,440 --> 03:09:12,640
Oh, where did I write it?

4042
03:09:13,280 --> 03:09:13,840
This is the...

4043
03:09:14,480 --> 03:09:20,560
We're on the, like, Gibb's struggles to watch a Tim Rogers video, arc.

4044
03:09:20,560 --> 03:09:21,200
Yeah, this is the arc.

4045
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:22,800
This is going on for like a month now.

4046
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:31,520
Well, I mean, I've got to the point where I tried to watch a video and it was the last of us video.

4047
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:37,280
And I think it's just the parts that people say are good were annoying me.

4048
03:09:37,440 --> 03:09:38,400
So this is what I said.

4049
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:42,960
I'm trying to watch a Tim Rogers video on the last of us and I'm getting frustrated.

4050
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:44,960
He's just showing me his video games.

4051
03:09:44,960 --> 03:09:46,480
I don't know what point he's making.

4052
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:50,800
It gives me the impression this video is not long for a good reason.

4053
03:09:50,800 --> 03:09:52,480
And I want to start skipping around.

4054
03:09:52,480 --> 03:09:55,440
I think he does, like, eventually come to a point.

4055
03:09:55,440 --> 03:09:58,240
But I feel like he had, like...

4056
03:09:58,240 --> 03:09:59,520
Oh, that's the one, like, he's showing...

4057
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:02,160
He's actually, like, showing his, like, collection of games.

4058
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:06,240
Like, it's one that Naughty Dog sent to him, I think, right?

4059
03:10:06,880 --> 03:10:09,520
No, he's showing every single game he has in his collection.

4060
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:13,200
And then before that, he explains why he has such a small collection.

4061
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,640
And it's all building to a point, but it just...

4062
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:20,080
It seems to take way too long because I feel like I get it.

4063
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:23,680
But anyway, the next thing I said is I hate this guy, Lol.

4064
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:29,760
I don't like how he enunciates every syllable of a word, every letter it feels like.

4065
03:10:30,320 --> 03:10:35,120
I thought it was a bit, but I think that's just how he talks or how he's choosing to talk.

4066
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:37,520
And he's choosing to talk in a kind of weird way.

4067
03:10:38,400 --> 03:10:43,200
Like, the video is a joke, and he's above it and above me for listening to it.

4068
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:44,960
And my patience has run pretty thin.

4069
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:47,920
When is he going to be a real person?

4070
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:49,200
That's what I want to know.

4071
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:55,200
He's, like, 100% sarcastically saying everything, but some parts are framed as jokes.

4072
03:10:55,200 --> 03:10:58,320
So, obviously, some parts have to be genuine.

4073
03:10:58,880 --> 03:11:00,080
And I can't tell the difference.

4074
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,160
I just wanted to talk normal.

4075
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:05,920
I feel most of that.

4076
03:11:05,920 --> 03:11:06,960
I feel most of that.

4077
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:10,640
That's my problems with Tim Rogers.

4078
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:13,760
He talks annoying, and I can't tell.

4079
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:14,960
He's very sticky.

4080
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:18,800
And he's definitely putting on a voice at all times.

4081
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:24,640
Even when he's not doing his, like, I'm reading a video essay voice,

4082
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:30,320
he still has, like, kind of an affected voice bit that he's doing.

4083
03:11:30,320 --> 03:11:31,120
I'm convinced.

4084
03:11:31,680 --> 03:11:32,240
A bit.

4085
03:11:32,240 --> 03:11:38,000
I mean, he has his, like, I'm reading a script in a dramatic fashion voice,

4086
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:42,640
and then he's sort of got his, like, he's kind of like, he's kind of casual,

4087
03:11:42,640 --> 03:11:45,600
like, I'm just fucking around, you know?

4088
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:51,840
Like, that's his, but, like, that's also a living you don't know who we're talking about.

4089
03:11:51,840 --> 03:11:56,240
I looked him up, and then I'm like, oh, this is the action button thing.

4090
03:11:56,240 --> 03:11:59,520
People have been talking about this guy's videos and telling me to watch it.

4091
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:04,560
I looked at this guy's face, and he has a dumb face.

4092
03:12:05,840 --> 03:12:07,520
Yeah, get his ass.

4093
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:10,400
He looks like, to me, he looks like Monkey Jones.

4094
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:15,200
He looks like, like, 70s Monkey Jones.

4095
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:17,840
I don't know.

4096
03:12:17,840 --> 03:12:19,840
He's the Jones that will break your bones, man.

4097
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:21,440
And the most recent thumbnail, anyway.

4098
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:26,240
I'm not exactly sure what it, who I think he looks like.

4099
03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:28,480
I don't know what this guy looks like.

4100
03:12:28,480 --> 03:12:34,240
But yeah, that's, that's, my main gripe is just the way he talks is, is annoying.

4101
03:12:34,240 --> 03:12:37,920
But more or so, because I can listen to people with annoying voices,

4102
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:40,880
it's that the video was three hours long,

4103
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:44,480
and I don't think he made a single point for the first, like, 30 minutes.

4104
03:12:44,480 --> 03:12:46,880
And I was like, when are you going to say anything?

4105
03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:49,200
When is anything going to come out of your mouth?

4106
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:50,320
Kind of like talking to my mom.

4107
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:55,040
I'll be honest, I don't really remember

4108
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:56,960
that one very well.

4109
03:12:56,960 --> 03:13:00,240
So I'm not sure like, maybe it's a bad example.

4110
03:13:00,240 --> 03:13:01,120
It's just sort of like,

4111
03:13:03,200 --> 03:13:09,520
I feel like I needed to be part of a fan club that is very well versed in Tim Rogers

4112
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:12,880
to get anything out of the things he was saying.

4113
03:13:12,880 --> 03:13:14,000
Because I didn't get it.

4114
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:17,360
I didn't care about anything like he's showing me all his games.

4115
03:13:17,360 --> 03:13:18,080
I'm like, cool.

4116
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:20,000
Where are you going?

4117
03:13:20,480 --> 03:13:24,400
This is not really related to that review.

4118
03:13:24,400 --> 03:13:26,880
It doesn't really reflect on the quality of the video at all.

4119
03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:28,480
But I think in that video,

4120
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:33,280
he mentions that he mentions that Vito Gueswoldy is his friend,

4121
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:36,880
and then he tells Vito that like his house is dirty and he should clean it.

4122
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:38,640
And I don't like Vito Gueswoldy.

4123
03:13:38,640 --> 03:13:40,480
So I think that's a cringe moment.

4124
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:42,480
That's a Tim Rogers L right there.

4125
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:46,080
I knew him look like Monkey Jones was a warning.

4126
03:13:49,840 --> 03:13:51,440
Anyway, I might give it another chance.

4127
03:13:51,440 --> 03:13:53,520
I might give a different video another chance.

4128
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:57,120
I think you should watch the slow translation of Final Fantasy VII,

4129
03:13:57,120 --> 03:13:59,440
aka Let's Mosey, the whole playlist.

4130
03:13:59,440 --> 03:14:00,640
That's a great series.

4131
03:14:01,440 --> 03:14:02,640
That's a very interesting series.

4132
03:14:02,640 --> 03:14:05,680
You learn a lot of Japanese in it.

4133
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:07,200
I hate Japan.

4134
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:09,280
Oh, well, then I guess we're fucked.

4135
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:10,960
I guess it's not going to work.

4136
03:14:10,960 --> 03:14:12,160
He only has seven whole videos.

4137
03:14:12,800 --> 03:14:14,000
How could there be a series?

4138
03:14:14,800 --> 03:14:15,440
Well, that's not it.

4139
03:14:15,440 --> 03:14:16,960
No, those are not here on his channel.

4140
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:19,040
Those other videos were on Kotaku,

4141
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:20,960
because he used to make videos for Kotaku.

4142
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:23,520
Oh, okay.

4143
03:14:23,520 --> 03:14:26,160
Yeah, I've heard of Let's Mosey.

4144
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:28,880
Let's Mosey is not an action button.

4145
03:14:28,880 --> 03:14:30,640
Action button is like his personal channel

4146
03:14:30,640 --> 03:14:32,320
from after he split from Kotaku.

4147
03:14:32,960 --> 03:14:34,560
I listened to like two hours.

4148
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:36,720
That's why people knew this guy before he had a channel

4149
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:38,480
is because he was from Kotaku.

4150
03:14:38,480 --> 03:14:38,720
Yeah.

4151
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:41,520
I listened to like two hours of the

4152
03:14:41,520 --> 03:14:44,960
Tokimeki Memorial video and like, I don't know.

4153
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:48,000
It's I felt like it was talking too much about his own personal life.

4154
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,720
And I mean, he definitely is doing that.

4155
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:52,160
He definitely is doing that.

4156
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:55,680
I just, I guess I'm not sure where's the end point.

4157
03:14:55,680 --> 03:14:58,080
Like, I feel like I already need to be a fan of this guy

4158
03:14:58,080 --> 03:14:59,680
to watch anything he's doing.

4159
03:15:00,240 --> 03:15:02,960
I watched the Tokimeki Memorial video first,

4160
03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:06,320
and I did find it strange and sometimes off-putting,

4161
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:07,760
but I mostly enjoyed it.

4162
03:15:08,400 --> 03:15:12,000
And yeah, and I guess that was my end.

4163
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:15,200
And now I was like, okay.

4164
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:16,720
And then I went back and I watched the other ones,

4165
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:17,520
and I was able to.

4166
03:15:18,480 --> 03:15:24,240
I didn't, I didn't mind the, like, yes, he definitely goes off.

4167
03:15:24,800 --> 03:15:27,920
He's definitely off on a tangent about himself most of the time.

4168
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:29,840
Oh, are we doing, are we doing sight lines?

4169
03:15:29,840 --> 03:15:31,440
Look, he, look, I'm just saying

4170
03:15:32,240 --> 03:15:34,320
this channel is definitely disorganized.

4171
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:35,680
It definitely makes no sense.

4172
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:36,560
It's no cohesion.

4173
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:37,840
Oblivio, what the fuck is this?

4174
03:15:38,720 --> 03:15:40,160
Did you do this last time?

4175
03:15:40,160 --> 03:15:42,320
He's looking in completely the wrong direction.

4176
03:15:44,080 --> 03:15:45,360
These are just incorrect.

4177
03:15:45,360 --> 03:15:46,640
None of his videos are connected.

4178
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:49,200
None of them, like, he never looks at himself.

4179
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:50,560
Only the characters look at him.

4180
03:15:51,200 --> 03:15:52,000
Why do you do this?

4181
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:54,640
Why do you do this?

4182
03:15:55,760 --> 03:15:57,600
These arrows are completely random.

4183
03:15:58,640 --> 03:16:01,040
And you know what's even, when he posts another video,

4184
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:03,200
the arrows are going to point in completely different places,

4185
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:04,400
and it's going to get even worse.

4186
03:16:05,040 --> 03:16:07,280
That's video, they're going to be pointed directly at you.

4187
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:08,960
He's clearly looking in any direction.

4188
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:11,200
He's looking, like, vaguely towards the camera,

4189
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:13,440
and I have to, like, interpret, like, yeah,

4190
03:16:13,440 --> 03:16:16,560
but, like, surely his eyes aren't exactly towards the camera.

4191
03:16:16,960 --> 03:16:18,400
They're, like, 1% up and down,

4192
03:16:18,400 --> 03:16:19,840
and I have to, like, interpret that.

4193
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:20,880
It's really difficult.

4194
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:23,120
I can't tell how genuine you're being right now.

4195
03:16:23,120 --> 03:16:25,600
Okay, but does Tim Rogers hide his dick

4196
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:26,720
when he's posing for pictures,

4197
03:16:26,720 --> 03:16:28,320
or does he put his hands back like it's alpha?

4198
03:16:28,320 --> 03:16:31,680
Okay, there is a really, I honestly, I don't even mind it,

4199
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:33,040
but it's weird to describe it.

4200
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:35,360
There's a section in the Cyberpunk video

4201
03:16:35,360 --> 03:16:36,560
where there's, like, half an hour,

4202
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:39,280
there's fully, like, half an hour of him, like,

4203
03:16:39,280 --> 03:16:42,880
in a white room, like, modeling various, like, jackets,

4204
03:16:42,880 --> 03:16:45,120
and boots, and jeans that he owns.

4205
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:48,640
And he just is, like, doing that for a while,

4206
03:16:48,640 --> 03:16:53,440
and he sort of ties it in to the themes of commercialism

4207
03:16:53,440 --> 03:16:57,440
in Cyberpunk fiction or something, I guess.

4208
03:16:58,160 --> 03:17:01,200
I would like it if he would, like, tighten up his scripts.

4209
03:17:02,080 --> 03:17:03,520
Just say less.

4210
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:08,320
I can't find a picture of Tim Rogers showing his crotch.

4211
03:17:08,960 --> 03:17:10,480
That picture does not exist.

4212
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:12,480
The scripts are not, the scripts are not tight.

4213
03:17:12,480 --> 03:17:14,000
The scripts are anything but tight.

4214
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:15,120
Well.

4215
03:17:15,120 --> 03:17:15,360
But tight.

4216
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:16,880
But tight.

4217
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:21,440
Not like that girl on the horse.

4218
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:23,840
Her butt was anything but tight.

4219
03:17:23,840 --> 03:17:24,560
Hey, I mean.

4220
03:17:24,560 --> 03:17:26,720
Now she was talking about video games.

4221
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:27,520
Now listen.

4222
03:17:27,520 --> 03:17:29,520
Now if her butt was talking about video games,

4223
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:31,040
I'd watch that for six hours.

4224
03:17:31,680 --> 03:17:33,360
The problem is Tim Rogers,

4225
03:17:33,360 --> 03:17:36,160
Tim Rogers isn't enough of a psycho for me to like,

4226
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:38,400
you know, because I'm a big fan of white boys,

4227
03:17:38,400 --> 03:17:40,320
but especially if they're crazy, like Ben.

4228
03:17:40,320 --> 03:17:41,040
Absolutely.

4229
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:41,920
Thank you very much.

4230
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:43,520
Those are the best kind of white boys

4231
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:44,320
that are crazy boys.

4232
03:17:44,320 --> 03:17:46,160
I would say Tim is a little bit quirked up.

4233
03:17:47,360 --> 03:17:49,840
Maybe a little, maybe a little too quirked up.

4234
03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:52,000
He's quirked up, but he's not,

4235
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,400
but he's not busting it down sexual style.

4236
03:17:54,400 --> 03:18:00,000
No, I would not describe him as busting it down sexual style.

4237
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,560
He's quirked up, but not busting it down sexual.

4238
03:18:02,560 --> 03:18:03,680
That's his problem.

4239
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:04,000
You're right.

4240
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:05,120
He's got one, but not the other.

4241
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:05,920
You need both.

4242
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:06,560
You have a point.

4243
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:09,120
Now Donald Trump, now there's a white boy

4244
03:18:09,120 --> 03:18:10,560
who is busting it down sexual style.

4245
03:18:10,560 --> 03:18:12,320
Did you see his physique?

4246
03:18:12,400 --> 03:18:14,320
Did you see his physique in those NFTs?

4247
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:16,800
Did you see he's like, he's like nine heads tall.

4248
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:18,480
He's like nine heads tall in those NFTs.

4249
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:19,920
He looks fantastic.

4250
03:18:19,920 --> 03:18:25,120
He gets nine heads every day from random women.

4251
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:25,280
Yes.

4252
03:18:27,280 --> 03:18:30,000
On Truth Social, I go there and I tweet it.

4253
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:33,600
You're no longer allowed to post about Truth Social on Twitter.

4254
03:18:34,240 --> 03:18:35,040
That's crazy.

4255
03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:39,200
They ban accounts that promote Instagram,

4256
03:18:39,200 --> 03:18:40,720
Truth Social, Mastodon.

4257
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:42,960
They're like, announce this today.

4258
03:18:42,960 --> 03:18:43,680
Instagram.

4259
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:44,560
Yeah, Instagram.

4260
03:18:46,320 --> 03:18:46,960
You see that?

4261
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:48,240
Oh my God, my speech is so free.

4262
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:50,080
Did you see that one?

4263
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:51,200
Comedy is so legal.

4264
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:53,760
You see that couple, half a day,

4265
03:18:53,760 --> 03:18:58,480
where they took off the Spaces feature on Twitter for half a day?

4266
03:19:00,240 --> 03:19:01,040
I'm not sure if we talked about that last week.

4267
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:03,200
We didn't talk specifically about that.

4268
03:19:03,200 --> 03:19:04,400
Was that even the last week?

4269
03:19:04,400 --> 03:19:05,760
I thought it was just a few days ago.

4270
03:19:05,760 --> 03:19:07,120
Just a few days ago.

4271
03:19:07,120 --> 03:19:07,920
Yeah, okay.

4272
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:11,520
He had a Spaces moment where he got a big L,

4273
03:19:12,080 --> 03:19:14,160
he got owned live on stream,

4274
03:19:14,160 --> 03:19:16,800
and then he destroyed the functionality of Spaces.

4275
03:19:18,080 --> 03:19:20,560
I don't know whether literally because he got owned,

4276
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:22,000
but it was very funny that he got owned

4277
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:24,560
and then deactivated that functionality.

4278
03:19:26,880 --> 03:19:29,680
It says, we no longer allow free promotion

4279
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,680
of certain social media platforms.

4280
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:34,320
Specifically, we will remove accounts created solely

4281
03:19:34,320 --> 03:19:36,800
for the purpose of promoting other social platforms

4282
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:40,480
and content that contains links or usernames

4283
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:41,920
for the following platforms.

4284
03:19:41,920 --> 03:19:44,640
Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, TruthSocial,

4285
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:46,400
Tribal, Noster, and Post.

4286
03:19:49,840 --> 03:19:51,360
It sounds like they'll fucking ban you

4287
03:19:51,360 --> 03:19:53,600
if you have your Instagram linked in your bio.

4288
03:19:54,240 --> 03:19:55,120
That's stupid.

4289
03:19:56,080 --> 03:19:58,080
Or even if you just post about it at all.

4290
03:19:58,080 --> 03:20:00,400
I feel like this is not even legal.

4291
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:02,960
I don't know about that.

4292
03:20:03,520 --> 03:20:09,120
It's a level of like, oh, you can't talk about

4293
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:11,760
a competitor's social media website.

4294
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:14,800
Will ban you? Will ban mention of it?

4295
03:20:14,800 --> 03:20:17,600
Like, I feel like there's got to be some law

4296
03:20:17,600 --> 03:20:18,640
that prevents that sort of-

4297
03:20:18,640 --> 03:20:20,080
I don't know if it's illegal, but I think it's-

4298
03:20:20,080 --> 03:20:21,120
And it's a private company.

4299
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:24,000
I think it's bad practice.

4300
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:25,040
Like, you want-

4301
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:27,120
I feel like it's got to be illegal somewhere.

4302
03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:28,480
You want to be interconnected.

4303
03:20:28,480 --> 03:20:31,680
Like in the EU maybe, for like anti-monopoly laws.

4304
03:20:32,480 --> 03:20:36,880
I'm going to start a social media where

4305
03:20:36,880 --> 03:20:37,840
it's like everything free.

4306
03:20:37,840 --> 03:20:39,760
It's the ultimate free speech social media.

4307
03:20:39,760 --> 03:20:42,720
You just cannot talk about my ex-wife's new husband.

4308
03:20:42,720 --> 03:20:44,720
That's the one rule is don't-

4309
03:20:44,720 --> 03:20:45,200
No!

4310
03:20:45,200 --> 03:20:49,920
Anyone who mentions Derek will be banned.

4311
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:54,000
I might not agree with my ex-wife's new husband,

4312
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:57,200
but I will defend to the death your right to talk about him.

4313
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:59,280
No, ban, ban, ban.

4314
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:00,400
Okay, shit.

4315
03:21:00,400 --> 03:21:01,280
Get him out of here!

4316
03:21:01,280 --> 03:21:02,960
Get him out of my social media!

4317
03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:04,480
Get him out!

4318
03:21:04,480 --> 03:21:05,440
Can we get that-

4319
03:21:05,440 --> 03:21:06,160
Yeah.

4320
03:21:06,160 --> 03:21:07,920
Next voicemail is an image.

4321
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:09,520
And it's this.

4322
03:21:09,520 --> 03:21:10,320
This is the image.

4323
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:11,440
Is it-

4324
03:21:11,440 --> 03:21:12,240
Is it you guys making up?

4325
03:21:12,240 --> 03:21:13,120
Was that not posting?

4326
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:14,160
Why is it not posting?

4327
03:21:14,160 --> 03:21:14,720
I don't mind.

4328
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:15,280
I see it.

4329
03:21:17,200 --> 03:21:20,160
Hey, does anyone know who these bitches are?

4330
03:21:22,640 --> 03:21:23,280
Wasn't it like-

4331
03:21:23,280 --> 03:21:24,080
I don't know.

4332
03:21:24,080 --> 03:21:25,200
These big titty bitches?

4333
03:21:25,200 --> 03:21:26,800
Yeah, have you seen these before?

4334
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:28,320
I- I- These are from something,

4335
03:21:28,320 --> 03:21:29,600
and I don't know what it is, but it's somewhere-

4336
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:30,400
Oh, did we not-

4337
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:30,800
Did we not-

4338
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:31,920
Her shirt says,

4339
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:32,960
lesbians are awesome.

4340
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:34,080
Yeah.

4341
03:21:35,520 --> 03:21:36,160
This is, um...

4342
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:40,000
These are from, like, an old webcomic.

4343
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:42,960
And I-

4344
03:21:42,960 --> 03:21:44,640
And I can't remember what it was called.

4345
03:21:44,640 --> 03:21:45,040
This is-

4346
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:46,160
This is kind of awesome.

4347
03:21:46,160 --> 03:21:46,320
Wait a minute.

4348
03:21:46,320 --> 03:21:47,440
They didn't look kind of familiar.

4349
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:48,560
What-

4350
03:21:48,560 --> 03:21:49,040
What is it?

4351
03:21:50,160 --> 03:21:50,400
Is it-

4352
03:21:50,400 --> 03:21:51,120
This must be-

4353
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:51,520
This-

4354
03:21:51,520 --> 03:21:53,600
This must be the, like, Radcon 2.

4355
03:21:53,600 --> 03:21:56,000
This must be, like, Radcon 2 or Ben.

4356
03:21:56,720 --> 03:21:57,120
Um...

4357
03:21:57,120 --> 03:21:59,360
Well, I wish I could remember-

4358
03:21:59,360 --> 03:22:00,320
I- I wish I could remember-

4359
03:22:00,320 --> 03:22:00,960
Shanty Lover.

4360
03:22:00,960 --> 03:22:03,360
What- What is it about my posture here?

4361
03:22:03,360 --> 03:22:03,920
Is this-

4362
03:22:04,960 --> 03:22:05,360
Is this-

4363
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:05,760
Is this-

4364
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:08,080
I feel like this pose is, like, a reference to something.

4365
03:22:08,640 --> 03:22:09,360
Your legs are way too short.

4366
03:22:09,360 --> 03:22:09,760
I think you-

4367
03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:10,560
Your legs are way too short.

4368
03:22:10,560 --> 03:22:12,080
I mean, you're just walking.

4369
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:14,080
Seems like it's clipped from-

4370
03:22:14,080 --> 03:22:15,840
From, like, a Radcon video.

4371
03:22:15,840 --> 03:22:16,640
I do look short.

4372
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:17,280
I don't know.

4373
03:22:17,280 --> 03:22:20,160
Something about this pose just reminds me of something, but-

4374
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:20,720
Is it-

4375
03:22:20,720 --> 03:22:23,360
Is it that Leonardo DiCaprio meme where he's str-

4376
03:22:23,360 --> 03:22:24,320
Striding?

4377
03:22:24,320 --> 03:22:24,720
He's walking?

4378
03:22:24,720 --> 03:22:25,440
No.

4379
03:22:25,440 --> 03:22:26,480
That's from, like, the front.

4380
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:29,680
I mean, if I passed by these in real life,

4381
03:22:29,680 --> 03:22:33,920
yeah, I probably would turn around and look with a big smile on my face.

4382
03:22:33,920 --> 03:22:35,680
That's, like, the worst pants you could wear.

4383
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:37,600
We're seeing big-titty lesbians, I feel.

4384
03:22:37,600 --> 03:22:39,200
Yeah, I- I don't look great.

4385
03:22:39,200 --> 03:22:40,000
I don't look great.

4386
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:40,800
Yeah.

4387
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:43,200
Right, exactly.

4388
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:44,960
Don't look now, but here comes that anti-

4389
03:22:44,960 --> 03:22:46,000
that ant-

4390
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:48,320
ant-gay-lover-nut.

4391
03:22:48,320 --> 03:22:51,840
So, one, the count of three lets me kiss you, like-

4392
03:22:51,840 --> 03:22:52,800
Like, it's our last-

4393
03:22:52,800 --> 03:22:53,680
This is, like, a panel.

4394
03:22:53,680 --> 03:22:55,600
This is, like, an actual quote from the comic.

4395
03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:56,480
I'm convinced.

4396
03:22:56,480 --> 03:22:57,280
Who is this?

4397
03:22:58,080 --> 03:22:59,360
Someone help me-

4398
03:22:59,360 --> 03:23:00,800
Show yourself now.

4399
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:01,120
Yeah.

4400
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:02,880
You want to find the source material.

4401
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:04,240
You want to read it?

4402
03:23:04,240 --> 03:23:06,480
Yeah, I actually do want to read it.

4403
03:23:06,480 --> 03:23:07,360
That's the right-

4404
03:23:07,360 --> 03:23:09,680
We tried to find out on, like, shitty webcomic,

4405
03:23:09,680 --> 03:23:11,840
like, archive things, but we couldn't find it.

4406
03:23:12,560 --> 03:23:12,960
I couldn't.

4407
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:15,520
Is it that obscure?

4408
03:23:15,520 --> 03:23:17,200
Who's sending in the voicemails?

4409
03:23:17,200 --> 03:23:19,600
It's not that obscure because I've seen it on, like,

4410
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:21,200
something awful and stuff before.

4411
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:24,880
Um, I like that.

4412
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:25,440
I want to-

4413
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:26,720
I want to redraw this.

4414
03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:27,440
This looks pretty-

4415
03:23:27,440 --> 03:23:31,120
Do they have a lot of legs or is that a dress?

4416
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:33,440
I think that's full of a dress.

4417
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:36,000
I like to think they got a lot of legs.

4418
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:36,560
They're octopuses.

4419
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:37,520
They're, like, Squidward.

4420
03:23:38,240 --> 03:23:40,000
They could also have that.

4421
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:41,280
One of them is a cat as well.

4422
03:23:41,920 --> 03:23:42,960
One of them is a cat.

4423
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:45,920
I'm not sure why, but-

4424
03:23:45,920 --> 03:23:46,480
Well, why not?

4425
03:23:47,200 --> 03:23:47,520
Yeah.

4426
03:23:47,520 --> 03:23:50,400
And that's, uh, and that's Ben in the corner.

4427
03:23:51,280 --> 03:23:52,160
That's Ben in the corner.

4428
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:56,640
He's in the even more spot, like, losing his dummy worms.

4429
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:58,480
Losing his virginity.

4430
03:23:58,480 --> 03:23:59,760
Losing his virginity.

4431
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:02,480
Okay, that was better.

4432
03:24:02,480 --> 03:24:02,960
I like that one.

4433
03:24:02,960 --> 03:24:04,160
That was better.

4434
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:04,880
Good job, Giv.

4435
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:07,920
It's the next one is a vocaru link.

4436
03:24:07,920 --> 03:24:08,400
Oh, thank you.

4437
03:24:08,400 --> 03:24:09,280
Can you click on that?

4438
03:24:10,560 --> 03:24:11,760
Yeah, I think it's loading.

4439
03:24:11,760 --> 03:24:12,640
Give it a second.

4440
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:16,640
Let me-

4441
03:24:16,640 --> 03:24:19,600
Let me just say, can I just say that, uh,

4442
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:23,440
I was being mean and bullying unique Namasaurus on Twitter earlier,

4443
03:24:23,440 --> 03:24:24,320
and he called-

4444
03:24:24,320 --> 03:24:25,680
He called me an idiologue.

4445
03:24:26,800 --> 03:24:28,640
So, uh, let's kill him.

4446
03:24:29,600 --> 03:24:29,840
Yeah, sure.

4447
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:30,640
He's a log.

4448
03:24:31,360 --> 03:24:32,240
He is a log.

4449
03:24:32,240 --> 03:24:34,320
That reminds me of some other kinds of logs.

4450
03:24:34,320 --> 03:24:35,280
I'm gonna get his ass.

4451
03:24:35,920 --> 03:24:36,800
I think he's-

4452
03:24:36,800 --> 03:24:38,080
I think he's ignoring me.

4453
03:24:38,080 --> 03:24:38,640
I think he's-

4454
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:39,280
I think he's-

4455
03:24:39,280 --> 03:24:40,560
I think he's giving me the brush up.

4456
03:24:41,200 --> 03:24:44,400
I am tempted to watch the short version of his video

4457
03:24:44,400 --> 03:24:47,040
to see if he kept the pan peaks upright in there.

4458
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:49,920
I refuse to watch the shortened version.

4459
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:51,520
I refuse to-

4460
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:53,040
I saw a couple minutes of it,

4461
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:54,480
and it just felt like the longer version,

4462
03:24:54,480 --> 03:24:58,400
but he sped up the audio and only got to the certain points.

4463
03:24:58,400 --> 03:25:00,000
He did add a couple of extra, like,

4464
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:02,640
like in the long version, he goes through, like,

4465
03:25:03,360 --> 03:25:03,920
one at a time.

4466
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:06,640
He goes for every small artist that NFTs helped.

4467
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:08,160
And then this one, he just kind of just says, like,

4468
03:25:08,160 --> 03:25:09,520
oh, it's helped a lot of small artists,

4469
03:25:09,520 --> 03:25:11,040
and then he names a couple of new ones.

4470
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:11,920
That's so smart.

4471
03:25:12,480 --> 03:25:13,520
That's so smart.

4472
03:25:13,520 --> 03:25:14,960
I'm honestly, it's not even-

4473
03:25:15,680 --> 03:25:20,240
It's not even that he's, like, NFTs are okay.

4474
03:25:20,240 --> 03:25:22,480
That's not even why I hate him so much.

4475
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:23,120
It's just-

4476
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:23,840
It's just white.

4477
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:26,400
He's such a fucking nerd and such a fucking dweeb,

4478
03:25:26,400 --> 03:25:27,760
and he thinks he's so smart.

4479
03:25:27,760 --> 03:25:29,920
He thinks he's so smart with his dog shit arguments,

4480
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:31,120
and I just want to kill him.

4481
03:25:31,680 --> 03:25:32,560
I just want to kill him.

4482
03:25:33,360 --> 03:25:34,080
Ah, man.

4483
03:25:34,080 --> 03:25:35,520
I never did that one video.

4484
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:36,160
The-

4485
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:38,320
I watched the eight hour long NFT defense,

4486
03:25:38,320 --> 03:25:39,600
so you don't have to,

4487
03:25:39,600 --> 03:25:41,920
because I was too busy making comics.

4488
03:25:41,920 --> 03:25:42,560
That's right.

4489
03:25:42,560 --> 03:25:43,040
There's better-

4490
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:44,000
There's better things to do.

4491
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:45,920
Better things to do in my time.

4492
03:25:47,520 --> 03:25:50,480
The vocru is still not-

4493
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:51,520
Well, we can-

4494
03:25:51,520 --> 03:25:54,560
I can just say it was sounds of jacking off.

4495
03:25:55,360 --> 03:25:55,920
Oh, okay.

4496
03:25:56,480 --> 03:25:57,280
The vocru is implying-

4497
03:25:57,280 --> 03:25:58,880
It's just 10 minutes of heavy breathing,

4498
03:25:58,880 --> 03:26:00,480
and then pfft at the end.

4499
03:26:00,480 --> 03:26:05,120
The vocru is implying that when gifts post selfies,

4500
03:26:05,120 --> 03:26:09,040
this individual views it as masturbation material.

4501
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:10,000
Oh, I understand.

4502
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:12,800
The vocru is implying that Gibbon take is sex-

4503
03:26:13,760 --> 03:26:15,280
I understand.

4504
03:26:15,280 --> 03:26:19,600
The vocru is implying that Gib looks pretty good.

4505
03:26:19,600 --> 03:26:22,080
Thank you for clarifying.

4506
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:22,640
Thank you for clarifying.

4507
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:24,800
Finger, finger guns, bang, bang, bang.

4508
03:26:25,760 --> 03:26:27,760
Thank you, voice mailer.

4509
03:26:27,760 --> 03:26:29,120
Thank you, kind mailer.

4510
03:26:30,320 --> 03:26:30,720
Thanks.

4511
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:31,200
Please send-

4512
03:26:31,200 --> 03:26:32,320
Please send more.

4513
03:26:32,320 --> 03:26:32,800
Next.

4514
03:26:33,760 --> 03:26:37,760
Next one is Aiden, again, Aiden II.

4515
03:26:37,760 --> 03:26:38,800
Don, it's been a minute long.

4516
03:26:39,760 --> 03:26:41,600
Okay, this one's working for some reason.

4517
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:43,360
Okay, three, two, one, go.

4518
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:45,200
Hey, this is Aiden.

4519
03:26:45,200 --> 03:26:47,280
I'm reporting from Cop Kill Town right now.

4520
03:26:49,440 --> 03:26:54,640
I learned to mine sweeper just so I could kill rowdies.

4521
03:26:56,400 --> 03:26:57,600
Is that gonna be a nerd?

4522
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:59,520
I have 20 million slime right now.

4523
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:01,200
I'm aiming for 30 million.

4524
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:02,400
Damn, this guy's actually playing the game.

4525
03:27:02,400 --> 03:27:06,640
I actually learned how to play mine sweeper properly.

4526
03:27:06,640 --> 03:27:07,520
This guy's mining.

4527
03:27:07,520 --> 03:27:08,640
Just so I could do this.

4528
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:11,600
Does that make me like an idiot?

4529
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:12,080
Yeah.

4530
03:27:12,080 --> 03:27:13,200
Does it make me like a nerd or something?

4531
03:27:13,200 --> 03:27:14,320
Yeah, definitely.

4532
03:27:14,320 --> 03:27:14,800
Or what?

4533
03:27:15,760 --> 03:27:17,040
But, you know, the base kind of idiot.

4534
03:27:17,040 --> 03:27:18,560
This is the petty that I learned to skill

4535
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:20,560
just to focus on other people?

4536
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:20,800
No.

4537
03:27:22,720 --> 03:27:26,000
Also, bullying Ben because I'm a killer and I have to.

4538
03:27:27,840 --> 03:27:28,640
He's struggling.

4539
03:27:29,280 --> 03:27:33,040
Ben, you got wet willies in class

4540
03:27:33,040 --> 03:27:34,560
and you didn't even tell the teacher

4541
03:27:34,560 --> 03:27:38,000
because you were so scared of stepping into the class.

4542
03:27:38,160 --> 03:27:38,960
It's true.

4543
03:27:38,960 --> 03:27:39,600
You just let it happen.

4544
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:40,160
It's true.

4545
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:42,880
You got an ear infection and it really hurt

4546
03:27:43,440 --> 03:27:44,880
and you still don't do anything about it.

4547
03:27:45,440 --> 03:27:46,320
How'd you know about that?

4548
03:27:46,960 --> 03:27:47,600
Fuck you.

4549
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:48,400
That's Ben now.

4550
03:27:48,960 --> 03:27:49,120
Okay.

4551
03:27:49,760 --> 03:27:51,440
You too have a good podcast.

4552
03:27:51,440 --> 03:27:51,840
Bye.

4553
03:27:51,840 --> 03:27:53,600
And if there's a guest, you also have fun.

4554
03:27:53,600 --> 03:27:54,320
Bye.

4555
03:27:54,320 --> 03:27:54,960
Well, deadly.

4556
03:27:55,680 --> 03:27:56,560
Oh, wow.

4557
03:27:56,560 --> 03:27:58,480
I was expecting that.

4558
03:27:58,480 --> 03:28:00,240
He wished you have a good podcast.

4559
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:03,120
His wish came true.

4560
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:03,440
Yay.

4561
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:04,560
Yay.

4562
03:28:06,400 --> 03:28:09,840
This guy, you know, does it?

4563
03:28:09,840 --> 03:28:14,160
It's no, it's not dumb to learn new skill to fuck with people.

4564
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:15,840
That's what you do in any.

4565
03:28:15,840 --> 03:28:17,360
That's what I do with Pokemon.

4566
03:28:17,360 --> 03:28:19,440
They go on showdown and I learned the skills.

4567
03:28:19,440 --> 03:28:22,560
I learned how to learn to type matchups and move sets

4568
03:28:22,560 --> 03:28:26,400
just so I could just so I could own noobs on showdown.

4569
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:29,520
What are the reasons there to get good at something?

4570
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:30,160
I can't.

4571
03:28:30,160 --> 03:28:31,120
I can't think of one.

4572
03:28:32,240 --> 03:28:33,040
Yeah, I get.

4573
03:28:33,120 --> 03:28:33,840
I guess just to.

4574
03:28:35,520 --> 03:28:39,760
I only draw Clarissa Gunsmoke so that I can take over Japan.

4575
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:40,480
That's not true.

4576
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:42,080
Colonize it.

4577
03:28:42,080 --> 03:28:43,280
We're colonizing, baby.

4578
03:28:44,160 --> 03:28:44,400
Yeah.

4579
03:28:44,400 --> 03:28:47,440
And what is colonizing if not pawning a bunch of noobs?

4580
03:28:47,440 --> 03:28:47,920
Did you see?

4581
03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:48,720
Did you see?

4582
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:52,640
Did you see what Cameron the fucking, what's his name?

4583
03:28:52,640 --> 03:28:54,720
Um, Avatar man.

4584
03:28:54,720 --> 03:28:55,600
James Cameron.

4585
03:28:55,600 --> 03:28:56,720
Did you see what James Cameron,

4586
03:28:56,720 --> 03:28:59,760
did you see what James Cameron said about the Native Americans?

4587
03:28:59,760 --> 03:29:01,040
About the Lakota.

4588
03:29:01,040 --> 03:29:01,600
What did he say?

4589
03:29:01,600 --> 03:29:02,640
About the Lakota people.

4590
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:06,720
He said like in an interview, he's it's so fucking amazing.

4591
03:29:06,720 --> 03:29:10,160
He said like, yeah, this story reminds me of like the Lakota

4592
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:13,520
and how the Lakota were wiped out by like the white man.

4593
03:29:13,520 --> 03:29:17,120
And now like looking, looking at like how completely

4594
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:20,080
their culture has been devastated and wiped out by that event.

4595
03:29:20,080 --> 03:29:23,120
You know, I think if they knew what would eventually become of them,

4596
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:26,720
I think they would have fought a little harder than they did back then.

4597
03:29:26,720 --> 03:29:28,960
Like I think they would have tried harder if they'd known

4598
03:29:28,960 --> 03:29:30,800
they would get this fucked over by it.

4599
03:29:30,800 --> 03:29:31,680
What the fuck?

4600
03:29:31,760 --> 03:29:36,240
It's so, I know, like why the fuck, why the fuck would you say that?

4601
03:29:36,240 --> 03:29:40,720
I thought you were like here because you like liked Native peoples

4602
03:29:40,720 --> 03:29:44,160
and were like, hey, let's sort of adapt a story about them

4603
03:29:44,160 --> 03:29:45,440
into a cool movie.

4604
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:47,520
Why would you say something so fucked up?

4605
03:29:47,520 --> 03:29:49,760
I thought it was going to, I was going to joke like,

4606
03:29:49,760 --> 03:29:51,840
oh, maybe they should have tried being blue

4607
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:53,440
and then weird like gossip and say,

4608
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:54,480
ooh, and like leave them alone.

4609
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:56,080
That's probably what he thinks.

4610
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:57,840
That's what he said.

4611
03:29:57,840 --> 03:30:00,320
I know I know that he's saying, I know that he's,

4612
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:06,400
I know that like he's trying to express like a pro Native opinion there.

4613
03:30:06,400 --> 03:30:08,960
Like he wants, he wishes they had not been wiped out

4614
03:30:08,960 --> 03:30:10,880
and like, I guess that's cool, but come on.

4615
03:30:11,760 --> 03:30:13,360
They would have shown harder.

4616
03:30:13,360 --> 03:30:14,720
They should have fought harder.

4617
03:30:14,720 --> 03:30:15,840
Get out of here.

4618
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:16,960
Jesus Christ.

4619
03:30:16,960 --> 03:30:18,080
What a clown.

4620
03:30:18,080 --> 03:30:18,800
Come on.

4621
03:30:18,800 --> 03:30:19,200
Come on.

4622
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:20,240
That being said.

4623
03:30:20,240 --> 03:30:21,440
Come on, come on, Jimmy.

4624
03:30:21,440 --> 03:30:22,640
Come on, Jimmy.

4625
03:30:22,640 --> 03:30:23,760
Do a little better.

4626
03:30:23,760 --> 03:30:27,520
That being said, don't forget to catch Avatar Way of the Water

4627
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:29,120
only in cinema right now.

4628
03:30:29,840 --> 03:30:30,720
Right.

4629
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:34,400
I genuinely don't understand why like I'm seeing people

4630
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:36,960
seeming like they're unironically hype for this movie.

4631
03:30:36,960 --> 03:30:37,680
I don't get it.

4632
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:39,040
Yeah, I don't get it at all.

4633
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:40,960
Are we being Morbius again?

4634
03:30:40,960 --> 03:30:42,080
Is this another Morbius?

4635
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:43,680
I actually did see it.

4636
03:30:43,680 --> 03:30:45,280
I saw an early screening of it.

4637
03:30:45,280 --> 03:30:46,560
I got free tickets.

4638
03:30:46,560 --> 03:30:46,640
Why?

4639
03:30:46,640 --> 03:30:49,760
Is it like amazing or is it just like one of the movies?

4640
03:30:49,760 --> 03:30:50,720
Because I wanted to.

4641
03:30:50,720 --> 03:30:53,760
Because, because James Cameron's never misses

4642
03:30:53,760 --> 03:30:56,000
when it comes to film, when it comes to cinema.

4643
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:57,520
I didn't like Avatar.

4644
03:30:57,520 --> 03:30:58,960
I didn't, yeah, I didn't really care.

4645
03:30:58,960 --> 03:31:00,400
I didn't care about it when I saw it.

4646
03:31:00,400 --> 03:31:05,840
I thought like the cultural thing with Avatar is like,

4647
03:31:05,840 --> 03:31:07,840
oh, such special effects.

4648
03:31:07,840 --> 03:31:10,880
And then because it wasn't like a very interesting story,

4649
03:31:10,880 --> 03:31:12,960
it sort of faded out of relevance.

4650
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:15,680
And then he said, I'm going to make 100,000 more sequels.

4651
03:31:15,680 --> 03:31:16,640
And that was like a joke.

4652
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:19,760
Like that was funny that he said he was going to do that.

4653
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:23,680
And then the second movie comes out and people are loving it,

4654
03:31:24,240 --> 03:31:24,880
which I guess is.

4655
03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:27,200
It actually is better than the first one.

4656
03:31:27,200 --> 03:31:27,920
I'll tell you that much.

4657
03:31:27,920 --> 03:31:29,040
It actually is better.

4658
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:29,440
I don't know.

4659
03:31:29,440 --> 03:31:32,400
I just think people did really love the first one.

4660
03:31:32,400 --> 03:31:36,800
Like people were like crazy about it for like a short while.

4661
03:31:36,800 --> 03:31:37,840
For that summer.

4662
03:31:37,840 --> 03:31:38,640
Yeah, like, yeah.

4663
03:31:38,640 --> 03:31:39,840
For that summer, of course.

4664
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:42,560
I'm not specifying a percentage of the population,

4665
03:31:42,560 --> 03:31:43,680
but they were definitely,

4666
03:31:44,320 --> 03:31:47,840
but I just remember hearing people raving about it for like

4667
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:50,320
a couple months and then everyone was just quiet.

4668
03:31:50,320 --> 03:31:52,880
It was like a big, it was like a big movie of the summer

4669
03:31:52,880 --> 03:31:54,160
of that year or whatever.

4670
03:31:54,160 --> 03:31:54,880
And that's cool.

4671
03:31:54,880 --> 03:31:56,160
It made a bunch of money, fair enough.

4672
03:31:56,160 --> 03:31:58,000
But yeah, nobody talks about it anymore.

4673
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:01,600
And I don't, I thought it was it was sort of a joke.

4674
03:32:01,600 --> 03:32:04,720
And then, but then I see that they announced the sequel.

4675
03:32:04,720 --> 03:32:07,680
And I see all this unironic like, oh, James,

4676
03:32:07,680 --> 03:32:08,720
oh, the movies are back.

4677
03:32:08,720 --> 03:32:09,920
Oh, we're back, baby.

4678
03:32:09,920 --> 03:32:13,280
Like big blockbusters are back and I can't wait to go to the movie theater.

4679
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:14,720
They're gonna get baby.

4680
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:15,200
Why?

4681
03:32:15,200 --> 03:32:16,240
I don't get it.

4682
03:32:16,800 --> 03:32:20,000
Why not watch my dinner with Andre and talk about what a piece of shit

4683
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:21,280
Wallace Sean is.

4684
03:32:21,280 --> 03:32:23,920
Like that's way more interesting in my opinion.

4685
03:32:24,560 --> 03:32:26,480
Because there's no blue people in that.

4686
03:32:26,480 --> 03:32:27,280
I hate.

4687
03:32:27,280 --> 03:32:27,680
There is.

4688
03:32:27,680 --> 03:32:28,640
There's a blue minotaur.

4689
03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:29,680
There's a blue minotaur.

4690
03:32:31,120 --> 03:32:34,400
There's a blue minotaur that Andre hallucinates when he's in church.

4691
03:32:36,480 --> 03:32:38,400
It's described in monologue.

4692
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:41,200
Yeah, there's no special effects.

4693
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:45,760
Yeah, but way the way of water is better than the first one.

4694
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:48,320
I get this vibe watching because I saw it,

4695
03:32:48,320 --> 03:32:53,680
but I get this vibe that like I do want him to make all six of these.

4696
03:32:53,680 --> 03:32:55,040
Avatar movies.

4697
03:32:55,040 --> 03:32:56,240
Is that the plan six?

4698
03:32:56,240 --> 03:32:57,120
Yeah, six of them.

4699
03:32:57,120 --> 03:32:58,240
That's the plan.

4700
03:32:58,240 --> 03:33:01,040
And I get the vibe that by the sixth film,

4701
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:03,600
they won't even like look the same as the first one.

4702
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:07,760
Like what's ever going on in the first one will not matter in the sixth.

4703
03:33:07,760 --> 03:33:10,000
Haven't they like already filmed a bunch of them?

4704
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:14,480
He's written the scripts all the way to part like five, I think.

4705
03:33:14,480 --> 03:33:18,720
And I think the rumor goes that the fifth one is like five hours long.

4706
03:33:19,600 --> 03:33:23,120
And the fucking executives like didn't have no notes

4707
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:25,680
or didn't tell him to cut out anything out of the movie.

4708
03:33:28,320 --> 03:33:35,040
It's funny in like a like that you don't see that happening that much.

4709
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:36,160
I guess he has the cloud.

4710
03:33:36,880 --> 03:33:40,960
I kind of would like to see it happen just because it's such so odd.

4711
03:33:40,960 --> 03:33:45,280
The movie kind of feels like like you ever written like a you ever like in your head.

4712
03:33:45,840 --> 03:33:49,200
And I feel like all like artists or storytellers have had this in their head

4713
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:52,320
where they like written like a very long epic saga in their head.

4714
03:33:53,120 --> 03:33:56,800
And they're all like, yeah, I know I know at the beginning like part one is kind of

4715
03:33:56,800 --> 03:34:01,200
is going to be kind of boring compared to all the epic shit that happens in the middle.

4716
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:05,440
But I have to go for part one to eventually get you to the to the kick ass shit in the middle.

4717
03:34:06,160 --> 03:34:08,400
That's like the vibe I'm getting from this series.

4718
03:34:10,880 --> 03:34:14,960
So was it going to be like the the first one they fly around so they're like

4719
03:34:14,960 --> 03:34:16,080
or maybe they're in the forest.

4720
03:34:16,080 --> 03:34:18,960
So it's like forest navi this one way of water.

4721
03:34:18,960 --> 03:34:22,400
Are they going to be like dirt like mole navi in one of them?

4722
03:34:22,400 --> 03:34:27,280
Well, well, maybe I feel like the slime and navi in the swamp.

4723
03:34:27,280 --> 03:34:28,880
They're going to be swamp level in the third one.

4724
03:34:28,880 --> 03:34:30,320
They're going to go like full magic.

4725
03:34:30,320 --> 03:34:33,920
There's like some fucking magic shit happening in the second one.

4726
03:34:33,920 --> 03:34:34,720
They're going to make it.

4727
03:34:34,720 --> 03:34:36,400
It's going to become World of Warcraft.

4728
03:34:37,360 --> 03:34:38,000
That'd be cool.

4729
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:40,880
But it's the well of life.

4730
03:34:41,440 --> 03:34:46,480
I also like how like casually they drop like sci-fi concepts throughout the film.

4731
03:34:46,480 --> 03:34:49,520
Like, do you remember the bad guy in the first movie?

4732
03:34:49,520 --> 03:34:51,200
There was like that white military guy.

4733
03:34:51,840 --> 03:34:54,720
The guy who's like, we got to get that unobtainium.

4734
03:34:54,720 --> 03:34:55,760
Yeah, yeah, that guy.

4735
03:34:55,760 --> 03:34:57,920
So so he comes back, actually.

4736
03:34:59,360 --> 03:35:06,880
Because even though he died, he comes back because they put his memories into a navi

4737
03:35:06,880 --> 03:35:09,120
like clone body that they made for him.

4738
03:35:09,120 --> 03:35:11,280
So that's how he comes back, right?

4739
03:35:11,840 --> 03:35:16,480
And there's this kind of there's this like fucking very interesting scene where like

4740
03:35:16,480 --> 03:35:20,800
they go to the site where his old body died and he picks up like his own skull.

4741
03:35:20,880 --> 03:35:21,920
He's like looking at it.

4742
03:35:21,920 --> 03:35:24,880
And it's like it's crazy how good the fuck.

4743
03:35:24,880 --> 03:35:26,240
And that's another thing that's great about the film.

4744
03:35:26,240 --> 03:35:29,920
It's crazy how good the fucking CGI is and how much like they fucking like emote.

4745
03:35:30,640 --> 03:35:35,200
Just like you really like and a lot of other things like you don't get like a good

4746
03:35:35,200 --> 03:35:37,680
performance out of people who are completely CGI.

4747
03:35:37,680 --> 03:35:42,640
But with like with the Avatar movies, like you really like feel the fucking range

4748
03:35:42,640 --> 03:35:44,400
coming out of these actors for these.

4749
03:35:44,400 --> 03:35:46,160
I mean, it's a digital.

4750
03:35:46,880 --> 03:35:52,480
So yeah, they usually are the fucking goats of anything CGI.

4751
03:35:52,960 --> 03:35:58,240
Yeah, I think also to I get the vibe that like if it is kind of an element,

4752
03:35:58,240 --> 03:36:01,200
it is kind of a meme to be like, oh, this is a masterpiece.

4753
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:03,200
It is kind of it's like half that.

4754
03:36:03,200 --> 03:36:07,840
But the other half is kind of like, when was the last time we got like a home grown

4755
03:36:07,840 --> 03:36:12,480
like franchise series that isn't based on like preexisting media, you know?

4756
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:17,520
Yeah, like all the MCU is built on like crutches.

4757
03:36:18,160 --> 03:36:21,680
And each each movie feels like factory made.

4758
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:25,840
It's like you're eating a bag of chips every time you watch an MCU movie.

4759
03:36:26,640 --> 03:36:31,040
But with Avatar, it feels like this is just one like millionaires crazy.

4760
03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:35,120
Like in an alternate universe, Avatar would have been some sort of like sci-fi series,

4761
03:36:35,120 --> 03:36:38,000
like a sci-fi book series like made in the 90s.

4762
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:42,960
But in our universe, it's like, oh, this crazy like millionaire director who has like.

4763
03:36:43,600 --> 03:36:47,440
Yeah, the guy who made Titanic and made so much money off of that that you could do

4764
03:36:47,440 --> 03:36:54,400
whatever he wanted, had an idea that would have otherwise been a smaller scale project.

4765
03:36:54,400 --> 03:36:55,280
Yeah, I get it.

4766
03:36:55,280 --> 03:37:00,640
Like people say the story about like, like people say that bullshit story about like George Lucas

4767
03:37:00,640 --> 03:37:05,520
being like, oh, yeah, he wrote all the Star Wars out and he knew he knew he only had like

4768
03:37:05,520 --> 03:37:09,440
enough funds to start in the middle with with with a new hope.

4769
03:37:09,440 --> 03:37:11,840
Which is nobody does anyone actually believe.

4770
03:37:11,840 --> 03:37:12,560
Yeah, I met people.

4771
03:37:12,560 --> 03:37:15,840
I met people who say that I met people who want to ironically say that shit.

4772
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:17,840
Believe me, I've met motherfuckers.

4773
03:37:17,840 --> 03:37:21,920
So so but this this avatar feels like that.

4774
03:37:21,920 --> 03:37:24,480
But like real like, no, this is the guy actually did that.

4775
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:30,320
Yeah, which is why like he waited so fucking long because he was like out there charting.

4776
03:37:30,320 --> 03:37:34,240
And then he does like real life, like real crazy shit, you know,

4777
03:37:34,240 --> 03:37:37,520
he's kind of like James Cameron is kind of like over to compare him to a fictional character.

4778
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:39,840
He's kind of like Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh.

4779
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:47,360
Have you read that post about how like Kaiba is like the most real depiction of a billionaire?

4780
03:37:48,320 --> 03:37:51,120
It's a time where it becomes that's what I kind of mean.

4781
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:52,560
Like he becomes obsessed with that.

4782
03:37:52,560 --> 03:37:54,720
I know that we'll post you're talking about the other.

4783
03:37:54,720 --> 03:37:58,800
Yeah, the one that's like the thing about Kaiba is realistic depiction of a billionaire

4784
03:37:58,800 --> 03:38:05,120
because he his literally his whole thing is that he has all this money and he could do anything with

4785
03:38:05,120 --> 03:38:06,160
it. He could help the poor.

4786
03:38:06,160 --> 03:38:09,280
He could like he could do, you know, make space travel.

4787
03:38:09,280 --> 03:38:12,960
He could, you know, reinvent, you know, healthcare or whatever.

4788
03:38:12,960 --> 03:38:18,800
But he just chooses to spend it all on ridiculous hologram technology designed for playing card

4789
03:38:18,800 --> 03:38:21,280
games because he just loves card games that much.

4790
03:38:21,280 --> 03:38:25,920
He's just he's shaping the whole culture of his world with his massive wealth around building

4791
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:31,680
all this technological infrastructure devised to facilitate the playing of children's card games

4792
03:38:31,680 --> 03:38:33,520
because that's just what he likes.

4793
03:38:33,520 --> 03:38:36,880
And he's just going to fucking do it and no one can tell him he can't.

4794
03:38:37,520 --> 03:38:41,600
Yeah, that's James Cameron with this series.

4795
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:42,320
Amazing.

4796
03:38:42,320 --> 03:38:47,840
And I think I was going to say all the like critiques people have about like the the the

4797
03:38:47,840 --> 03:38:51,520
movie like oh it's white saviorism blah blah blah all this stuff.

4798
03:38:51,520 --> 03:38:52,240
I agree with it.

4799
03:38:52,240 --> 03:38:55,520
I think yeah yeah like if you give me like a take that's like that I'll agree with it.

4800
03:38:55,920 --> 03:39:00,400
That being said, I think the one thing that makes me like not hate the series for that

4801
03:39:00,400 --> 03:39:02,800
is because it doesn't feel like malicious.

4802
03:39:03,520 --> 03:39:06,960
You know, like it doesn't feel like he's he's making a statement about oh yeah,

4803
03:39:06,960 --> 03:39:11,840
this you know why people do it better like no that just kind of like accidental.

4804
03:39:12,640 --> 03:39:19,520
Well, yeah, yeah, I'm I'm sure that Cameron has like all the it seems like he at least has

4805
03:39:19,520 --> 03:39:24,080
like his heart in the right place with like he wants to show these like you know indigenous

4806
03:39:24,080 --> 03:39:29,120
people as like you know good and like they should be there.

4807
03:39:29,120 --> 03:39:32,560
You know, they're the heroes of the movie that you're supposed to root for them in there.

4808
03:39:32,560 --> 03:39:39,360
I and I think I think another funny thing is that the movie has like five different degrees of like

4809
03:39:39,360 --> 03:39:43,280
race mixing in the movie because it's like okay.

4810
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:48,160
So like Jake Sully, he's like he was human and at the end of avatar they fully put his like

4811
03:39:48,720 --> 03:39:50,960
mind inside his avatar body, right?

4812
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:52,640
So he's like completely Navi, right?

4813
03:39:53,120 --> 03:39:53,840
Yeah.

4814
03:39:53,840 --> 03:40:00,480
And he but also his his like Navi his Navi body was also it has some of his like DNA in it

4815
03:40:00,480 --> 03:40:03,520
because that's like it's his brother's DNA, right?

4816
03:40:03,520 --> 03:40:04,880
Like yeah, yeah, out of his brother.

4817
03:40:04,880 --> 03:40:05,360
Yeah.

4818
03:40:05,360 --> 03:40:05,600
Yeah.

4819
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:05,760
Yeah.

4820
03:40:05,760 --> 03:40:09,120
So so he has he has a little bit of human in him.

4821
03:40:09,120 --> 03:40:13,680
So when he has kids with Zoa Sildana's like Navi,

4822
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:20,320
their kids like look like their face look like Navi, but they have an extra finger like a human.

4823
03:40:21,040 --> 03:40:21,280
Right.

4824
03:40:22,080 --> 03:40:28,080
And then later there and then also in their family, the Sigourney, I don't know if you remember

4825
03:40:28,080 --> 03:40:30,080
the Sigourney Weaver character from the first one.

4826
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:31,120
She was like a scientist.

4827
03:40:31,120 --> 03:40:32,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4828
03:40:32,400 --> 03:40:37,760
She she at the end of avatar one, like it shows that she's like dying.

4829
03:40:37,760 --> 03:40:41,120
So they put her mind in her Navi body like right at the end.

4830
03:40:41,760 --> 03:40:47,840
And then in the sequel, it turns out that it worked but it put her Navi body in a coma, right?

4831
03:40:47,840 --> 03:40:49,440
So she's been in a coma this whole time.

4832
03:40:50,000 --> 03:40:56,560
But in her coma, she was pregnant in her Navi body and they don't know they don't know how

4833
03:40:56,560 --> 03:40:57,600
the pregnancy happened.

4834
03:40:57,600 --> 03:41:01,600
They assume it's like fucking magic or something and her daughter and she has like a daughter.

4835
03:41:02,640 --> 03:41:06,080
She has like a Navi daughter out of her like Navi body, right?

4836
03:41:06,080 --> 03:41:09,920
But the thing that's kind of interesting, the thing that's kind of interesting is that her

4837
03:41:09,920 --> 03:41:15,280
Navi daughter, her face, like she doesn't have like that flat like cat nose that all the Navis

4838
03:41:15,280 --> 03:41:15,440
has.

4839
03:41:15,440 --> 03:41:18,480
She has like a human nose, but she's like still blue and everything, right?

4840
03:41:18,480 --> 03:41:23,920
So this is like, so this is like a different degree of mixed race than like a jake-like-

4841
03:41:23,920 --> 03:41:28,640
Did like a human impregnate her mostly Navi, like the human body?

4842
03:41:28,640 --> 03:41:30,320
That's like, that's like, they don't know.

4843
03:41:30,880 --> 03:41:33,600
It's never explained in the movie, but that's like, I guess one of the mysteries.

4844
03:41:34,320 --> 03:41:38,800
And later it's showing that her daughter has like a weird magical ability, right?

4845
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:45,120
Like she like later it's revealed that she doesn't need to like connect her like little ponytail

4846
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:47,600
to other animals to like control it.

4847
03:41:47,600 --> 03:41:48,400
She could just do it.

4848
03:41:48,400 --> 03:41:50,240
Like she has like a psychic ability to do it.

4849
03:41:50,880 --> 03:41:51,520
Right?

4850
03:41:51,520 --> 03:41:55,120
And it's like connected to like the world tree that connects like her whole planet, right?

4851
03:41:55,760 --> 03:42:01,040
And then another thing is that it turns out that after the war, after the war in the first movie,

4852
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:05,920
there was like still like a baby human there left on that planet that they were raising.

4853
03:42:05,920 --> 03:42:09,840
And they couldn't, they couldn't send that baby human back to Earth because you should,

4854
03:42:09,840 --> 03:42:12,320
you're, you can't put babies in cryostasis.

4855
03:42:13,200 --> 03:42:15,120
That's not, that's not good for a fucking baby.

4856
03:42:15,120 --> 03:42:16,800
I think that makes, that makes sense.

4857
03:42:16,800 --> 03:42:17,120
Right.

4858
03:42:17,120 --> 03:42:18,880
So, so the baby is, wait, hold up.

4859
03:42:18,880 --> 03:42:23,920
The baby is raised on Pandora and the baby is raised with a bunch of Navi, right?

4860
03:42:23,920 --> 03:42:28,720
And he's like a human like, he's like a human white boy with dreadlocks and his name is spider.

4861
03:42:28,720 --> 03:42:30,000
That's like his fucking name.

4862
03:42:30,640 --> 03:42:30,960
Right?

4863
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:31,520
That's it.

4864
03:42:31,520 --> 03:42:35,600
It's all these weird degrees of like fucking like race, race.

4865
03:42:35,600 --> 03:42:35,840
Yeah.

4866
03:42:35,840 --> 03:42:38,960
Cause they also have a friend who's like, he's like, he's like,

4867
03:42:38,960 --> 03:42:40,960
he shaped like a ball and he's bright green.

4868
03:42:41,920 --> 03:42:42,720
In the new one?

4869
03:42:43,520 --> 03:42:44,320
Yeah.

4870
03:42:44,320 --> 03:42:45,840
He's literally like, he's like a circle.

4871
03:42:45,840 --> 03:42:46,720
He's like got a circle.

4872
03:42:46,720 --> 03:42:48,160
He's got like a spherical body.

4873
03:42:48,160 --> 03:42:49,360
He's bright green.

4874
03:42:49,360 --> 03:42:50,000
Oh, wait.

4875
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:50,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4876
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:51,520
Oh, wait.

4877
03:42:51,520 --> 03:42:52,000
I get it.

4878
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:52,400
It's just like.

4879
03:42:53,920 --> 03:42:54,240
Yeah.

4880
03:42:54,240 --> 03:42:55,680
Oh, I love Avatar actually.

4881
03:42:57,680 --> 03:42:58,880
Actually Avatar based.

4882
03:42:59,760 --> 03:43:00,160
All right.

4883
03:43:00,160 --> 03:43:02,160
Look at that CGI of it.

4884
03:43:02,160 --> 03:43:06,000
And that's like everything I explained is only like one fifth of the film.

4885
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:09,200
Dude, I can't believe they make whole movies in the computer now.

4886
03:43:11,120 --> 03:43:12,720
Should we move, go to the next voicemail?

4887
03:43:12,720 --> 03:43:15,280
Next, next voice fail is an image.

4888
03:43:15,280 --> 03:43:16,320
Did you say voice fail?

4889
03:43:16,960 --> 03:43:17,280
Yeah.

4890
03:43:17,280 --> 03:43:19,360
Oh, I mean, voice fail.

4891
03:43:20,080 --> 03:43:21,360
It is image here.

4892
03:43:22,800 --> 03:43:26,080
And this is, I think, I think this is true as hell.

4893
03:43:27,440 --> 03:43:29,920
I wish that my computer worked.

4894
03:43:29,920 --> 03:43:31,600
I hope that it will load.

4895
03:43:32,720 --> 03:43:36,560
Well, I'll describe it for the, the people who aren't looking,

4896
03:43:36,560 --> 03:43:37,600
such as Ben St.

4897
03:43:39,040 --> 03:43:39,680
Ben St.

4898
03:43:40,480 --> 03:43:43,360
tears off the calendar for December 2022.

4899
03:43:43,360 --> 03:43:46,000
Underneath January 1984.

4900
03:43:46,640 --> 03:43:48,000
The woman is me.

4901
03:43:48,000 --> 03:43:50,880
I've got my name Gib on my shirt.

4902
03:43:50,880 --> 03:43:54,400
And I'm saying, whoa, they edited Munchie to look like a Nazi.

4903
03:43:54,400 --> 03:43:56,000
We can't show this on screen.

4904
03:43:58,320 --> 03:43:59,360
And it's true.

4905
03:44:00,160 --> 03:44:01,120
That's what I said.

4906
03:44:01,120 --> 03:44:02,000
That is what you said.

4907
03:44:03,680 --> 03:44:06,720
And I said, oh, no, political.

4908
03:44:06,720 --> 03:44:07,840
It's 1984.

4909
03:44:07,840 --> 03:44:08,960
This is 1984.

4910
03:44:09,680 --> 03:44:10,480
That's right.

4911
03:44:10,480 --> 03:44:11,200
Okay.

4912
03:44:11,200 --> 03:44:12,240
That seems true.

4913
03:44:12,240 --> 03:44:13,200
It seems true to life.

4914
03:44:14,560 --> 03:44:15,280
I can't see it.

4915
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:18,720
You can't see it, but I can imagine it crystal clear.

4916
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:20,800
Show me the next one.

4917
03:44:21,440 --> 03:44:25,520
Next one is, why do you, it's just a no, no voice.

4918
03:44:25,520 --> 03:44:26,160
Just a question.

4919
03:44:26,160 --> 03:44:28,480
Why do you act like a maniac on Twitter?

4920
03:44:29,520 --> 03:44:31,040
I assume they're talking to you, Ben.

4921
03:44:31,680 --> 03:44:32,560
What do I act like?

4922
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:33,760
How do I act like a maniac?

4923
03:44:34,800 --> 03:44:35,280
I don't know.

4924
03:44:36,800 --> 03:44:39,520
I'm not, I'm just, I'm just mean to people that I don't like.

4925
03:44:39,520 --> 03:44:40,640
That's normal.

4926
03:44:40,640 --> 03:44:41,280
That's normal.

4927
03:44:41,280 --> 03:44:42,320
That's a normal thing to do.

4928
03:44:42,320 --> 03:44:45,360
You attack innocent YouTubers like you name a source.

4929
03:44:45,360 --> 03:44:45,920
I'm normal.

4930
03:44:45,920 --> 03:44:46,960
I'm the only normal one.

4931
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:49,600
If you think I'm the maniac, that means there's something wrong with you.

4932
03:44:49,600 --> 03:44:50,080
I'm sorry.

4933
03:44:50,880 --> 03:44:52,560
I'm sorry, but you have to get a grip.

4934
03:44:53,120 --> 03:44:54,480
You have to get a grip, my dude.

4935
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:59,520
Did a Stereo's Coconut compliment you on being a maniac on Twitter?

4936
03:44:59,520 --> 03:45:01,520
Like you said, that's what he liked about you.

4937
03:45:01,520 --> 03:45:02,160
He did.

4938
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:04,320
I think he was just being nice.

4939
03:45:05,200 --> 03:45:10,320
I think he, I think, I think he was being, I think he was being diplomatic.

4940
03:45:11,280 --> 03:45:11,520
Nice.

4941
03:45:12,400 --> 03:45:13,680
Which I'll take it, you know.

4942
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:15,520
How do you?

4943
03:45:18,240 --> 03:45:21,760
I hope people watch that stream I was on with the Stereo's because that was actually really fun.

4944
03:45:21,760 --> 03:45:22,960
I was really funny.

4945
03:45:22,960 --> 03:45:26,960
It was actually really fun explaining to him like what Channel Awesome was.

4946
03:45:28,240 --> 03:45:31,040
Oh, yeah, I haven't got around to watching that.

4947
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:32,640
All the other kids in that stream, they like,

4948
03:45:33,200 --> 03:45:36,480
they didn't, they didn't like explain to him like actually what it was.

4949
03:45:36,480 --> 03:45:39,840
They would tell him like, oh, yeah, this person got canceled for being a rapist.

4950
03:45:39,840 --> 03:45:40,960
Oh, yeah, this person died.

4951
03:45:41,760 --> 03:45:43,360
And he was like confused.

4952
03:45:43,360 --> 03:45:45,680
And then I explained like, here's the deal.

4953
03:45:45,680 --> 03:45:49,920
Here was like the corporate structure hierarchy and how it became this like,

4954
03:45:49,920 --> 03:45:53,920
this, this enterprise built of like Doug, Doug Walker clones.

4955
03:45:53,920 --> 03:45:55,600
And he was like, oh, thank you.

4956
03:45:55,600 --> 03:45:57,200
Now I get why it's funny.

4957
03:45:57,200 --> 03:46:01,120
That's, but that's kind of like, like a Stereo's fault.

4958
03:46:01,120 --> 03:46:01,920
Not going to lie.

4959
03:46:01,920 --> 03:46:06,080
Because he's, he's, he's a magnet for people who, because, because here's the bit.

4960
03:46:06,080 --> 03:46:10,160
Let me, if you ever listen to like them, I've listened to a lot of like a Stereo's podcast

4961
03:46:10,160 --> 03:46:15,360
and usually the gimmick is the same across the board is that a Stereo's is a boomer

4962
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:20,240
and he does it like, like edgy things and his co-host would be super edgy and we'll

4963
03:46:20,240 --> 03:46:21,680
tell him a bunch of edgy things.

4964
03:46:21,680 --> 03:46:23,360
And the Stereo's would be like, oh my God.

4965
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:24,480
I see.

4966
03:46:24,480 --> 03:46:26,720
And that's every, that's every a Stereo's podcast.

4967
03:46:26,720 --> 03:46:31,600
So, so because of that, his fan base is a bunch of edgy people who just jumped

4968
03:46:31,600 --> 03:46:35,040
the calls and tell him like, Stereo's, you heard about this super edgy thing and he'll

4969
03:46:35,040 --> 03:46:36,000
be like, oh my God.

4970
03:46:36,000 --> 03:46:38,320
Ah, that's, that's his fucking gimmick.

4971
03:46:39,120 --> 03:46:40,800
Oh, I killed him.

4972
03:46:42,320 --> 03:46:43,440
Oh no, Ben's dead.

4973
03:46:43,440 --> 03:46:44,240
Ben's dead.

4974
03:46:44,240 --> 03:46:46,720
Is he finally got the best of him?

4975
03:46:46,720 --> 03:46:47,680
Ben's dead, baby.

4976
03:46:48,320 --> 03:46:52,160
I hope Ben is talking into his recording right now and that we're all talking over each other

4977
03:46:53,040 --> 03:46:53,520
in the edit.

4978
03:46:54,880 --> 03:46:56,720
Ben Stain has turned it to Ben Angel.

4979
03:46:56,720 --> 03:47:02,400
I'm going to post the next thing because it's the homo Juneus.

4980
03:47:04,800 --> 03:47:08,720
Yeah, I got the file in the chat so that Ben can listen to it when he gets back,

4981
03:47:08,720 --> 03:47:10,080
maybe if he's lucky.

4982
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:12,640
Rest in peace, Ben.

4983
03:47:14,560 --> 03:47:15,680
We barely knew ye.

4984
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:18,800
I'm, I'm back.

4985
03:47:18,800 --> 03:47:19,680
Sorry, I'm back.

4986
03:47:19,680 --> 03:47:20,960
My discord dropped the call.

4987
03:47:22,560 --> 03:47:24,880
I got the, I got the image to load.

4988
03:47:24,880 --> 03:47:26,000
I look, look at my hair.

4989
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:30,400
I look like fucking, uh, I have like fucking Jerry Seinfeld like Kramer high hair.

4990
03:47:30,400 --> 03:47:31,120
You do.

4991
03:47:31,120 --> 03:47:36,000
It's a very funny, I looked so, I look so bad at red, the red con two videos.

4992
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:37,600
What's the deal with Munchy?

4993
03:47:38,640 --> 03:47:42,480
He, they say he's a Nazi, but I did not see what they're saying.

4994
03:47:46,720 --> 03:47:51,120
I'm like, you know, it's Gib, you're saying we can't show this on screen and I'm tearing

4995
03:47:51,120 --> 03:47:51,680
the cover.

4996
03:47:51,680 --> 03:47:54,400
I'm tearing the calendar to 1984, but I'm smiling about it.

4997
03:47:54,400 --> 03:47:55,680
Like, I'm not concerned.

4998
03:47:55,680 --> 03:47:57,280
Like, like the original boomer.

4999
03:47:57,280 --> 03:47:58,640
Oh, you like Lantilator 4.

5000
03:47:58,640 --> 03:48:01,920
I'm like, yeah, time to go back, baby.

5001
03:48:01,920 --> 03:48:05,200
We have to go back, returned to 1984.

5002
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:05,520
Cool.

5003
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:09,040
Uh, let's, let's do the next one.

5004
03:48:09,680 --> 03:48:11,040
And next one is a vocary link.

5005
03:48:11,040 --> 03:48:11,520
Oh, okay.

5006
03:48:11,520 --> 03:48:12,400
Can you hear that?

5007
03:48:13,680 --> 03:48:14,640
Yes, I can.

5008
03:48:15,520 --> 03:48:15,840
Okay.

5009
03:48:16,480 --> 03:48:18,240
Three, two, one, go.

5010
03:48:20,320 --> 03:48:22,640
Oh, I swim in the ocean.

5011
03:48:25,120 --> 03:48:27,760
Swimming is all I know how to do.

5012
03:48:29,360 --> 03:48:31,440
Below me is water.

5013
03:48:31,440 --> 03:48:32,080
Next to me is water.

5014
03:48:32,080 --> 03:48:33,200
It's the way of water.

5015
03:48:33,760 --> 03:48:36,000
In front of me is water.

5016
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:37,680
Behind me is water.

5017
03:48:38,320 --> 03:48:40,000
This isn't like a clip from the film.

5018
03:48:40,000 --> 03:48:41,200
If I dive down, it's more water.

5019
03:48:41,200 --> 03:48:42,080
Yeah, I've never seen.

5020
03:48:42,960 --> 03:48:45,600
If I swim up, it's more water.

5021
03:48:47,760 --> 03:48:50,800
I'm not having sex with you right now, water.

5022
03:48:51,760 --> 03:48:57,200
It's all very homogenous.

5023
03:49:00,400 --> 03:49:02,880
I don't know why the way you said it that time got me.

5024
03:49:04,080 --> 03:49:06,080
I don't know who this guy is, but I love him.

5025
03:49:06,080 --> 03:49:09,120
He, he's pretty homogenous.

5026
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:09,920
He's very.

5027
03:49:09,920 --> 03:49:12,000
Yeah, his, his voicemails are getting a little homogenous.

5028
03:49:12,000 --> 03:49:13,200
They're all about the same thing.

5029
03:49:13,200 --> 03:49:16,240
Yeah, they are a little bit like they all have the same structure

5030
03:49:16,240 --> 03:49:17,200
and they all end the same way.

5031
03:49:17,200 --> 03:49:18,240
I wonder where this is going.

5032
03:49:18,240 --> 03:49:18,960
I don't understand.

5033
03:49:18,960 --> 03:49:19,520
Doesn't make any.

5034
03:49:20,480 --> 03:49:22,400
Sounds a little disturbed.

5035
03:49:22,400 --> 03:49:23,200
Australian.

5036
03:49:23,200 --> 03:49:23,760
Is that just me?

5037
03:49:24,800 --> 03:49:27,040
A little Australian.

5038
03:49:27,040 --> 03:49:27,920
Australian.

5039
03:49:27,920 --> 03:49:29,120
He's a little alien.

5040
03:49:30,160 --> 03:49:32,800
The next voicemail is another one of these.

5041
03:49:33,840 --> 03:49:34,880
These high things.

5042
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:38,560
As you can see, Ben Stain's channel is very complex.

5043
03:49:38,560 --> 03:49:41,200
There's a lot of interweaving fiends.

5044
03:49:41,760 --> 03:49:45,840
I like on the Mega Man lecture, every single Mega Man on the board.

5045
03:49:45,840 --> 03:49:46,640
He's a little arrow.

5046
03:49:48,080 --> 03:49:48,800
That's pretty good.

5047
03:49:50,480 --> 03:49:54,640
I should say this is a low quality JPEG, so that it loads for you, Ben.

5048
03:49:54,640 --> 03:49:56,720
I totally forgot about the Ben St. debate.

5049
03:49:56,720 --> 03:49:58,160
Digibro on Bernie.

5050
03:49:58,160 --> 03:49:59,120
What happened to that guy?

5051
03:50:00,640 --> 03:50:01,760
Digibro?

5052
03:50:01,760 --> 03:50:02,000
Yeah.

5053
03:50:03,120 --> 03:50:05,920
He became, he died.

5054
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:06,880
He died.

5055
03:50:06,880 --> 03:50:08,640
No, he became, he became May.

5056
03:50:09,680 --> 03:50:09,840
Nice.

5057
03:50:09,840 --> 03:50:10,960
He's gone.

5058
03:50:10,960 --> 03:50:11,440
Yeah.

5059
03:50:11,440 --> 03:50:12,080
He became May.

5060
03:50:12,080 --> 03:50:16,080
They became pregnant with the child of the, of the gunk.

5061
03:50:16,080 --> 03:50:19,200
And it, and the title was passed on through the bloodline.

5062
03:50:19,680 --> 03:50:21,200
My God, how old is that baby now?

5063
03:50:22,240 --> 03:50:23,920
Almost, must be less than a year.

5064
03:50:24,720 --> 03:50:26,320
Is it only been, okay.

5065
03:50:28,320 --> 03:50:31,600
I know how this works is like, oh, a family member has a baby,

5066
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:33,600
and then before you know it, they're like seven.

5067
03:50:33,600 --> 03:50:35,440
Next time you see them, yeah.

5068
03:50:35,440 --> 03:50:37,120
Before you know it, I think that's a podcast.

5069
03:50:37,680 --> 03:50:40,720
That's how I am with all my stupid little second cousins now.

5070
03:50:40,720 --> 03:50:42,800
They're all turning like, one of them's like five.

5071
03:50:43,360 --> 03:50:44,720
God, one of them's like five.

5072
03:50:44,720 --> 03:50:45,760
Holy shit.

5073
03:50:45,760 --> 03:50:47,760
And then, oh, I can see it.

5074
03:50:47,760 --> 03:50:48,640
Oh my God, I can see it.

5075
03:50:48,640 --> 03:50:48,960
Thank you.

5076
03:50:48,960 --> 03:50:50,000
That's how it worked.

5077
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:52,160
Oh, all the, all the little Mega Man's.

5078
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:57,360
Wait, what is, these are, and yeah, yeah.

5079
03:50:57,360 --> 03:50:58,880
See, this is, this is coherent.

5080
03:50:59,440 --> 03:51:00,240
This is coherent.

5081
03:51:00,240 --> 03:51:01,440
They're all looking at each other.

5082
03:51:02,640 --> 03:51:07,520
They're all, it's all connected in the great circle of life.

5083
03:51:07,520 --> 03:51:10,400
The only, the only tricky one is you and Mega Man are looking at the camera.

5084
03:51:10,400 --> 03:51:11,600
I don't know what the fuck to do there.

5085
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:15,200
We're all, you do nothing.

5086
03:51:15,200 --> 03:51:18,400
All together, all of us together looking at the camera.

5087
03:51:19,600 --> 03:51:25,040
Some of these are, some of these, oh, Endless War looking at about is good.

5088
03:51:25,040 --> 03:51:25,680
I like him.

5089
03:51:26,640 --> 03:51:27,600
I like him there.

5090
03:51:29,200 --> 03:51:35,600
I should release more Endless War animation tie-ins that'll get 8K views.

5091
03:51:36,240 --> 03:51:39,760
It is a follow-up to my, to my, to my big hit.

5092
03:51:40,880 --> 03:51:41,760
Okay.

5093
03:51:41,760 --> 03:51:42,400
Yeah.

5094
03:51:42,400 --> 03:51:42,720
Next.

5095
03:51:42,720 --> 03:51:46,080
Well, it's a good, it's a good thing, I think, because it is actually my time to go now.

5096
03:51:46,080 --> 03:51:48,320
Oh, thank you for stopping by.

5097
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:51,680
I'm glad I could stop by.

5098
03:51:51,680 --> 03:51:53,440
It's been good chatting.

5099
03:51:54,080 --> 03:51:54,960
All 10 words.

5100
03:51:55,840 --> 03:51:57,600
It's been good, all 10 words.

5101
03:51:57,600 --> 03:52:00,000
You silently eat suffering.

5102
03:52:00,000 --> 03:52:02,560
Well, we all spurge about, yeah.

5103
03:52:04,720 --> 03:52:07,440
We're eating good in the neighborhood.

5104
03:52:09,200 --> 03:52:11,760
And I got to go eat something I'm feeling faint.

5105
03:52:11,760 --> 03:52:12,480
Oh, okay.

5106
03:52:12,480 --> 03:52:13,040
Oh, no.

5107
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:16,880
Yeah, we have, we have been, we have been going, we are, we had four hours now.

5108
03:52:17,440 --> 03:52:18,080
Oh my god.

5109
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:21,360
Yeah, we just, we just passed the four hours mark.

5110
03:52:22,720 --> 03:52:28,000
So, well, if at any point you're done, you can say so and leave.

5111
03:52:28,000 --> 03:52:30,240
Well, how many more voicemails, how many voicemails do we have?

5112
03:52:30,240 --> 03:52:31,200
Well, we've been going slow.

5113
03:52:31,200 --> 03:52:36,720
There's like, actually, one, two, three, four.

5114
03:52:36,720 --> 03:52:38,400
There's like seven to 10.

5115
03:52:39,120 --> 03:52:40,080
Some of them are images.

5116
03:52:41,520 --> 03:52:42,080
Okay.

5117
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:44,480
I mean, I may have to skip that.

5118
03:52:44,480 --> 03:52:45,680
Oh, I apologize.

5119
03:52:45,680 --> 03:52:47,280
That's no, that's totally okay.

5120
03:52:47,360 --> 03:52:49,680
This is a long time.

5121
03:52:49,680 --> 03:52:50,000
Yeah.

5122
03:52:51,280 --> 03:52:55,120
Well, I mean, thank you, Oblivion, for stopping by.

5123
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:57,760
And Deadly, it's been a great having you as a guest.

5124
03:52:58,560 --> 03:53:00,080
And thank you.

5125
03:53:00,080 --> 03:53:01,760
You're welcome to come back any time.

5126
03:53:01,760 --> 03:53:02,640
That's true.

5127
03:53:02,640 --> 03:53:03,520
That's true.

5128
03:53:03,520 --> 03:53:05,360
Everyone, subscribe to Deadly Comics.

5129
03:53:05,360 --> 03:53:06,480
Watch all the animations.

5130
03:53:06,480 --> 03:53:06,960
Definitely.

5131
03:53:06,960 --> 03:53:07,360
Good.

5132
03:53:07,360 --> 03:53:08,800
Oh yeah, definitely everyone should.

5133
03:53:08,800 --> 03:53:11,920
I mean, if that wasn't clear by the fact that he's here,

5134
03:53:12,960 --> 03:53:13,760
you should definitely check out his animation.

5135
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:14,880
But don't promote him on YouTube.

5136
03:53:14,880 --> 03:53:15,600
You might get banned.

5137
03:53:15,600 --> 03:53:16,880
That might be illegal next week.

5138
03:53:16,880 --> 03:53:19,680
On Twitter, if you mention that you have his YouTube channel,

5139
03:53:19,680 --> 03:53:20,640
you will get banned.

5140
03:53:21,760 --> 03:53:25,680
Yeah, just write my name on a paper and leave it in the public place.

5141
03:53:28,240 --> 03:53:29,520
That's how we get the word out.

5142
03:53:29,520 --> 03:53:34,000
They can't stop all of us from doing that.

5143
03:53:34,000 --> 03:53:36,080
They can only take some of us down.

5144
03:53:37,440 --> 03:53:38,080
Exactly.

5145
03:53:38,080 --> 03:53:38,560
They can.

5146
03:53:39,360 --> 03:53:40,160
I'm heading out.

5147
03:53:40,160 --> 03:53:40,560
All right.

5148
03:53:40,560 --> 03:53:41,120
Thanks.

5149
03:53:41,120 --> 03:53:42,560
We'll leave me on for a little bit.

5150
03:53:42,560 --> 03:53:43,200
Thank you.

5151
03:53:43,200 --> 03:53:43,680
See ya.

5152
03:53:44,320 --> 03:53:44,800
See ya.

5153
03:53:45,360 --> 03:53:46,000
See ya.

5154
03:53:46,560 --> 03:53:46,800
Cool.

5155
03:53:46,880 --> 03:53:47,840
See you guys as well.

5156
03:53:47,840 --> 03:53:48,240
All right.

5157
03:53:48,240 --> 03:53:49,600
See ya, Deadly.

5158
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:50,160
Thanks again.

5159
03:53:50,160 --> 03:53:50,800
Bye-bye.

5160
03:53:50,800 --> 03:53:52,240
Thanks for having me on.

5161
03:53:52,240 --> 03:53:52,480
All right.

5162
03:53:52,480 --> 03:53:53,120
My pleasure.

5163
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:53,520
Later.

5164
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:54,400
See ya.

5165
03:53:54,400 --> 03:53:54,800
Bye-bye.

5166
03:53:55,920 --> 03:53:56,480
All right.

5167
03:53:56,480 --> 03:53:58,960
Well, let's wrap this up.

5168
03:54:00,240 --> 03:54:00,960
Okay.

5169
03:54:00,960 --> 03:54:03,440
Next ones are Ben's Weekly Reminder.

5170
03:54:03,440 --> 03:54:04,720
Played Delta in Chapter 2.

5171
03:54:06,160 --> 03:54:08,000
And to catch up on One Piece,

5172
03:54:08,000 --> 03:54:09,600
and then they sent another one said,

5173
03:54:09,600 --> 03:54:12,240
I meant to stay up to date with One Piece.

5174
03:54:12,960 --> 03:54:14,560
They're all non-voicemails.

5175
03:54:14,560 --> 03:54:15,040
Gotcha.

5176
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:19,680
The one after that is this.

5177
03:54:20,720 --> 03:54:21,440
Just says Ben.

5178
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:22,480
Okay.

5179
03:54:23,200 --> 03:54:23,520
Okay.

5180
03:54:23,520 --> 03:54:24,160
Okay.

5181
03:54:24,160 --> 03:54:25,760
Three, two, one, go.

5182
03:54:26,320 --> 03:54:28,400
Ben, I'm driving Ben.

5183
03:54:28,400 --> 03:54:31,760
I'm driving beyond the speed limit, Ben.

5184
03:54:31,760 --> 03:54:34,240
Ben, I'm breaking the law.

5185
03:54:34,240 --> 03:54:34,640
No.

5186
03:54:36,720 --> 03:54:38,000
Why are you telling me?

5187
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:39,040
That was me last night.

5188
03:54:39,840 --> 03:54:41,120
Was it actually?

5189
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:41,760
No.

5190
03:54:41,760 --> 03:54:43,600
No, that wasn't me.

5191
03:54:43,600 --> 03:54:46,160
But I was, I speed all the fucking time.

5192
03:54:47,200 --> 03:54:49,440
I mean, I think a lot of people do.

5193
03:54:49,440 --> 03:54:51,280
I think it's, I mean, like,

5194
03:54:51,280 --> 03:54:53,360
I mean, they're speeding and then they're speeding.

5195
03:54:54,240 --> 03:54:58,720
I only go like 20 miles over the speed limit, you know?

5196
03:54:58,720 --> 03:55:01,520
I mean, on the highway, that's normal.

5197
03:55:01,520 --> 03:55:02,560
Yeah, exactly.

5198
03:55:03,280 --> 03:55:06,880
And you know, and if there's a cop, I'll stop on stop sign.

5199
03:55:06,880 --> 03:55:08,160
But if there's no cop, I'll stop.

5200
03:55:08,160 --> 03:55:09,440
By crashing into them.

5201
03:55:09,440 --> 03:55:11,360
And there's no cop, no stop.

5202
03:55:11,360 --> 03:55:12,080
You know what I'm saying?

5203
03:55:13,760 --> 03:55:14,880
You never know.

5204
03:55:14,880 --> 03:55:16,160
You never know when there's a cop,

5205
03:55:16,160 --> 03:55:16,880
because they hide.

5206
03:55:17,840 --> 03:55:18,480
I know.

5207
03:55:18,480 --> 03:55:19,680
Hide sneakily.

5208
03:55:19,680 --> 03:55:21,440
And they'll sneakily try and get you.

5209
03:55:21,440 --> 03:55:25,680
In my six years of driving, I've only been stopped twice.

5210
03:55:28,320 --> 03:55:29,280
Yeah, I mean.

5211
03:55:30,320 --> 03:55:31,520
Both unrelated to speed.

5212
03:55:32,400 --> 03:55:33,280
I'm not telling you.

5213
03:55:33,280 --> 03:55:34,640
I'm not telling you how to drive.

5214
03:55:35,440 --> 03:55:38,080
Yeah, I mean, I speed on the highway.

5215
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:39,680
I think everyone speeds on the highway.

5216
03:55:41,200 --> 03:55:44,720
You come to California out and come in my car.

5217
03:55:44,720 --> 03:55:45,920
I'll definitely be speeding.

5218
03:55:47,280 --> 03:55:48,560
You'll feel the wind.

5219
03:55:51,520 --> 03:55:53,280
It'll be the last thing you ever feel.

5220
03:55:54,880 --> 03:55:57,280
The next one is called, you know that one.

5221
03:55:58,960 --> 03:55:59,760
Okay, hang on.

5222
03:55:59,760 --> 03:56:00,960
It is downloading.

5223
03:56:00,960 --> 03:56:01,840
Okay, I'm ready.

5224
03:56:02,720 --> 03:56:04,480
Three, two, one, go.

5225
03:56:06,080 --> 03:56:08,080
I'm so dumb.

5226
03:56:08,080 --> 03:56:10,240
I'm so dumb.

5227
03:56:10,240 --> 03:56:13,040
Anyways, whenever you meet again,

5228
03:56:13,040 --> 03:56:16,880
can you take a picture of doing the soy jacks

5229
03:56:16,880 --> 03:56:20,400
pointing backwards in the face for?

5230
03:56:21,280 --> 03:56:22,080
That would be funny.

5231
03:56:24,080 --> 03:56:26,000
We should have done that when you visited.

5232
03:56:29,280 --> 03:56:30,320
Did you hear the voicemail?

5233
03:56:31,360 --> 03:56:33,360
Sorry, I got food delivered.

5234
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:36,560
It's soy jacks pointing.

5235
03:56:36,560 --> 03:56:38,560
He just wanted us to do the meme

5236
03:56:38,560 --> 03:56:39,920
where we both point behind us.

5237
03:56:41,200 --> 03:56:41,760
Here we go.

5238
03:56:42,640 --> 03:56:43,600
Soy.

5239
03:56:43,600 --> 03:56:44,000
I don't know.

5240
03:56:44,000 --> 03:56:44,560
I would do it.

5241
03:56:46,160 --> 03:56:47,360
It is a funny idea.

5242
03:56:47,360 --> 03:56:48,160
We should have done it.

5243
03:56:48,160 --> 03:56:49,200
It's a missed opportunity.

5244
03:56:51,200 --> 03:56:52,880
I actually look like the guy now.

5245
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:58,240
I look like the guy, not the real one in the picture,

5246
03:56:58,240 --> 03:57:01,520
but the drawn version that's bald and has a beard.

5247
03:57:01,520 --> 03:57:03,280
Like that's just what I look like now.

5248
03:57:03,280 --> 03:57:04,240
You should do that.

5249
03:57:04,240 --> 03:57:05,520
But you guys do the pose,

5250
03:57:05,520 --> 03:57:07,360
but you're guys are in front of Trixie's house.

5251
03:57:08,160 --> 03:57:11,760
In front of her like address.

5252
03:57:13,920 --> 03:57:14,560
Stalking.

5253
03:57:14,560 --> 03:57:15,520
Like, oh, we found her.

5254
03:57:16,880 --> 03:57:20,720
And then we do the faces like out on the street

5255
03:57:20,720 --> 03:57:21,760
looking at the house.

5256
03:57:21,760 --> 03:57:24,320
And then another one like in front of her front door.

5257
03:57:24,320 --> 03:57:26,320
And then another one like with the door open,

5258
03:57:26,320 --> 03:57:29,280
like pointing inside the house as like the people inside

5259
03:57:29,280 --> 03:57:30,000
are like, what?

5260
03:57:30,000 --> 03:57:32,800
They're like scared that we're like breaking in.

5261
03:57:32,800 --> 03:57:35,920
And then another one like on top of Trixie,

5262
03:57:36,480 --> 03:57:38,720
like duct tape and like tied up and hog tied.

5263
03:57:38,720 --> 03:57:40,560
We were like, oh, holding her behind us.

5264
03:57:40,560 --> 03:57:42,640
We just point to her, make the face.

5265
03:57:42,640 --> 03:57:46,640
And then the final one is us like over like an unmarked gray.

5266
03:57:46,640 --> 03:57:48,960
He was just like pointing back behind us.

5267
03:57:48,960 --> 03:57:51,040
Like, oh, so we did it.

5268
03:57:54,640 --> 03:57:55,520
This is my fantasy.

5269
03:57:56,160 --> 03:57:57,440
I think it'd be funny for the first one

5270
03:57:57,440 --> 03:57:59,200
when you guys are pointing to the front of her house.

5271
03:57:59,200 --> 03:58:01,840
She's coming outside just like that one picture of boogie

5272
03:58:01,840 --> 03:58:02,560
with the gun.

5273
03:58:06,240 --> 03:58:08,320
Or it could be Riley with the gun

5274
03:58:08,320 --> 03:58:09,360
because he's like fat enough.

5275
03:58:10,720 --> 03:58:12,080
Yeah, Riley.

5276
03:58:12,080 --> 03:58:13,600
That would be a fun photo shoot

5277
03:58:13,600 --> 03:58:16,160
if it weren't so actually dangerous.

5278
03:58:16,160 --> 03:58:18,000
Yeah, if it weren't, if it were,

5279
03:58:18,000 --> 03:58:20,240
if we could do it without like actually

5280
03:58:20,240 --> 03:58:23,440
He's about to introduce you to a big having connection right now.

5281
03:58:24,880 --> 03:58:27,920
If we could, if we could, if we just,

5282
03:58:27,920 --> 03:58:29,440
if we just happened to be there,

5283
03:58:30,080 --> 03:58:32,880
and like we knew that like no one would see us

5284
03:58:32,880 --> 03:58:35,520
and like we knew that like nothing was going to happen

5285
03:58:35,520 --> 03:58:36,880
and we could just do it just for funny.

5286
03:58:36,880 --> 03:58:38,560
It would be funny to pose in front of the house

5287
03:58:38,560 --> 03:58:40,480
just like, oh, we did it.

5288
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:42,960
We made the pilgrimage.

5289
03:58:44,400 --> 03:58:45,680
But no, I wouldn't,

5290
03:58:45,680 --> 03:58:48,160
if I actually did it, it would be bizarre

5291
03:58:48,160 --> 03:58:50,880
and I would be rightfully shamed for it.

5292
03:58:50,880 --> 03:58:51,360
LaMau.

5293
03:58:51,360 --> 03:58:52,960
Smash cut to Ben doing it.

5294
03:58:52,960 --> 03:58:55,600
Smash cut to me being rightfully shamed for it.

5295
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:56,320
Yeah, true.

5296
03:58:59,360 --> 03:59:01,120
Okay, how many more?

5297
03:59:01,120 --> 03:59:02,160
We must be getting down there.

5298
03:59:02,240 --> 03:59:06,400
There's like one, two, three, four, five, six more.

5299
03:59:07,360 --> 03:59:07,920
Seven more.

5300
03:59:08,960 --> 03:59:09,680
This one is a, what is this?

5301
03:59:09,680 --> 03:59:11,280
You said there were seven more.

5302
03:59:11,280 --> 03:59:11,760
Okay.

5303
03:59:11,760 --> 03:59:12,880
Seven to 10.

5304
03:59:12,880 --> 03:59:14,640
I wasn't, I did, I glanced at it.

5305
03:59:14,640 --> 03:59:15,200
What is this?

5306
03:59:15,840 --> 03:59:19,680
Fast upload something, something slash file.

5307
03:59:19,680 --> 03:59:20,720
I don't know what this is.

5308
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:22,400
It's not loading for me.

5309
03:59:25,040 --> 03:59:29,440
I'll post the link in case somebody else can see it.

5310
03:59:30,080 --> 03:59:30,640
But I can't.

5311
03:59:31,120 --> 03:59:34,320
I mean, I think it's pretty unlikely

5312
03:59:34,320 --> 03:59:35,360
that it's going to work for me.

5313
03:59:36,160 --> 03:59:38,080
It's, it doesn't download anything for you.

5314
03:59:40,080 --> 03:59:40,880
No, there's no page.

5315
03:59:40,880 --> 03:59:42,720
It's not, oh, connection timed out.

5316
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:44,240
Error code.

5317
03:59:44,240 --> 03:59:44,640
Okay.

5318
03:59:44,640 --> 03:59:45,440
That's not working.

5319
03:59:47,360 --> 03:59:47,680
Yeah.

5320
03:59:48,640 --> 03:59:49,920
Sorry, fast uploader.

5321
03:59:51,280 --> 03:59:52,320
That's too bad.

5322
03:59:52,320 --> 03:59:53,360
Let me try it one more time.

5323
03:59:54,640 --> 03:59:55,840
No, it's not letting.

5324
03:59:55,840 --> 03:59:57,920
Oh, that's unfortunate.

5325
03:59:57,920 --> 03:59:59,680
I wonder what it could have been.

5326
04:00:01,600 --> 04:00:03,680
Cheesy, you get anything?

5327
04:00:04,240 --> 04:00:06,240
Um, like fast upload.

5328
04:00:09,680 --> 04:00:10,720
Nah, this is.

5329
04:00:11,760 --> 04:00:14,720
No, no, well, ah, well.

5330
04:00:17,200 --> 04:00:20,320
The next one is a one piece chapters.com slash something,

5331
04:00:20,320 --> 04:00:26,240
something, and it's a link to one piece scans.

5332
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:27,360
Okay.

5333
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:28,320
Why?

5334
04:00:29,280 --> 04:00:31,600
Um, maybe it's the preferred scan.

5335
04:00:31,600 --> 04:00:32,880
It does look very good actually.

5336
04:00:33,600 --> 04:00:34,640
TCB scans.

5337
04:00:38,000 --> 04:00:40,160
There was a voicemail, but it's not loading for me.

5338
04:00:40,160 --> 04:00:41,600
Uh, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll just post it.

5339
04:00:42,640 --> 04:00:43,440
It's not loading.

5340
04:00:44,640 --> 04:00:47,040
The voicemail itself is like eight seconds long.

5341
04:00:47,040 --> 04:00:47,680
It's not loading.

5342
04:00:47,680 --> 04:00:49,280
So I don't know whether it's relevant.

5343
04:00:50,640 --> 04:00:50,960
Okay.

5344
04:00:50,960 --> 04:00:53,280
He says he recommends reading one piece through,

5345
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:57,360
yeah, this, this website or a vis media,

5346
04:00:57,920 --> 04:01:00,320
the scan quality and the translations are better.

5347
04:01:01,920 --> 04:01:02,560
Understood.

5348
04:01:02,560 --> 04:01:03,520
This does look very good.

5349
04:01:04,560 --> 04:01:08,000
Uh, well, maybe I will use this going forward then.

5350
04:01:09,680 --> 04:01:09,920
Okay.

5351
04:01:09,920 --> 04:01:13,280
The next one, next voicemail is another image.

5352
04:01:14,080 --> 04:01:14,400
Okay.

5353
04:01:16,160 --> 04:01:17,520
Oh, all right.

5354
04:01:17,520 --> 04:01:18,320
That's interesting.

5355
04:01:19,280 --> 04:01:19,680
Great.

5356
04:01:19,680 --> 04:01:22,720
Oh, this is how they're, this is how they're like seeing your

5357
04:01:22,720 --> 04:01:23,680
profile picture.

5358
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:25,280
They think it's a beak with a beard.

5359
04:01:26,240 --> 04:01:27,280
Well, it's not a beak.

5360
04:01:27,840 --> 04:01:28,160
Huh.

5361
04:01:28,960 --> 04:01:31,200
It's your, that's, that's your ear thing.

5362
04:01:32,880 --> 04:01:34,560
Uh, I can see it though.

5363
04:01:34,560 --> 04:01:38,720
Oh, kind of.

5364
04:01:40,320 --> 04:01:40,720
Yeah.

5365
04:01:40,720 --> 04:01:41,520
I mean, okay.

5366
04:01:43,040 --> 04:01:44,240
Oh, okay.

5367
04:01:45,040 --> 04:01:45,760
Oh, that one.

5368
04:01:45,760 --> 04:01:48,320
I thought you meant your profile picture on discord.

5369
04:01:48,320 --> 04:01:49,440
I was about to say that looks.

5370
04:01:49,440 --> 04:01:51,520
No, no, it's an older one, older profile.

5371
04:01:52,720 --> 04:01:54,720
Well, this, well, this is what I still use on Twitter.

5372
04:01:55,520 --> 04:01:56,160
Oh, yeah.

5373
04:01:56,160 --> 04:01:56,400
Yeah.

5374
04:01:57,040 --> 04:01:58,960
Um, hmm.

5375
04:01:58,960 --> 04:01:59,600
Okay.

5376
04:01:59,600 --> 04:02:02,560
Yeah, I kind of see it if you, if you read the ear as a beak.

5377
04:02:02,560 --> 04:02:02,800
Sure.

5378
04:02:03,440 --> 04:02:03,680
Neat.

5379
04:02:04,320 --> 04:02:04,640
Funny.

5380
04:02:05,440 --> 04:02:06,720
Uh, lol.

5381
04:02:08,720 --> 04:02:09,040
Yeah.

5382
04:02:11,440 --> 04:02:12,480
Maybe I'll redesign.

5383
04:02:13,200 --> 04:02:14,480
So I should read, redesign,

5384
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:16,560
reploid me to look like this.

5385
04:02:18,400 --> 04:02:19,120
I'll give him a name.

5386
04:02:19,680 --> 04:02:22,080
Why don't you use your profile for this one?

5387
04:02:22,080 --> 04:02:25,120
His name would be like, his name would be like

5388
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:28,640
slime, slime corvid.

5389
04:02:30,400 --> 04:02:31,280
That's pretty good.

5390
04:02:31,280 --> 04:02:32,000
That's not bad.

5391
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:32,640
That's pretty good.

5392
04:02:32,640 --> 04:02:32,800
That's pretty good.

5393
04:02:32,800 --> 04:02:34,560
You can, we can, we can workshop it.

5394
04:02:34,560 --> 04:02:35,920
Not slime, swan.

5395
04:02:37,520 --> 04:02:39,520
Well, does that look, does that look like a swan to you?

5396
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:42,960
Does any of the fucking animals look like they're animals?

5397
04:02:42,960 --> 04:02:44,800
Looks like a furby with a beard.

5398
04:02:44,800 --> 04:02:45,360
They never do.

5399
04:02:45,360 --> 04:02:47,920
Sometimes chill penguin looks like a penguin.

5400
04:02:47,920 --> 04:02:48,560
Yeah.

5401
04:02:48,560 --> 04:02:50,400
That's, it's not an apartment.

5402
04:02:50,400 --> 04:02:52,000
It's not a fucking apartment really.

5403
04:02:52,880 --> 04:02:53,600
I mean, storm.

5404
04:02:53,600 --> 04:02:56,880
I mean, like, it's like most, most of the time.

5405
04:02:56,880 --> 04:02:59,040
Never played any of the Mega Man X games.

5406
04:02:59,040 --> 04:03:01,280
Most of the time they are recognizably.

5407
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:02,560
Okay.

5408
04:03:02,560 --> 04:03:04,880
For confidence, I will say that they look,

5409
04:03:04,880 --> 04:03:06,080
they don't look like animals.

5410
04:03:06,800 --> 04:03:08,240
Sometimes they're a little iffy.

5411
04:03:08,240 --> 04:03:09,600
Sometimes they're a little iffy.

5412
04:03:09,600 --> 04:03:10,080
It's true.

5413
04:03:11,120 --> 04:03:11,520
Slime.

5414
04:03:11,520 --> 04:03:12,560
She's a cat.

5415
04:03:12,560 --> 04:03:13,280
Slime swallow.

5416
04:03:13,280 --> 04:03:13,920
Yeah, I have a cat.

5417
04:03:14,720 --> 04:03:15,680
I heard a cat.

5418
04:03:15,680 --> 04:03:17,120
Yeah, he's a, he's a little guy.

5419
04:03:17,120 --> 04:03:17,680
He's a little guy.

5420
04:03:17,680 --> 04:03:18,800
His name is spooky.

5421
04:03:18,800 --> 04:03:19,280
Oh yeah.

5422
04:03:20,560 --> 04:03:21,360
Poopy.

5423
04:03:21,440 --> 04:03:22,000
Spooky.

5424
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:23,200
Poopy's on the strip.

5425
04:03:23,200 --> 04:03:23,920
No, shut up.

5426
04:03:23,920 --> 04:03:24,240
Stop.

5427
04:03:24,240 --> 04:03:24,960
Stop bullying me.

5428
04:03:24,960 --> 04:03:26,080
Stop bullying me right now.

5429
04:03:26,640 --> 04:03:27,840
Poopy's on the strip.

5430
04:03:27,840 --> 04:03:29,040
No, no, you're wrong.

5431
04:03:29,040 --> 04:03:30,880
We all hung out at Poopy's on the strip.

5432
04:03:31,760 --> 04:03:32,480
All right.

5433
04:03:32,480 --> 04:03:34,160
I'll, I'll post a picture of him.

5434
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:36,880
Because he's a, he's, he's quite a little fella.

5435
04:03:36,880 --> 04:03:38,320
And he's, he's got like.

5436
04:03:38,320 --> 04:03:40,000
It's the next voicemail.

5437
04:03:40,000 --> 04:03:40,960
Guys, be honest with me.

5438
04:03:40,960 --> 04:03:43,520
Is this the worst podcast episode ever?

5439
04:03:43,520 --> 04:03:44,400
Or is it the best?

5440
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:45,920
It's one or the other?

5441
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:48,800
Uh, why would it be the worst?

5442
04:03:49,440 --> 04:03:50,320
Because it's long.

5443
04:03:51,520 --> 04:03:52,800
No, that's what they like.

5444
04:03:52,800 --> 04:03:53,200
That is what they like.

5445
04:03:53,200 --> 04:03:54,080
They like it long.

5446
04:03:54,080 --> 04:03:55,120
For some reason.

5447
04:03:55,120 --> 04:03:56,240
These piggies love to eat their sloth.

5448
04:03:56,240 --> 04:03:57,600
They like taking a long,

5449
04:03:58,320 --> 04:04:02,800
they take, like taking a long hard podcast.

5450
04:04:02,800 --> 04:04:04,640
He's got a little sweater on.

5451
04:04:04,640 --> 04:04:07,200
Yeah, we got him a little gay sweater one time.

5452
04:04:07,200 --> 04:04:09,200
He's got a, he's got a gay little sweater.

5453
04:04:09,200 --> 04:04:10,240
Look at that little twink.

5454
04:04:10,240 --> 04:04:12,000
Look at that little twink base.

5455
04:04:12,000 --> 04:04:13,920
That little, that little fruity boy.

5456
04:04:13,920 --> 04:04:15,600
That fruity little queer mo.

5457
04:04:16,400 --> 04:04:18,480
That fruity little, he's so effeminate.

5458
04:04:18,480 --> 04:04:20,400
We all, we train him to be homophobic.

5459
04:04:20,400 --> 04:04:22,960
This is how people, this is how your cousin see you, Ben.

5460
04:04:25,120 --> 04:04:26,960
Oh, look at the little gay boy.

5461
04:04:26,960 --> 04:04:28,160
He's a little gay boy.

5462
04:04:28,160 --> 04:04:28,720
This gay little sweater.

5463
04:04:28,720 --> 04:04:31,280
Oh, he's in a little, oh, he's in a little sweater.

5464
04:04:31,280 --> 04:04:33,520
Oh, he's got a little shoes on.

5465
04:04:36,560 --> 04:04:37,200
Sad.

5466
04:04:37,200 --> 04:04:38,960
He's got a little gay little podcast.

5467
04:04:40,000 --> 04:04:42,880
Oh, he's got a little, oh, he put a little YouTube video.

5468
04:04:42,880 --> 04:04:44,400
Oh, he made a little ad revenue.

5469
04:04:44,400 --> 04:04:46,000
That's nice for him.

5470
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:46,960
Sorry, I got, sorry.

5471
04:04:46,960 --> 04:04:49,760
I got to go do renovations on my house that I own.

5472
04:04:49,760 --> 04:04:52,640
Sorry, I got to go, I got to go arrest my tenant

5473
04:04:52,640 --> 04:04:54,240
and give him over to the police.

5474
04:04:54,240 --> 04:04:55,040
All right, bye.

5475
04:04:57,520 --> 04:04:59,520
Damn, I'm just jealous.

5476
04:04:59,520 --> 04:05:00,320
You know what?

5477
04:05:00,320 --> 04:05:02,160
I'm just, I'm just hating because I'm jealous.

5478
04:05:05,120 --> 04:05:06,400
Anyway, next voicemail.

5479
04:05:06,400 --> 04:05:07,200
Good thing you said.

5480
04:05:08,080 --> 04:05:10,480
Next, next voicemail is do it.

5481
04:05:10,480 --> 04:05:13,280
Good thing I said it so that nobody else can say it about me.

5482
04:05:14,080 --> 04:05:14,800
Did you post it?

5483
04:05:15,440 --> 04:05:17,920
I posted it just above the, it was above the cat image.

5484
04:05:17,920 --> 04:05:19,120
Oh, right.

5485
04:05:19,120 --> 04:05:22,480
Okay, three, two, one, go.

5486
04:05:23,440 --> 04:05:28,400
Please, please, please, Pokemon Park.

5487
04:05:29,600 --> 04:05:31,920
It's so fun.

5488
04:05:31,920 --> 04:05:33,360
Thank you, my big friends.

5489
04:05:34,160 --> 04:05:35,280
Pokemon Park.

5490
04:05:36,560 --> 04:05:36,880
What is that?

5491
04:05:36,880 --> 04:05:37,680
I believe it is that.

5492
04:05:37,680 --> 04:05:38,800
Is that a Switch game?

5493
04:05:40,320 --> 04:05:43,440
It's the one with like the Pokemon, like little wind up toys.

5494
04:05:44,960 --> 04:05:45,600
Wait, is it?

5495
04:05:46,320 --> 04:05:47,280
It's a theme park.

5496
04:05:47,840 --> 04:05:48,480
Pokemon Park?

5497
04:05:48,480 --> 04:05:49,040
No, wait.

5498
04:05:50,960 --> 04:05:52,240
What is Pokemon Park?

5499
04:05:52,880 --> 04:05:54,080
Can you hear my Google bit?

5500
04:05:54,080 --> 04:05:57,760
He also called it Pokemon Ranger.

5501
04:05:57,760 --> 04:05:59,280
No, I do not hear the cat purring.

5502
04:05:59,280 --> 04:06:00,000
Thank you very much.

5503
04:06:00,000 --> 04:06:01,040
And I would not like to.

5504
04:06:02,480 --> 04:06:04,480
Do not let me hear that cat purring.

5505
04:06:04,480 --> 04:06:06,880
Don't let that fucking cat purring.

5506
04:06:06,880 --> 04:06:08,240
There will be hell to pay.

5507
04:06:09,440 --> 04:06:10,240
What you gonna do?

5508
04:06:10,240 --> 04:06:11,120
You can't do nothing.

5509
04:06:11,120 --> 04:06:13,200
You're in Boston, bitch.

5510
04:06:13,200 --> 04:06:17,600
Okay, Pokemon Ranger is an action role-playing video game.

5511
04:06:20,720 --> 04:06:21,760
Oh, God.

5512
04:06:25,920 --> 04:06:29,200
It is radically different from the traditional Pokemon RPGs.

5513
04:06:29,200 --> 04:06:32,640
You control a Ranger in the Fiore region and catch Pokemon

5514
04:06:32,640 --> 04:06:35,120
by using a device called the Capture Styler,

5515
04:06:35,120 --> 04:06:36,720
which is controlled by the stylus.

5516
04:06:37,440 --> 04:06:39,760
The storyline of the game is set out in 10 main missions.

5517
04:06:40,640 --> 04:06:45,680
The only Pokemon that you have a Minon or a Plussel as your companion.

5518
04:06:47,600 --> 04:06:48,240
Wow, okay.

5519
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:50,880
So it's completely different.

5520
04:06:51,760 --> 04:06:52,720
That's kind of interesting.

5521
04:06:54,080 --> 04:06:54,560
Is it good?

5522
04:06:55,360 --> 04:06:56,560
This guy seems to think it's good.

5523
04:06:58,160 --> 04:07:01,040
I guess we'll get back to you on that.

5524
04:07:02,720 --> 04:07:05,440
Might take a look at it, perhaps.

5525
04:07:06,080 --> 04:07:07,520
Okay, all right.

5526
04:07:07,840 --> 04:07:10,880
So you like circle man up the stylus.

5527
04:07:11,600 --> 04:07:12,560
There's a lot of dragons.

5528
04:07:12,560 --> 04:07:14,480
There's a lot of dragons on the cover.

5529
04:07:14,480 --> 04:07:16,240
The cover is Charizard.

5530
04:07:16,240 --> 04:07:17,280
There's Kingdra.

5531
04:07:18,880 --> 04:07:22,320
There's Flygon and Salamence.

5532
04:07:23,280 --> 04:07:23,600
Wow.

5533
04:07:25,840 --> 04:07:27,760
Okay, anyway, what's the next one?

5534
04:07:28,720 --> 04:07:30,080
Next one is called Nome Talk.

5535
04:07:30,880 --> 04:07:33,600
Okay, three, two, one, go.

5536
04:07:35,360 --> 04:07:37,200
Oh, yeah, Nome Talk.

5537
04:07:37,200 --> 04:07:39,680
My favorite ancient gnome, Nome Chomsky.

5538
04:07:41,840 --> 04:07:43,840
Nome Chomsky's ancient?

5539
04:07:45,120 --> 04:07:47,280
No, my favorite Asian gnome.

5540
04:07:47,280 --> 04:07:48,640
Oh, ancient gnome.

5541
04:07:48,640 --> 04:07:49,280
I think it will be.

5542
04:07:52,640 --> 04:07:55,520
For a while, I was hearing people talk about Nome Chomsky a lot.

5543
04:07:55,520 --> 04:07:58,800
Haven't really heard much about him in the last year or so.

5544
04:07:58,800 --> 04:08:01,680
I feel like he kind of became a little less relevant.

5545
04:08:02,320 --> 04:08:10,800
Is Nome Chomsky the guy who is like pro-Russia in the war thing?

5546
04:08:12,240 --> 04:08:13,280
I'm not sure.

5547
04:08:13,280 --> 04:08:15,200
Was he like a cool guy who went cringe?

5548
04:08:15,200 --> 04:08:18,480
I feel like there's an old man, cool guy who went cringe on Russia.

5549
04:08:18,480 --> 04:08:20,800
I think you might be thinking of the guy, yeah.

5550
04:08:20,800 --> 04:08:26,400
I think he's still cool, just that his oldness has caused him to say cringe things.

5551
04:08:26,400 --> 04:08:28,240
I'm not really sure what his Russia take is.

5552
04:08:28,240 --> 04:08:33,680
I know that he's a leftoid and was kind of a lib.

5553
04:08:33,680 --> 04:08:35,280
And I remember he was very pro-Biden.

5554
04:08:35,280 --> 04:08:38,960
People were disappointed that he was very enthusiastically like,

5555
04:08:38,960 --> 04:08:42,880
you need to vote for Biden if it's even like, yeah,

5556
04:08:42,880 --> 04:08:44,960
it's bad that they didn't let Bernie run.

5557
04:08:45,520 --> 04:08:48,800
But you need to vote for Biden because climate change is such an important issue,

5558
04:08:50,720 --> 04:08:51,360
which is true.

5559
04:08:52,240 --> 04:08:55,200
And then, yeah, I don't know what is Russia.

5560
04:08:55,200 --> 04:08:57,920
I think I might have heard someone say that he's anti-NATO.

5561
04:08:58,960 --> 04:08:59,600
He's anti-NATO.

5562
04:08:59,600 --> 04:09:00,720
Yeah, that's it.

5563
04:09:00,720 --> 04:09:05,760
I think he's pro-Russia in the sense that he's not pro-Ukraine in the war

5564
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:07,200
and not pro-NATO.

5565
04:09:07,760 --> 04:09:13,040
And saying like, NATO caused Russia to, forced Russia to fight back.

5566
04:09:13,040 --> 04:09:14,080
And I'm like, eh.

5567
04:09:14,080 --> 04:09:14,720
Honestly, I mean maybe.

5568
04:09:14,720 --> 04:09:17,280
I've heard things that contradict that, so I don't know.

5569
04:09:17,280 --> 04:09:21,840
I have not, yeah, I don't really have, I can't really have a take on it.

5570
04:09:21,840 --> 04:09:26,000
There's like too much to that situation for me to even really be like,

5571
04:09:26,000 --> 04:09:28,640
I definitely disagree with that or not.

5572
04:09:30,720 --> 04:09:31,200
Next one?

5573
04:09:31,200 --> 04:09:31,760
Okay.

5574
04:09:31,760 --> 04:09:35,040
Next one is called white lander, but I misspelled it.

5575
04:09:35,680 --> 04:09:36,480
Who's lander?

5576
04:09:37,040 --> 04:09:38,400
Three, two, one, go.

5577
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:43,360
I just wanted to point out how funny it was when you thought that Argentina meant

5578
04:09:43,360 --> 04:09:45,360
white land because there is a meme.

5579
04:09:45,360 --> 04:09:51,600
The Argentina is white meme, which is based on how many white supremacists there are in Argentina.

5580
04:09:52,480 --> 04:09:58,960
Which is kind of funny because, well, you know, we, all of the countries in South America are

5581
04:09:58,960 --> 04:10:06,400
mixed race mostly and over half of the population in Argentina are, you know, First Nation.

5582
04:10:06,400 --> 04:10:08,000
So it's kind of weird.

5583
04:10:08,720 --> 04:10:15,120
There is so many white nationalists in Argentina who think that Argentina is both

5584
04:10:16,480 --> 04:10:17,680
like Aryan white.

5585
04:10:17,680 --> 04:10:20,160
I don't know what the fuck they think, honestly.

5586
04:10:20,160 --> 04:10:22,160
But it's, it made me laugh.

5587
04:10:22,160 --> 04:10:24,160
So that, okay.

5588
04:10:24,160 --> 04:10:25,920
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's the meme.

5589
04:10:25,920 --> 04:10:29,520
A lot of like Nazis escaped to Argentina after World War II.

5590
04:10:29,520 --> 04:10:30,560
That's what I was going to say.

5591
04:10:30,560 --> 04:10:35,200
Isn't that, isn't it the case that a lot of like, a lot of like Nazi people were fleeing

5592
04:10:35,200 --> 04:10:39,840
like the Nuremberg trials after World War II and a bunch of like Nazi Germans like

5593
04:10:39,840 --> 04:10:40,960
fled to Argentina?

5594
04:10:40,960 --> 04:10:41,840
I've heard that before.

5595
04:10:43,280 --> 04:10:43,520
Lol.

5596
04:10:43,520 --> 04:10:43,760
Yeah.

5597
04:10:44,560 --> 04:10:47,040
Did they go there because they thought it was the white place?

5598
04:10:47,600 --> 04:10:49,360
I, I don't think so.

5599
04:10:49,360 --> 04:10:54,560
No, I think I think I've heard about the government being super friendly to white supremacists

5600
04:10:55,680 --> 04:11:00,800
because like after the Civil War, apparently like a bunch of Confederates like went down

5601
04:11:00,800 --> 04:11:01,440
to South America.

5602
04:11:01,440 --> 04:11:02,640
Confederates?

5603
04:11:02,640 --> 04:11:03,040
Yeah.

5604
04:11:03,040 --> 04:11:04,800
Oh, that's the American Civil War, right?

5605
04:11:04,800 --> 04:11:05,840
Yeah, American Civil War.

5606
04:11:05,840 --> 04:11:06,720
They went down there.

5607
04:11:07,760 --> 04:11:12,160
I don't know if Argentina, but like somewhere in South America, I know there's like a whole

5608
04:11:12,160 --> 04:11:13,840
town that's like a Confederate town.

5609
04:11:15,520 --> 04:11:16,400
Crazy.

5610
04:11:16,400 --> 04:11:20,480
I know that different, I know, I know different countries in South America have different like

5611
04:11:21,280 --> 04:11:26,880
sort of like like racial makeups and in some countries it's more like the divide between

5612
04:11:26,880 --> 04:11:33,760
like Caucasian people and colored people is like broader and more distinct than it is in others.

5613
04:11:33,760 --> 04:11:39,280
And yeah, I think I was kind of, I did think I'd heard that specifically about like

5614
04:11:40,080 --> 04:11:41,600
Germans fled to Argentina.

5615
04:11:43,760 --> 04:11:44,560
Yeah, we're seeing them.

5616
04:11:45,520 --> 04:11:45,840
Yeah.

5617
04:11:46,400 --> 04:11:52,480
You ever seen that invincible meme where it's like, the caption is like, when you're

5618
04:11:53,600 --> 04:11:58,800
Argentinian grandson goes up to you and asks you why is his last name German?

5619
04:11:58,800 --> 04:12:03,760
And it's like, it's fucking of the man from invincible.

5620
04:12:03,760 --> 04:12:08,400
And he's like, it's like that one scene where he has to always telling a mark about like the

5621
04:12:08,400 --> 04:12:11,040
true plan of like invading the human race.

5622
04:12:11,040 --> 04:12:16,000
But of the man is like edited to look like like an old German man.

5623
04:12:16,400 --> 04:12:17,600
I don't think I've seen that one.

5624
04:12:17,600 --> 04:12:21,680
And I probably wouldn't get it because I because I haven't seen invincible.

5625
04:12:21,680 --> 04:12:22,240
But I have.

5626
04:12:22,240 --> 04:12:28,560
I've seen like similar memes like like never ask never ask a man his what he makes never ask

5627
04:12:28,560 --> 04:12:33,600
a woman her age, never ask a white Argentinian like what his grandparents were doing during

5628
04:12:33,600 --> 04:12:35,200
World War Two or something like that.

5629
04:12:37,200 --> 04:12:37,440
Law.

5630
04:12:38,480 --> 04:12:43,360
Every time I think about Argentinians that like Nazis, that's the Argentinian.

5631
04:12:43,360 --> 04:12:48,720
I think of that one scene in X-Men first class where Magneto is in Argentina.

5632
04:12:48,720 --> 04:12:51,600
Any fucking murders, both of those Nazis with his power.

5633
04:12:51,600 --> 04:12:52,720
That scene was so badass.

5634
04:12:53,680 --> 04:12:54,880
Which which one was that?

5635
04:12:54,880 --> 04:12:57,280
Which I think that was X-Men first class.

5636
04:12:58,000 --> 04:12:59,600
Okay, I didn't see that one.

5637
04:12:59,600 --> 04:13:01,920
Yeah, that was like part of the new reboots.

5638
04:13:01,920 --> 04:13:03,040
They did a couple years ago.

5639
04:13:03,040 --> 04:13:04,560
Those went to like shit real quick.

5640
04:13:06,160 --> 04:13:06,480
Yeah.

5641
04:13:09,280 --> 04:13:11,440
I don't I watched the old I watched the old ones.

5642
04:13:13,600 --> 04:13:14,800
I think I saw the first two.

5643
04:13:16,160 --> 04:13:21,520
I saw the one where they break Magneto out by giving him a little bit of they put the iron in

5644
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:22,720
that guy's blood.

5645
04:13:22,720 --> 04:13:24,640
Yeah, he sucks the iron out of his blood.

5646
04:13:24,640 --> 04:13:25,600
That was pretty good.

5647
04:13:25,600 --> 04:13:26,560
That scene was base.

5648
04:13:26,560 --> 04:13:31,280
I love my favorite scene in the first X-Men movie is like when Wolverine first meets all

5649
04:13:31,280 --> 04:13:36,000
the other X-Men and he like thinks that them having code names is so goofy.

5650
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:39,200
Yeah, he goes up to Professor X and he's like, what do they call you wheels?

5651
04:13:41,680 --> 04:13:42,720
What do they call you?

5652
04:13:42,720 --> 04:13:43,680
Wheels.

5653
04:13:43,680 --> 04:13:44,160
Abelist.

5654
04:13:44,720 --> 04:13:45,280
Abelist.

5655
04:13:45,920 --> 04:13:50,480
He was born in the 17th century.

5656
04:13:50,480 --> 04:13:51,520
He doesn't know any better.

5657
04:13:52,320 --> 04:13:53,520
Is he that old?

5658
04:13:53,520 --> 04:13:54,480
Yeah, he's old.

5659
04:13:54,480 --> 04:13:55,120
He didn't know that.

5660
04:13:55,120 --> 04:13:56,080
I knew he was really old.

5661
04:13:56,080 --> 04:13:56,960
I knew he was really old.

5662
04:13:56,960 --> 04:13:58,320
I didn't know he was that old.

5663
04:13:58,320 --> 04:13:58,800
Oh, he was.

5664
04:13:59,360 --> 04:14:00,160
I had no idea.

5665
04:14:00,160 --> 04:14:04,000
I thought he was just a guy who's one day got like bones of steel.

5666
04:14:04,640 --> 04:14:08,560
I thought he might have been like a hundred because like I know he's like extremely long

5667
04:14:08,560 --> 04:14:11,280
lived because of his regenerative factor.

5668
04:14:11,280 --> 04:14:11,920
Oh, of course.

5669
04:14:12,480 --> 04:14:15,280
Yeah, like since the 17th century.

5670
04:14:15,280 --> 04:14:16,160
He's been around.

5671
04:14:16,160 --> 04:14:16,800
And he's short.

5672
04:14:16,800 --> 04:14:22,080
He's like he's like a short stocky king in the in the comics and they sort of they sort of

5673
04:14:22,080 --> 04:14:24,640
made him look like more normal.

5674
04:14:24,640 --> 04:14:26,320
They kind of race that in the movies.

5675
04:14:26,960 --> 04:14:27,680
Yeah, right.

5676
04:14:27,680 --> 04:14:31,520
But and in the cartoon too, in the cartoon, he just looks the same as everyone.

5677
04:14:31,520 --> 04:14:33,920
I got the same build as Cyclops and everything.

5678
04:14:33,920 --> 04:14:34,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5679
04:14:36,160 --> 04:14:39,040
Yeah, he's been he's been around a while.

5680
04:14:40,000 --> 04:14:45,840
I think his I think his first appearance was in I think he first showed up in a whole comic

5681
04:14:45,840 --> 04:14:47,360
was when Wolverine first showed up.

5682
04:14:50,160 --> 04:14:51,760
Enough about Wolverine facts.

5683
04:14:51,760 --> 04:14:53,600
You guys want to go for the rest of the voicemail?

5684
04:14:53,600 --> 04:14:54,480
Let's do the next voicemail.

5685
04:14:54,480 --> 04:14:54,880
How many more?

5686
04:14:54,880 --> 04:14:56,240
We must have not many more to go.

5687
04:14:56,240 --> 04:14:57,840
This is the last one.

5688
04:14:57,840 --> 04:14:58,160
Nice.

5689
04:14:58,800 --> 04:14:59,760
Is the Vinnie comic.

5690
04:15:02,000 --> 04:15:03,040
The Vinnie comic of the week.

5691
04:15:03,040 --> 04:15:03,760
Oh, it's Vinnie.

5692
04:15:03,760 --> 04:15:04,080
Okay.

5693
04:15:04,720 --> 04:15:06,240
Tell me when it's loaded for you.

5694
04:15:06,400 --> 04:15:09,760
What what is this what is this?

5695
04:15:12,640 --> 04:15:18,080
Vinnie, you can't you can't you can't put words in my mouth like this.

5696
04:15:20,720 --> 04:15:22,320
It's it's still loading for me.

5697
04:15:22,320 --> 04:15:22,880
I'm sorry.

5698
04:15:23,440 --> 04:15:27,200
I'm going to make a comic like this and make Ben and Gibb be like,

5699
04:15:27,760 --> 04:15:30,080
actually, cheesy royalty was a badass idea.

5700
04:15:30,080 --> 04:15:32,000
You should totally do that base.

5701
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:36,960
I have a I have a funny feeling.

5702
04:15:36,960 --> 04:15:38,720
I have a feeling this one's going to be funny.

5703
04:15:39,280 --> 04:15:41,760
Okay, this guy recommended me on the anger too.

5704
04:15:41,760 --> 04:15:42,880
So you should look at this image.

5705
04:15:44,640 --> 04:15:45,520
That's pretty good.

5706
04:15:45,520 --> 04:15:46,720
Yeah, when I that's pretty good.

5707
04:15:47,440 --> 04:15:48,720
How much is that?

5708
04:15:48,720 --> 04:15:55,600
That is about that's got to be 200 and that's maybe like 250 or something.

5709
04:15:55,600 --> 04:15:57,760
That's got to be 30 pounds of dairy.

5710
04:15:58,400 --> 04:16:03,760
I think the blue and the yellow plates are 45.

5711
04:16:04,480 --> 04:16:07,360
And I think I'm not could be more, actually.

5712
04:16:08,400 --> 04:16:09,280
So it's pretty good.

5713
04:16:09,280 --> 04:16:10,960
That's way more than I could lift.

5714
04:16:12,720 --> 04:16:14,080
It's a respectable squat.

5715
04:16:15,280 --> 04:16:17,280
I am looking respectfully.

5716
04:16:17,280 --> 04:16:18,720
I am looking respectfully.

5717
04:16:18,720 --> 04:16:22,080
I'm looking for knowledge.

5718
04:16:22,080 --> 04:16:25,440
You see, I want to get to where this lady is.

5719
04:16:26,240 --> 04:16:28,720
And and good squat posture is important.

5720
04:16:28,720 --> 04:16:30,320
So I need to look at a lot of them.

5721
04:16:30,320 --> 04:16:32,560
And yeah, it's important.

5722
04:16:32,560 --> 04:16:37,200
Don't forget when when you get to here, you know, post plenty of pics online,

5723
04:16:37,200 --> 04:16:39,920
you know, we want to want to root for you.

5724
04:16:39,920 --> 04:16:41,120
We want to root for you, Gibb.

5725
04:16:41,120 --> 04:16:42,640
You know, we're yeah, yeah.

5726
04:16:42,640 --> 04:16:44,880
No, no, definitely, definitely.

5727
04:16:44,880 --> 04:16:46,800
Did I mention that I'm back to lifting?

5728
04:16:46,800 --> 04:16:48,080
Did I mention I'm lifting again?

5729
04:16:49,360 --> 04:16:49,840
I'm not.

5730
04:16:50,400 --> 04:16:51,040
That feels good.

5731
04:16:51,040 --> 04:16:54,880
I think you did mention I've been doing it for maybe like for maybe three weeks

5732
04:16:54,880 --> 04:16:55,920
for a month now.

5733
04:16:55,920 --> 04:16:58,640
And I'm it's fun.

5734
04:16:58,640 --> 04:16:59,280
I like it.

5735
04:16:59,280 --> 04:17:00,320
God fucking damn it.

5736
04:17:00,320 --> 04:17:00,960
OK, sorry.

5737
04:17:00,960 --> 04:17:04,880
I'm switching back to my hot mobile hotspot.

5738
04:17:04,880 --> 04:17:06,480
And maybe that will work this time.

5739
04:17:07,360 --> 04:17:09,360
You know, I'll be I'll be I'll be squatting this much.

5740
04:17:11,200 --> 04:17:16,320
In maybe in a few months.

5741
04:17:17,360 --> 04:17:20,320
And then just letting you know that if you're doing squats, you know,

5742
04:17:20,320 --> 04:17:24,480
post videos like these two, you know, because we're rooting for you out there.

5743
04:17:24,560 --> 04:17:27,680
Big man, because we're oh, yeah, OK, I want to be rooted for.

5744
04:17:28,400 --> 04:17:32,080
I want to be exactly, you know, we want to we want to admire the physique

5745
04:17:32,080 --> 04:17:33,200
that you're going for, right?

5746
04:17:35,040 --> 04:17:37,760
Uh, I want to be I want to be mired.

5747
04:17:37,760 --> 04:17:38,720
Yeah, I want to be mired.

5748
04:17:40,640 --> 04:17:42,640
OK, so it's just one image, right?

5749
04:17:43,680 --> 04:17:44,240
Yes.

5750
04:17:44,240 --> 04:17:48,720
OK, OK, so me go exhaling vape.

5751
04:17:48,720 --> 04:17:51,360
I love vapors in my lungs.

5752
04:17:52,800 --> 04:17:54,000
See, that seems true.

5753
04:17:54,080 --> 04:17:56,320
But then look, look at what I'm saying.

5754
04:17:56,320 --> 04:17:57,520
Tee hee, ha ha.

5755
04:17:57,520 --> 04:18:00,080
I love when Vinny sends me memes.

5756
04:18:00,080 --> 04:18:00,800
Heart react.

5757
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:02,560
I've never done that.

5758
04:18:03,440 --> 04:18:05,200
I've never once heart reacted.

5759
04:18:06,480 --> 04:18:07,840
Shake your DMs.

5760
04:18:07,840 --> 04:18:10,080
Vinny, Vinny sends me memes.

5761
04:18:10,080 --> 04:18:15,360
And once that occasionally I will have a comment in response.

5762
04:18:15,360 --> 04:18:16,960
Most of the time I do not.

5763
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:21,360
The memes have to be gold standard.

5764
04:18:21,360 --> 04:18:25,280
They have to be platinum memes for me to to even crack a smile.

5765
04:18:26,240 --> 04:18:28,480
I've got a I've got a very advanced palette.

5766
04:18:31,360 --> 04:18:35,600
Then I say, I wonder if Ben St would let me invite Vinny to an episode of the PCP.

5767
04:18:37,120 --> 04:18:38,080
Lol, maybe.

5768
04:18:39,040 --> 04:18:40,640
You know, this is exactly what I would say.

5769
04:18:40,640 --> 04:18:44,480
I can't believe you're always you're always wondering that you're all you're always

5770
04:18:44,480 --> 04:18:48,080
you're always wondering that as soon as the episode ends and we stop recording.

5771
04:18:48,080 --> 04:18:51,280
You're always asking me that and I'm always saying I know and I'm always

5772
04:18:51,440 --> 04:18:54,080
saying, you know, I was thinking the exact same thing.

5773
04:18:56,640 --> 04:18:57,680
We just never get around to it.

5774
04:18:57,680 --> 04:18:58,880
We just never get around to it.

5775
04:18:58,880 --> 04:19:04,480
Vinny needs to redraw this and I'm going to give his place and I'm like, ha ha.

5776
04:19:04,480 --> 04:19:05,360
He's so funny.

5777
04:19:06,000 --> 04:19:09,920
I wonder if Pan will be down with letting him be a guest on the pizza party podcast.

5778
04:19:10,560 --> 04:19:11,600
He's really so funny.

5779
04:19:12,640 --> 04:19:18,880
Pan should let me be the co-host of the pizza party podcast because all his co-hosts

5780
04:19:18,880 --> 04:19:20,640
have abandoned him and I will be loyal.

5781
04:19:21,680 --> 04:19:29,040
I will be I will be unflinchingly loyal to pizza pan if I can be his podcast.

5782
04:19:29,040 --> 04:19:29,920
Pizza pan.

5783
04:19:29,920 --> 04:19:36,240
I think I think pan has like it's pretty much on this that peanut boat.

5784
04:19:36,240 --> 04:19:38,000
Like he's not he's not leaving this.

5785
04:19:38,640 --> 04:19:43,920
And I think I think that's like two things because like one like that peanut will do

5786
04:19:43,920 --> 04:19:46,080
everything for him, right?

5787
04:19:46,160 --> 04:19:48,400
Which is like, oh, thank God for him.

5788
04:19:48,400 --> 04:19:49,200
Right.

5789
04:19:49,200 --> 04:19:52,080
And also like like Daph is never going to like.

5790
04:19:53,280 --> 04:19:59,360
Daph is kind of like, oh, a weird like kind of yes man to pan and also like he's popular.

5791
04:20:00,000 --> 04:20:00,240
Right.

5792
04:20:00,240 --> 04:20:01,680
It's that's good for pan too.

5793
04:20:03,360 --> 04:20:05,840
Well, I see the appeal.

5794
04:20:05,840 --> 04:20:07,920
So I guess I can't compete with that.

5795
04:20:09,360 --> 04:20:14,320
Ben, do you think you could do you think you could bring up a topic to pan pizza?

5796
04:20:14,320 --> 04:20:16,000
And then he says, yeah, yeah.

5797
04:20:16,000 --> 04:20:18,480
And then you bring up another topic right after.

5798
04:20:18,480 --> 04:20:19,680
Do you think you have that skill?

5799
04:20:20,320 --> 04:20:21,200
Yeah, I think so.

5800
04:20:21,200 --> 04:20:22,240
Yeah, I think I got it.

5801
04:20:22,240 --> 04:20:23,440
Yeah, I think I damn.

5802
04:20:24,080 --> 04:20:31,040
Damn, are you telling me that I could do I should do what he does and he should clean my balls?

5803
04:20:32,560 --> 04:20:32,880
Yes.

5804
04:20:36,240 --> 04:20:38,880
That's so funny because he's cleaning pan pizzas balls.

5805
04:20:38,880 --> 04:20:41,040
And so you'll be doing that too.

5806
04:20:42,000 --> 04:20:45,520
If those balls will be spotless, you'll be able to see your face in them.

5807
04:20:46,800 --> 04:20:50,320
I want to I want to be able to eat off those balls because that's what I'm going to do

5808
04:20:50,320 --> 04:20:52,080
after this podcast is over.

5809
04:20:52,640 --> 04:20:55,920
He needs them balls nice and clean before neon coffee comes to visit.

5810
04:20:56,800 --> 04:20:57,920
He's a spotless man.

5811
04:21:00,160 --> 04:21:02,880
Well, if you're the man for the job, you gotta.

5812
04:21:02,880 --> 04:21:04,960
What would what would what would Vinny have?

5813
04:21:04,960 --> 04:21:08,480
What would Vinny even have to say on on on the PCP?

5814
04:21:09,680 --> 04:21:10,800
What does he want to be a guest for?

5815
04:21:10,880 --> 04:21:11,840
What does he want to talk about?

5816
04:21:13,520 --> 04:21:16,720
He says he says I wonder if Ben St would let me invite Vinny to an episode of the PCP.

5817
04:21:16,720 --> 04:21:17,200
But why?

5818
04:21:18,160 --> 04:21:18,640
But why?

5819
04:21:19,760 --> 04:21:21,680
Vinny is just inflating his own ego.

5820
04:21:21,680 --> 04:21:24,960
He wants to believe that I would say this.

5821
04:21:27,120 --> 04:21:30,320
Vinny, I love your comics, but I don't know.

5822
04:21:30,320 --> 04:21:30,960
Vinny, baby.

5823
04:21:30,960 --> 04:21:32,800
I mean, I guess you could give a good guess.

5824
04:21:32,800 --> 04:21:34,080
What's there to say?

5825
04:21:34,080 --> 04:21:34,800
What's there to say?

5826
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:39,360
It's just funny that you would make me say it in a comic.

5827
04:21:41,520 --> 04:21:44,320
I'm not actually to against it.

5828
04:21:44,320 --> 04:21:47,200
It's just I don't know why it's it's down down here.

5829
04:21:47,200 --> 04:21:50,000
It says I drew this real quick Saturday night on my tablet.

5830
04:21:50,000 --> 04:21:54,000
You've probably forgot, but I have sent in picture I've drawn on my tablet to the PCP before.

5831
04:21:55,120 --> 04:22:00,480
The one there was with CWC Sonichu with the shadow of a dick cast over her face.

5832
04:22:00,480 --> 04:22:01,680
Oh, that was you.

5833
04:22:01,680 --> 04:22:02,880
OK, I do remember that one.

5834
04:22:03,440 --> 04:22:08,320
Then there was the samurai baby, you know, in the ninja outfit with face covered by mask.

5835
04:22:08,320 --> 04:22:09,680
No, sexy law.

5836
04:22:09,680 --> 04:22:10,480
No, sexy.

5837
04:22:11,440 --> 04:22:13,360
OK. Oh, yeah, I do remember that.

5838
04:22:13,360 --> 04:22:14,240
I do remember that.

5839
04:22:16,400 --> 04:22:16,800
OK.

5840
04:22:18,160 --> 04:22:20,560
You know, I think there is another one.

5841
04:22:20,560 --> 04:22:22,640
I think we got a last minute voice.

5842
04:22:22,640 --> 04:22:25,760
Yes, is it Yo Sly Mernalia?

5843
04:22:25,760 --> 04:22:26,000
Yeah.

5844
04:22:27,840 --> 04:22:28,960
Should I post it?

5845
04:22:28,960 --> 04:22:30,000
I'll post it.

5846
04:22:30,000 --> 04:22:30,800
Yeah, I got it.

5847
04:22:31,440 --> 04:22:31,760
Sweet.

5848
04:22:32,480 --> 04:22:33,920
Let's see if it works.

5849
04:22:33,920 --> 04:22:35,440
Three, two, one, go.

5850
04:22:36,400 --> 04:22:39,040
Yo Sly Mernalia, everybody.

5851
04:22:39,200 --> 04:22:41,760
Hey, just calling in, checking in, letting you know,

5852
04:22:41,760 --> 04:22:43,840
join the PCP Minecraft server.

5853
04:22:43,840 --> 04:22:47,120
Just like the last few years, we're doing a little wish list, you know,

5854
04:22:47,120 --> 04:22:51,520
send type out your wish list, send it to Phoebus or I think it was mage.

5855
04:22:51,520 --> 04:22:52,480
I think that was the lore.

5856
04:22:53,200 --> 04:22:55,760
But yeah, you know, get some cool items for your Minecraft.

5857
04:22:55,760 --> 04:22:58,880
Oh, cheat, cheat, some Pokemon stuff, whatever.

5858
04:22:58,880 --> 04:22:59,440
I don't know.

5859
04:22:59,440 --> 04:22:59,760
Fuck it.

5860
04:23:01,120 --> 04:23:05,120
Have a good one or whatever the hell you celebrate as long as it's Sly Mernalia.

5861
04:23:07,040 --> 04:23:07,840
Right.

5862
04:23:07,840 --> 04:23:13,280
Remember, was it, was there a, was there a Sly Mernalia event last year?

5863
04:23:15,840 --> 04:23:17,840
I actually don't remember.

5864
04:23:17,840 --> 04:23:21,360
There must have been, but I don't know whether we knew about it.

5865
04:23:21,360 --> 04:23:24,480
I don't remember if it was last year, but I do remember doing some,

5866
04:23:24,480 --> 04:23:28,640
some holiday festivities in the, in the PCP Minecraft server.

5867
04:23:29,600 --> 04:23:30,080
Yeah.

5868
04:23:30,080 --> 04:23:34,240
That may have been Easter of last year or something.

5869
04:23:34,240 --> 04:23:36,400
There was like a rabbit catching thing.

5870
04:23:36,400 --> 04:23:42,560
How does, how does eggs, how does someone join the, the Minecraft server?

5871
04:23:44,000 --> 04:23:46,080
I mean, I guess if you're a patron, right?

5872
04:23:46,080 --> 04:23:48,560
If you're a patron, you get access to the Minecraft server.

5873
04:23:48,560 --> 04:23:55,040
I'm pretty sure Marin, I'm pretty sure Marin just lets people in again, against our will.

5874
04:23:55,680 --> 04:24:02,000
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure Marin is just, is just, is just going behind our back

5875
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:03,680
and over our heads on that one.

5876
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:05,840
And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not even.

5877
04:24:06,320 --> 04:24:09,680
I'm not even, I'm not actually that mad, although I should be, but I'm not.

5878
04:24:10,720 --> 04:24:11,280
So whatever.

5879
04:24:12,480 --> 04:24:15,840
Marin will get you into the PCP Minecraft, but please become a patron also.

5880
04:24:16,800 --> 04:24:19,440
Maybe we should just let people into the PCP Minecraft server.

5881
04:24:19,440 --> 04:24:22,000
Maybe we should just not make that exclusive anymore.

5882
04:24:23,440 --> 04:24:29,280
Because the, the, the, the, the, the upshot of that is just that there were very few people

5883
04:24:29,280 --> 04:24:33,120
in the server and that's, that's kind of not really beneficial to it.

5884
04:24:34,080 --> 04:24:38,720
Because most people who are patrons are not patrons specifically for the Minecraft server.

5885
04:24:39,520 --> 04:24:40,800
So maybe we should just open that up.

5886
04:24:42,000 --> 04:24:42,880
I think it'd be good.

5887
04:24:42,880 --> 04:24:43,520
Marin, let's just-

5888
04:24:43,520 --> 04:24:44,720
It'd be fun to see people around.

5889
04:24:44,720 --> 04:24:45,200
Yeah, Marin.

5890
04:24:45,200 --> 04:24:48,080
Maybe it'll get more people interested in the streams as well.

5891
04:24:48,080 --> 04:24:49,360
Let's just, I'll just say it.

5892
04:24:49,360 --> 04:24:51,760
Marin, just let anyone into the fucking Minecraft server.

5893
04:24:51,760 --> 04:24:54,000
It's not, it's not an exclusive patron thing anymore.

5894
04:24:54,000 --> 04:24:54,800
Don't worry about it.

5895
04:24:56,400 --> 04:24:58,960
Okay, it's, that's it.

5896
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:00,880
Thanks for the voicemail.

5897
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:03,600
Uh, I guess that's the end.

5898
04:25:06,000 --> 04:25:07,920
So I'll ask you one more time.

5899
04:25:08,560 --> 04:25:14,800
Did anything interesting happen to you this week?

5900
04:25:15,520 --> 04:25:15,920
To me?

5901
04:25:17,120 --> 04:25:17,600
Everyone.

5902
04:25:18,400 --> 04:25:21,520
I, um, I finished rough drafting Ms. Nick Paglacci.

5903
04:25:21,520 --> 04:25:23,040
That's coming out next month.

5904
04:25:23,040 --> 04:25:24,480
Oh, yeah.

5905
04:25:24,480 --> 04:25:25,520
The what thing?

5906
04:25:25,520 --> 04:25:27,120
Nick Paglacci is coming out.

5907
04:25:28,400 --> 04:25:29,360
Nick Paglacci?

5908
04:25:29,360 --> 04:25:33,760
First of all, I'm like 90% sure it's pronounced Paglacci.

5909
04:25:33,760 --> 04:25:36,240
Yeah, bitch, I bet it's pronounced that way, motherfucker.

5910
04:25:36,240 --> 04:25:36,720
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

5911
04:25:36,720 --> 04:25:38,000
I bet you pronounce it that way.

5912
04:25:39,360 --> 04:25:45,920
But it's, uh, yeah, that's, um, it's the opera, the clown opera Paglacci,

5913
04:25:46,480 --> 04:25:49,920
but drawn with the McDonald's past.

5914
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:52,560
Yeah, it's starting the Ronald McDonald gang.

5915
04:25:53,760 --> 04:25:59,120
I, uh, I think I told you that I thought that was a really funny premise a long time ago.

5916
04:25:59,840 --> 04:26:01,440
I'm glad you're finally doing it.

5917
04:26:01,440 --> 04:26:02,000
Yeah.

5918
04:26:02,000 --> 04:26:02,240
Yep.

5919
04:26:02,240 --> 04:26:03,920
It's all done in rough draft.

5920
04:26:03,920 --> 04:26:05,600
I just actually got to draw it.

5921
04:26:05,600 --> 04:26:10,560
And then I'm going to, if Twitter is not dead by the time this video's out,

5922
04:26:10,560 --> 04:26:13,840
I'm pretty sure, like, I don't know, the whole thing with like, oh, you can't link other sites

5923
04:26:13,840 --> 04:26:16,320
or blah, blah, blah, I'm pretty sure they're going to change that in a couple of hours.

5924
04:26:16,320 --> 04:26:17,600
Yeah, I think so too.

5925
04:26:17,600 --> 04:26:19,040
That's too fucking stupid.

5926
04:26:19,040 --> 04:26:20,640
It's the stupidest fucking move ever.

5927
04:26:22,640 --> 04:26:26,080
But if Twitter is not dead, I'm going to be posting that on Twitter.

5928
04:26:26,080 --> 04:26:27,760
And then how was that?

5929
04:26:27,760 --> 04:26:28,880
How long is it?

5930
04:26:28,960 --> 04:26:31,200
It's going to be, uh, it's going to be 60 pages.

5931
04:26:32,080 --> 04:26:33,040
Oh, wow.

5932
04:26:33,040 --> 04:26:34,000
God damn.

5933
04:26:34,000 --> 04:26:38,640
But, um, yeah, I think I could crank this up pretty good because it's not going to be

5934
04:26:38,640 --> 04:26:39,280
a black and white.

5935
04:26:39,280 --> 04:26:40,960
It's going to be a red and white.

5936
04:26:41,840 --> 04:26:42,400
Yeah.

5937
04:26:42,400 --> 04:26:42,640
Yeah.

5938
04:26:43,520 --> 04:26:44,400
Oh, like downwell.

5939
04:26:45,120 --> 04:26:48,960
It's going to be red and slightly yellowish white.

5940
04:26:50,160 --> 04:26:50,960
You know.

5941
04:26:50,960 --> 04:26:51,760
Really?

5942
04:26:51,760 --> 04:26:52,560
Like no black?

5943
04:26:53,520 --> 04:26:58,480
Uh, no, because I'm trying to like imitate like Ronald McDonald colors.

5944
04:26:58,880 --> 04:27:03,120
But like, I guess kind of like how the wrapper looks like when you order a burger.

5945
04:27:03,120 --> 04:27:03,440
Kind of.

5946
04:27:04,240 --> 04:27:06,080
Um, oh, I see.

5947
04:27:06,640 --> 04:27:10,080
I mean, you, you should use, you should use, you should use red on white, but with like

5948
04:27:10,080 --> 04:27:12,480
yellow dots for like screen tones.

5949
04:27:12,480 --> 04:27:13,360
Oh, I don't know.

5950
04:27:13,360 --> 04:27:15,040
I'm just, I'm just throwing out ideas here.

5951
04:27:15,040 --> 04:27:21,520
I, um, I did, um, I drew like a little test image for what the characters would look like.

5952
04:27:21,520 --> 04:27:22,560
I don't know if you saw it.

5953
04:27:22,560 --> 04:27:23,600
I think I read it.

5954
04:27:23,600 --> 04:27:25,040
I don't think, I don't think so.

5955
04:27:25,680 --> 04:27:26,000
Yeah.

5956
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:29,920
But, um, it was kind of like, yeah, it was just to see like, okay, this is kind of like

5957
04:27:29,920 --> 04:27:31,920
the style I'm going to go for in the comic.

5958
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:36,880
I mean, it's going to be as cartoon, cartoon-y as like everything else I've been doing, you know.

5959
04:27:37,440 --> 04:27:37,840
Yeah.

5960
04:27:37,840 --> 04:27:38,400
So, um,

5961
04:27:38,400 --> 04:27:39,280
Sure.

5962
04:27:39,280 --> 04:27:44,240
And, um, I'm pretty sure it kind of get out pretty quickly because there's not going to be no color in it.

5963
04:27:44,960 --> 04:27:45,440
And, um,

5964
04:27:46,240 --> 04:27:47,360
I think that's really funny.

5965
04:27:47,920 --> 04:27:48,880
I think that's going to be cool.

5966
04:27:49,760 --> 04:27:50,480
I think you'll like it.

5967
04:27:50,480 --> 04:27:52,400
You'll finally, you'll finally be proud of me.

5968
04:27:53,680 --> 04:27:54,240
It lasts.

5969
04:27:54,880 --> 04:27:55,760
Right.

5970
04:27:55,760 --> 04:27:56,240
Okay.

5971
04:27:56,240 --> 04:27:56,560
All right.

5972
04:27:57,520 --> 04:27:58,560
I think they're right there.

5973
04:27:59,440 --> 04:28:00,560
The way they look like.

5974
04:28:00,560 --> 04:28:00,880
Yeah.

5975
04:28:02,320 --> 04:28:02,720
All right.

5976
04:28:03,280 --> 04:28:04,160
Uh, I don't know.

5977
04:28:04,160 --> 04:28:05,120
I'll keep an eye on for that.

5978
04:28:05,120 --> 04:28:06,480
I think let's, let's wrap up.

5979
04:28:07,280 --> 04:28:07,840
All right.

5980
04:28:07,840 --> 04:28:10,240
Hey, hey listeners, become a patron.

5981
04:28:10,960 --> 04:28:11,360
Sorry.

5982
04:28:11,360 --> 04:28:12,160
I just, uh,

5983
04:28:12,160 --> 04:28:14,800
unexclusive your exclusive, uh, uh,

5984
04:28:14,800 --> 04:28:16,480
PCP Minecraft server access.

5985
04:28:16,480 --> 04:28:17,360
Sorry about that.

5986
04:28:17,360 --> 04:28:18,720
Become a patron anyway.

5987
04:28:19,360 --> 04:28:19,760
For bonus content.

5988
04:28:19,760 --> 04:28:24,000
And get access to the exclusive bonus podcasts.

5989
04:28:24,080 --> 04:28:24,560
Yes.

5990
04:28:24,560 --> 04:28:25,280
Episodes.

5991
04:28:25,760 --> 04:28:29,920
Um, when Nate, you know,

5992
04:28:29,920 --> 04:28:32,720
I asked Nate for a status update on the,

5993
04:28:33,840 --> 04:28:36,080
on the OVA and he has not responded.

5994
04:28:37,360 --> 04:28:37,920
Oh yeah.

5995
04:28:37,920 --> 04:28:38,560
I saw.

5996
04:28:38,560 --> 04:28:40,000
But, uh, I assume he will.

5997
04:28:40,800 --> 04:28:41,920
And, uh, whenever that's done,

5998
04:28:41,920 --> 04:28:44,320
we are definitely going to have some bonus stuff to do.

5999
04:28:44,320 --> 04:28:44,960
I have some, we should,

6000
04:28:44,960 --> 04:28:46,960
we should make some bonus stuff related to that.

6001
04:28:47,600 --> 04:28:48,480
Um, nothing new.

6002
04:28:48,480 --> 04:28:49,440
Commentary tricks.

6003
04:28:49,440 --> 04:28:50,720
Nothing new for a little bit,

6004
04:28:50,720 --> 04:28:52,000
but there's all the old stuff

6005
04:28:52,000 --> 04:28:53,680
and there will be new commentaries

6006
04:28:53,680 --> 04:28:55,200
and there will be new bonus content

6007
04:28:55,760 --> 04:28:57,520
in the not too distant future.

6008
04:28:57,520 --> 04:28:59,280
So become a patron if you like.

6009
04:29:00,320 --> 04:29:00,960
Uh,

6010
04:29:00,960 --> 04:29:04,080
Where's the status update of when is Nate coming back?

6011
04:29:04,080 --> 04:29:05,280
That's what I don't know.

6012
04:29:05,280 --> 04:29:05,920
I don't know.

6013
04:29:05,920 --> 04:29:08,000
He months ago,

6014
04:29:08,000 --> 04:29:09,680
he said he was going to start working on it

6015
04:29:09,680 --> 04:29:11,120
and then he didn't start working on it.

6016
04:29:11,120 --> 04:29:12,160
And then he finally said,

6017
04:29:12,160 --> 04:29:13,680
okay, I'm going to start working on it.

6018
04:29:13,680 --> 04:29:14,880
And then like a month later,

6019
04:29:14,880 --> 04:29:17,280
he said, okay, I've started working on it.

6020
04:29:18,640 --> 04:29:20,080
And so I don't know.

6021
04:29:20,640 --> 04:29:21,920
He says he's working on it,

6022
04:29:21,920 --> 04:29:23,600
but I don't know if he is or not.

6023
04:29:25,200 --> 04:29:26,480
That's the status update.

6024
04:29:29,120 --> 04:29:30,720
Uh, yeah.

6025
04:29:30,720 --> 04:29:31,040
Okay.

6026
04:29:31,040 --> 04:29:32,240
Anyway, let's end the episode.

6027
04:29:33,600 --> 04:29:34,000
All right.

6028
04:29:35,680 --> 04:29:35,920
Okay.

6029
04:29:35,920 --> 04:29:36,480
Bye.

6030
04:29:36,480 --> 04:29:37,440
It's the end.

Thanks.

6032
04:29:37,760 --> 04:29:38,400
