00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Poopcast.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm the best guy ever. Man, that was a killer joke. Nailed it.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,480
He really is the best guy ever.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
The best poop ever. Oh, he did it again.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
Yeah, he just keeps going nuts with that.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,160
He just can't stop himself.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,080
Here's Ben Saint is here.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,880
Yeah, I am. Hi, fucker.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,200
As is Mumkey Jones.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,440
Cut my dick into pieces. This is my last showed.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,280
And Digibro.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
I woke up, I jacked my dick, and I came on the show.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,440
You came on the show.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
That's what you needed that half an hour for?

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
No, I jacked up before that half an hour.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,800
Give me like 10 seconds and I'll do that shit real quick.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,520
You're really pushing my times up there, Ben.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm not trying to like get fucking candles out and like fucking edge for the afternoon.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:08,400
Can I just say that this is the first episode of PCP where I don't respect any of the co-hosts, even a little bit.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
That's good. We tried to get Mage on, but she's busy.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
Usually we have like a Mage or a Jess or a hippo, but today it's just like the worst of the bunch.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah, yeah, this basket of deplorables here.

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,000
It's hashtag worst cast.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,320
So today's a special day for the PCP, because this will be our 50th episode.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Oh fuck.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,080
How about that shit?

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,640
Not counting the special bonus episode.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,200
Whoa.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,800
Well that's true, of course.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,760

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,720
And if you want to hear the highly anticipated Shrek versus Harry Potter throwdown,

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
I forgot, I forgot that's what it was.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,600
That's what it was.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
Oh, it's a glorious time.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,480

00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,040
There you go.

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,200
Do what you need, do what you gotta do.

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,520
And we don't know what's leprechaun into hood.

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,280
That's right.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
And who knows what we'll do for the bonus episode next time.

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
We'll let you know.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
Anyway, so we're talking about travel today.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
Travel is the topic.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Yeah, because Monkey was just traveling.

49
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
He got home from traveling two hours ago, right?

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah, Nate, can I tell my own fucking story?

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,880
Jesus Christ.

52
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,240
All right, all right, I'm just leading in.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,120
Go on, go on.

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm transitioning.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm in the perfect condition to record a podcast about travel,

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,160
because I am right now the embodiment of how travel affects a person.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,240
I am very sick and tired and my throat is all fucked.

58
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,840
And I can't even focus for more than like 30 seconds at a time

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,400
on anything because I woke up so early to travel.

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
So I'm very excited to talk about travel today and all the pros and cons

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,920
and cons and negatives and cons and bad parts.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
So just tell us, where did you leave from and where did you arrive?

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
How long was this travel time?

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,880
I started off in North Carolina and I took a plane to Chicago

65
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,480
and then I took a plane here to Iowa.

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
So it's not the longest I've been on.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
I mean, the longest travel time, we'll get into that later.

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
But this one was only five or six hours,

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
but I'm mostly just tired because I had to get up at like four in the morning.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,080
Yep, yep.

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,200
I am also the embodiment of travel now because I just ate a pop tart

72
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,960
and got out of bed and walked over to your desk.

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,640
Stellar, stellar.

74
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
No, just now, like as we were recording, I have been eating a pop tart.

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,040
And I think that the only time I usually eat pop tarts is in travel

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,400
because it's a very convenient food to take with you, you know,

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
stuff. So I'm in your backpack or something.

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,960
When I travel, I always find that I eat a shit ton when I'm traveling.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,160
I go to like fucking gross restaurants and I buy tons of shitty food and I eat it all

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,840
because it's like a vacation.

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
It's like a little fucking, I'm in transition.

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,360
What I do on this at this point in my life doesn't matter.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,800
So I'll just go to like when I used to travel from home to college,

84
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,680
I would get on the fucking train from Providence to New York or something

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
and then take a bus from New York to New Jersey or something, whatever.

86
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,640
It doesn't matter.

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah, I did that too.

88
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,960
Point, yeah, point is I was stopped in New York and I would walk around

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
and I would fucking eat Krispy Kreme.

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
I would go and look for Krispy Kreme and fucking Penn Station

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,640
and I would eat Krispy Kreme because it was the only time

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
because they didn't have them in Massachusetts back then.

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,160
Penn Station had a good selection.

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,400
They had this good deep dish pizza I would get.

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
Penn Station is a great station.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
One time I'd missed my train and I got stuck there overnight

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,480
and I had to sit slumped against a wall for an entire night.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,080
That's like my worst nightmare.

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,200
It happened.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,120
I had to sit slumped against a wall while fucking literally insane homeless people,

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
like swandered around like zombies.

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,400
You were SpongeBob in the rock bottom episode.

103
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,840
Yeah, I think so.

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,240
You were an urban street warrior for one night.

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
It was rough.

106
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Since Davoo's not here on this episode, he said he didn't have enough to say about travel,

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,160
I guess, but I will share a similar story of his, which is that when he was flying back

108
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,360
after the events that transpired, which inspired the how we lost our virginity episode,

109
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,360
on his way back, his plane, they just, I guess they were repairing it.

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
He had to stay in the airport overnight.

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
Like almost a whole 20 hours or so that he was stuck in this airport

112
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
and they gave him like a bunch of vouchers for shit.

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,640
And I guess they had given him a voucher for a hotel room, like, you know,

114
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,960
the connected to the airport one, but he didn't take it because he was afraid

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,440
that he would sleep through alarms and not make his flight again.

116
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
So instead he opted 20 hours.

117
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,040
Yeah.

118
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,160
He opted to sleep in the airport instead, like to just lay on chairs and shit

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
and use their food vouchers and stuff.

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
So you know what airline that was?

121
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm just curious.

122
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,800
I have no idea.

123
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
Southwest probably.

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,520
Yeah, that's the question based off of that that I'd like to open up to the panel.

125
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you guys sleep when you're traveling?

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,920
Because personally, if I'm in the middle of traveling, like I can't sleep on the plane.

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
I can't sleep in the airport.

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,520
I can't sleep anywhere until I get to my destination.

129
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,480
I can only sleep if I am dead fucking tired, which has been the case a lot of the times,

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,640
but I have to be like killed.

131
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I have a really hard time sleeping on buses and trains and planes and stuff.

132
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,880
So sometimes when I travel, I plan it so that I just don't sleep the night before.

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
So I'll have been up for like fucking 40 straight hours when I get on the bus.

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,320
And then I can fucking sleep on the trip.

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,120
I've tried things like that, and sometimes that doesn't mean I'll pass out.

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,600
It doesn't always, but it helps.

137
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,640
Every year that I go to Baltimore for Otacon, my cousin Boyd drives the car.

138
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
It's usually my car, but he drives.

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,920
And it's a four and a half hour to five hour drive.

140
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,480
And I usually am so excited about the con that I won't sleep for the night before.

141
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,440
And I'm thinking, I'll just sleep in the car on the way there.

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,040
And it never happens.

143
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Like I'll be sitting there like utterly wracked with tiredness.

144
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,840
Like all I could think about is how badly I want to sleep.

145
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,200
But something about being in a car, I just can't do it.

146
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,800
And then somehow after Otacon's over and we're on the way home,

147
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
I pass out like a fucking, you know, I go out like a light and I'm just done the whole way back

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,000
because I'm just too physically out from having not really slept through most of the convention.

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Oh, I hear you.

150
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
I hear you, my gay brother.

151
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,120
I am with you 100% in all of your endeavors.

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,440
Well, hey, I was going to say, you're welcome.

153
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
Yeah, it's been a very supportive guy.

154
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,400
In the, when I was traveling, I had some experience like that.

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Well, okay, when I, when I, I have a very easy time sleeping.

156
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
You are on planes.

157
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,840
You used to fuck.

158
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
You used to fucking when we would, when we would stay up and watch adult swim,

159
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
you would fucking pass out way early.

160
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
You would miss all the latest anime.

161
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,240
I would.

162
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,200
That's something.

163
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,800
I think the reason me and my friends had that very, uh,

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,640
like my cousin is one of those guys who you can like see him fully asleep and snoring,

165
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,480
but he will insist he didn't fall asleep, like no matter what.

166
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,000
He'd be like, no, I wasn't sleeping, man.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,640
I wasn't sleeping.

168
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,680
I was just pressing my eyes.

169
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,720
I kind of feel like that.

170
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Like I think when me and Ben would be up watching anime late, like he would say,

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,360
are you asleep?

172
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
And like I had been like mostly unconscious, but I would like

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
flood her open my eyes and like see something on the screen.

174
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
He'd be like, no, I'm, I'm totally awake right now.

175
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah.

176
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,640
He would, he would like, he would like argue with you about it, that he wasn't asleep,

177
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,960
even though it was like, it was blatantly true.

178
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,480
But the reason is, because all of us had a certain like shame that we had missed the

179
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,240
animes, you know, like, like, like, like, like the one thing that we all cared about in life

180
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
was getting to watch anime, but it all airs at this late ass time period.

181
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
And so if you didn't make it to the end, if you didn't make it to 2am when they

182
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
restarted and do all the shows again, that it's like, oh, you, you fucking,

183
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
you just couldn't do it, man.

184
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,560
Like your passion wasn't strong enough, you know, if you were that, if you really cared,

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,520
you would have made it all the way through and powered through the sleep.

186
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,360
So I think that's why we, you know, none of us were accusing each other of that.

187
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
But I think that's what we were afraid of.

188
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,000
On the subject of sleeping while traveling, I did fucking buy a case of some like over

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,800
the counter sleeping pills, which I think just have like melanin or melatonin or whatever

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
the fucking sleeping thing is.

191
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
And sometimes I take those and I don't know if they actually help, but they feel like

192
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
they help and that's good enough.

193
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
So I would recommend those.

194
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
I hate the thing about the problem with sleeping while traveling.

195
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
The biggest problem by far is getting my head in a comfortable resting position.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,480
Yeah.

197
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,040
Who else?

198
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,680
I mean, when you're on the plane, I always credit at the windows.

199
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
I just like looking at the window and like you always do the thing where your head is

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
like, I put it against the window, but there's like hard plastic there.

201
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
You kind of lean it back, but then your, your head will fucking be at a weird uncomfortable

202
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
angle where it's kind of like angling off your torso.

203
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,920
Cause it, it finally falls into that little like crack there and it's the worst.

204
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,400
And that's why they have travel pills, I guess.

205
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,800
I've been, I've been traveling a bunch lately.

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,720
I've been taking long ass bus rides to and from Atlanta and I've found some techniques.

207
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,240
I bring a blanket and I fucking tuck the blanket up behind my head because if I have that,

208
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,640
if I have that, then I can fucking rest my head against the crevice between window and

209
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,400
seats, which would otherwise be horribly uncomfortable and bumpy,

210
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,040
but with the blanket is quite tolerable.

211
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,640
And then I sit cross ways along the seat, take up both seats because fuck letting anyone sit next to me.

212
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,120
And I put down the armrest and I put my feet up against the armrest.

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
So I'm kind of squeeze myself into the, into the seat space,

214
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,080
kind of sandwiched in between the wall of the bus and the armrest with my head up in the blanket.

215
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,400
And that is pretty tolerable, highly recommended.

216
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,200
I hate squishing my legs when I'm trying to sleep.

217
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
It's very uncomfortable.

218
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,160
I feel like I need to be a little squished.

219
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,280
Really?

220
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,520
Yeah.

221
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,280
I'd like curl up a little bit.

222
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,960
Well, not always, but sometimes.

223
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Should we all tell these stories of our individual biggest travel expeditions?

224
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes, let's do that.

225
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah, we can talk about our bullshit if you want.

226
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,400
Okay.

227
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,920
Me too.

228
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
Monkey, tell us, tell us your tale, monkey.

229
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,720
What do you got?

230
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
Oh boy, it all started back in high school.

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
It starts with one thing.

232
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,920
You don't know why.

233
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,760
It doesn't even matter how hard you try.

234
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,720
The year was 1942 and I had heard some good stories about this place.

235
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
It's called Auschwitz and I really wanted to know what was going on.

236
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
The year was 1945 with just her sister at her side.

237
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,280
Anyway, exactly.

238
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:25,440
19, 19, 1942, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday comes again.

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
This is terrible.

240
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,080
This is the worst podcast of all time.

241
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,280
Whichever commenter writes a full Hitler parody of that song, the lyrics in the comments,

242
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,000
Ben is going to give them a thumbs up on their comments.

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So Ben will give you a thumbs up.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Yeah.

245
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,560
I will record if you get all the syllable counts correct and you're not a fucking idiot and the

246
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
word's actually rhyme.

247
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,720
Correct rhyme schemes, right?

248
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll do a quick sing-through and send it to Monkey for him to post on Monkey Jones too.

249
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,120
Oh, perfect.

250
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,080
Yeah, did you ever get a lot of reviews out of abusing you on that channel?

251
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
So it's been great so far.

252
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,760
Yeah.

253
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,080
All the shitposts we've recorded at your house have, like already the first four have garnered

254
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
me like five bucks.

255
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,120
And I'm like, okay, five bucks for doing nothing.

256
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,400
That sounds pretty cool.

257
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,960
Yeah, fuck.

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
He's recording Diddy sitting in his room.

259
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,720
And we've gotten easily 30 on those.

260
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,360
So.

261
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, we do.

262
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,720
So it all started back in high school.

263
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,480
Little monkey boy.

264
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,280
He, it's not called the yellow fever when they're not Asian.

265
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,400
What's it called when you just want to fuck somebody who's not the same color as you?

266
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,560
Being a xenophile.

267
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
Being a xenophile outside your race?

268
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,240
I don't know.

269
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
It's called being like a race mixing?

270
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
Like a reverse cuck or something.

271
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,760
I don't know.

272
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,280
It's called being a devil spawn is going to hell.

273
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,640
Xenophile.

274
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,440
Xenophile.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Sure, okay.

276
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,600
Sure, okay.

277
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,720
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

278
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,080
Little monkey boy at the age of 17 was a bit of a xenophile.

279
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,600
Yeah.

280
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
This gorgeous foreign exchange student girl.

281
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,040
Oh boy.

282
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,320
What kind of, what kind of, where's your front?

283
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,480
Where's your front?

284
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,840
Argentina, my friend.

285
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,720
Okay.

286
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,600
Argentina.

287
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
She's got that big Latin ass.

288
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
The widest country in South America.

289
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,640
So you know it's valuable.

290
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,520
Thank God.

291
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:01,680
Yeah.

292
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,880
Yeah.

293
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
Like she's only a little bit ethnic.

294
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,160
Phew.

295
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,320
You know, when you see a hot foreign exchange student girl,

296
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,080
you make sure that you're her best friend.

297
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,360
Because when they're in this foreign country,

298
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
they don't have any friends.

299
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,520
They don't have anybody.

300
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,240
So if you're the only shoulder they have to turn to,

301
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
maybe you get a little bit of that Argentinian puss.

302
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,960
Who knows?

303
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,040
And you can give them one of the like, you know,

304
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,520
no one in this country gives a fuck about you.

305
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,120
So you better do what I tell you to do.

306
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
Oh, you better, you better consume it.

307
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,560
That doesn't sound like negging.

308
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,840
That sounds like fucking negging.

309
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
That sounds like fucking...

310
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,680
Yeah, like I love to go up to girls in the club and neg them

311
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
with like, dude, I could totally snap your neck right now.

312
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,000
That does not look like,

313
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
you do not look like you have a well-toned neck, girl.

314
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,880
Let me just work on that again.

315
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
Or like you can teach them fake things

316
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
about American culture.

317
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
For example, in Argentina,

318
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
they do that thing where they greet each other

319
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,560
by kissing people on the cheek.

320
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
And I taught her here in America,

321
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,280
how you greet friends when you're alone in their house

322
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,680
and their host mother is gone,

323
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
is you pull down their pants and you suck their dick.

324
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,680
So I taught her that very important American custom.

325
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
So yeah, we became really good friends.

326
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,560
And naturally, she eventually had to go back home.

327
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,600
But we stayed in contact and she wanted me to come down

328
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
to Argentina to stay at her house with her family.

329
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,520
All right.

330
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,240
So that was a big old trip,

331
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,200
crazy plan and cost like $2,500 out of the monkey bank account.

332
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,920
That's like all months of working

333
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,720
at the local amusement park for that bullshit.

334
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,760
And the trip there was fine.

335
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,760
Like I had to take a plane from Iowa to Texas.

336
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,240
Wait, hold on.

337
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
I blanked out for a second,

338
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,280
but are you saying that you went all the way to Argentina

339
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,560
to get some poon?

340
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
That's right.

341
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,520
So you said you didn't do more than...

342
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,200
We're not that far in the story yet, did you?

343
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm telling you about my very extravagant flight plan.

344
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,560
Okay.

345
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,160
Well, I'm just shocked because like on the virginity episode,

346
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,120
we were all talking about how much we paid to lose our virginity

347
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,080
and monkeys over here flying out of the fucking country.

348
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Well, sure.

349
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
I paid like fucking $400 million thousand

350
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,320
because I had to go to college to do it.

351
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
That's true.

352
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,160
Wait, had you had sex with this girl before this trip?

353
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,400
No.

354
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,360
Okay.

355
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,400
What?

356
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,160
Did you suck your dick?

357
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,960
Ben, please.

358
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,480
I do not kiss and tell.

359
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm a gentleman.

360
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,400
I mean, fine.

361
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,560
But do you get your dick sucked in town?

362
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm loud and angry.

363
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:21,920
I don't know.

364
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,480
Wait, wait.

365
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
But so, monkey.

366
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay.

367
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,640
You were talking about a flight plan.

368
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,760
So getting your dick sucked was that part of your plan?

369
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,520
Now, you don't get to bring friends

370
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,240
because the flight plan I just filed at the agency lists me,

371
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,640
my men, and Dr. Pavel here, but only one of you.

372
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,360
Okay.

373
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,080
Okay.

374
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,920
Was your erection rising

375
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,800
during this flight?

376
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,520
How does that happen?

377
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,400
Okay.

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,480
For you.

379
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,200
All right.

380
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,240
So just to get there, it's like 18 hours.

381
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,040
You go Iowa to Texas, Texas to,

382
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
you got to go to like the southern most point,

383
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,560
the capital of Argentina.

384
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,960
I don't remember what it's called.

385
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,600
San San Andreas.

386
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
No, it's not San Andreas.

387
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,320
I don't remember.

388
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,440
I can't remember.

389
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,600
But then she lived in Salta.

390
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,120
So I had to actually fly down to the southern tip of Argentina

391
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,080
and then take a transfer flight going back up north.

392
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,640
So it was way out of the way, super long flight.

393
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,320
Where it went bad was the flight home.

394
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,880
Because when you're in these foreign airports,

395
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
like most of the signs are in Spanish.

396
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
Oh no, I should tell you, I guess,

397
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
if I'm going to weave a whole yarn here,

398
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,280
going through customs on my way into Argentina

399
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,040
was an absolute nightmare.

400
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,480
Because when you're a foreigner.

401
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
On your way into Argentina.

402
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,680
Because you have to show them your passport

404
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,720
and then like some little dude in like a glass booth

405
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
interviews every single person.

406
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
So you're waiting in line for like three years

407
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,600
to get through all these interviews

408
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
and stuff of all the foreigners coming in.

409
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,880
But the motherfucker, and I guess this is my fault,

410
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,840
the guy who had to interview me to enter the country,

411
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
only spoke Spanish and I only speak English.

412
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
So you can imagine how that interview went.

413
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,040
It was about 20 minutes of him getting very frustrated with me

414
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,920
that I don't even know like the most common things in Spanish.

415
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,000
It took a few years, but obviously not enough.

416
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
And here's a hint for anybody who wants to become a terrorist.

417
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
No dude, I'm on the fucking PCP right now.

418
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,880
You can't have your microphone.

419
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
You presumptuous bastard.

420
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,520
Here's a hint for anybody who wants to become a terrorist

421
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,720
in a foreign country.

422
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,920
Just don't learn their language because the customs guy

423
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,840
will get so mad that you can't talk to him

424
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
that he'll just shrug his shoulders

425
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
and let you go on through anyway.

426
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,720
So that's my advice.

427
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
Good. Good.

428
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
Anyway, so the nightmare is coming back home

429
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
because the fear is one of my flights will get cancelled or something

430
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,680
and then I'm trapped in a foreign country

431
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,760
and I don't know who to talk to to get my new flight and all that shit.

432
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,720
Luckily, nothing got cancelled until I got to Texas

433
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
and then my flight home to Iowa got fucked and cancelled.

434
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,960
And as I said before, I cannot sleep while I'm in the middle of traveling.

435
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,720
So I'm just sitting at this airport already 18 hours into traveling

436
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
just losing my fucking mind.

437
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,080
There is, I'm telling you, airports are fucked.

438
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,800
They're so fucked because if your flight gets cancelled,

439
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,520
it's game over.

440
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,920
You're done.

441
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,520
There's no really place to sleep.

442
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,920
Like they should have like little sleep chamber pods

443
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,680
that you can go like rent and sleep in

444
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,040
and they'll wake you up when your flight's ready.

445
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,160
But they don't have shit.

446
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
You're pretty much stuck in a divorce thing

447
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,680
where either you go get a hotel room

448
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,520
and they don't offer me a free thing.

449
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,040
Like I'd have to go pay for a hotel room

450
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,120
and then risk missing the flight again

451
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,640
or sleep on the fucking chair.

452
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
Hope that nobody steals your bags.

453
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
Get fucked, you fucking faggot.

454
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,760
And the long story short is I eventually get home

455
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,240
after being awake for 30 hours

456
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,960
and it was the most miserable, tired,

457
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,560
terrible experience of my life.

458
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,120
So typically I think traveling's okay,

459
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,240
but that one instance was just fucked.

460
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,600
Gay.

461
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,240
That's shit time, dude.

462
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,280
I've, yeah, I've had a bunch of flights like that.

463
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Like now that I'm older and shit

464
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
and I live like farther away from where I grew up,

465
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
I've been flying a lot pretty regularly

466
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
and like American Airlines is the worst,

467
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
I think that I found.

468
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,560
They, yeah, like I think on two separate occasions,

469
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
I learned after the second time not to fly with them,

470
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,400
like one time my flight just got kept getting delayed

471
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
and kept getting fucking delayed

472
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,840
and then just got pushed back to the next day.

473
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
So I think on that day, like since I had my car,

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
since I'm a fucking adult,

475
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I just drove back home and then drove in the next day.

476
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
But the other time, I don't know,

477
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
like I didn't want to for whatever reason,

478
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
like the flight was really early in the morning the next day.

479
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
So, you know, I was lucky enough

480
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,440
that they did offer me a hotel voucher.

481
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
So I just fucking, you know,

482
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
got in the shuttle with a bunch of people

483
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
who also got fucked over,

484
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,120
stayed at a hotel for a night,

485
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
got in my flight the next morning and got gone.

486
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
But the fact that they have so much like

487
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,800
ability to just screw over people,

488
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,120
the ability of an airline to fuck people over is so vast

489
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,240
that it seems like they are disproportionately unaccountable

490
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
for the damage that they do every single day

491
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
by just being incompetent at their fucking jobs.

492
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
And they do it to hundreds of people at a time

493
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
and then when confronted with like how they're ruining

494
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
so many people's not only day,

495
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
probably a week and maybe even life

496
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,200
by shortening it with all the stress.

497
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
They have the attitude of shrugger,

498
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,480
fuck off, I don't care.

499
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
Fuck you, it's my job, fuck you.

500
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,640
Yeah, I don't know, man.

501
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
I wish I had a solution.

502
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,360
Maybe there's something we can talk about.

503
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,400
Ways to improve or completely destroy the system

504
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
and don't even give people the illusion

505
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
that travel is something that you want to do.

506
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,680
Just say no, just stay where you are.

507
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,360
We're abolishing flights.

508
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,120
You just live where you live and that's it.

509
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
We gotta wait for the teleporters.

510
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,560
That's what I'm saying, Doug.

511
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,360
It's travel.

512
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,960
I would be, travel is so shit.

513
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
That's really the point at the end of this.

514
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
Travel is so garbage that I want to basically not exist

515
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,880
by just having teleporters like they do in fucking Star Trek

516
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,800
and just be anywhere you want immediately.

517
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,680
Travel is retarded.

518
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,800
There's nothing good about it.

519
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,000
I hate it.

520
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
You know, honestly, I don't mind travel.

521
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,360
I mind the cost of travel.

522
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,440
That's the main reason I don't do it

523
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,720
is because I'm a cheapskate

524
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,520
and the thought of like spending hundreds of dollars

525
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,120
just to go do something is just too,

526
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
it's too much for my brain to handle,

527
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
even if I can afford it.

528
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,640
For every calculation like that,

529
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,680
you gotta think like, okay,

530
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm gonna go fly, I don't know, to this place

531
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
and fuck this slut.

532
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,280
That's the plan, okay.

533
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,160
Now, how much am I willing to invest

534
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
in this operation here?

535
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
Like, am I gonna spend like $1,000?

536
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,360
You know, I mean, that's fine in some cases,

537
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
but to do it regularly,

538
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,480
to make it a part of your life,

539
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,680
it's prohibitively expensive.

540
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
Well, even like, we all agreed

541
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,400
that on the losing of virginity video,

542
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,280
that for the first time, you spare no expense.

543
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
That's right, no price is too much to pay.

544
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,600
Yeah, but then after that,

545
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,160
you're like, well, now I understand what sex is,

546
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I understand that it's not that big a deal.

547
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,680
Am I even willing to spend $100 on this?

548
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,280
Well, don't forget, Digi,

549
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,280
your virginity regrows as you go on without having sex though.

550
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
We gotta keep that in mind, yep.

551
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,480
But like, sex is not withstanding,

552
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
just going anywhere to do anything.

553
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
Like, for instance, the dick show

554
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,640
is going to start doing these live shows.

555
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,680
Road rage.

556
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,200
Yeah, his road rage.

557
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
And he's going to do a show in LA

558
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,400
and a show in Philadelphia.

559
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
Those are the two that are planned.

560
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,680
Whether or not it continues from there,

561
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,720
we have no idea.

562
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,960
There's no further plans beyond that.

563
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,560
So he's going to do a show in Philadelphia.

564
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,000
Now, I'm looking at it like,

565
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
Philadelphia is not that far from me, right?

566
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
Like, it would either be a short,

567
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,680
inexpensive flight,

568
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,000
or a eight hour drive,

569
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,520
seven or eight hour drive.

570
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
So, and I have,

571
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
I think I probably have friends in Philadelphia,

572
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,240
I can't remember if Jeff Burgess lives in Philadelphia

573
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,360
or Pittsburgh,

574
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,320
but if he lives in Philly,

575
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,200
maybe I'll do it.

576
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
But like, so he's doing this,

577
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,440
this taxationist theft show in Philadelphia.

578
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
And I have to look at it and go,

579
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,560
all right, well,

580
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,200
first of all,

581
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,040
we've got the travel time,

582
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,000
which is, you know,

583
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,720
eight hours there,

584
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,760
eight hours back.

585
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
If I go, like,

586
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
if I go there and I don't want a hotel,

587
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,800
that means I'm just going to,

588
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,760
like, drive all day for a,

589
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,680
probably two hour show, you know?

590
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,360
Or I stay the night

591
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,680
and then waste the whole next day as well.

592
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,320
That's two days of just driving,

593
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
just to see this one thing.

594
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
And like,

595
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,720
and then I'm thinking about what the,

596
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,840
if I take a car,

597
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,720
that's probably going to be $100 of gas.

598
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,840
If I take a flight,

599
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
it's a, you know,

600
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,800
what if I have to get a hotel,

601
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,400
$100 on a hotel,

602
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,280
however much it costs,

603
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,480
you know, depending on where you are.

604
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,200
In New York,

605
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
like, New York trips

606
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,120
are almost prohibitively expensive

607
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,080
just because of, like, lodging.

608
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,880
Like, it's so expensive

609
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
to get a hotel in New York.

610
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,360
It's like, you know,

611
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
like over $100 a night that it's like,

612
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
A lot of people do day trips to New York, I think.

613
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,560
Yeah.

614
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,640
Like, I have here in Virginia Beach,

615
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
we have something called the Chinatown Bus,

616
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,120
which is just a bus that goes straight

617
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,800
to Chinatown, New York,

618
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,520
no stops.

619
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
And it's like 50 bucks.

620
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,280
So getting to New York,

621
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,120
very cheap, very easy.

622
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,160
It's like 10 hour, 10, 12 hour drive,

623
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,880
you know, whatever.

624
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
It's a waste of time,

625
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,080
but yeah, it's a cheap, easy trip.

626
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
But staying in New York,

627
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,480
that's where you're gonna suddenly rack up

628
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,840
hundreds of dollars

629
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,920
just to fucking be in a place.

630
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
You know, not even to do things there.

631
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
Let's not even talk about the fact

632
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,560
that if you wanna actually do things there,

633
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,640
now you're gonna be spending all this,

634
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,560
and if you go to some other town,

635
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,080
you're not gonna go eat fast food.

636
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,160
That's not why you came, you know.

637
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,920
You're gonna go some cool place

638
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,160
that's gonna cost more dozens,

639
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,480
if not hundreds of dollars to do all the stuff.

640
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
So like the total travel cost

641
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
just racks up and racks up.

642
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,160
And it's like, you know,

643
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,520
you really gotta be willing to just part

644
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,720
with what you have

645
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
in the name of good times.

646
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
That's true, that's very true.

647
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,480
And not to mention like you were saying,

648
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,720
to know kind of like what's,

649
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
when you're going to a new place,

650
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,800
you don't necessarily know

651
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
if it's a fun place to spend time,

652
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,160
or just like what to do

653
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,520
to have a good time while you're there.

654
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,280
So you pretty much need to have somebody

655
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,040
on the other end who's willing to donate

656
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,880
their time, like a friend or whatever,

657
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
that's gonna like, or research it extensively.

658
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,800
But even then, you never know what you're gonna find.

659
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,080
So you also have to like know

660
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
that it's gonna be a good time ahead of time.

661
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
And like I also had like a trip

662
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,200
that I was thinking of doing,

663
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,160
and also didn't,

664
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,720
cause like it's probably not worth it ultimately.

665
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
But like Tim and Eric,

666
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,680
I've just announced they're doing

667
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,920
a 10 year anniversary tour

668
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,360
for the 10 year anniversary of Tim and Eric,

669
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,560
awesome show, great job.

670
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,680
And I would love to go to,

671
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,280
cause Tim and Eric are two of my favorite people

672
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,880
in the fucking world,

673
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,000
and awesome show was like one of my favorite shows ever.

674
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,120
But they're not coming,

675
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,920
they're coming to Chicago,

676
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,280
but that's like four hours away from here.

677
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,400
And I'm not gonna do that.

678
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,280
I would love to go,

679
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,200
and my hope would have been to have gone,

680
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
to that show in Seattle, I think,

681
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,640
with my buddy John,

682
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,680
who also is just a huge super fan.

683
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,400
And we fucking fell in love with that shit together.

684
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,600
It would be a wonderful experience

685
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
to hang out with him and my other friends out in Seattle,

686
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,200
but I'm not gonna fucking pay $400 to go out

687
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,640
for a one fucking time show for two hours,

688
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,520
and then just come back.

689
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,400
And like, I guess I could like bundle it into like,

690
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,920
oh, let's also hang out with the guys,

691
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
but I got shit to do.

692
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,800
I don't have time to fucking hang out

693
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,160
with my friends all the time.

694
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,880
I got work to that needs to get done.

695
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
That's why I need to teleport.

696
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
If I could just fucking teleport there

697
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,160
and do my shit,

698
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,960
it'd be the best.

699
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,920
You know, I have this beautiful vision

700
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,440
of like constantly traveling

701
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,600
and doing things with people and stuff.

702
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,480
And then what you always realize only afterwards

703
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,440
is that like, you just suddenly look at the calendar

704
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
and realize that days are gone,

705
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
and whatever you haven't done yet

706
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,040
is now a pressing matter.

707
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
Like for instance,

708
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,920
Monkey came to my house about a week ago

709
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,080
as part of this travel that he was doing,

710
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,200
who stayed the night,

711
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,240
and we recorded a shitload of Let's Plays.

712
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,400
And you may have noticed

713
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,840
that none of them have come out yet.

714
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,200
And that's because-

715
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,800
I have come to expect this of you, did you?

716
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, it doesn't help-

717
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,640
I'm expecting you to see them probably in May.

718
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,080
Well, we recorded a ton of them,

719
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,600
and you don't even realize, Monkey,

720
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
that after you left,

721
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,160
me and Ben and DeVu made five more Let's Plays.

722
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,600
Just that night.

723
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,000
Like, we kept going to like seven in the morning or something.

724
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,640
Shit.

725
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,080
So yeah, I've got a whole desktop

726
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,680
full of fucking Let's Plays.

727
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,320
And the reason that I didn't get around to editing them

728
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,280
is that, like, leading up to Monkey coming over,

729
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,400
I was, like, anticipating.

730
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to hang out with Monkey.

731
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,960
This is the most fun thing I'm going to do this month, probably.

732
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,360
Monkey comes over-

733
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Probably this year.

734
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,800
We recorded all these Let's Plays.

735
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,600
It sucked.

736
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
It was garbage.

737
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,120
No, we did a bunch of stuff for two days,

738
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,920
and then he leaves,

739
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,280
and then I'm like, oh, God,

740
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,120
it's now March 20th or so.

741
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,760
I have to make two more videos

742
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
before this month is over,

743
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,320
and start planning for what I'm going to do in April.

744
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,680
So the second Monkey's gone,

745
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,840
it's like, well, now we just got to work constantly.

746
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,440
You know, and I don't have time to just sit around

747
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
and edit all these Let's Plays,

748
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,800
because I'm going to be, like, just outputting.

749
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,920
You know, all I've been doing is, like,

750
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,920
making shit nonstop for the main channel since he left.

751
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,400
So that's what happens every time I travel.

752
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,040
It's like, I go, I have fun for four or five days,

753
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,760
and I come back, and I realize that a huge chunk of the month

754
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,000
is just gone, and now, like, you know, it's grind time.

755
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Let me tell you one more thing real quick.

756
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,680
It's just, it's my vision for the future.

757
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,880
Well, it's whatever.

758
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,800
So in Star Trek, there's this wonderful thing that's painted.

759
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,640
I know, I'm becoming like Mike,

760
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,920
and I love it so much.

761
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,040
So in Star Trek, Deep Space Nine,

762
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:59,040
there is a couple scenes where Commander Sisko's son,

763
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,480
I think, is, like, visiting the academy

764
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
or something, or something's going on,

765
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,360
or like, oh, no, what is this?

766
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,600
Sisko is, like, he's back on Earth

767
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
for some assignment, doesn't matter.

768
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,520
But the point is, like, he, his family lives in Louisiana,

769
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,480
in New Orleans, and he loves that place,

770
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,320
but Starfleet headquarters is in San Francisco, California.

771
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,440
So, like, what his day is like is that he gets up,

772
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,640
has breakfast in his house, gets in a fucking teleporter,

773
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,480
gets phased over to San Francisco, has his day there,

774
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,000
and then just is instantly, at the end of the day,

775
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
he just fucking teleports back to Louisiana,

776
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
has dinner with his family, is fucking great time.

777
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
And it's just, and they just, like, they just talk about,

778
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,840
like, oh, hey, you know, I was, yeah, I was just in San Francisco.

779
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,560
10 seconds later, I'm here in fucking New Orleans.

780
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,240
It's the greatest thing in the world.

781
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,960
It's just, it's just like how cars enabled us

782
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
to travel a little bit.

783
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
Teleporters enable you to travel

784
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,280
a thousand billion million miles in a second,

785
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,120
and it just becomes part of life.

786
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,400
And I can't even think about all the ways

787
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,120
it would make life better and different and interesting.

788
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,720
Oh, it's, oh, it's, it's, it brings a tear to my eye.

789
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,600
It's so beautiful.

790
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,360
It's, I want that so badly.

791
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
It'd be pretty fucking sweet.

792
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,520
Too bad we live in the real world,

793
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,320
where we have to pay taxes and, and jerk ourselves off.

794
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,280
Oh shit, thanks for reminding me.

795
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,520
I still haven't fucking submitted my taxes yet.

796
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,200
Oh, God, I need to do that too.

797
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
That's in like a month, that's due.

798
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,560
Yep, I need to submit my shit to my tax people.

799
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Oh, no.

800
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,800
Oh, tax cast.

801
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
Ben, have you, have you paid your taxes, Ben?

802
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,480
What's going on with your taxes?

803
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,960
Have I?

804
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,440
Have you filed?

806
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,160
Why would you think I made my taxes?

807
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,040
Have you filed?

808
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
I mean, don't you have to file?

809
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,640
If you're-

810
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,520
What, have you?

811
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,080
You fuck?

812
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Well, no, but I'm aware that I need you.

813
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,800
Judgy McJudgerson?

814
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
I'm not, I'm just saying.

815
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,160
I have plans to do so with, with, uh, like a tax lady.

816
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,360
With, on sunny, you know, does our taxes talk?

817
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,560
I have, yeah, I have ten, I'm gonna figure it out.

818
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,840
I know how I'm gonna figure it out.

819
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
I know I'll do it soon, someday.

820
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,680
Someday I'll pay taxes.

821
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,360
Yeah, I always end up doing it.

822
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,160
Ben, what's your craziest travel story?

823
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,400
Uh, my-

824
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,760
I know you're a big hitchhiker.

825
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,560
So, so are we exclusive-

826
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,240
Oh yeah, fucking hitchhiked that one time.

827
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,840
Hold on, before we continue here,

828
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,600
are we exclusively talking about the act of travel?

829
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,000
Is that-

830
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,520
I don't think it's anything about traveling.

831
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,680
Well, because Monkey's story was literally only about the flights that he took,

832
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,160
and nothing about Argentina whatsoever.

833
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,600
Well, that's not interesting.

834
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,720
It's the vastly more interesting subject,

835
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,640
but if we're gonna focus on just the travel, that's fine.

836
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,160
You can do whatever you want.

837
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:36,320
I, uh, when I was, I fucking,

838
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
when I fucking moved to California,

839
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,800
and was an astro camp fucking instructor for a while,

840
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,400
and I lived in the mountains,

841
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,720
and then I fucking lost that job,

842
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,560
and then I fucking hitchhiked to the fucking, to my aunt's house,

843
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,720
and then I fucking, I don't know,

844
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,080
go watch my fucking Nuzlocke of the Black one.

845
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,440
You know, I told that story.

846
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,240
That was fun.

847
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
I got fucking pulled over by the police.

848
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,040
The police, they tried to arrest me.

849
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,960
They tried to arrest me for hitchhiking,

850
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,320
and I came up with a story.

851
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,720
They were like,

852
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
you can't be here on the fucking highway.

853
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,520
And I said,

854
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,760
oh, my, uh, my girlfriend,

855
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,840
we had a fight and she kicked me out of the car,

856
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,520
and they took pity,

857
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,720
and they took pity on me,

858
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,680
and they said, oh, buddy,

859
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,880
oh, I'm so sorry.

860
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,240
I'm sorry that happened.

861
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,840
How did that story not fall apart the moment that they looked at your face?

862
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,840
Well, good question.

863
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
I can't answer it.

864
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,800
The cops were gay, obviously.

865
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,440
Oh, yeah.

866
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,120
They wanted to piece that shit, yeah.

867
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,320
And they, uh,

868
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,160
oh, yeah, and they put me on the fucking on-ramp.

869
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,360
They were like, okay, technically,

870
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,960
you're not allowed to be on the freeway,

871
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
but you're technically allowed to stand on this on-ramp

872
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,920
and hitchhike.

873
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,720
Good luck, buddy.

874
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
And I said, thanks, law man.

875
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,560
And I winked at them gaily.

876
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,560
And there's more to this.

877
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,520
Pull out my crack.

878
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
There's more to that story.

879
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,680
Ben does have a very famously effective wink.

880
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,280
Do I?

881
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,160
Is that true?

882
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,400
Yeah.

883
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,800
Sure.

884
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,280
Wow.

885
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,600
Yeah, that's true.

886
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,360
And the part of the story I've never understood

887
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,320
is why you decided to hitchhike across the country

888
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,000
when you could have just flown home.

889
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Flo-

890
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,440
First of all, I wasn't going home.

891
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Second of all, flying is expensive.

892
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Third of all, I just felt like hitchhiking.

893
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,000
The fucking, my job at AstroCab ended,

894
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,240
and I didn't, and I hadn't bought a ticket.

895
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,960
I hadn't bought a plane ticket or a train ticket or anything,

896
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,960
to my aunt's house.

897
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,160
And I was like, well, it's only like three states away.

898
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,480
And I, and they dropped me off at the airport.

899
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,040
And I was like, well, I didn't actually buy a ticket.

900
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,320
I didn't tell them this.

901
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,680
I didn't tell them that I didn't buy it.

902
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,280
I just had dropped me off at the airport.

903
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,320
And I got off at the airport, and I looked up at the sun.

904
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,960
And I said, judging by the position of the sun,

905
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
I think east is this way.

906
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
And I just started walking in that direction.

907
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
What year was this, and did you have a phone?

908
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,840
Yeah, I had a phone.

909
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,600
But I wanted to hitchhike.

910
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,320
And this was like 2012, 2011.

911
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,360
Your alternative lifestyle disgusts me.

912
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm just sick of it.

913
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,160
Me too.

914
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,840
You are a parasite on this great land of America.

915
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,240
Oh man.

916
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,600
But then when I got to Aunt Steph's house,

917
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,360
I was there for a little while.

918
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,520
And then I went back to Northern California

919
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,040
to live with one of my AstroCamp friends.

920
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,280
And that was one of the best days of my life,

921
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
because I had like a 22-hour train ride.

922
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
And it was so relaxing.

923
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
And I played Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup for like 22 hours

924
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,600
on a fucking train ride to fucking California

925
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,800
to live with a bunch of cool faggots

926
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,720
that let me stay in their house for free

927
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
for what was supposed to be a few weeks,

928
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
but ended up being like six months

929
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
before they were finally like,

930
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,200
Ben, you need to start paying rent.

931
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
And I said, OK, I understand.

932
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
And then I paid like two months of rent.

933
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
And then I ran out of money and was like,

934
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,160
well, I can't pay rent anymore.

935
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
And they said, well, get out.

936
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
And I said, yep, I'll go home now.

937
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And they did.

938
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That seems pretty...

939
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,480
Yeah, it seems like a pretty legitimate transaction there.

940
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,080
Yeah, yeah.

941
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,880
It was legit.

942
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
I didn't screw anyone over.

943
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,880
I'm a good boy.

944
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,680
Yeah.

945
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Oh, yeah.

946
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,560
And then I went to Poland.

947
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
And then I went to Poland to teach physics.

948
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,800
And then that was a plane ride, but whatever.

949
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
And then for Christmas that year, for Christmas that year...

950
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,520
Ben, how did you go from world traveling teacher

951
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,560
to eating Digi's leftovers every day?

952
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,840
I will tell you the story of how that happened.

953
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Not even exaggerating their name.

954
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,240
I went to Poland.

955
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,600
And I taught physics.

956
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,280
And my students hated me.

957
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
And they gave me bad reviews.

958
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,280
And they said, get out.

959
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,840
Yeah, you like that?

960
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,800
You like that, monkey?

961
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,640
Oh, man.

962
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:38,880
And they said...

963
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,400
It's just like your PCP lecture.

964
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,680
All the students hated you.

965
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,640
Yeah, it's right.

966
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,800
That's true.

967
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,560
And they fucking down...

968
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,080
I see the Polish...

969
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,520
They downloaded you as a person.

970
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,480
The job had given me this fucking swanky high-rise apartment in the center of town.

971
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,560
And I was like, well, I'm too...

972
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,440
They were like, we're not going to pay for your apartment anymore.

973
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
And I was like, landlord, please, give me a different room.

974
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,440
And they were like, okay, we'll move you right downstairs

975
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,800
into this fucking dingy-ass fucking hole in the fucking wall,

976
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,920
where you'll technically be sharing it with like a 90-year-old woman

977
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
who's just living there waiting to die.

978
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,120
And there's no running water.

979
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,640
And there's no fucking kitchen.

980
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
All you have is a hot plate.

981
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
And there's no bed.

982
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,480
And the heater is just a big stone pillar in the center of the room

983
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,080
that fucking gets hot sometimes.

984
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,120
Fuck yeah.

985
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,200
So watch out for that.

986
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,960
You're in the lap of luxury over there.

987
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, it was a good time.

988
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,080
Where's my stone pillar gone, Dan?

989
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,080
And I was like, well...

990
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,960
They'll give you a woman to have sex with.

991
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,440
That's right.

992
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,040
That's right.

993
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,000
And then for Christmas, for Christmas,

994
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,600
I had heard that Christmas in Tartu Estonia was the best party.

995
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,560
And I went to Tartu Estonia for, no, for New Year's.

996
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,240
And it was wonderful.

997
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,760
And then I fucking was like, well, I'll take all the money

998
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
that I save working in physics.

999
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,160
And I fucking took a fucking train and bus

1000
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,800
and fucking walking trip for like three months.

1001
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,240
And I went across fucking Germany and France and England to Ireland.

1002
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,240
And then I was in Ireland for fucking, what's the word, St. Patrick's Day.

1003
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,040
And I was doing that for like three months and it took forever.

1004
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
And you know what?

1005
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,480
You know what?

1006
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,080
I got really bored of it after a while.

1007
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,640
After a while, I was just like, you know what?

1008
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,320
The world kind of sucks and everything is pretty much the same as everything else.

1009
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,920
And it's like that old saw.

1010
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,200
It's like that old saying, wherever you go, there you are.

1011
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,960
It's like, it's all the fucking same.

1012
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,760
It's just whatever.

1013
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,160
You just, you meet new people, but they're the same as the old people.

1014
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,880
Fuck it.

1015
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,920
And I was like, and I was like, when I go home,

1016
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,640
when I go home to America, once I run out of money, which I just did,

1017
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say fuck it.

1018
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,680
I don't want to go anywhere anymore.

1019
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,600
I'm gonna fucking sit in my room.

1020
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,600
And the only fucking thing I care about is like my fucking mind.

1021
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,760
I'm just going to cultivate my mind instead.

1022
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
Fuck the outside world.

1023
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
I'm only going to look inside for the rest of my miserable life.

1024
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,280
And that's what I did.

1025
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,640
And I learned how to draw and I fucking got good.

1026
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
And I became the greatest hero of a generation.

1027
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,840
And that's my story.

1028
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,360
And that's how I ended up eating leftovers out of Digi's garbage for months.

1029
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,080
He cultivated his mind so hard, he had no choice,

1030
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,320
but to eat those leftovers out of Digi's garbage.

1031
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,960
That's right.

1032
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,240
I cultivated my mind so hard that I didn't even want it.

1033
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,880
That's what I call a highly trained mind.

1034
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,520
Yeah.

1035
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
Ben, I just want to ask, there are probably a lot of

1036
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,240
impressional young minds in the audience who aspire to be an artist.

1037
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,440
To eating garbage as well.

1038
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,000
To go insane.

1039
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,720
Yeah, that's right.

1040
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,360
My question is, would you recommend this lifestyle or would you say pursue the teaching

1041
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,000
instead of- I frankly don't understand why everyone doesn't live exactly the way I have.

1042
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,000
I think people long for a little more stability than you have.

1043
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,960
It confuses and disgusts me.

1044
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,080
Everyone is not just like me.

1045
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,440
To have a life with no future or prospects or like money,

1046
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,120
it's kind of scary for most people.

1047
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,920
Not me though.

1048
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,560
Boy, boy.

1049
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Aren't you currently financially unsustainable in the very long term though?

1050
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,760
Um, in the very long term?

1051
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,080
Yeah.

1052
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,320
But like, I'm okay for now.

1053
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,440
I'm okay for now.

1054
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm okay for now.

1055
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,160
Patreon.com.

1056
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,280
Like for today.

1057
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,840
Save him.

1058
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,080
Yeah, save him.

1059
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,440
Hashtag save him.

1060
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,840
Yeah.

1061
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,160
Yes, exactly.

1062
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Your definition of being okay for now is if Digi ordered a pizza last night.

1063
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,280
That would save the day.

1064
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,560
That would save the day.

1065
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,880
Oh, shit.

1066
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,800
Or Victor.

1067
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Victor gives me fucking crazy leftovers.

1068
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,280
Victor's always buying food, chaining his mind, losing his appetite,

1069
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,640
and being like, Ben, you want this?

1070
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,840
And that's like half of what I eat.

1071
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,920
You know, Ben, I noticed when we were at their house,

1072
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,120
like when we were growing up, nobody ever left leftovers.

1073
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,800
Like they were consumed immediately.

1074
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,880
But the Collins family ain't quite like that.

1075
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,200
No.

1076
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,760
And none of us eat around leftovers.

1077
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,920
So anything that gets left over is just passed to somebody else.

1078
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,000
It's bizarre.

1079
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Like for me and Ben, that's just an opportunity.

1080
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,520
I never leave anything uneaten, like never, ever.

1081
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,240
I just, if I, you know, if I get something and then realize halfway through that I don't

1082
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,640
like it anymore, then it's gone.

1083
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,080
Well, I mean, maybe it's just because we were like, we didn't have as many options as kids.

1084
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,840
Like we were just fucking eight or whatever.

1085
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,520
I mean, it's just that my dad has always been like,

1086
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,240
very like anti leftovers just because he's like a germaphobe.

1087
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,160
So I just don't think there was a culture of leftovers in the house if you get what I'm saying.

1088
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,600
I see.

1089
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,320
We're all picky eaters, really picky eaters, everybody.

1090
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,640
I want to hear the story of how did you went to the Philippines to have gay six?

1091
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,040
Yeah.

1092
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,840
Yeah.

1093
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,800
We've all been wondering.

1094
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,040
So I'll tell you the travel story of going to the Philippines,

1095
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,880
which is, I guess, interesting in its own right.

1096
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,120
Oh, yeah.

1097
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,000
So I should wait.

1098
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,120
I want to mention about my story that I fucking snuck on trains.

1099
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,080
I snuck on trains.

1100
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh, sweet.

1101
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,600
I didn't pay for tickets all the time.

1102
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,440
Like the homeless man, like you jumped onto a moving train into a little box car.

1103
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,320
No, like a can of beans and you have a beer and shit.

1104
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,040
And a bindle.

1105
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,320
No, like I would get on a train with no ticket and I would just be like, well,

1106
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,120
this train ride is an hour and I would just go sit in the bathroom on the train for an hour

1107
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,720
and no one would check my ticket or Ben or I would sit down on a seat.

1108
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,440
Wait till I saw the conductor coming to check tickets and then go to the bathroom.

1109
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,040
Wait until they pass through the car and then go sit down again.

1110
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,600
And I took tons of train rides for free that way.

1111
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,280
Ben, do you want to, as soon as this podcast is over,

1112
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,880
go out and buy a can of beans and eat them with me?

1113
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,320
Why?

1114
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,480
Like a homeless man could be longer and lighter.

1115
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,320
I have a sudden desire for beans because of what I'm talking about.

1116
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,120
I'll just picture it.

1117
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1118
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,080
Does this mean, does this mean that I get half a free can of beans?

1119
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,320
Hell yeah.

1120
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,600
My monthly tugboat has come in.

1121
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,080
It's a date, Digi.

1122
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,120
It's a fucking date.

1123
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,640
I'm just picturing the guy on the train with the can of beans,

1124
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,240
but the lid is still on and they're mostly open.

1125
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

1126
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,480
Who doesn't have a can opener so he uses a fucking rusty old knife he found?

1127
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,600
Yeah.

1128
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,400
It's a good look.

1129
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,480
But are you guys aware, just while we're on the topic,

1130
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,160
that I eat a can of dark red kidney beans out of a can for lunch every single day of my life?

1131
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,560
Oh my God.

1132
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,280
That's what I do.

1133
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,240
Fucking yuck, dude.

1134
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,800
Every single day.

1135
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,360
Why?

1136
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,600
Yeah, why?

1137
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,800
Because it's high in protein, high in fiber.

1138
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,640
Wait, wait, high in fiber.

1139
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,120
Wait, fuck.

1140
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,200
How's the song go?

1141
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,320
High in fiber.

1142
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,880
Low in fat.

1143
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,440
Low in fat.

1144
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,520
Hey, I bet you didn't know that when I eat beans.

1145
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,000
I sit in my own little cloud.

1146
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,800
Nobody comes to visit me in my little cloud.

1147
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't know why.

1148
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,520
Maybe because I'm cut muffins.

1149
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,800
Cut muffins.

1150
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
Yep, that's a brag.

1151
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,720
I do literally eat these beans though every single day.

1152
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,600
Kibbe beans are good for you.

1153
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:09,680
I prefer beans, beans, musical fruit, morey, morey too, morey too, belly fills,

1154
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,920
eat two beans with every meal.

1155
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,120
That's the normie one.

1156
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,760
The brag show is better.

1157
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,960
The normie one.

1158
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,160
That's the normie's beans song.

1159
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,520
It's a slightly, the specific version I'm doing is from Skull Monkeys.

1160
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
You should all look up Skull Monkeys Beansong.

1161
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,080
Oh, fucking Skull Monkeys.

1162
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,240
Fucking Skull Monkeys.

1163
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
Speaking of let's plays that haven't come out yet,

1164
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,200
three hour Skull Monkeys let's play somewhere on Jesse's hard drive.

1165
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,280
Oh god, where is it?

1166
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,080
I want that.

1167
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,680
Why isn't it out yet?

1168
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,000
He's a bad person.

1169
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,240
Who was telling the story?

1170
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,880
Someone was guessing.

1171
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,720
He was going to talk about going to a hotel and in a hand basket.

1172
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:56,960
So I was 19 and I dropped out of college and wasn't doing anything with my life.

1173
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,760
And my dad was like, we got to get this.

1174
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,200
My dad essentially thought that maybe if I went and saw something new,

1175
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,320
something that's not the house, you know, for a change,

1176
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,440
maybe it would inspire me to like want to work or be a human being.

1177
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,840
Clearly it didn't work.

1178
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
So he knew that I had, yeah, it did not work at all.

1179
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,360
Legit, it did not work in the way that it was supposed to.

1180
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,800
But he knew that I had a friend in the Philippines, Ghost Lightning,

1181
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,680
who's in his 30s and has a family and shit.

1182
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,040
And he was like, that guy seems like he's got his shit together.

1183
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
Why don't you go visit your friend in the Philippines?

1184
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,320
And I was like, fucking, are you serious right now?

1185
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,480
Dude, that's a half the planet away.

1186
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,600
I've never really traveled anywhere before on my own.

1187
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,800
I've never even gone to like a neighboring city without a person with me.

1188
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,880
I'll tell you, one of the biggest reasons I don't travel is I hate going anywhere alone.

1189
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,240
You can ask my friends, you can ask Ben and DeVue and Victor.

1190
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
Those are the people who count at this point.

1191
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,480
Like, when I want to go even just out of the house to get food,

1192
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,120
I will always try to bring somebody with me.

1193
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,920
I'm always like, hey, you want to go to Wendy's?

1194
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,560
You want to go here?

1195
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,360
You want to just be out with me?

1196
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,120
Because so I'm not alone, you know?

1197
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,520
I've gotten a lot more.

1198
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,480
When did he comes out?

1199
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,920
He needs someone to come out with.

1200
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,520
Yeah, I've gotten a lot more used to.

1201
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,880
Message received.

1202
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,520
I've gotten a lot more used to going alone just because

1203
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,760
now that I have money and nobody else does,

1204
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,840
I want to go out a lot more than anyone else does.

1205
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,440
So I've gotten used to going alone.

1206
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,720
And that's why I'm going to travel now.

1207
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,720
I'm willing to do it finally.

1208
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,160
But at the time, I had never been anywhere by myself.

1209
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,280
So I was like, this is the scariest prospect I've ever heard.

1210
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm going to a essentially third world country.

1211
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,720
Like, they have, you know, they're not third world in the way that you might imagine,

1212
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,800
but it's definitely not a first world nation.

1213
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,240
Do you hear about their prime minister who like promotes vigilanteism

1214
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,480
and like wants to personally beat up gangsters?

1215
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,920
You mean their current leader who is murdering people in the streets

1216
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,400
for accusations of drugs?

1217
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,320
Like, right.

1218
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,360
Just accusations.

1219
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah.

1220
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,320
Well, a man who he's got such a crackdown on he's got a massive,

1221
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,280
like if you do anything involving drugs, you die.

1222
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,920
And he's using this as a political power.

1223
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,600
Like he can accuse his opponents of being drug, you know, drug cartels.

1224
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,000
I bet his favorite video game is crack down.

1225
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,640
Yeah.

1226
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,320
Crack down.

1227
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,680
Crack down.

1228
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,560
The country is currently at, yeah, it's got a really corrupt.

1229
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,160
That guy has compared himself to Hitler.

1230
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,960
In a daring subversion of the typical trope.

1231
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,600
Yeah.

1232
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,200
He's compared himself to Hitler.

1233
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,760
It's incredible.

1234
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,160
Wow.

1235
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,880
He's my hero.

1236
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,280
Okay.

1237
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,080
Moving on.

1238
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,320
So he wasn't in power at this time.

1239
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,440
So this is 2011.

1240
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,520
And yeah.

1241
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,840
So my dad's like, why don't you go see a friend of the Philippines?

1242
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,600
And I was like, well, sure.

1243
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,560
So I asked Ghost Lightning and he's like, well, that sounds cool as fuck.

1244
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,960
So the plan is I'm going to go there for a whole month.

1245
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,640
I'm going to live at Ghost Lightning's house

1246
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,720
because the cost of living in the Philippines is dirt cheap compared to like, you know,

1247
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,280
like American dollars will carry you obscenely far over there.

1248
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,320
So the plan was that my dad was like the most expensive parts to fly.

1249
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,160
It's like $1,000 just to fly there.

1250
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,800
Right.

1251
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,640
So my dad was like, all right, I'm going to give you, you know, the $1,000 to the flight,

1252
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,800
$300 to give to Ghost Lightning as like a rent fair, you know, like to stay there for a whole month.

1253
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,360
And then.

1254
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,800
I love the rent fair.

1255
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,040
Yeah.

1256
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:55,440
He gave me, my dad had given me like, like $1,000 of you can spend this.

1257
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,160
And then $1,000 of this is just in case, you know, in case anything is wrong.

1258
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,640
So I was trying not to break into that thousand at all.

1259
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,480
But the other thousand, the first thousand, you can spend this thousand.

1260
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,480
I took, you can spend this to mean I will spend all of this.

1261
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,440
Oh, absolutely.

1262
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:13,920
Yeah.

1263
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:22,800
So, um, so yeah, I took off to the Philippines and it was, it was, uh, look, I used to be,

1264
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,080
I mean, if you think I'm awkward and, uh, and, and weird now, I used to be exceedingly

1265
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,440
socially awkward to the point that I made very stupid decisions based on it.

1266
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,840
So for instance, Ghost Lightning had given me his phone number online.

1267
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,920
I foolishly had not attempted to call that number to make sure I had it correctly.

1268
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,080
I never, because I just thought like, oh, I don't want to bother him.

1269
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,480
You know, like, I don't know what time of day he's awake.

1270
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,880
And basically I'm afraid of phones, you know, I would just never, I was like terrified of

1271
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,040
calling anybody and having to talk on the phone.

1272
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,240
So I remember to this day, people always ask me to make phone calls.

1273
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,560
Yeah.

1274
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,240
When there's a phone call to be made.

1275
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,800
Exactly.

1276
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,760
So, so yeah, I just, I was like, oh God, I don't want to have the call.

1277
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,120
But then so, all right.

1278
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,360
So I get on a plane, uh, I think I flew to probably like Detroit or something.

1279
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,280
So one of those flights, one of those, uh, cities that you always had the layovers from.

1280
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:28,400
And then from there, I flew to Japan, which was like a 14, 15, maybe more hour flight.

1281
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:36,240
As long as the total trip, this was crazy because the total time that I was in the air was, uh,

1282
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,240
like, yeah, I think it was that I was in the air for 14 hours.

1283
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,280
But then because it's 10 hours ahead of us in the Philippines,

1284
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,880
it had been like exactly 24 hours from the time I left that I arrived.

1285
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,920
So like I traveled into the future.

1286
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,760
But, um, but in any case, so I took this, this longest flight to Japan.

1287
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,080
And then I was in Japan for like an hour.

1288
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,960
I've been there.

1289
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,120
I can say that I was in a moment, a brief moment in the Holy land before going straight down to hell.

1290
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,000
I gotta tell you, man, like, I think this, this could be,

1291
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
this could surely be my, uh, my Baka Gaijin, uh, talking here.

1292
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:24,800
But like people always say that when you go to Japan, like people who go there,

1293
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,720
like it's never what they expect.

1294
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,000
Like, uh, oh, the, the, uh, you know, the women aren't as beautiful as anime characters.

1295
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,280
And, and it's not like how you're thinking and stuff like that.

1296
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,880
Yeah. Well, maybe because I've watched a lot of Japanese TV and travel blogs and stuff,

1297
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,920
but man, in the short time I was there, it was exactly what I thought Japan is like.

1298
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,240
I was like, yeah, this is a thorough understanding of the Japanese culture from inside the airport

1299
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,360
for one hour.

1300
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:57,520
Yeah. I mean, every, all the ways that things are laid out, the ways that their PA system

1301
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:04,320
works, extremely organized, um, you know, constant updates on what is happening meticulously

1302
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,120
everywhere in the airport, you know, tons and tons of signs, informing you of everything.

1303
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:15,040
Also, all of the flight attendants, like everyone who, who's like, uh, you know,

1304
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,240
telling people, like calling out names to get on the plane, stuff like that,

1305
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,840
all beautiful women, all of them.

1306
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,600
You know, I, I noticed a, uh, when I flew to Japan, there was a very,

1307
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,720
they were all very nice and very well put together.

1308
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:28,960
Yeah.

1309
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,360
Just distinctly, definitely several notches above the other flights I've taken in like domestic

1310
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,320
cruise and shit.

1311
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,360
Like you go, I go to the airport, I expect the person calling me up to be like some,

1312
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,560
you know, 10 out of 10 anime babe, you know, some, some, you know, fat, fat old black lady

1313
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,040
or something, uh, is that my go-to for unappealing person?

1314
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,280
Sure.

1315
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,040
We got, we got a real John Tron over here.

1316
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,800
And then I go to Japan and it's all like, you know, like very, very well dressed,

1317
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,760
hair perfectly parted in a ponytail, um, like all, they all look identical.

1318
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,040
And I don't mean that in the all Asians look the same way.

1319
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,880
I mean, they were all dressed and had their hair in the same style.

1320
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:21,920
And like, it was just all like late 20, early 30s, Japanese women with the same hairstyle.

1321
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,400
And they were all beautiful.

1322
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,040
So yeah, that's, that's Japan in my mind now.

1323
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,520
Ladies, you heard it here from Digi Bro.

1324
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,400
You're all beautiful.

1325
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,640
Yeah.

1326
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,200
Scarcely beautiful.

1327
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,360
You know, I'm just, I'm just saying that, uh, it is not a difficult job to be a flight attendant.

1328
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,960
I'm sure it's got its own challenges, but like the most important thing is that you

1329
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,120
look good and consistent with the airline's way it wants to present itself.

1330
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,040
So, uh, put some effort into that guys.

1331
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,360
Hey Nate, didn't you like go to Japan, like travel there?

1332
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,640
I sure did.

1333
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,880
Spent two, three months there.

1334
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,400
You're not on Nate's stories yet.

1335
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,440
Yeah, we can talk about that later.

1336
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:57,920
There's not.

1337
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,960
Why are you trying to co-op?

1338
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,120
Why are you trying to cut into my story to hear Nate's?

1339
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,920
I thought you were done.

1340
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,320
I'm only in Japan at this point.

1341
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,880
You've only gone to Japan.

1342
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,640
Well, he hasn't reached hell yet.

1343
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,280
Yeah.

1344
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,520
Yeah.

1345
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,160
So then it's like a, it's like a hour or two flight from Japan to the Philippines, pretty short.

1346
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:21,120
And so I get there and yeah, hell, good way to describe the airport in the fucking Philippines,

1347
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,360
because yeah, just like what monkey said about customs, it's basically a fucking long ass line

1348
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,800
to get up to a guy in a glass window, uh, with a very curt attitude who interviews you.

1349
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,120
And the guy, like I'm telling him, you know, I'm going to be here for a month.

1350
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,640
And he's like, well, like how can you be here for a month if you're like, like,

1351
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,120
if you're not going to have, if you're not going to be working, essentially.

1352
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,320
Like he was, he was basically trying to badger me about like he thinks, I don't know,

1353
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
maybe he thinks I'm here to do something illegal.

1354
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:52,960
But he's like,

1355
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,760
Is that beard, man?

1356
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,840
Is that beard terrorist written all over it?

1357
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,040
So for whatever reason, he gives me, he's like, I'll mark you for three weeks

1358
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,480
and you can come back and have you stay extended.

1359
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,680
And I'm like, uh, okay.

1360
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,520
You know, like I can't, I'm trying to argue with this guy, but it's, he's, he's just

1361
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,040
being a total asshole, right?

1362
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:20,480
So yeah, I get through him, get into customs, get, uh, thank God, I don't even bother.

1363
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,680
Whenever I travel, I only, only carry on.

1364
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,160
No, not carry on luggage.

1365
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:34,560
I can, I'm a master of packing things, you know, uh, all that butt sex and mostly 18

1366
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,600
times moving the house.

1367
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
I know how to pack shit tight.

1368
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,280
So, uh, so yeah, I've got, I've got all my shit.

1369
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,360
And I, um, I get off the plane and I go out, I go out, you know, it's

1370
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,160
monkey, you'll appreciate this.

1371
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,440
I don't think anybody else will.

1372
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,120
But in the proto men's song, uh, bring us the rope.

1373
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,120
That moment where you hear the, the, the doors open of the, uh, of the courthouse

1374
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,520
and it's like,

1375
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,760
you just hear like an army of people outside chanting and they're all, that's what it felt

1376
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,360
like walking out of the airport.

1377
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,880
There's just an endless ocean of humanity.

1378
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,440
It's just people everywhere.

1379
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,680
And like, so the idea is, you know, like any other airport, there's just like a

1380
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,360
couple of lanes of cars that are coming in to pick people up, but it's like almost

1381
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,760
all cabs and there's like hundreds of them and it just goes on and on.

1382
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,840
And there's just endless sea of people.

1383
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,760
And I, of course, I'm, I mean, I'm already late.

1384
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,960
Like I'm supposed to have been there like 30 minutes ago.

1385
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,920
Ghost lightning has, I don't know this yet, but he has a cab waiting for us.

1386
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,560
And they're, you know, they're going to be charging a lot.

1387
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,760
Like I don't know what he paid for that cab, but I know it was probably a, like a

1388
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,960
deafening amount of money.

1389
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,240
You know, I'm going to kind of put that on him because planes are unreliable.

1390
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,120
And like if there's so many cabs, you should be able to just get one.

1391
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,160
Well, I mean, I'm already like 20, 30 minutes late, but now I'm about to be

1392
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,040
another 40 minutes late because I'm trying to call this guy.

1393
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,440
And of course I have his number wrong and I'm trying to find him in an endless sea

1394
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,480
of people.

1395
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,280
And neither of us knows where the other is supposed to be.

1396
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,360
He can't even really know if I've landed yet because I have had no real way of

1397
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,400
contacting him this whole time I've been traveling.

1398
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,200
You know, I've, I'm on like, I think I'm on like an old flip phone.

1399
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,000
No, my dad let me bring an iPhone one.

1400
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,920
I didn't have my own cell phone at the time.

1401
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,600
So I brought like my mom's old phone or something like that.

1402
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,240
So I'm trying to like, you know, figure out what to do with this number.

1403
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,200
And I can't get like Wi-Fi reception or anything.

1404
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,040
So I'm like freaking out.

1405
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm like, what the fuck do I do?

1406
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,320
You know, I'm wandering around for like 40 minutes.

1407
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,920
Finally, it occurs to me to try to send an email to him.

1408
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,000
So I am able to get just the faintest connection like a, it loads for like a

1409
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,200
straight minute to get into, you know, anything.

1410
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,920
And I send him an email that's just like, you know, I'm here, but I have your number

1411
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,600
wrong or something like that.

1412
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,720
And he says to me like, he sends me one that's like gate 13.

1413
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,880
I'm wearing a Mazinger t-shirt.

1414
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,160
And so eventually I did find him.

1415
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,840
And yeah, it was a nightmare.

1416
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,200
So, and then he was hoping you were going to say that like the only way that you

1417
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,320
ended up able to communicate with him was you had to really quick do an anime

1418
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,560
analysis and post it to your blog to convey the information of where you currently were.

1419
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,360
And he had to like decode it.

1420
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,400
Like the first letter of each word said what gate he was at.

1421
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,640
I'm pretty sure Twitter existed at the time.

1422
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
But so, so, yeah.

1423
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,800
So, and then the other thing is like in the Philippines, and I suspect this is

1424
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,680
true of, I mean, this is true of some places in America, but it's definitely true of

1425
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,560
other countries.

1426
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,640
There's just constant people hustling everywhere.

1427
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,720
So one of the things that down there is that they'll have guys who just like at

1428
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,920
that area who are just constantly offering to take your bags.

1429
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,080
Like they'll like they'll carry it to the car for you.

1430
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,160
You know, like, oh, let me, let me, let me.

1431
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,320
And so I, of course, I let some guy and we carry him out to the car and then go

1432
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:16,560
slightly.

1433
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,400
He's like, you got to tip that guy.

1434
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,240
You know, I'm like, of course I do.

1435
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,440
Like I didn't even think about it.

1436
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,000
Like I just think in these guys work for the airport.

1437
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,200
And it's like, no, these guys are, they're doing this for tips.

1438
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,200
You know, so I tip him probably something too much because I didn't have my bills

1439
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,400
broken down far enough.

1440
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,880
That's when you turn to him and say, here's the tip.

1441
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,200
Get a real job hippie.

1442
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,400
They pull out their knife and I think I probably had to pay him an American

1443
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,520
dollars because I hadn't converted my money yet to there.

1444
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,360
So I don't know what it was worth to him.

1445
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,480
It might have been worth nothing.

1446
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,080
You know, so, uh, so I stayed in the Philippines for a month.

1447
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,040
It was a good time.

1448
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,520
Um, so the travel back as Bumky said, also gigantic pain in the ass.

1449
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,080
So of course you remember that guy who gave me the three weeks and said, come back.

1450
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,600
You know, I didn't come back.

1451
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,680
You know, I just come back to do that.

1452
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,120
So, so, uh, go sighting drops me off at the airport.

1453
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,680
It's like six in the morning.

1454
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,640
Where does that guy even get off?

1455
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,680
What is he like?

1456
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,440
Why do these fucking people at the customs want to fuck with you so bad?

1457
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,160
I don't know.

1458
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,840
Do they think that we're actually terrorists?

1459
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,720
Like you were joking.

1460
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,040
Well, all right, what is their mindset?

1461
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,600
What's the difference between three weeks and a month?

1462
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,320
You know, I don't know what that kind of nitpick.

1463
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,640
I do not understand because it seems very insignificant.

1464
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,240
Like you just want to fuck with you, but they are trying to like minimize threat

1465
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,640
levels.

1466
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,960
I mean, I really don't know what goes into constituting that.

1467
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,040
But something like what I didn't understand about it is that like I had my return ticket.

1468
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,240
It's not like I was, you know, getting a one-way trip and I was saying a month

1469
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,760
and then I would just never go back.

1470
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,160
I'm going to come leech off your fucking country.

1471
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,280
Yeah, I have a fucking ticket.

1472
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,000
You retard.

1473
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,040
What do you want from me?

1474
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,120
That's exactly the weird thing is you have the return to go home after three weeks.

1475
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,880
I have no idea.

1476
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,360
He just wanted me to come back to the airport all the way the fuck across town,

1477
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:09,040
you know, and go through security again to go talk to him in a little glass booth at customs.

1478
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,200
And may I remind you that and this is the biggest problem of my trip to the Philippines.

1479
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,920
In the universe.

1480
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,400
I had a good time there, but I did not do it right because as I'll remind you,

1481
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,480
I had never been traveling before and I hated to go anywhere alone.

1482
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,400
And no one there speaks English unless you're in like a rich area.

1483
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,760
So like, you know, I think they speak in the Philippines.

1484
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,120
Ghost Lightning would try to like this to Gallag is what it's called.

1485
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,440
And he would try to teach me like basic enough to Gallag that I could like,

1486
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,680
you know, figure out prices of things and take public transit because we mostly took public transit.

1487
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,600
Though they had like a house driver, like a guy.

1488
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,640
I think it was like, I think it was like his wife's uncle or something who like would just wife's boyfriend.

1489
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,080
No, his wife's uncle who would just like drive like his,

1490
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,240
they would just pay him to be around with a car to drive members of the family,

1491
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,840
wherever they needed to go around town.

1492
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,400
That's the cool thing about less than first world nations.

1493
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,000
You got you got shit like that going on.

1494
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,360
You just have lots of cool stuff.

1495
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:15,920
It's pretty cool.

1496
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,920
They had a bunch of house servants and stuff like that's pretty dope.

1497
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,480
Like who but yeah, that was my favorite because what he would do is he would like,

1498
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,360
like, you know, we'd be let's go to the mall and he just like drop us off in front of the mall

1499
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,400
and then he'd go find parking, you know, and then he just kind of like hang out in the parking lot

1500
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,320
until we were done and we'd like text him and he'd come and pick us up in front of the mall.

1501
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,320
There's not enough focus put on the suffering we as Americans endure by not having personal

1502
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,240
drivers. That's a big it's pretty cool.

1503
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,680
I would love to have one.

1504
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:51,440
But it's that's the thing to pay someone a livable wage in America wouldn't be worth it.

1505
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,400
Thanks for that $15 minimum wage, Bernie motherfucker.

1506
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,280
So, I mean, you could probably pay Ben in leftovers to drive you around.

1507
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,000
It would be my honor, sir.

1508
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,240
I don't know what Ben when Ben's job and never really brings him in contact with a dumpster,

1509
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,600
you know, jump from him.

1510
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,360
He's going to jump from that job pretty quick.

1511
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,240
He can't be trusted.

1512
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,320
I see I'll go and go where the money is in the dumpster.

1513
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:25,040
I'm driving and he's catches a dumpster out of the fucking driver's

1514
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,920
slams of the brakes and he's like, doggy, I got a I got a gold rush today.

1515
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,760
So anyways, the homeless warrior.

1516
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,320
Yeah.

1517
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,920
So yeah, I didn't I did not go out much and like go sighting was always encouraging me like,

1518
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,400
you know, when I'm not because, you know, he was working.

1519
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,240
So he's like, when I'm not around, you should go out and go to the mall or go to go to the

1520
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,280
fucking airport and get your shit figured out with three weeks.

1521
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,640
They, you know, go somewhere.

1522
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,000
I never went anywhere unless either him or his wife was with me.

1523
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,080
You know, like I would exclusively go places with them except for one time that I walked

1524
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:09,920
a couple miles to Jollibee and ate Jollibee Jollibee is the Philippines equivalent of

1525
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,640
McDonald's.

1526
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,320
I mean, they have McDonald's everywhere.

1527
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,080
But basically McDonald's took too long to come to the Philippines.

1528
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,400
So they made their own fast food chain.

1529
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,480
I mean, KFC is huge there.

1530
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,800
They KFC was like the first to go everywhere.

1531
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,800
They they they they franchised around the world early, which is why the rest of the world

1532
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
likes them and we don't give a fuck.

1533
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:34,960
But Jollibee was one they made up themselves and like the Philippines has a very, very

1534
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:41,120
interesting set of fast food regulars that they that they have their go-tos because they've

1535
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:46,240
got burgers with with like white cheese and tons of mayonnaise, which just seems to be

1536
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,160
an Asia thing in general.

1537
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,560
Then they've got fried chicken and spaghetti.

1538
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,000
And like spaghetti jets.

1539
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,680
The Jollibee when you go to Jollibee, it's it's you got your bird.

1540
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,560
You got like two kinds of burger like the small big burger.

1541
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,040
Then you've got the like three to five drumstick fried chicken and then you've got spaghetti.

1542
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,920
And then if you go to McDonald's, they also serve spaghetti.

1543
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,600
So that's awesome.

1544
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,960
Like everywhere there is like those are the three staples of fast food.

1545
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,800
Burger, fried chicken, spaghetti.

1546
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,320
So yeah, I walked to Jollibee one time.

1547
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,760
Do they have fried chicken and McDonald's?

1548
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,880
Um, I don't know if they have on the bone fried chicken there, but they have.

1549
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,440
I mean, McDonald's has, you know, they had chicken fries and selection shit at the time.

1550
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,560
Like a drum drum leg or whatever the fuck it's called.

1551
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,240
I don't think they have those at McDonald's.

1552
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,600
Drumstick, that's right.

1553
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,040
But they did have spaghetti.

1554
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,280
So anyway, I want to try McDonald's spaghetti.

1555
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,640
That sounds amazing.

1556
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:40,880
Yeah.

1557
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,720
You know, when I moved out to Cincinnati, I just noticed like chili is the thing that

1558
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,400
appeared in every restaurant and they're like gold star chili is like as big as I

1559
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,680
don't know Dunkin Donuts out here.

1560
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,000
Another thing to realize is that McDonald's is a little bit more upscale there because

1561
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,400
they charge the same prices that they would in America, but that's vastly more there.

1562
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,240
That's what it was like in Lublin too.

1563
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:02,800
There was a McDonald's.

1564
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,520
Same with Japan.

1565
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,160
Same with Japan.

1566
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,280
There was a McDonald's and it was the food was the same, but they charge the same as in

1567
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,000
America and therefore it was pretty fucking expensive.

1568
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,920
I thought it was real quick and they charge the same as it was in America and therefore

1569
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,240
it was kind of like a relatively upscale restaurant.

1570
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,800
It was like right in the center of the fucking city and it was a rather fascinating phenomenon.

1571
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:29,920
The fact that America has a more economically strong position means that like by exporting

1572
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,280
what's an equivalent price point outside of America, they all kind of get a nicer

1573
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,680
version of that shit than we get relatively speaking.

1574
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:44,400
That reminds me that in Latvia, when I stopped in Latvia on the way to Estonia,

1575
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,960
I got off the train and I walked around and I ate some fucking gummy jelly shit that was in

1576
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,800
some candy shop and that was great.

1577
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,120
But I also went to a McDonald's and in this McDonald's in Riga, Latvia,

1578
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:59,920
there was like a super nicely laid out thing with like this fancy fucking dessert tray,

1579
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,520
this fancy dessert rack with all these like fancy cheesecakes in it and stuff.

1580
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,560
And I went and I fucking, I ordered my burger and the manager fucking brought the burger out

1581
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:13,360
to me and he was in like a nice smart like tie and he like sat the burger down in front of me

1582
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,520
and like smoothed down the little napkin and was like, please enjoy your burger, sir.

1583
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:17,840
Got it.

1584
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,120
And I said, and I said, nothing, I didn't care.

1585
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,920
And I said, your people are what's ruining my country.

1586
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,520
I said, patreon.com.

1587
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,920
They had some like two story McDonald's in the Philippines and just like these gigantic and

1588
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,040
yeah, a little bit a little bit fancier, not like super fancy, but whereas pizza hut for

1589
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,800
some reason, extremely fancy because also they charge the same prices here.

1590
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:48,080
So the equivalent of like, if you just bought a pizza in the Philippines, you're basically

1591
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,400
spending the equivalent of $25 on it.

1592
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,120
So, you know, did you just jog by memory?

1593
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:58,240
The McDonald's I went to in Argentina had like cheesecake and shit, like a bunch of random

1594
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:58,880
fancy stuff.

1595
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,520
Yeah, yeah.

1596
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,960
The one in Latvia had the cheese.

1597
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,120
So, so anyways, so, so for my travel backstory from the Philippines, I of course have not

1598
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,960
adjusted this three weeks thing.

1599
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,000
I've stayed a whole month and I have not done anything about it.

1600
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,880
So ghost lightning drops me off at the airport.

1601
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,480
It's like six a.m.

1602
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,960
My flight is at like seven or so.

1603
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,440
Oh, that's a bad move.

1604
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,560
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not I'm not it probably wasn't that close.

1605
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,040
But like what matters is that it's early in the morning.

1606
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,400
That's the detail you need to know.

1607
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,000
So I go in and I'm like, you know, I'm at the flight desk and they're like, well,

1608
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,440
you only had three weeks that you were allowed to be here.

1609
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,480
So we're going to charge you like a fee, right?

1610
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,040
Of like $80, which was a lot.

1611
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,160
It's not that bad.

1612
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:48,480
Right.

1613
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,600
I'm sure it could have been worse.

1614
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,960
But I was like mother because, you know, I've already spent in the time I'm in the Philippines.

1615
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,960
I spend hundreds of dollars on anime bullshit.

1616
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,240
Like a significant amount of all the figures and shit that you see in my videos are bought

1617
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,640
in the Philippines because they're way cheaper there and they had way more variety because

1618
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,680
not only do they have tons of bootlegs, but there's there's just tons of toy stores there.

1619
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,720
Like if you go into a mall, there will be several stores that are just anime toy stores.

1620
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,040
And even Toys R Us there has tons of anime shit because they're, you know,

1621
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,000
they're close to Japan.

1622
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,520
They have lots of anime on TV.

1623
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,000
They've got Animax Asia and shit like that.

1624
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,120
So, you know, I would walk into a Toys R Us and they got Gintama toys and for cheap.

1625
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,240
So I'd buy them everywhere.

1626
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:41,520
So I had my backpack was totally full of toys because again, I only do carry on.

1627
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,160
And so I just took like everything I bought, I just took it out of the box and put it in

1628
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,360
the backpack like individually and then and left all the boxes at Ghost Lightning's house.

1629
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,400
I assume he threw them away.

1630
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,960
I had said something about like getting him to ship them to me.

1631
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,720
I don't know why I thought I would do that, but he probably threw them away a long time ago.

1632
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,720
So, or immediately rather.

1633
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:08,000
So yeah, I have all these anime toys and shit in my in my backpack.

1634
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,360
And then I, yeah, I'm at the airport and they're like, you have to pay a fee.

1635
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,400
So I'm like, fuck, I have to.

1636
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,520
Okay.

1637
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:25,520
I think this is why it was an issue is that I didn't have enough Filipino money left to pay this fee.

1638
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:31,920
I only had like I had already run through all like because the way I was getting Filipino

1639
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,800
money is I had all these these like conversion checks.

1640
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,080
Like my dad had written me all these checks where basically you go to the bank.

1641
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,240
Yeah, cashier's checks where you go to the bank.

1642
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,760
You sign in front like you have one signature that's already on there.

1643
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:50,880
And then you sign again and like at the bank and then they they exchange it for cash.

1644
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,440
So I mostly had a bunch of these checks and

1645
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,600
and I had like some American money and some Filipino money that I had cash,

1646
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,520
but I had several unchecked like uncashed checks, but I couldn't do anything with them.

1647
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,240
Right.

1648
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,360
And it was funny when I went to do that, when I went to sign the second time at the bank,

1649
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:15,600
because my signature is so fucking inconsistent, the lady was like really confused when I signed

1650
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,120
them and she was like, I need you to duplicate your original signature and then duplicate this one

1651
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,840
for me.

1652
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,000
And I did that as best I could.

1653
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,400
So so yeah, so so I'm like, fuck, the only way I'm going to be able to afford this,

1654
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,840
because they wouldn't take my American money.

1655
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,600
They were like, you need more Filipino money.

1656
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,000
So I was like, well, I've got a couple of these checks left.

1657
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,560
There's a bank in the airport.

1658
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,000
It's closed and it doesn't open till 8am.

1659
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,520
Which is after my flight.

1660
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,640
Oh, fuck, right.

1661
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,800
So I don't have anything.

1662
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,320
So I'm freaking out.

1663
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:52,640
And then a police officer who's nearby is like, hey, look, I'll make this exchange for you.

1664
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,600
I'll give you Filipino money in exchange for American money.

1665
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,760
And I think it was that maybe it was that it.

1666
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,840
Yeah, I think it was that it was like 80 bucks is what I needed.

1667
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,800
But I only had like 50s on me or something.

1668
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,480
I only had $100 for some reason in American money.

1669
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,560
So I just gave it to I was like, you know, he gave me the equivalent of 80.

1670
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,440
And I gave him 100.

1671
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,240
He was like, are you sure, man?

1672
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,920
And I was like, I have no choice.

1673
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,600
This is all I have.

1674
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,840
I need my flight to 10 minutes, you know.

1675
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,960
That remind one time I was I was one quarter short of being able to do my fucking laundry.

1676
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,840
So I went wandering around the streets and just found a guy.

1677
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,560
Like it was like the midnight so nothing was open.

1678
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,840
But I found at the back of the local Little Caesars Pizza, there were people cleaning up.

1679
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,920
And I just I walked in to the back of the restaurant after they were close and said,

1680
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,400
can someone please give me a quarter?

1681
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,600
And I just I gave a guy $5 for one quarter.

1682
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,960
Oh my god, you could have got a hot ready pizza for that five.

1683
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,880
They didn't have coin converters in the laundry mat.

1684
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,920
Dude, I don't use a laundry mat like there's a machine in my basement.

1685
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,960
Uses quarters because I'm getting fucking scammed every day of my life.

1686
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,040
But yeah, like it's it's a nightmare actually getting those getting the courts to that.

1687
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,320
I have to go to the bank and shit fucked up to stop washing your clothes.

1688
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:15,920
I'm doing that.

1689
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,880
I'm trying that.

1690
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:23,280
So so yeah, so so I get I finally I get the money I get through and then I fly to I think

1691
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,960
I don't think I had to stop in Japan on the way back.

1692
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,880
I think it was just a straight flight to America.

1693
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:33,760
But this time it's another customs fuckery situation where like I land in the U.S.

1694
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,680
with like maybe like 45 to 50 minutes to get to the next flight.

1695
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:39,920
Right.

1696
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,720
So this is this is going to be cutting it close no matter what.

1697
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,480
And it's a long ass line in customs.

1698
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,680
But we're going through pretty quick.

1699
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,600
Now what's amazing about this is that like everyone else on the flight I'm with is like

1700
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,160
Filipino.

1701
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,560
You know, I'm like like one of the only white guys.

1702
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,920
Everyone else is going through.

1703
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,040
They've got this left lane.

1704
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,400
Every guy's just like looking at him going.

1705
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,920
Oh yeah, go go go ahead.

1706
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,680
I get selected.

1707
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,040
I get pulled aside to this.

1708
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,360
This other room where this this other guy who is another Filipino guy.

1709
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,240
But they've there's these two dudes, these two like security guys who are running, you

1710
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,840
know, running through this guy's shit.

1711
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,760
And they're taking forever.

1712
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,680
They're like talking to the guy and shit.

1713
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,520
They're doing all this stuff and I'm looking over.

1714
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,480
I'm watching that other line just mosey on through constant stream of people and I'm

1715
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,800
checking my phone like like by the time these guys even start looking at my shit,

1716
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,080
I'm going to be fucking late.

1717
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,880
Right.

1718
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,640
So like they finally get that guy up and then they're going through my shit.

1719
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,120
And these guys seem like total dick bags.

1720
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,640
Like they've they've both got.

1721
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,600
I think that's a requirement for working at an airport.

1722
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,960
Have any of you seen the wire?

1723
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,240
Nope.

1724
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,640
Nobody.

1725
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,960
I've seen some of it.

1726
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,600
I know officer money penny or whatever.

1727
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
Hey penny from San Andreas.

1728
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,280
That's not helpful.

1729
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,040
I know there's a black guy who likes chess.

1730
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,640
There's these two asshole cops in the show.

1731
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,240
And that's what these guys reminded me of.

1732
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:10,080
Just like they had like this the attitude of like like like like like the jock cop is

1733
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,600
the kind of guys I'm talking about.

1734
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,680
You know, like Ben St was the cop.

1735
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,920
No, the opposite.

1736
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,880
It's the big old jock.

1737
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,160
Tough guy.

1738
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,280
Yeah, yeah.

1739
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:25,040
It's these two guys who are like, you know, they clearly throw their weight around,

1740
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,200
even though they're just like security officers or whatever.

1741
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,240
That's me.

1742
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,560
So they, of course, they open up my shit.

1743
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,920
They're going through all my stuff and they're not even very thorough.

1744
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,280
They're just kind of like looking at my stuff.

1745
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,480
And of course my fucking suitcase is just full of anime crap.

1746
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,880
So they're like flipping through my fucking gunslinger girl books and stuff.

1747
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,640
And like I had bought this.

1748
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,560
I'd bought like a 20 like every character from a certain scientific railgun because

1749
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,080
they had these like little mini figures and they you could buy them in like a set.

1750
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,080
And there's like 10 of them.

1751
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,280
So they're like opening up the little boxes and look at the like.

1752
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,120
So what are these for?

1753
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,280
I'm like, they're they're toys.

1754
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,120
They're he's like, yeah, what are they?

1755
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:05,520
What are they for?

1756
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,480
What are you going to do with them?

1757
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,040
You piece of shit.

1758
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,160
They're collectibles.

1759
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,360
So what the fuck do you mean?

1760
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,840
And he's it's like they I was like, you know, I'm probably going to give some to friends.

1761
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,160
I don't know, man.

1762
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,520
Like because I gave half of them to shade.

1763
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,480
It was just like, I don't I don't fucking know.

1764
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,040
What do you mean?

1765
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:21,520
What are they?

1766
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,640
They're fucking toys.

1767
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,440
What do they look like?

1768
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,520
Can't you see that I'm a fucking weird pedophile?

1769
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,800
Because this is I've got the you know, this is when I've got the super long hair all the way down

1770
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,760
to my ass.

1771
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,160
That's all frazzled and fucked up because I don't take care of it.

1772
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,400
I've got the shitty fucking goatee.

1773
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,080
So I'm I'm a hideous monstrosity.

1774
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:49,600
You know, I am obviously a gross pedophile terrorist.

1775
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,120
So like can't they just like it's like, are you going to arrest me or not?

1776
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,920
You know, like nothing in that bag is incriminating because I'm not retarded.

1777
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,840
So either arrest me because I'm clearly a bad guy or just let me through, you know, whatever.

1778
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,800
So I managed to I actually managed to make the flight with like seconds to spare.

1779
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,440
Like I ran across the whole airport.

1780
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,920
You know, I'm I'm out of shape.

1781
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,640
So I show up like winded my legs are burning and shit.

1782
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:22,800
Like I ran across the whole fucking Chicago airport or whichever one the one of the big ones.

1783
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:24,400
Yeah.

1784
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,640
And I guess that's basically the end of the travel story.

1785
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,360
Oh, what a journey.

1786
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,560
What an odyssey it was.

1787
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,960
Customs people should all be like fucking hanged.

1788
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,200
Yeah.

1789
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,200
You know, I've got I've got I have a positive story about the customs people.

1790
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,240
Oh, no, you don't.

1791
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,200
I do.

1792
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,040
Shocking and unforgivable.

1793
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,080
What did you have sex with?

1794
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,040
Like a cute little Japanese woman and you had sex with her or something.

1795
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:47,280
Yeah.

1796
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,840
I mean, all I had to do is take her out of my suitcase and let him fuck her.

1797
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,880
And then he let us go through.

1798
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,480
So it was pretty good.

1799
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,480
You know, it was worth it for my investment.

1800
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:56,720
Okay.

1801
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,520
So I mean, I'll go with your mind real quick.

1802
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,720
That was such a weird reversal on what I think monkey meant.

1803
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,440
Maybe I misunderstood.

1804
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,920
He was implied that you had sex with the customs lady.

1805
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,640
You seem to imply that you had a Japanese lady with you who had sex with the customs guy.

1806
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,240
In my suitcase, I guess I've been like forming this idea in my head.

1807
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,720
Listen, you guys tell travel stories like you're a pedophile.

1808
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,400
They're examining what's in your bag.

1809
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,440
There's a little girl in there.

1810
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,120
You know, some, some like that.

1811
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,640
It all comes together.

1812
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,440
Yeah.

1813
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,640
So, so, okay.

1814
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:37,280
So the most interesting travel I've done was when I visited Japan for two months before my

1815
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:42,560
senior year of college when I was studying Japanese and at school at the College of New Jersey.

1816
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,120
And that was by far, yeah, it was pretty nerdy.

1817
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,600
The best thing it was, it was the best thing about college without a doubt other than meeting

1818
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,440
my friends, which, which was good.

1819
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,720
But, but this trip was, was the best.

1820
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,200
It was, it was the best thing I've done in my life.

1821
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,280
So, the trip there was actually great.

1822
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,600
I mean, I was lucky that, yeah, like my parents helped me pay for the trip.

1823
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,640
I couldn't have done it on my own.

1824
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,920
And I got a bunch of cashier's check, got all my shit together, packed my bag,

1825
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,960
packed all my anime shirts to wear what the people in Japan wear and got on the plane and

1826
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,560
and just got out there.

1827
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,360
And then the flight out there was, was pretty, pretty great.

1828
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,160
Can't really complain.

1829
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,960
I think it was from Logan Airport in Boston.

1830
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,200
And I think there wasn't a stopover.

1831
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,480
I think it was like a one shot.

1832
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,360
I could be wrong about that.

1833
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,400
But in any case, the flight to Japan was lovely.

1834
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,320
It was like the best airplane food I've ever had.

1835
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,520
I had like a fucking meal and it was like, it was like comfortable.

1836
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,080
Yeah, please.

1837
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,560
And the air ladies were great.

1838
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,360
It was, it was wonderful.

1839
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,600
And so, so I was living there, going to go into this school.

1840
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,760
I actually looked it up while you guys were talking.

1841
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,080
It's KCP International.

1842
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,240
So it's like the PCP only with a K for Japan.

1843
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,080
And also international.

1844
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,400
Yeah, and also that.

1845
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,240
So that place was great.

1846
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,720
It was this, this cool ass school.

1847
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,400
Wait, the PCP is international.

1848
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,160
We have hippo and mage.

1849
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1850
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:11,600
That's true.

1851
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,720
Fuck you, Ben.

1852
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,840
You're not international.

1853
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,040
I'm made of real countries.

1854
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,280
Wait, international doesn't just mean Japanese.

1855
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,960
I don't understand that.

1856
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:19,680
Not anymore.

1857
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,200
Unfortunately not.

1858
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,480
You learn something new every day.

1859
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,320
Well, not if you're me.

1860
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,480
The mind of a homeless man is a closed book.

1861
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,720
There's nothing new entering or leaving it.

1862
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,880
So I have a closed book.

1863
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,560
I'm washed up.

1864
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,880
I'm set in my ways.

1865
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,440
So I don't have much to say about that.

1866
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,720
I mean, it was just a school.

1867
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,000
There was a bunch of Koreans.

1868
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,080
It was mostly Koreans, probably half Koreans.

1869
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,000
Then a bunch of weeby Americans

1870
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,760
and a couple of British people and shit.

1871
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,480
They were all cool.

1872
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,440
But what was interesting about it was

1873
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,920
I noticed where my money went while I was there.

1874
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,120
Because I spent an ungodly amount of money there as well.

1875
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,000
I bought like one thing I was really looking forward to

1876
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,120
was that I'd never been satisfied

1877
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,000
with the selection of one piece shirts.

1878
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,800
Well, that too.

1879
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,880
I did try to get laid extensively in Japan.

1880
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,760
That was probably the number two thing

1881
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,200
that I engaged in while I was there.

1882
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,240
But right.

1883
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,400
So I was trying to find one piece shirts.

1884
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,480
And I was online one day and found this ad.

1885
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,120
I just found a magazine that had ad for one piece shirts

1886
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,080
from Uniqlo.

1887
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,640
And they just had fucking one piece shirts.

1888
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,760
So it was a big day trip.

1889
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,120
I dragged a couple people out.

1890
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,080
We went to Uniqlo.

1891
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,200
Were you a day tripper?

1892
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:40,640
Yes.

1893
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,320
Yes.

1894
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,040
Good joke.

1895
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:43,840
Thank you.

1896
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,640
Thank you.

1897
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,200
Thank you.

1898
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:49,520
I found the promised land of one piece shirts in this Uniqlo.

1899
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,360
And I bought them and it was good.

1900
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,920
It was actually fun.

1901
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,840
I did that like early on in my trip.

1902
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,520
But later on when I just like started,

1903
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,680
when I figured out how to wander on Akihabara and shit,

1904
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,240
like there was more to be found.

1905
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,240
Just like on the street everywhere.

1906
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,440
Well, okay, I'm exaggerating.

1907
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,200
But like in like the clothing districts and shit,

1908
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,720
in like the shopping centers,

1909
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,240
there was just tons of one piece shit.

1910
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,000
Because Japan gets it.

1911
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,320
Japan understands that nothing else matters except one piece.

1912
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,720
So aside from just like buying that shit,

1913
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,680
my money was divided up between like bar tabs,

1914
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,440
you know, buying alcohol, going to food places,

1915
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,640
like the McDonald's we'd go to after being out all night,

1916
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,640
trying to get laid in Roppongi.

1917
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,920
Roppongi was the place we went,

1918
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,040
like the club district, me and a couple of friends from school.

1919
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,400
We'd go there and my money was consumed by that.

1920
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,600
But then more interestingly,

1921
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,840
I spent a lot of time at both crane machine arcades

1922
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,880
and just like straight up game arcades in general.

1923
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,120
Because there was this game that I was already really into,

1924
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,080
Project Diva, the, you know, the fucking Hatsune Miku,

1925
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,440
you know, rhythm game.

1926
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,320
And that game was hot at this time.

1927
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,880
I think this was like 2000, it is awesome.

1928
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,600
It was fucking great.

1929
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,040
And they had these arcade booths

1930
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,680
where people would be lined up around the fucking block

1931
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,800
to sign up and play fucking Project Diva.

1932
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,840
And I would play Megurini Luca.

1933
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,800
I can't remember what fucking song.

1934
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,640
I had like one song I was pretty good at.

1935
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,760
But these guys were masters.

1936
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,280
They were, they were grandmasters.

1937
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,440
Like the Japanese have abandoned their Kung Fu ways

1938
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,600
and taken up the project Diva ways and they have excelled.

1939
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,440
And it was, it was pretty dope.

1940
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,720
Spent a lot of time there.

1941
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,440
Bought a lot of Jojo figures from these like crane machines.

1942
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,240
Oh, one, one fun time I had was that,

1943
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,800
like on the day I was leaving, I, there was this,

1944
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,880
there was this two piece set of a,

1945
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,600
a two piece of one piece.

1946
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,320
No, unrelated to one piece actually.

1947
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,880
There was, so early on when I was there,

1948
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,720
there was like this crane machine, like,

1949
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,720
that was set up with like a two piece thing.

1950
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,120
One had C2 from Code Geass.

1951
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,960
The other had Colin Kozuki.

1952
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,000
And like on the first day, well, early on when I was there,

1953
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,760
I won the C2 set, like a piece of the two piece set.

1954
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,640
And I was like, yeah, great.

1955
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,920
But one day I've got to get that Colin.

1956
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,200
So I'll come back later.

1957
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,760
And I never did until the very day I was leaving

1958
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,600
to get on the plane to go home.

1959
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,720
And I happened to walk by an arcade that had that Colin,

1960
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,000
other half statue of what I had.

1961
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,160
And I was like, well, this is a sign, gotta do it.

1962
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,000
So I spent like two hours in this crane machine

1963
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,480
just putting 100 yen after 100 yen,

1964
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,480
after 100 yen into the machine,

1965
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,920
trying to fucking get this thing.

1966
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,640
And like after like half an hour,

1967
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,880
the guy who owned the place just like noticed

1968
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,040
what I was doing and like tried to come over

1969
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,960
and give me some pointers to stop wasting money

1970
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,960
to like actually help me win the thing.

1971
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,200
Cause I definitely spend like hundreds of dollars

1972
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,920
by the time this, well, okay, maybe a hundred all told.

1973
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,960
What were you trying to get again?

1974
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,600
I was trying to get like, so I've got the statue.

1975
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,680
I've got, I'll put like a picture of it or something.

1976
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,040
It's like a combining statue of, from the anime Code Geass,

1977
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,240
C2 the character and Colin Kozuki.

1978
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,760
And like you can put them independently.

1979
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,240
That's Colin's dad felt to you.

1980
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,400
No, no, I understand.

1981
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,680
I am a true Japanese man.

1982
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,960
I have been to the promised land.

1983
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,320
I'm one of her now.

1984
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,920
I am with the struggle.

1985
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,040
And anyway, I fucking like eventually,

1986
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,240
even his help was enough.

1987
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,720
So eventually he just like adjusted its placement.

1988
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,280
He re opened the thing, adjusted where the thing was.

1989
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,400
Let me do it again.

1990
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,720
And then I won the thing like immediately.

1991
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,240
So basically he would put so much fucking money

1992
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,680
into trying to buy what was probably a $20 toy

1993
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,440
that he had to give it to you.

1994
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,880
He just took pity on you.

1995
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:37,920
That's exactly what happened.

1996
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,000
He just took pity on this poor white man,

1997
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,600
just throwing away his entire inheritance.

1998
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,200
That figure was probably for sale in like a store behind you.

1999
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,240
Like for half of what you spent on it.

2000
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,200
But you know, then I would have this cool ass story.

2001
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,720
And that's right, that's right.

2002
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,240
This honest, honest engine who took pity on me

2003
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,040
in the land of the rising sun.

2004
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,640
And so that was that.

2005
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,760
But one other thing looking back on that I noticed.

2006
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,280
So one of the things I did while I was there,

2007
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,440
like the other big expenditure I made

2008
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,640
while I was in Japan was I bought a gym membership.

2009
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,240
But getting a gym membership for like, even in America,

2010
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,320
getting a gym membership for a short amount of time

2011
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,480
is not something you can do easily.

2012
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,080
So like I ended up spending like a quarter of my total money

2013
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:32,640
on, yeah, like hundreds of dollars on this fucking gym membership.

2014
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,080
Are you fucking kidding me?

2015
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,680
I had to get my lifts.

2016
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,760
I had to get my lifts while I was there.

2017
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:42,160
It was, yeah, it was, you know, it was a really nice place.

2018
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,160
It was the funniest thing was when I signed up,

2019
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,160
I had to do like a one-on-one interview.

2020
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,840
And like most of them spoke Japanese obviously,

2021
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,160
but there was this one lady, this like young girl,

2022
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,560
and they were all wearing the exact same like track suits.

2023
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,760
They were all uniformed up as like staff members of the place.

2024
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,040
It was, in fact, it was just like this fucking manga

2025
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,200
I'm reading right now, Nankiro Damoru or whatever it's called.

2026
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,560
It's about weightlifting girls.

2027
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,280
Great, I love it.

2028
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,120
But it was a very lovely experience going there.

2029
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,600
But the cool thing I learned while I was there

2030
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,720
that in gyms, in like weightlifting gyms in Japan,

2031
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:18,080
did you know that if you have any tattoos,

2032
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,360
you have to cover them up because there's so many Yakuza members

2033
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,600
that go to these gyms with tattoos all the place

2034
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,200
that it is inevitable that a gang war will break out in a gym

2035
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,040
if they see each other's tats.

2036
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,000
Yeah, so you got it.

2037
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,440
You are not allowed to show any fucking tattoos on your skin

2038
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,960
in any of the gyms in Japan.

2039
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,000
Yeah, it's pretty dope.

2040
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,280
But anyway, so yeah, that's how I spent my time there.

2041
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,760
And the flight back was much more painful.

2042
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,560
So like on my way back, I was late and just missed my flight

2043
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,680
because I've never been very good at being on time for things.

2044
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,360
And I fucked this one up bad.

2045
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,360
So I probably got there an hour later or something.

2046
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,920
I just didn't understand the travel times yet

2047
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,920
to get to the airport specifically.

2048
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,520
And when I got there, I missed my flight.

2049
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,080
It was shitty.

2050
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,360
So I just got a flight the next day.

2051
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,560
I just got pushed back.

2052
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,720
They took pity on me and gave me a flight the next day.

2053
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:13,920
So I just spent a day in the Tokyo airport,

2054
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,280
wherever the fuck this was.

2055
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,400
And I used that time at the time.

2056
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,200
I mean, my Japanese was at its best ever at this point.

2057
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,520
So what I did was, this was a wonderful airport

2058
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,800
with lots of shit to do.

2059
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,960
So I just went on down to the bookstore,

2060
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,640
bought myself the entirety of the Skypea arc

2061
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,720
of one piece in one piece volumes

2062
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,600
and the last 10 volumes that had come out at that time,

2063
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,440
which was like during Fishman Island.

2064
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,400
And just sat down, read myself some one piece,

2065
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,920
tried to learn as much as I could.

2066
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,520
Isn't it like 30 books?

2067
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,960
I mean, I probably bought like 20 right there.

2068
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,160
But they're pretty sure you have those.

2069
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,120
Oh, so this car.

2070
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:50,960
Yes.

2071
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,680
So this car.

2072
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:54,720
What were you saying, Mom?

2073
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,920
How did you carry 20 anime books at the same time?

2074
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,120
They're really not that big.

2075
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,720
Like, they're small.

2076
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,240
I mean, I have a bunch of them on myself.

2077
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,440
I mean, they're like a book.

2078
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,840
You don't know anime like me, all right?

2079
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,720
You don't understand.

2080
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,000
I've been to the Holy Land.

2081
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,480
Who are you?

2082
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,560
Who the fuck are you, Mumpy Jones?

2083
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,280
No, no shit.

2084
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,640
Anime books are smaller in Japan.

2085
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,400
They are Motomichikaku shit.

2086
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,680
I think the ones that they...

2087
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,800
I think the ones that they...

2088
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,240
Everything's smaller in Japan.

2089
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,120
Hold on.

2090
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:25,440
Yep.

2091
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,760
Oh, Shisai.

2092
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,800
Motochisai.

2093
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,320
Why was I thinking Miji...

2094
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,240
Well, I'll tell you why.

2095
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,520
Ichiban Shisai.

2096
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,240
I'm looking through my Japanese to English dictionary now

2097
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,920
to figure out why I was thinking of...

2098
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,800
Oh, I almost forgot.

2099
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,480
I also went to Comic-Cat while I was there.

2100
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,200
And that was cool.

2101
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,640
Oh, fuck you, guy.

2102
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,840
Yeah, I don't know.

2103
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,160
I would love to go to fucking Comic-Cat.

2104
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,480
If I... I would never go to Japan, fuck Japan.

2105
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,960
The only reason I would ever break that promise

2106
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,800
is if I could go to Comic-Cat.

2107
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,280
Ben, what would you do at Comic-Cat with no money?

2108
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,080
Eat a fucking dick, dude.

2109
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,120
The only thing to do there is to buy shit.

2110
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,320
It's a comic market.

2111
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,720
I would look at fucking comics.

2112
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,320
I would look at fucking dojin artists.

2113
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,040
There is a second thing.

2114
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,480
There is a second thing to do while you're there.

2115
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,560
I would go to fucking be around people

2116
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,400
that were buying shit tons of dojins.

2117
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,200
It would be cool.

2118
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,400
What's cool?

2119
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,440
That is cool.

2120
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:17,920
What's cool?

2121
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,480
Davoo is literally howling.

2122
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,560
Literally howling out my window.

2123
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,120
I mean, Ben, we've both watched...

2124
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,320
Fuck.

2125
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,120
Comic-Party.

2126
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:27,840
Comic-Party.

2127
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:28,080
Right.

2128
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,040
So we understand.

2129
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,480
We knew right then and there.

2130
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,200
Yeah.

2131
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,040
That was the life for me.

2132
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:33,680
Right.

2133
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,960
So you can go there and you can reach it.

2134
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,200
But the other cool thing that was happening there was like...

2135
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,200
So at Comic-Cat, you're not allowed to take pictures

2136
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,800
of cosplayers at any time.

2137
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,960
Unless there's a giant open square

2138
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,800
down to the side of the convention.

2139
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,600
And that's where cosplay sluts go

2140
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,800
to get their pictures taken.

2141
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,080
And they get corralled in there.

2142
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,920
And if you're in the danger zone,

2143
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,480
people can take pictures of you and you can't complain.

2144
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,560
You got to deal with that shit

2145
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,400
within the bounds of decency, I'm sure.

2146
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,400
So looking at all the...

2147
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,040
Like the cosplay there was obviously far better

2148
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,520
than any of the shitty conventions I've been to in America.

2149
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,960
Comic-Cat cosplay is...

2150
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:09,600
They know what's up.

2151
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:10,960
Yeah.

2152
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,520
And that's it.

2153
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,800
That's based on the whole story.

2154
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,480
Oh, so this guy...

2155
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,000
Ah, yes, and you're...

2156
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,200
So, so...

2157
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,640
He's in your days.

2158
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,600
He's in your...

2159
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,080
Yeah, my trip to Japan really taught me a lot.

2160
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,440
So what is the moral of all these stories?

2161
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,000
What is the consensus on travel here?

2162
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,080
The moral of the story is don't travel.

2163
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:30,880
It's boring.

2164
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,120
Don't go through customs because they're all fucking asshole.

2165
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,880
Oh, I forgot my custom story.

2166
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,600
Let me tell you my...

2167
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,480
That's really short.

2168
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,800
When I was on my way back,

2169
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,400
when I got the flight in from Japan to

2170
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,560
wherever like Chicago airport or whatever in America,

2171
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,000
so like when I got through there,

2172
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,600
like I didn't have to do any interview stuff.

2173
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,160
Like it seems like you guys did when you traveled internationally,

2174
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,200
but I did get like...

2175
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,320
There was like one, you know,

2176
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,720
international level of like bag searching and shit.

2177
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,480
So like this guy opens my bag

2178
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,880
and one of the things I had bought as like a present when I got back

2179
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,160
was I bought my parents a big old bottle of sake.

2180
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,600
And they just...

2181
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,560
Foolish.

2182
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,080
That's yeah, it's totally illegal

2183
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,520
and you're not allowed to do it at all.

2184
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,640
And he's just like...

2185
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,440
Wait.

2186
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,320
You got a bottle...

2187
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,360
Well, it's because like you can't...

2188
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,800
You could like store shit in it or something.

2189
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,280
Not to mention you can't have liquids above like...

2190
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,040
Yeah, I just had it in my bag.

2191
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,240
Oh, okay.

2192
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,160
And so like the guy just stops me.

2193
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,560
That's true of all flights, not just international.

2194
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,400
You cannot bring liquids onto a flight.

2195
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,520
Well, I don't remember if this was on in my carry-on

2196
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,200
or in like my separate bag.

2197
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,720
It must have been my carry-on.

2198
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,600
I don't actually remember.

2199
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,960
But like whatever bag it was,

2200
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,280
this guy examined it and he opened up and he's like,

2201
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,920
Dude, you know this is illegal, right?

2202
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,600
And I was like, I don't know anything about anything.

2203
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,920
Why would you think that I know anything you asked for?

2204
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,880
You immediately went,

2205
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,320
Ah, so this guy!

2206
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,160
I am just a Japanese grandmother.

2207
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,520
I am just a Japanese grandmother.

2208
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,360
I saw the officer.

2209
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,880
It's his first time I do it.

2210
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,600
That was pretty much what I said,

2211
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,760
just in my perfect English.

2212
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,400
And he, you know, he literally just...

2213
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,080
He was like, dude, you know this is illegal, right?

2214
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,200
You're not allowed to travel this.

2215
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,520
And I was like, I'm sorry, please.

2216
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,760
Is that a fact, sir?

2217
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,080
Yeah.

2218
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,160
And he just said, all right, no big deal.

2219
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,280
Go on, let me go.

2220
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,320
You nigger, how'd you even get away with this?

2221
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,040
He let me keep it.

2222
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:15,920
He didn't even take it.

2223
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,440
He let me keep it and just let me go.

2224
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,760
And then I gave it to my parents and we all drank it

2225
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,120
and it was a grand old time.

2226
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,920
And when I got back from Japan,

2227
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,560
my parents had tried to put together a sign

2228
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,080
that said welcome back, Nate,

2229
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,560
or like welcome to America in Japanese.

2230
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,920
And they fucked it all up.

2231
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,920
It was a bunch of nonsense.

2232
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,880
Embarrassing.

2233
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,400
It was truly embarrassing.

2234
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,000
That's when I knew they were, we were done.

2235
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,240
That's when we were done that day.

2236
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,560
They can't even speak the king's Japanese.

2237
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,480
The king's Japanese.

2238
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,840
The emperor's Japanese, whatever.

2239
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,280
I'll say that that time going to the Philippines

2240
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,360
was real scary and it was difficult on the travel.

2241
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:57,360
And a couple of times I flew out to Montana

2242
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,960
to take the Clunge Plunge.

2243
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,040
It was disgusting.

2244
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,440
It was still a little like, the first time I did it,

2245
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,520
I was, it was still kind of a pain in the ass.

2246
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,200
But by the second time I was like, you know what?

2247
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,960
Flying, whatever.

2248
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,280
Ain't that big a deal?

2249
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,680
The funny thing is like, I think I was always so afraid

2250
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,040
of like everything going wrong.

2251
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,480
But even when stuff does go wrong,

2252
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,000
it's fixed pretty easily.

2253
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,440
It just wastes time.

2254
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,960
It's just like, oh, you missed your flight.

2255
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,280
Well, you got to take one like in four hours.

2256
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,240
So have fun fucking around the airport, you know?

2257
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,320
It's, people are pretty accommodating really.

2258
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,240
Like you'll, if you miss a flight, they'll help you,

2259
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,000
but you will have to wait until like,

2260
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,600
you just got to waste a bunch of fucking time.

2261
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,600
And I've gotten so used to the airport itself

2262
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,400
because of radcons one and two,

2263
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,920
where I was constantly driving back and forth

2264
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,680
to the airport to pick people up.

2265
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:53,360
And now I have like, I could perfectly envision

2266
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,680
every square inch of that airport now.

2267
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,680
Like I know it like the back of my hand.

2268
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,920
So I have a sense of confidence about that airport.

2269
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,560
Like, you know, if I got to fly somewhere from here,

2270
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,240
I know exactly what it's going to be like.

2271
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,280
I know what's going to happen.

2272
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,280
Nothing's alien to me, you know.

2273
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,880
I finally understand how baggage claim works

2274
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,920
after having watched Jesse go through it.

2275
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,840
So, yeah, I feel like, you know what, travel, yeah, whatever.

2276
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,280
But the cost of travel,

2277
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,760
kind of like everything in life.

2278
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,600
You just got to know what you're getting yourself into

2279
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,200
and then calculate if it's worth it

2280
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,200
because it costs money, it costs time.

2281
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,040
It'd be nice if we could just tell up our people places,

2282
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:33,840
but we can't.

2283
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:39,120
So just, you know, that whole ending part

2284
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,760
was just so I could say the phrase, clunge, plunge.

2285
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,960
That's the only reason I told that part of the story.

2286
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,320
Good, worth it.

2287
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,480
So how about we just go to questions?

2288
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,600
Yeah, questions, questions.

2289
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,640
Some of these shits.

2290
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,040
All right.

2291
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,400
I remember everybody tweet us.

2292
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,160
We tweet out when we were fucking doing the shit,

2293
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,560
usually on Saturdays or on like 4 p.m. or so.

2294
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,360
So at TP Crasnators, all right, let's see what we got.

2295
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,640
Hey Nate, remember when mom and dad took us to Mexico

2296
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,840
and we stayed at Club Med?

2297
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,440
Um, actually I don't remember that at all.

2298
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,560
I was like 4.

2299
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,160
I remember that it happened sort of.

2300
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,560
And I vaguely, vaguely remember it

2301
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:16,240
and that was the only good travel story of my miserable life.

2302
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:16,640
Really?

2303
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,680
You remember fondly?

2304
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,080
I was in Vietnam.

2305
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,520
No, it sucked.

2306
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,680
It actually sucked, but I do sort of remember.

2307
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,480
I sort of remember being annoyed and not liking it.

2308
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,440
And there we go.

2309
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,520
Well you know, our dad took us to a lot of places.

2310
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,600
He liked to travel and we've been to like

2311
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,600
Seattle as a family and like Disney.

2312
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,080
That's true.

2313
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:33,040
And we went to a couple.

2314
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,080
We went to a couple new worlds.

2315
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,960
I went to a new world.

2316
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:35,920
Yeah, I didn't go to land.

2317
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,040
I went to a new world.

2318
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,160
And we'd been to, you know, like the Grand Canyon

2319
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:41,120
and just like Utah.

2320
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,520
Oh yeah, we did travel to the Grand Canyon.

2321
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,440
We went to see the place that I wanted to see,

2322
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,600
which was Utah Arches National Park.

2323
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,040
If only I had been old enough to remember any of this story.

2324
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:54,080
I have had the ultimate travel story in my life,

2325
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,400
but I was a child because my parents

2326
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,560
toured with Lollapalooza.

2327
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:03,840
It's a big fucking tour from the 90s

2328
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,320
that the Jane's Addiction created.

2329
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,400
And it was just like every fucking cool band of the 90s

2330
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,160
would all tour around the country.

2331
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,920
We went to like 36 different states

2332
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,640
because my parents were running a clothes vendor.

2333
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,240
So we traveled in a fucking,

2334
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:21,200
in a shitty fucking mobile home

2335
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,800
that broke down constantly.

2336
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,640
All kinds of terrible stuff happened.

2337
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,400
Every story I've heard from it

2338
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,800
is like, this is the ultimate story,

2339
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,720
but I'm too young to remember any of it.

2340
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,840
So I can't tell.

2341
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,800
The only thing, the only thing I remember

2342
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,040
other than skipping rocks with Green Day,

2343
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,960
because Green Day would babysit me and Victor

2344
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,040
in exchange for clothes at the time.

2345
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,200
Is that actually the band you're talking about?

2346
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah, the band Green Day would babysit me and Victor

2347
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,600
and we were babies in exchange for free clothes from my dad.

2348
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,240
And you can see that the clothes that my dad gave them

2349
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,280
was from Perniche.

2350
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,920
They wore it at Woodstock in 95, so.

2351
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,280
Well, shit.

2352
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,800
Yeah, so I was babysat by Green Day on this tour.

2353
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,120
It's ironic because now you're an American idiot.

2354
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,040
Yeah, and I remember we were going to the Grand Canyon,

2355
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,440
but for some reason I heard Grand Cannon.

2356
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,880
So I spent the whole time thinking

2357
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,400
we were going to a giant cannon.

2358
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,800
I thought it would be fucking awesome.

2359
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,720
It would be.

2360
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,720
Yeah, and I remember that while I was thinking

2361
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:25,280
about the Grand Cannon, the smashing pumpkin song,

2362
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,960
in spite of all my rage, I'm still just

2363
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:27,600
a rat in the cage.

2364
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,240
I don't know what it's called.

2365
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,040
That song was playing.

2366
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,400
That's all I remember of my trip around the world

2367
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,720
to 36 states or about America.

2368
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:37,040
When I think of Grand Canyons,

2369
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,560
I think of my favorite cannon,

2370
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,440
which is the ones that send you places from Secret of Mana.

2371
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,200
Yeah, Cannon Travel Agency.

2372
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,320
Cannon Travel Agency.

2373
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,520
All right, that's enough about my bullshit.

2374
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,200
Okay, what kind of questions we got here?

2375
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:52,560
Let's see, okay, let me find one.

2376
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,040
Okay, I got to find a filler one,

2377
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,200
so you guys can talk while I find one that's better.

2378
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,480
I'm gay.

2379
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,080
I'm gay.

2380
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:00,720
Okay, here we go.

2381
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,600
Sold us, guys.

2382
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,480
Sold us, man.

2383
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,400
Megan Lau at Nyan Kwan asks,

2384
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,200
how do I become as suicidal as Monkey Jones?

2385
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,400
Oh, shit.

2386
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,040
Well, we'll fucking watch his video

2387
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,440
on top deadliest suicide methods.

2388
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,760
But that's once you're already suicidal, that's useful.

2389
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,200
How does she get to want to do that?

2390
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,840
I'd say just based on who you might be,

2391
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,160
I think if you watch either the Depression video

2392
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,240
and or the Elliot Roger review,

2393
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,280
maybe it'll get you there.

2394
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,240
Yes.

2395
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,280
Okay, here's one.

2396
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,200
AtcoreReviews asks,

2397
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,080
guys, how do you feel about cooking slash baking?

2398
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,400
Do you enjoy it and are you good at it?

2399
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,000
The answer for Ben is no,

2400
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,840
because he just had a huge baking experiment.

2401
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,040
Don't say it.

2402
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,080
Don't say it.

2403
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,280
Now I'm curious.

2404
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:49,840
You know what?

2405
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,800
You didn't like it,

2406
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,800
but I thought it came out pretty good.

2407
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,480
You just didn't like the ingredients.

2408
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:54,880
That's all.

2409
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,400
No, don't fucking say it.

2410
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,520
You need to tell us right now.

2411
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,080
Don't say it.

2412
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,640
You know what?

2413
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,160
If you say it, I'm just going to edit it out.

2414
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,520
I'm not sure why it's a secret,

2415
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:05,120
because this video won't come out for a week and a half.

2416
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,240
I don't care.

2417
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,280
You're not allowed.

2418
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,760
Wait, are you just saying this is a time-sensitive thing?

2419
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,000
Yes.

2420
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,800
That's the reason.

2421
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,360
Anyway.

2422
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,000
That's fine.

2423
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,040
The people will know one day.

2424
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:13,760
Just tweet about yourself.

2425
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:14,560
It was whatever.

2426
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,760
You didn't like the ingredients.

2427
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,400
That's fine.

2428
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:16,960
That's fine.

2429
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:17,760
It's not for everyone.

2430
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,560
It's only for people with refined palates like myself.

2431
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,960
You should have gone to Papa John's for better ingredients.

2432
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:23,600
Yeah.

2433
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,400
That's true.

2434
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:25,440
Shit.

2435
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,360
Now I want pizza more than I want beans.

2436
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,200
I forgot about my desire for beans earlier.

2437
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,080
Oh, then who's got cut out of your beans?

2438
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,440
Hey, it's not the first time, and it won't be the last.

2439
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,280
Hey, here's one.

2440
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,640
Monkey, this is mostly for you,

2441
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,760
because you just do this the most of the time.

2442
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,400
Me again.

2443
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,000
Well, it's for everybody.

2444
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,440
But at JoshRushyAsk,

2445
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,920
what's the weirdest slash most disgusting snaps,

2446
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,120
as in Snapchat, I assume,

2447
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,200
you guys have ever gotten from fans?

2448
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:52,000
Immediately after doing the interview with Monkey,

2449
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,280
where I was saying,

2450
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,880
I was asking him if he gets dick pics,

2451
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,320
and he said every day,

2452
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,840
and I said, I've never gotten one.

2453
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,320
And so immediately someone sent me a dick pic,

2454
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,680
and I blocked it.

2455
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:06,320
So then I realized why I don't get dick pics

2456
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:10,160
is because anytime something happens to Monkey,

2457
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,640
and I think, man, how have I been so lucky

2458
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,160
that my fans aren't like that.

2459
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,760
I then remember that anytime

2460
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,280
anyone fucks with me in the slightest,

2461
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:17,920
I blocked them.

2462
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,520
And that's why it just happened to me.

2463
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,000
Solid, solid reason.

2464
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,280
Okay, so the worst thing I can think of right now

2465
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,040
is just like a close-up of a guy's hairy asshole

2466
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,000
while he's shitting,

2467
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,800
so I can see the shit come out of my mouth.

2468
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,520
Oh my god, no.

2469
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,520
And it puts me to snap,

2470
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,560
so like you kind of know what you're looking at.

2471
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,000
Yeah, how the fuck did he do that?

2472
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,760
Ben sees that, and Ben just thinks,

2473
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,120
oh man, dinner is served.

2474
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:41,920
Here we go.

2475
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,240
How did he pull off this fucking snap?

2476
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,360
That's like impressive.

2477
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,000
That is impressive.

2478
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,760
No, I didn't interview him about it.

2479
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,720
I've got to bring him on.

2480
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,320
Do an interview with this man, Monkey.

2481
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,040
We need this.

2482
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:57,200
I finally started, finally, after all this time,

2483
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,760
I finally started getting nudes on Snapchat,

2484
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,760
and I've been trying to send them back,

2485
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,600
but it's so difficult to hold my gigantic phone,

2486
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,240
which by the way is an S7 Edge,

2487
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,360
so it's got the little,

2488
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,080
like it's got the,

2489
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,240
like if your fingers touch the little edge piece,

2490
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:14,080
and it does, you know, it'll do things,

2491
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,200
so like trying to hold the phone and press the button

2492
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:20,800
and hold it at an angle where you can actually like see me

2493
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,000
is just impossible.

2494
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,760
I'm like, how the fuck, like,

2495
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,200
I don't know how the, how she's sending me

2496
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,120
these impressive pictures,

2497
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,680
but I can't fucking do it without breaking my hand.

2498
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,520
Well, you win some.

2499
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,360
Yeah, I, yeah, I know what you mean.

2500
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,000
I actually, I mean, I try to take progress pics

2501
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,560
to keep track of like my muscle building and stuff,

2502
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,080
and it's actually really hard.

2503
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,240
It's fucking hard to go and do that shit.

2504
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,000
I usually, I'll just like turn on the camera

2505
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,080
and like record and then just take a video

2506
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,840
and then just divide up into clips.

2507
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,440
So if somebody ever hacked into my computer,

2508
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,000
they would find in many pictures of me mostly naked.

2509
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,560
Not entirely though.

2510
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,360
Okay, here's one.

2511
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:02,320
At LazyAceDia asks,

2512
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,720
was there ever a time you questioned your sexuality

2513
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,400
or have you always known you were gay?

2514
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:12,960
I always knew.

2515
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,520
Next question.

2516
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,400
I always knew.

2517
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,840
Yeah, that's, I think we all knew.

2518
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,560
Let me see here.

2519
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,160
Okay, let's, all right, let's,

2520
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,400
fuck, no, hang on.

2521
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:24,960
Let's fuck.

2522
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,520
That's actually shit.

2523
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,080
That's gay.

2524
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,480
Which is why I'm into it.

2525
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:29,360
Yeah.

2526
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,000
Okay, here's that.

2527
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,120
We can end after one of these or something.

2528
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,920
But this guy asks, advice, what's the perfect ratio

2529
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,280
at M Spectrum asks, what's the perfect ratio

2530
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,200
of editing to video output?

2531
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,080
Snore, what a gay question.

2532
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,280
I'm just, I'm just saying, is there,

2533
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,800
is there a number to be found?

2534
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,880
No editing whatsoever is the ideal level of editing.

2535
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,640
Just do the opposite of what Nate does.

2536
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,280
Yeah, anything that's not what Nate's doing

2537
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,800
is what you should be doing.

2538
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:00,640
To me, anything that's not that.

2539
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:04,960
If it takes, I mean, anything that I don't send to DeVoo,

2540
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,400
the most it's gonna take me to edit is a couple hours.

2541
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,240
I should be able to do it in one sitting.

2542
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,240
And if it, if I can't do it in one sitting,

2543
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:16,240
it means it's gonna be, it's gonna be hell before it gets,

2544
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:20,720
like the top 10 and top 20 anime of the year videos.

2545
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,160
I edited those myself.

2546
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,880
Each of them only took a couple of hours to do,

2547
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,240
but because there were so many breaks in the workflow,

2548
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,600
then it took me like days.

2549
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,640
And I was only able to finally do it

2550
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,520
when I like got shit-faced and could convince myself to work.

2551
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,280
I hate editing.

2552
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,640
I remember that.

2553
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,640
Yes, editing is bad.

2554
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,920
This guy, incidentally, actually, never mind.

2555
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,800
Okay, last question.

2556
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,680
Let's end on this one.

2557
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,440
At Wienermeister asks,

2558
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,280
TP Crasnears, where is my dad?

2559
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,560
I haven't seen him in two weeks.

2560
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,080
You might have to ask for asking.

2561
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,680
You might have to ask our buddy.

2562
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,760
I mean, I know I was complicit in this,

2563
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,920
but I don't actually know what Munchie does

2564
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,680
with the dads that we steal,

2565
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,640
so you'll have to consult Munchie about it.

2566
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,720
I know I've got someone's dad in my trunk,

2567
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,880
but it might not necessarily be your dad.

2568
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,360
Yeah, I mean, I just steal the dads.

2569
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,680
Well, wait, what was this guy's name?

2570
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,280
It was at Wienermeister.

2571
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:22,160
Well, Wienermeister, I mean, is your dad too missing his hands, feet, and head?

2572
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,080
If so, it may be him.

2573
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,600
Okay, that's enough.

2574
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,560
Once again, all terrible questions.

2575
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,760
Do better next time, people.

2576
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,120
Very disappointed.

2577
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,200
As always, terrible questions.

2578
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:41,440
Words of encouragement from best guy ever.

2579
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,640
Do better next time.

2580
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,160
I get it.

2581
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,280
Our audience has this weird...

2582
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,800
It should be the easiest thing in the world to ask questions.

2583
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,320
Just make them stuff that all of us can answer,

2584
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,640
because we will not select your question otherwise.

2585
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,160
When we were doing the let's plays,

2586
01:45:58,880 --> 01:45:59,840
we had, like, me...

2587
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,040
Oh, man, that was a disaster.

2588
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,320
Yeah, I put out a tweet that's like,

2589
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:05,760
me, Munchie, and Victor are playing video games.

2590
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,720
Tweet us questions.

2591
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,400
And, like, half the questions are stuff like,

2592
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,000
what's your favorite anime studio?

2593
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,720
I'm like,

2594
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:14,240
brother fucker, these two don't even know what an anime studio is.

2595
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:18,160
I bet Munchie cannot name one fucking anime studio.

2596
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,920
A1 Pictures is the best one.

2597
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,680
There you go, that's true.

2598
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:27,120
Expect to have anime-related questions just soundly, roundly ignored.

2599
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,320
I am the...

2600
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,360
Let me get this...

2601
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,440
Since people don't seem to understand this,

2602
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:35,600
because everyone in the PCP likes some anime,

2603
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,160
but I am the only member of the PCP

2604
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,800
who gives a single fuck about anime.

2605
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,400
Maybe Nate as a second...

2606
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,200
They might be confused to think that I give a fuck about anime.

2607
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:45,920
Really don't.

2608
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,920
No, Nate watches like...

2609
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,200
They are deeply confused.

2610
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,240
For anybody,

2611
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,640
if you're watching anyone's channel other than mine,

2612
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,520
the amount of shows that they've talked about on their channel

2613
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:59,200
is just about the exact same as the amount of shows they've seen.

2614
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,840
Like, there's...

2615
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,960
Well, that is not true for me.

2616
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,160
That is not true for me.

2617
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,760
Okay, we'll say double then.

2618
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,240
Double, double the...

2619
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,720
You are underestimating how many fucking shows I've seen.

2620
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:09,120
Well, then you...

2621
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,200
I started watching anime before you fucking child.

2622
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,480
You're a little baby, you don't know anything about anime.

2623
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,920
You did not start watching anime before me.

2624
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:14,720
Don't...

2625
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,440
I think you might have.

2626
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,640
You started watching during the original Adult Swim,

2627
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,320
because that's the old school Adult Swim,

2628
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,240
when they had the actual footage of pools and shit.

2629
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,840
Yeah, 2001.

2630
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,400
That's...

2631
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,040
Okay, there you go.

2632
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,600
So same time.

2633
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,920
But I mean, that's when I found out it was called anime.

2634
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,560
You know, I mean, I've been watching Sailor Moon and Pokemon.

2635
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,080
Pokemon and Yukio and shit.

2636
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,680
Well, Yukio would have been after Adult Swim started, but...

2637
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,640
Look, we all know you watch more anime than me.

2638
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:39,120
Well, that's why I said that he was the only other person

2639
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,200
who could be said to care about anime out here.

2640
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,280
Like, I mean, you and Ben have seen it.

2641
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:47,600
Like, Hippo has maybe seen, like, 15 shows total, if that.

2642
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,720
You know, like, he's only watched...

2643
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,760
I've probably seen...

2644
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,240
I've probably seen 20, 25.

2645
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:56,000
I just do not care about the anime industry nearly as much as you.

2646
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,360
I mean, I care about it because I like anime.

2647
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,320
I want more good ones.

2648
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,600
But that's it, you know.

2649
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,800
Yeah, there you go.

2650
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,200
All right, that's it.

2651
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,680
We're done.

2652
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,640
Oh, and I was just gonna say one more on your topic,

2653
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:10,160
on your point, Ben, that, yeah, my words of wisdom

2654
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,720
for the people here, always bad questions.

2655
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,960
Remember, the two most damaging words

2656
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,040
in the English language are good job.

2657
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,480
So never, you know...

2658
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,120
What?

2659
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,480
That's from fucking whiplash.

2660
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,280
That's from whiplash.

2661
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,000
Oh, shit.

2662
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,520
Because you gotta challenge people

2663
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,520
and tell them that they're shit until they get good.

2664
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,440
And no matter how good they actually are,

2665
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,560
they can always be better.

2666
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:35,040
Someone accused me of being the coach from whiplash

2667
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,560
after my big rant.

2668
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,960
That was one of the many comparisons I was getting.

2669
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,480
Where did they say that to you, did you?

2670
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,920
Say some comments somewhere.

2671
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,000
Then why the fuck didn't you say so?

2672
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:47,920
That's a quote.

2673
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:48,640
That's a quote.

2674
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,040
All right.

All right, thanks for listening.

2685
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:03,600
Cut him out.

2686
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,200
Just cut him out of this podcast.

2687
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:05,680
He's out.

2688
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:06,080
He's out.

2689
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,960
It'll be like he never even existed in the first place.

2690
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:09,440
Perfect.

2691
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,800
Just the way we're eradicated.

2692
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,160
Everybody say goodbye.

2693
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:14,800
Bye.

2694
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,280
Yeah.

2695
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:21,600
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2696
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:27,280
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2697
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,000
But I'm not working.

2698
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,560
I'm doing nothing.

2699
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,280
Why did I'm jerking?

2700
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,920
Myself, I'm sucking.

2701
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,640
I am an asshole.

2702
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,280
I am a stupid.

2703
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,000
I've got a deadline.

2704
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Don't want to do it.
