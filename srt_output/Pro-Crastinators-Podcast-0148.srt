00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,760
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,200
I am the best guy ever.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,240
What's so funny best guy ever?

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
Oh nothing, nothing Ben.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Yeah?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
What's up with you?

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Oh you know.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Just thinking about you.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Just chilling.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,600
Feeling good, feeling good after passing a fucking mineral through my fucking kidney

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,440
bladder fucking duct or whatever.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,920
That was what I was up to yesterday instead of going to Anthro New England like I was

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,520
supposed to for a nice relaxing day among my own kind.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,360
Instead I was in the hospital and on the toilet and in bed and in hell dying.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,200
Was it like solid as you passed it?

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,080
Was it like the Kramer experience from Seinfeld?

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
You know Nate.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Yeah.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
You know maybe we should introduce the others.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Okay that's true.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Let's get back to this.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Alright.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Tom's here.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Tom.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Great agony these days.

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Yeah.

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
My leg is fucked to shit.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm feeling my age and I was also supposed to go to Anthro New England yesterday and

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
have a good time among characters.

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Jesus Christ.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
You were?

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Yeah I was going to go.

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,520
What a coincidence that the two people trying to get to Anthrocon were struck in with illness

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
and weren't able to make it.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
I was fine.

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Just saying.

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I was fine the day before.

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,480
I was fine every day.

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,760
It was truly a divine intervention.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
That was the one.

41
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Could this be the result of keto?

42
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Could this be a keto?

43
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,360
I don't think so.

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
But you never know.

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Fair enough.

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Not a doctor.

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,400
Mages here of the lethal aurora variety.

48
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,320
I don't have problems as big as you guys though I am sleep deprived and I'm very cold because

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
of it.

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Heating is on in my room.

51
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,920
It's kind of stuffy and it's warm and I'm still cold.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
It's not like a physical coldness.

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,520
It's the kind you get when you're tired and you just, no matter how many you like it.

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,240
It's the kind you feel when your father comes home and tells you that your mother was just

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,440
run down by a reckless driver and he stares you down and deadens himself with alcohol

56
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,760
as he has for the last 10 years which may have been why she was standing in the street

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,080
waving her arms, jumping in the middle of traffic, hoping to be struck, to be escaped

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
from this terrible life.

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,280
Well not that kind of cold, but you're close.

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
No.

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Okay.

62
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Also, Endless Jess is here.

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Hello friends.

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,680
I have removed my face and my skin too and this is my new voice.

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Just like the Joker.

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,160
Who was telling me about someone, like their grandpa had to have an operation where they

67
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,880
had to like peel his face off and repair like a hole that had formed in his face skull.

68
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,520
Perhaps that was someone I know in my real life and not one of you guys.

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Everything you just said terrifies me.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Is that like a Roger Ebert sort of thing where like they just like removed like a chunk

71
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
of his like skull and then it was a weird.

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
They didn't remove it.

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
They had to repair a hole.

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
They were.

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Oh, they were.

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
I don't know.

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
This must have been one of my IRL friends telling me that this.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
You know, forget who said it.

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,040
There's a guy in JoJo part four who's just a child with a hole in his cheek that like

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,360
whistles as he breathes in and out through the hole.

81
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,480
And then there's like some weird rock, paper, scissors badly has with Rohan.

82
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm not going to worry about it right now.

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,560
I heard that JoJo is a bad show.

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,000
I saw this video essay on it recently about how a video essay you say it's not a rant.

85
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,080
By a drunken, enraged, shy man child.

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Um, well, I guess that depends on how you look at it.

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
You know, actually, Jesse, I'm actually fascinated.

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,240
I have not heard a single person speak ill of JoJo except Jesse.

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,640
What was this person's case as to why JoJo's shit?

90
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
You mean, you mean Digi, right?

91
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,520
Yeah, you said, uh, I've heard no one speak ill of JoJo except Digi.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
That's, isn't that what I said?

93
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
No, no.

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Everyone else has said good things.

95
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Oh, okay.

96
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Right.

97
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
My bad.

98
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
My bad.

99
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,240
I don't, I don't know what JoJo is and I never will.

100
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,320
I don't, I don't watch anime.

101
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm not one of you.

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
It's a secret.

103
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
It's a sacred cow of anime right now.

104
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,480
I watched the first part of part four and I was enjoying it, but then I stopped halfway

105
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,800
through and I meant to pick it up again, but I never got around to it.

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
That's my JoJo story.

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I read it.

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I love it.

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Uh, super great.

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
You're a big JoJo guy, Nate.

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,280
You're a big JoJo guy, right?

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
I'm such a big JoJo guy.

113
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,880
You've read the whole series.

114
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
I absolutely.

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,960
And I, the thing is, I'm such a big JoJo guy that I just sit here on my ivory tower looking

116
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,040
down in scorn at the anime viewers and just utterly disgusted by their base existence.

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,040
I was always under the impression that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure was just some Dreamcast

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,880
game from like 25 years ago.

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
It was a game.

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,000
And then like in recent years, I find out that it's like a real thing that is going.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,760
Are you thinking of Chuchu Rocket?

122
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
No.

123
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
I, my old age-

124
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
There was a JoJo's game for 10 casts like way back in the day.

125
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,040
I remember reading about it in magazines and being like, well, that looks like a, like

126
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,480
a Marvel vs. Capcom ripoff or something like that.

127
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,920
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure does sound like more like a video game than anything else.

128
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Yeah.

129
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,480
Um, hey, let's get back to my kidney stone.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,000
I want to dispel a myth because I learned a lot, I learned a lot about them as you might

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
imagine.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,680
See, I had thought, I had thought that the horror of a kidney stone was that you had

133
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,480
to pee it out and that you would have to like push out this rock like through your

134
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,600
dick.

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Turns out that's not untrue, but it doesn't, but it doesn't matter because at least in

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,280
my case, the kidney stone was tiny, it was like grain of sand size, like, and like peeing

137
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,600
that out is fine.

138
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
It's NBD.

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,120
It's the, it's the duct between the kidney and the bladder that's much thinner and that's

140
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,880
where it was caught and that's where it was painful and took like an entire day.

141
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,560
How'd you shake it loose?

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
What was done?

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I couldn't really do anything.

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,400
They prescribed me, they prescribed me hella pain killers.

145
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,440
They gave me some serious shit.

146
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,280
They gave me, they gave me, they gave me, they gave me, first they gave me, they gave me,

147
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,880
they hooked me up to an IV and then they gave me a drip feed of something that she described

148
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,480
as a non-narcotic thing that she compared to like super Advil and I was like, okay.

149
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,360
And it took the edge off a bit, but I was still in agony.

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,880
And so she's like, okay, I'm going to give you some morphine.

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,520
So she gives me a bunch of morphine and media, media had prepared me to think that morphine

152
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,360
was like a magical, beautiful experience.

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
I didn't actually like it very much.

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,920
She was like, you should feel it immediately and you should feel like a warm sensation

155
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
going over your body.

156
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,240
It felt a little warm, but mostly it just felt like, I felt like muscle ache sort of

157
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,760
like spread all over my body and then like I couldn't move very much and it didn't even

158
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
make it hurt less.

159
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,000
It's still hurt, but I just couldn't move very much.

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,440
I was like, uh, and, but the one good thing it did was it made it easy.

161
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,840
I was able to like start dozing off under the influence of that.

162
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
So that was good.

163
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Yeah.

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Okay.

165
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
That's good.

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
That's good.

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,880
But then, then she gave me Percocet, which is, which contains oxycodone.

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
So that's what she.

169
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Oh shit.

170
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,340
Oh yeah.

171
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
So that's what I got.

172
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
She gave me a prescription for that.

173
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,340
I took it home.

174
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,640
Um, anyway, I think with a bubblegum crisis by the way, I need some of that for my fucking

175
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
leg.

176
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
God damn it.

177
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,160
All the pain pills they've been giving me have been doing shit.

178
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I think I've passed it.

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I think I passed this.

180
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Okay.

181
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
So they gave me no joke.

182
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,880
They gave me paper cones with a like a fishnet plastic fishnet at the bottom to pee through

183
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,120
to catch the stone, to keep it, to, I get to obtain its power.

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
I think the idea is that you're supposed to bring it to a urologist and like they can

185
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,000
examine it and be like, okay, this is what caused it.

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Like it's made of this, this and that, you know, help in diagnoses.

187
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
But not me.

188
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm auctioning mine off.

189
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Um, so.

190
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Turn it to kidney stone.

191
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
It's like the infinity stone.

192
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Email me at IASU.

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:17,280
IASU comic at gmail.com with your best offer or just, or just PayPal me and I will, I will

194
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,120
send my kidney stone to the highest bidder.

195
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,160
Any suggested starting bid, Ben?

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
20?

197
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
100?

198
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Yeah.

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
20?

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
If we're not going above 20, I don't care.

201
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
It's not worth my time.

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,000
I mean, I had to suffer a lot to get this thing.

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's fair.

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,560
And listen, I have, I mean, I'm no, I'm no sorcerer or anything, but, but I have a feeling this

205
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,440
thing must be imbued with some hella dark energies.

206
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,240
This is like the male equivalent of like being a Snapchat thought, like instead of your personal

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,000
snapbacks or kidney stones and your blood and spit and maybe shit and cum, you know,

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
the whole works.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The whole works.

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,160
Send me, send me an email, serious inquiries only.

211
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,560
Again, it is very small.

212
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,520
It is only like the size of a grain of sand, but no solicitors unless serious.

213
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Yes.

214
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
And that's it.

215
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Well, there you go.

216
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
That's my kidney stone.

217
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Truly a degenerate end to a horrible story.

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,680
And you know, as horrible as it was, it could have been a lot worse because at the end

219
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,080
of the day, I was, it only lasted like a day or so.

220
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm glad to hear that.

221
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
But I have to ask the question.

222
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm sure that's on everybody's mind.

223
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Was it keto?

224
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,800
Will Keto cause my kidney stones?

225
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Have we doomed a generation to a fate of horrible sharp pains through their kidneys

226
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
and bladder?

227
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,700
I don't think so.

228
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,560
But I mean, I don't know.

229
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Drink water kids.

230
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Drink lots of water.

231
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,640
If I were going to blame something, it would be all the soda I drink, all the diet soda.

232
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,680
The one thing, the one thing, okay.

233
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,080
So now I'm also suffering in a new way and then I can't stop shitting water.

234
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,400
But I don't think, I don't think that that's because of the kidney stone or anything.

235
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,760
I think that I caught, brought that on myself by like when I stopped at the CVS to film

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
my...

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
It was a damn gypsy curse.

238
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,360
To film my Percocet prescription.

239
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,520
I bought a bunch of bags of sugar-free candy and I ate like all of them.

240
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,840
So I'm pretty sure eating nothing but like sugar alcohols for like an entire day probably

241
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
fucked my guts up and now I can't stop shitting water.

242
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,200
You know what else has sugar?

243
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
It doesn't have sugar.

244
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It has sugar alcohols.

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Soda.

246
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,600
No, it doesn't mage.

247
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It has...

248
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Not if you get the non-sugar kind.

249
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Yeah.

250
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,360
Sweeteners then.

251
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Get the fuck out.

252
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
You're just like my fucking aunt.

253
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh, you know it's rat poison, right?

254
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,880
Oh, you know it's rat poison, don't you?

255
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,760
Wait, what's rat poison?

256
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,960
Aspartame was what she was talking about.

257
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Oh.

258
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Well, great.

259
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm just nagging you.

260
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Good.

261
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I hate rats.

262
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Oh, rats are good.

263
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Rats are good boys.

264
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
You said that.

265
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
They didn't...

266
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,680
Didn't I tell you that at the family Christmas party, fucking Aunt Kelly or Nancy, whoever

267
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,280
the fuck, I can't tell them apart, one of them comes up to me and she sees me putting...

268
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Because we don't have any, you know, parents only had a limited supply of sweeteners so

269
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,560
I just like grab what was there, I put some aspartame, put some sweeten low or whatever

270
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,920
in my fucking coffee that I'm making myself and she goes, oh, you know what's rat poison,

271
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
don't you?

272
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,120
That is such a like family core thing to say.

273
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,400
So I pulled out my fucking, so I pulled out my fucking Glock, right, and I spun the camera

274
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,000
and I shoved it right up right in her mouth and I said, you know, you're gonna be rat

275
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
food, don't you?

276
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,760
And I pulled the trigger.

277
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,120
That's the right way to end that debate.

278
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,480
Fair, deserved.

279
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,200
That's what I call street justice.

280
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,480
Just to be fair, I'm not against like sweeteners instead of sugar.

281
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,880
I was just nagging.

282
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm morally opposed to it.

283
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm so fucking...

284
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
It's some pussy shit.

285
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
That's my shit.

286
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Some pussy shit.

287
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,840
Listen, you know, I stopped at the CVS and I'm looking at the bags of sugar-free candy

288
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,960
and I'm like, I'm gonna do this right.

289
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,000
So I look at all the ingredients and there's basically, okay, there's good like recommended

290
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,600
like sugar-alcohols and sugar substitutes like xylitol and there's another one I forget.

291
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Xylitol's one.

292
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,240
But none of them are made with the recommended ones.

293
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:26,080
They're all made with, oh fuck, malty, malty, malty, hold on, I don't know, there's two.

294
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,720
This is something, an isomalt and I'm like, okay, neither of these are the recommended

295
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,680
ones, but I look up the glycemic index of each one and I see that the malty, the malt

296
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,880
one, not that great, has a pretty high glycemic index, but the iso one has a low glycemic

297
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
index.

298
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm like, well shit, I wonder, I'm gonna try it, I'm gonna experiment.

299
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,080
So I bought like a bag of the malt, it got like fucking Reese's peanut butter cup, sugar-free,

300
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
made with the malto stuff.

301
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,880
I got a bag of Jolly Ranchers, fake Jolly Ranchers made with the isomalt, and I'm like,

302
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm gonna try eating these and we'll see if it knocks me out of ketosis.

303
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,960
I bring them home, I eat them, I eat them all, I eat so much of it, I'm sick, I can't

304
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,920
stop shitting water, but you know what, Pete on a strip, still in ketosis baby, fuck yeah.

305
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
That's all that matters.

306
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Well you know, I mean what this means, what this means is that I literally can eat fucking,

307
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,120
I can eat fucking Reese's peanut butter cups and be fine as long as I get the sugar-free

308
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,400
nuts in the forest for the trees by like obtaining keto, but like eating nothing that has actual

309
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,480
nutritional value though.

310
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,880
You're a fucking hack, Nate, you're fucking stupid.

311
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
The point of keto is that you're burning fat, and if you're not giving-

312
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah, but you still want like nutrients, right?

313
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Like, I don't know.

314
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,080
Nate, for fuck's sake, obviously I'm not gonna be eating nothing but fucking peanut

315
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
butter cups.

316
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
That's what you said you were doing!

317
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Get the fuck out of here!

318
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
You said you did that!

319
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,440
Yes, I did it this one time, and it was a mistake, and I'm sick, obviously, and I'm

320
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
paying for it.

321
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Okay, well-

322
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
I'll fucking end you.

323
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,720
I'm questioning your larger life choices here, at putting keto so far above, you know, this

324
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
other shit.

325
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Is it worth it?

326
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Yes.

327
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Okay, whatever.

328
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,600
Because I've lost like fucking 40 pounds, and fucking suck my cock.

329
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Well, sure.

330
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,640
And I still feel fat, and I still- and I hate myself, but objectively I'm less fat than

331
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,520
I was before, even if I feel the exact same.

332
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
So there!

333
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
I did it!

334
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Well, good.

335
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Wait.

336
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,680
That's- it's the- I blacked out for a bit.

337
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Because the moral of this story, that you can be less fat, and all you have to put up

338
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,200
with is like a kidney stone and shitting blood for a couple days, because that seems like

339
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
a good deal.

340
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
No!

341
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Basically.

342
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
One, kidney stone had nothing to do with keto.

343
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,920
Two, shitting blood, not water, and it's only because I made unrelated bad choices.

344
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,160
You can be skinny, and all you have to do is not eat carbs for like a year.

345
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Easiest thing I ever did.

346
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Bam.

347
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Fair enough.

348
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Fair enough.

349
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
And I'm fucking mad about it.

350
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
And I'm fucking mad about it.

351
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,360
Scooby says you can gain muscle while you lose weight, if you have balanced your diet

352
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
really well.

353
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,800
Yes, but what if I want to shit blood?

354
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,320
What if I'm sick of all of my blood, and I want to be ejected through my stinkiest hole?

355
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,680
I haven't discovered the secret.

356
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,880
I haven't discovered the secret of that yet.

357
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,200
I need to level up my water shitting abilities into blood shitting.

358
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,240
I mean, we're like 70% blood or something, that's a lot of weight.

359
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,600
So if you can figure out how to get rid of that, you'll be losing a ton of weight at

360
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
that point.

361
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
You won't even need keto at that rate.

362
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,600
If I get rid of all this blood inside me, I'll have more room for muscle.

363
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
You know, that's fucking true.

364
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,800
I'll take my blood out and fill it up with pure electrolytes, for peak male performance.

365
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Hey, if Metal Gear Rising Revenge and Sod is said, electrolytes heal you to maximum

366
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
health instantly.

367
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
You just have to crush the spine of a robot.

368
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Is it actually called electrolytes?

369
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Is that what they're referred to as?

370
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Yeah, Dr. Horace says you have to absorb everyone's electrolytes.

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
That's how you restore your HP.

372
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Just drink some fucking Gatorade, dude.

373
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah, you could smash their spine.

374
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Why would you drink a Gatorade when you can fucking drink the spines of Roboman?

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why would you drink a Gatorade when you could inject Gatorade into your spinal column?

376
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Exactly.

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Every enemy in the game is just a fucking bottle of Gatorade.

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You could be Gatorade.

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You just gotta cut the cap open.

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Hey, you know that video Digi made the other day about, this is my story, this is my thing

381
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
for the day.

382
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,100
This is a fascinating tale of an adventure I had.

383
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,500
You know Digi's video the other day on Digiber After Dark, that was him talking about, like,

384
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,500
it's great to be a YouTuber where he talks about, you know, all the bullshit from being

385
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,000
a YouTuber and all that stuff.

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Okay, so that was an interesting video and, you know, I had a lot of things to say.

387
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,400
I mean, Digi talked about it a little bit, but there was like, I was looking through

388
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
the comments because I was curious what people said.

389
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:30,200
I discovered one commenter by the name of Finn Sasuke, okay, Finn Sasuke, and I was

390
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
like, oh, here we are with like a fucking Naruto fan.

391
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Let's see what this genius has to say.

392
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,500
And his comment was essentially like, yeah, bro, I've been making videos for years and

393
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
yet like, I've got like a couple hundred subs and like, I've gone nowhere, man.

394
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
Like what the fuck.

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,700
And I was just rolling my eyes, so fucking hard at this obvious poser at this obvious

396
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,460
pretender, clearly a Naruto fanboy piece of shit.

397
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,060
And so I'm just like, okay, let's see what you got, my dude.

398
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,700
Let's see what you've been working so hard on for the last millions of years for your

399
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,140
with your 400 subscribers to see like why you haven't succeeded.

400
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:17,820
I click on his channel and all of a sudden the name Finn Sasuke is not actually a reference

401
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,460
to Naruto at all.

402
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:26,820
This guy, I believe he's Finnish and he has a channel full of training videos for the

403
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:32,340
Ninja Warrior competition known as Sasuke in actual Japan.

404
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,860
And as I'm going through this backlog, I'm finding that this man has actually been training

405
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,300
for like a decade to compete on the Japanese Ninja Warrior.

406
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,100
And this is some of the most impressive feats of acrobatics by a human being I've ever seen.

407
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:53,700
He has constructed meticulously the actual set in his backyard that they use in Sasuke

408
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
in Ninja Warrior.

409
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,860
The Japanese one, not the American bullshit one.

410
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,140
He was very, I commented on it and I was like talking to him about this.

411
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,540
And I was just so blown away and I was really sitting back and I was thinking about, you

412
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,620
know, loser assholes like Digi who sit around all day and they watch anime and then they

413
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,180
talk about it on the internet.

414
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,500
Wow, so fucking impressive.

415
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,060
Like sure, he totally deserves the success he's had and the notoriety and whatnot.

416
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,180
Here's a fucking guy who's been training physically out in the dirt, out in the mud, physically

417
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,500
reconstructed this like obstacle course that isn't even, it's like the things that we have

418
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,060
to put this guy's link in the show notes.

419
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,500
It's nuts, the kind of stuff you have to do for this.

420
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
And I was so blown away by like, what have I done of any value compared to what this

421
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,860
guy does every day training on this.

422
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,860
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna disagree with you Nate.

423
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,580
You know, as much as I, as much as I'd love to shit on you and Digi's uttered non-accomplishments

424
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,780
in life, how is what this guy's done any better?

425
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Okay, okay.

426
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,220
He built, he built some shit out of wood and he's really good at like fucking jumping

427
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,340
around on it.

428
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
That's what it amounts to.

429
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,180
I'm aware that a lot of this is personal to me because I, I've been neglecting my physical

430
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,340
training over the last like month or two and I feel terrible about it.

431
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,500
And also, when I, when I was a kid watching Real Ninja Warrior, the Japanese were not

432
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,700
the American one that came later on like G4, they would play Rewinds like over and over.

433
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,860
Ben, you and I would sit down and we'd watch this.

434
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,700
And I always wanted to be like those guys.

435
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,820
And I always felt so bad that I wasn't, and I would, in the, in our basement where we

436
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,820
would watch this on our big old TV, there was an iron beam above like the, like going

437
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
across the roof.

438
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,740
There was like a low hanging ceiling, but like I could do pull-ups on that.

439
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,580
And in Ninja Warrior, they do these things where like you hang on, you don't have like

440
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,340
six inches to hook your whole hand onto like a bar.

441
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,700
You've got like one inch or like two inches to like hook just like the tips of your digits

442
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
on.

443
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Yes.

444
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
So your finger strength has to be insane.

445
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,020
I would practice on that thing with my fingers, just trying to do it.

446
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,300
And I could barely do it for like a second.

447
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,260
So, so all of a sudden, this, this one man, Finn Sasuke has just brought down, he's reminded

448
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:10,100
me of my dreams of my path, of my past, how I want it to be a Sasuke Ninja Warrior, the

449
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,900
way he actually has tried to be.

450
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,380
And while it's absolutely true that like this guy isn't playing the YouTube algorithm

451
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
game, right?

452
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,140
Like it makes sense that his channel isn't like super popular, it's not like topical

453
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
or anything.

454
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,500
It's a passion project.

455
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,540
So on that, you know, what's the appeal?

456
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,060
Like I don't see that going anywhere as a YouTuber, unless you're like really charismatic

457
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,060
and you really like, you know, put a lot of like personality into your videos.

458
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,700
I went to the video just now to try and find the comment you're talking about and I haven't

459
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,460
found him yet, but I have found one comment on, on this video.

460
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,780
And again, this is Digi's video.

461
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,940
I found a comment from someone like a disgruntled Best Guy Ever fan pleading to you on Digi's

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,940
video.

463
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
What?

464
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
Best Guy Ever.

465
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,340
If you're watching this, take note that this is the ultimate proof to not partner up with

466
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Digi Bro IRL.

467
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Oh my God.

468
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,420
A fine friend to keep at a distance through the internet, I'm sure, but completely incompetent

469
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,700
in decision making and finance management.

470
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,300
And he goes on for paragraphs.

471
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
This guy.

472
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,100
Wait, who posted that?

473
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Some Best Guy Ever.

474
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,660
Like someone who was worried about you, Nate.

475
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Worried about...

476
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,700
This guy has association with Digi.

477
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,780
This guy sounds like he's coming from a position where he knows more or he thinks he knows

478
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,500
more than he should.

479
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,140
And what a weird cryptic username.

480
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Dr. Wolf00.

481
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
This is so strange.

482
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
What could it mean?

483
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:36,300
Well, you know, Nate, this thing about this guy, you being all, ooh, cool, he's a really

484
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
good ninja.

485
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
He's so cool.

486
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Reminds me of a conversation that I had.

487
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,380
He's a really good ninja in 2019, so is he really a good anything?

488
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,540
Reminds me of a conversation I had the other day.

489
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
I can't remember.

490
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,740
I came into the PCP Discord and I said, I just had an encounter with a genuine low

491
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,860
IQ male.

492
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Yes.

493
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,900
And I said, Ben, I'm sorry, I won't bother you again.

494
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
Yeah.

495
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
But yeah.

496
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,020
Well, I talked to a literal moron.

497
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Okay.

498
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,100
Now, is this something I should feel bad about, like, you're making fun of an actual retarded

499
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
person?

500
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
No.

501
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
He's not retarded.

502
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
He's got a job.

503
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
He's functional.

504
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Okay.

505
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,100
He's just fucking stupid.

506
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
And it made me mad listening to him.

507
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
As it should.

508
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Listening to his fucking twaddle.

509
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,420
And I don't know, among the many stupid things he said, there was, we were talking about

510
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,980
like a mutual friend of ours who I'll call Martin.

511
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,660
And Martin is a deeply flawed but charismatic human being who we kicked out of our house

512
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,620
because he wouldn't pay his fucking rent.

513
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
Fair.

514
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
Very fair.

515
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Yeah.

516
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,820
So, you know, we've all got our grievances against him, but I still generally like the

517
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
guy.

518
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,580
And fucking, I'll just call him the moron here.

519
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,300
He's just, he's talking about like, oh, Martin, oh, yeah, I fucking hate Martin.

520
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,540
Oh, Martin's fucking, yeah, he's, you know, I don't trust that guy.

521
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
You know, he's terrible.

522
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,620
You know, unlike, unlike his brother, unlike, you know, his brother, his brother's got like

523
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,620
all the, all the, you know, all the good genes went to him.

524
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,300
You know, you might call him the Arnold Schwarzenegger to Martin's, to Martin's Danny

525
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
DeVito.

526
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
Danny DeVito, yeah.

527
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,580
I guess I might as well have said, he's like, yeah, that guy, he biked across the whole

528
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,700
country, whereas like Martin, yeah, but Martin, Martin just stayed here his whole life.

529
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
And I'm listening to this.

530
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,500
And I'm like, he biked across the whole country.

531
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Good for him.

532
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
So fucking what?

533
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
What does that mean?

534
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,980
It like, what, what does that, what does that actually accomplish?

535
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Why, why does that, why does that make him so much of a better person than, than Martin?

536
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,740
I suppose it just speaks to like general determination.

537
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,220
Like it does take a lot of like physical effort to do that.

538
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
You know what that reminds me of?

539
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Sure.

540
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,340
I'm not, I don't think there's no value in it, but I don't think you can be like, this

541
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,060
guy biked across the country.

542
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
This guy didn't.

543
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,180
I mean, this sounds, this Martin guy sounds like he's done nothing.

544
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,260
So anything is superior to nothing.

545
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
I don't know what it means.

546
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,740
There's this gulf of greatness between them.

547
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,620
He has, he has many, Martin has many admirable qualities as most people do.

548
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,860
I agree with you that it's technically a worthless achievement.

549
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,140
But if I had done it, you bet your ass I'd be going around like, hey, none of you fucks

550
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
biked around the country.

551
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,540
I'm the best guy here.

552
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
Everybody look at me.

553
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,540
I would never stop saying that.

554
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,380
I, and I said, I said to this guy, I'm like, well, and I'm like, I don't think that means

555
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
that much.

556
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,460
Like, yeah, it's cool that he did it, but so what?

557
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,860
And he gets almost indignant at me.

558
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,300
He's like, oh, you do it then.

559
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Well, you do it then.

560
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,500
That's, I'm like, do this thing that you just described as worthless and pointless.

561
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Fuck off.

562
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
You idiot.

563
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,020
I want just to go around the country on a bike.

564
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,340
I mean, yeah, it'd be fun.

565
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
I think it'd be nice.

566
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,340
I'd like to go around the country in a car.

567
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,700
I don't think, I don't think it's bad.

568
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I think it's neat.

569
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,060
I think it's pretty cool that he did something like that, but it, but it, it just pissed me

570
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,980
off to be like, yeah, this other guy is such a failure.

571
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,340
Look at, look at this other guy.

572
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,340
He did X.

573
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
That means he's better.

574
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,100
I, I am sympathetic to that and that's a fair point.

575
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,780
My boy Scooby 1961 fitness YouTuber I'm always talking about, he, he like once a year or

576
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,900
so will like a bike across something like Germany or, you know, like all of fucking

577
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,020
the Norse countries or whatever, something like that.

578
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:25,380
And like the kind of man he is, like when you hear that somebody does that, it's like,

579
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,780
they could be one of a couple kinds of person.

580
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,740
He like, there could be like a young buck trying to prove himself.

581
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,860
In his case, he's like a fitness nut who just like loves being outdoors and loves doing

582
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,620
cardio and loves going to like exotic places and seeing the world.

583
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,700
And so like when you hear a story like that, it definitely informs the kind of person that

584
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,860
that is.

585
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,780
And hearing somebody bikes across America, I, I don't know, it's kind of impressive.

586
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,100
It's like when people, yesterday in my, in my stream, people were saying, it's a little

587
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,260
impressive, but not that I'm not that impressed.

588
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
That's true.

589
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,780
I think it, it informs the person more.

590
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,260
It's like yesterday in the stream, some people were saying like something like, why does it

591
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,500
matter if I've had sex or not?

592
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,060
Like what's the big deal guys?

593
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,540
And I'm, and I'm thinking, I think I said like, what the difference is that if you have

594
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,100
lost your virginity, that shows a baseline level of social competence.

595
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,180
You were able to persuade someone to have sex with you.

596
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,460
I've learned something about you from that.

597
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
You're above zero.

598
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,060
And it's, yeah, I get, I get you.

599
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,060
And it's not that like, if you haven't done that, it means you definitely don't have that

600
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
ability.

601
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Exactly.

602
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Yes.

603
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
Of course.

604
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
I feel you.

605
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
I fucking love forests.

606
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Forests are just like best.

607
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Really?

608
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
I'm kind of surprised.

609
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
I can see your passion.

610
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,560
I'm kind of surprised to hear you say that.

611
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,060
You don't seem like the outdoorsy type.

612
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:56,060
I, I see, yeah, I stay at home, but I just, I just want to, I want to go to a forest.

613
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Yeah.

614
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Yeah.

615
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,060
Yeah.

616
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
I think we could all get down.

617
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,060
It just like peeks out her window at the forest outside.

618
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,060
It's like some day before you retreat.

619
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Who is on the edge of the forest?

620
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,060
There's only a stupid river I hate.

621
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Is it the river of tans or something?

622
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,060
He just like looks at the distant forest and just gives a little thumbs up.

623
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Yeah.

624
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
Yeah.

625
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,060
I'm more into the, I'm more, I'm more all about the urban jungle myself.

626
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Yeah.

627
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Yeah.

628
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
I'm all about that hardcore parkour.

629
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
I am serious.

630
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Yeah.

631
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Fitness is cool and all, but I'm, I'm a bit more into forests.

632
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
That's my whole thing.

633
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
I'm so fucking tired.

634
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm crying.

635
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Time to sleep in the earth forever in the forest, I guess, and be one with your, with your people.

636
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
Exactly.

637
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Like one of my dreams is like, when I die, or if I die.

638
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
If I die, okay.

639
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,060
I like, I like your optimism.

640
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
You too.

641
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
If I die.

642
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:09,060
To be like, like, I saw like people like, when they get burned into ash, you put them like into like this little pot and you like, you put a seed in it and they grow into a tree.

643
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,060
I'd like to be a tree one day.

644
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,060
Oh, Fluttershy.

645
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Yeah.

646
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
There it is.

647
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
There it is.

648
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
I agree.

649
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
That's how Fluttershy will become a tree.

650
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
She will die.

651
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
I want to be a cool tree.

652
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,060
I'd want to be like a pomegranate tree.

653
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
I want to be a weeping willow because they're the most keynote trees.

654
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,060
I want to be, I want to, I want to be an oak and make everyone miserable.

655
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
With fucking acorns and shit.

656
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Yeah, exactly.

657
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Like I have a, I have a oak tree back in the Fanny and our, it's kind of not our yard, but our, on our property sort of like my grandfather put like, put the tree in the, in the ground.

658
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
I want to be a hanging tree.

659
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
I put backwards.

660
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
Like the one that they hang people in.

661
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
The tree that people are hung from.

662
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Yeah.

663
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Yeah, okay.

664
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:59,060
I like to believe that in my next life, I can, I can contribute to the death of some people at least.

665
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Yeah.

666
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
You want your, you want your kill count to keep going up.

667
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Even after you've logged out.

668
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:13,060
How do you call those trees that have like, like branches that are just like going down and up like to the ground and they're like, they look like, like water, but like trees.

669
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
That sounds like a weeping willow.

670
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,060
Is it a weeping willow?

671
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Hold on.

672
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
Google it.

673
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
Probably.

674
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:26,060
No, speaking about oak trees, total left turn here, but I just watched the movie Antichrist with Willem Dafoe the other day.

675
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Is that oak trees?

676
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah.

677
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
Is that, is that a, who's the director?

678
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Gus, no.

679
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
Say that again?

680
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,060
I can't fucking, it's not Gus Van Sand, is it?

681
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
It's Antichrist by Lars von Trier.

682
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,060
Lars von Trier, that's the one.

683
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Yeah.

684
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,060
Okay.

685
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Yes.

686
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:48,060
And oak trees play a surprisingly large role in the film as the, the sound of when they're in a cabin in the woods and oak acorns are raining down.

687
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,060
And causing a lot of stress and tension all night long as they try to sleep.

688
00:29:54,060 --> 00:30:02,060
I guess I won't get into it other than to say it was dope and I recommend it and I want to see spoilers because they're shocking and hilarious, but I won't.

689
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,060
I love, I love, I love weeping willows.

690
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Like they make, they make like a secret hideout.

691
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
That's true.

692
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,060
I always wanted to have a sleeping willow hideout when I was a kid.

693
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I drive by one every day.

694
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Make a secret hideout.

695
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,060
Bring a cardboard box.

696
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,060
I realize that Tigger from Winnie the Pooh, he doesn't have a house.

697
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
He just sleeps in trees.

698
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Hang on.

699
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
That's not true.

700
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
I heard you say that in your, in your episode.

701
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:40,060
There, wasn't there a thing where like Tigger, Tigger's house is like a weird ragamuffin thing with like, I remember him like sleeping in a sock drawer.

702
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Wasn't that like a thing that Tigger did?

703
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,060
You're thinking, I'm pretty sure you're thinking of Jake from Adventure Time.

704
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,060
No, I'm not.

705
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
Uh, I don't know.

706
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
There was one episode where he was sleeping in Rue's bed.

707
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
Well, that's me.

708
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,060
He lives in a tree house.

709
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:01,060
You just type in Tigger's house and Google images and you can literally, it just, it took me two seconds, guys.

710
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,060
Hmm.

711
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,060
Well, Ben's been like just watching the show, so I assume not doing it.

712
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Yeah, I may, I might have been wrong.

713
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Okay, well, I know in the old shorts, you see him just sleeping in a tree at some point.

714
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
I guess he might still have a house.

715
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Let's see, Tigger's.

716
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,060
I think that either got updated or like they like gave him a house later or something.

717
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Oh yeah.

718
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Huh.

719
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Yeah, he's got, he's got like a moat and a tire swing.

720
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,060
Yeah, it's like a fucked up weird house.

721
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,060
Who says, who says the Tigger doesn't have any stuff?

722
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,060
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,060
Maybe because his house is so fucked, he, you know, it's weird.

724
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,060
Oh, you know what?

725
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:39,060
In the episode where they crown him king of the beasties, you see the sign, you see this house.

726
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,060
I just didn't put two and two together that it was his house.

727
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Oh yeah.

728
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
There you go.

729
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Why doesn't everyone have a house in a tree?

730
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Everyone else's house sucks.

731
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Only owls and Tiggers are good.

732
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:55,060
Poo and poo and pill it and rabbit just living fucking holes in the ground.

733
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,060
Man, I want to spoil Antichrist so bad.

734
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Just spoil it.

735
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060
Nobody's going to watch Antichrist.

736
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
I'm just going to tell you the opening.

737
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,060
It is shocking and I actually hate when people spoil even the beginning of movies for me,

738
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
but I'm going to tell you anyway.

739
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,060
So if you don't want to hear it, log out for the next 10 seconds.

740
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,060
Willem Dafoe is fucking his wife in slow motion.

741
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
You see cock in pussy in this video.

742
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
Whoa.

743
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,060
You see it and as they're fucking, their baby gets up out of the crib, walks up to the window

744
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,060
and falls out the window and dies while they're fucking.

745
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,060
Nice.

746
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,060
It was a very dope opening.

747
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,060
That's also the plot of an Eric Clapton song.

748
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Free falling.

749
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Oh wait, that's not.

750
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
Not to get back on a happier note.

751
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:44,060
Hey, if I ever go to a Radcon, can we have like an outing to a forest?

752
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Like a campfire and stuff.

753
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
You know, interestingly made.

754
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,060
So you're at Radcon Forest?

755
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
Oh yes, I know.

756
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
Damn.

757
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:02,060
Actually, at Radcon 3, as we were scoping out the location, we did note there was like

758
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,060
a swampy area and forest not far from the house.

759
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,060
It was on like the end of the street or whatever.

760
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,060
And we considered like taking cameras out there to like go do stuff.

761
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Nothing came of it.

762
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
But it was all snowy shit at the time.

763
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Yeah.

764
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,060
There was like a whole forest area right behind the house.

765
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Good place to hide the bodies.

766
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,060
You know guys, I was thinking about this the other day.

767
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,060
Radcon 3 was dope and it was a great experience.

768
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,060
And I'm super proud that we did it and raised the money to fund it and whatnot.

769
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:33,060
But I have noticed that my YouTube channel was doing great until I started working on

770
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
preparing Radcon 3.

771
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
We were talking about this.

772
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
And I have not been back on the rail since.

773
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
I have, yeah.

774
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:44,060
I don't know if it was because of Radcon 3, but like sometime after, I'm still working

775
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,060
on stuff, like still working on, I mean I'm pretty much done with my part of T-Bat, but

776
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I'm still working on 10 paces and draw.

777
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,060
That's getting pretty close to done too, but like I've got some more to do.

778
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,060
And yeah, my comics have come out much more sporadically since then.

779
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
And it's a real shame.

780
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,060
And I don't want to blame Radcon 3.

781
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
I blame myself, obviously.

782
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:08,060
Radcon 3 in 2018 was a lesson in prioritization for me.

783
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
And it was a good lesson.

784
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
And I'm glad I learned it.

785
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
And now I know.

786
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,060
We committed to so many fucking projects on that.

787
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,060
Finishing these Radcon 3 projects is like paying off student loans.

788
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
It is like paying off student loans.

789
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Like here I am like a year later and like I'm still like, I'm just bare like, ooh, okay,

790
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,060
10 paces and draw, almost done, almost done.

791
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Thank God.

792
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,060
Boy, Sharer is going to be sweet when I got that ball and chain off my ankle.

793
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,060
That's why at Radcon 4, I'm coming in, I'm cashing in for another lecture.

794
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
And that's all I'm fucking committing to.

795
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
Yeah.

796
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
It's going to be great.

797
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,060
I'm going to be like two lectures at the next one.

798
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
That's a good idea.

799
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,060
Maybe like one big one and two many ones.

800
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
It is amazing.

801
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
I'm just going to start my Animorphs lecture.

802
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,060
It's going to be fucking lit.

803
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,060
Oh, I'm excited for that.

804
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,060
Are you re-reading the books?

805
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,060
Or are you just cliffing?

806
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,060
I mean, I read them all again like last year, but I might do it again.

807
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
Are you fucking kidding me?

808
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,060
God, why?

809
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,060
Animorphs.

810
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,060
Because it's fucking good.

811
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,060
But is there like a hundred volumes or something?

812
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,060
There's like 80 something, but they're super short.

813
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,060
They're like fucking children's books.

814
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
It's fine.

815
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,060
They're printed in very large stuff.

816
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Yeah.

817
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
Fair enough.

818
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,060
You can knock one book out in like an hour and a half.

819
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Oh, okay.

820
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
That's not as bad.

821
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
I'm reading.

822
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,060
So I'm reading Ula-Liliya's newer book, Secret in the Basement.

823
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
And...

824
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,060
Sounds like my sex life.

825
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Go on.

826
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,060
High five.

827
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,060
Yes.

828
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Yeah.

829
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,060
It is about, well, I don't know.

830
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:48,060
I'm only on act like four out of like 20 or something.

831
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,060
It's in many ways very similar to...

832
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
In fact, I'm actually glad.

833
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,060
I'm actually happy with how similar it is to Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.

834
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,060
It's about like a normal kid becoming super strong through RPG shit.

835
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
Cool.

836
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,060
Instead of about just like an alien who's already like the ultimate fucking champion of magic.

837
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Well, that story is fascinating.

838
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,060
Like it's kind of boring in terms of like, you know, the guy's just God mode from the

839
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,060
start.

840
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
I mean Knuckles, yeah.

841
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,060
Knuckles is never in any danger.

842
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Although, to be honest, this kid's never in any danger either because right from the

843
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,660
beginning he's got this wizard named Tristan who is just, he's just like, yeah, go on out

844
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,060
there and fight some monsters and gain experience and if you ever die, I'll just resurrect you.

845
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Oh.

846
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
So, you know.

847
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
That's a shame.

848
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
Good to know.

849
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,060
I'm hoping maybe he'll subvert.

850
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,060
I'm hoping maybe at some point Tristan will get taken out of commission.

851
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,060
But, you know, knowing...

852
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,060
It would be good to ratchet up the tension for sure.

853
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,060
It would and that's why I don't think it's going to happen.

854
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
But I'll let you know.

855
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Yeah, please do.

856
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Please do.

857
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Maybe he's going for the actual video game feel of when you're playing a video game, you

858
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
know you can always just retry.

859
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
So maybe it's...

860
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
I think he is going for that, yeah.

861
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Yeah.

862
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,060
But like, yeah, what would make it an actual story is if at one point Tristan is gone and

863
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,060
there's like, you know, like, like in fucking, you won't, what is it?

864
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Yeah.

865
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,060
When, you know, eventually Tom Cruise loses the power and then he's like, oh shit, now

866
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,060
I can't fuck up or I'll actually die.

867
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Suddenly the stakes are super high.

868
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,060
Like that.

869
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,060
That would be a good, you know, bit that I'm confident isn't coming.

870
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,060
But isn't it just a fascinating choice though that he would like deliberately diffuse tension

871
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
just to make that kind of...

872
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Yeah, I do.

873
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
I think you're right.

874
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,060
I think it's about, I think it's about making it feel like a video game.

875
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Like you can die and you just respawn.

876
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
Yeah.

877
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
Yeah.

878
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,060
You know, this time he's going through, Tristan is like the shopkeeper, so he's got to like

879
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,060
buy, he's got to like buy items.

880
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,060
You know, he's got to like, he's got to trade in his old shitty copper fucking helm for

881
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:08,060
like a platinum helm, you know, because it gives him some sweet MP boosts or whatever.

882
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,060
That's the kind of, that's the kind of story it is.

883
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,060
Funny, I don't know, funny detail.

884
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,060
So the way that he accesses the magical world where he fights monsters and gains experience,

885
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,060
this kid's name is Richard, is there's a place in his basement and sometimes he'll dream of

886
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:32,060
the place and when he dreams, sometimes there will be a barber pole up on the wall in the corner.

887
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,060
And then at some point he meets, this wizard shows up to him in a dream, Tristan, and he's

888
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
just, he's just a fucking Dumbledore wizard.

889
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:45,060
He's got like a robe and like a conical cap with its lavender with gold stars and moons on it.

890
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,060
It says, you know, and it says he's got long, like 30 inch long brown hair, then some of it is like

891
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
collected in braids.

892
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:58,060
And he's like, hey, Tristan, so cool that you're a wizard and you brought me here to become an

893
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
adventurer and all.

894
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Why a barber pole?

895
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,060
And Tristan's just like, I just really like hair and hairstyles.

896
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
And that's why.

897
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,060
That's why, I guess it could be anything, fair enough.

898
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
I just really like it.

899
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,060
I just think Barbary is a really cool profession.

900
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:23,060
That's how I feel playing Kingdom Hearts 3, like the people who make this game just really like hair and hairstyles.

901
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,060
Yeah, yeah, just like Tristan.

902
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,060
Tristan loves hair and hairstyle.

903
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:34,060
My name is Tristan the wizard and I sell hair and hairstyles.

904
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,060
One hairstyle, please.

905
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,060
One hairstyle, please.

906
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,060
It's like you buy like the hairstyle template so that you can just switch between hairstyles at any given moment.

907
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
Oh, that sounds like cable.

908
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Yeah, yeah.

909
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
I love cable.

910
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:58,060
The kid in secret in the basement.

911
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,060
So, you know, in Legend of the Talonel Masters, there was Knuckles and Knuckles was all about magic.

912
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,060
He had really good magic stats.

913
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,060
But he had a friend who was even stronger named Speed.

914
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:13,060
And Speed was all about physical stats, in particular, obviously Speed.

915
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:21,060
Speed was like his speed and evasion were so high that it was like statistically impossible that anything could ever hit him.

916
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,060
And then this guy, this kid in Richard, he's all about defense.

917
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,060
Defense is like his top stat right from the get go.

918
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,060
So I think he's building like a tank build.

919
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:38,060
You have a good balance party there. You got like a DPS guy, you got a magic guy, and you got a tank.

920
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
I think so.

921
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,060
They could roll well together.

922
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,060
I don't think he gets to like Knuckles' levels by the end.

923
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,060
Like Knuckles is over level 9000 and so is Speed.

924
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,060
I think Speed might be over 10,000.

925
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,060
But I think, I don't know how high he gets, but he doesn't get that high.

926
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Are they in the same universe?

927
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
They must be.

928
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Because, well, I don't know.

929
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Their RPG mechanics are basically identical, so I want to say yes.

930
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:09,060
I don't know, it could be Final Fantasy I, Final Fantasy II logic where everything looks the same and seems the same, but it's a different world.

931
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
Yeah, it could.

932
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,060
There's no hard confirmation as far as I know.

933
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,060
So there's a different fictional character named Knuckles that's not the enchilada.

934
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Enchilada?

935
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,060
No, we're not talking about Knuckles the enchilada.

936
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,060
Knuckles the space wizard is from a planet called Corona.

937
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
He is two feet tall.

938
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Corona, you say?

939
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,060
Corona, yeah.

940
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:46,060
He's two feet tall, humanoid, covered in purple fur, and his hands are slightly bigger proportionally to his body than you might expect.

941
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,060
Okay, so likely.

942
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,060
It's like a 1% increase.

943
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
It's like 30% increase.

944
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:58,060
If he were a human, you might say, huh, his hands kind of big, but he's tiny.

945
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
But he's two feet tall.

946
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,060
So his hands are tiny too.

947
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,060
Like maybe they're bigger compared to speeds, but not that much.

948
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
What about speed? What speed look like?

949
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Exact same only, he's green and his hands aren't that big.

950
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,060
Well, there it is, I guess.

951
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,060
Speed has a special attack called the speed busher.

952
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Which is he punches something so hard that it flies so fast that it immediately lights on fire and becomes a fireball that like crashes into whatever he punches to that.

953
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Okay, that's pretty cool.

954
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,060
It's pretty cool.

955
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Also, at the end of Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters, they walk up to the final dungeon and speed is just like, okay, I've been through the entire dungeon and disarmed all the traps, let's go.

956
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,060
It's left to be done at that point.

957
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,060
I don't know.

958
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:58,060
Literally the entire Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters is Knuckles waiting until the source of the future event that he senses.

959
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:05,060
Because he senses a future event, but he's never seen an event of this particular kind before, so he doesn't know what it is.

960
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,060
So literally the entire book is just killing time until it happens.

961
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,060
So Knuckles can be like, oh, so that's what it was.

962
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,060
And then Knuckles can solve it.

963
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,060
You know what's a game just like that?

964
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,060
You know, I think my Kingdom Hearts 3 video will be out by the time that this comes out.

965
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:26,060
So let me just tell you a fascinating story about Kingdom Hearts 3 that anyone who played the game should know.

966
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,060
It's that at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts 3, right, you're on a quest to uncover, quote, the power of waking.

967
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,060
You don't know what that's going to do, but you know what's important.

968
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,060
You're going to need it.

969
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:41,060
So what Sora does is he holds up his Keyblade and says, Keyblade, literally take me where I need to go.

970
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,060
I don't know. Please plot guide me.

971
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,060
And it opens a portal.

972
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:52,060
He goes through it, and it leads him to Olympus Colosseum, where in fact, he does not find the power of waking.

973
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,060
And from there, proceed to every single Disney world in the game.

974
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,060
Okay.

975
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,060
Just because it's where the Keyblade takes him next?

976
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,060
Well, it only takes him to that first place after that he wanders on his own.

977
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,060
But the portal took him to Olympus Colosseum.

978
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,060
He did not discover the problem there, or the power there.

979
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,060
After you've beaten every Disney world, there is a cutscene.

980
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:18,060
Sora says, huh, we've sure looked around a lot, pulls out Keyblade, Keyblade, where should I go now?

981
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
What should I do?

982
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:22,060
I've made no progress on this power of waking thing.

983
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:27,060
The Keyblade opens a portal, takes him to exactly where he needs to go to find the power of waking.

984
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,060
Well, he didn't have the levels and experience points.

985
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
He didn't have enough elixirs.

986
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,060
I mean, I suppose that's what we're supposed to infer.

987
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,060
He had the levels of elixirs.

988
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,060
He had to level up Kiraga.

989
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
I'm doing this in the video.

990
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,060
I'm going to just splice.

991
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:49,060
If you just cut every event of the game between entering that first portal and coming out that second portal,

992
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,060
if it just was that portal, nothing would be lost.

993
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,060
It just hasn't taken to the second place first.

994
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,060
Yeah, just do that, and nothing would be lost.

995
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,060
Because, okay, here's the thing that's infuriating.

996
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,060
The real power of waking is the friends we made along the way.

997
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,060
It's a real power, though.

998
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,060
It doesn't matter.

999
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,060
But the other thing is that Riku and Miki are trying to find Aqua,

1000
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,060
who's going to help them, whatever she's important,

1001
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,060
and she's trapped in the Land of Darkness.

1002
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,060
They go to the Land of Darkness, they fuck around, and they fail, and then they leave.

1003
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,060
They just come back again later.

1004
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,060
Nothing has changed, only they've got new Keyblades,

1005
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,060
because the first one's broke, means nothing to the plot,

1006
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,060
and it's at that point that Sora shows up.

1007
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:31,060
So, like, Riku and Miki were there doing the thing

1008
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,060
that you come back later to find them doing.

1009
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,060
My point is, literally nothing mattered.

1010
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,060
None of those events made a difference.

1011
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,060
Literally nothing.

1012
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,060
And this is Kingdom Hearts 2 you're talking about.

1013
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,060
This is Kingdom Hearts 3.

1014
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,060
This is the new game.

1015
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,060
Oh, okay.

1016
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,060
Kingdom Hearts 2 has way more important stuff happen in the meantime.

1017
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,060
You know what's weird about Kingdom Hearts, the whole conceit of the series?

1018
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,060
Yeah.

1019
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:57,060
Is that all these Disney worlds, they sort of retell the story of the Disney movies.

1020
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,060
But, like, it exists in this weird continuity where, like,

1021
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,060
from the perspective of these characters, they look back and think,

1022
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,060
hey, remember that time where those three guys showed up,

1023
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:14,060
and one of them was like a dog man, and the other was a duck,

1024
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,060
and they just, like, solved all my problems for me?

1025
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,060
And then they disappeared, and I never fucking saw them again.

1026
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,060
What the hell was that?

1027
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,060
It was like a whole universe full of people who just at some point in their lives,

1028
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:31,060
some guys showed up, and it was the catalyst for their whole life changing,

1029
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,060
and then they were never seen again.

1030
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,060
That's how it works in all the games.

1031
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:40,060
It's a weird place, but yeah, that's pretty much where Kingdom Hearts resides.

1032
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,060
And you know what else I noticed?

1033
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,060
I don't fucking know.

1034
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,060
It seems like, so far in Kingdom Hearts 3, I'm not that far,

1035
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:54,060
but it seems like in the story, nobody ever knows what's going on except for Goofy.

1036
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,060
Like, Goofy is the smartest person in the fucking universe in this game.

1037
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,060
How do you figure?

1038
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,060
Every single conversation in the game is like,

1039
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:07,060
Sora is like, oh gosh, I don't know what to do with the darkness

1040
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,060
and the Keyblade heart over in the heart, nobody's heart,

1041
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,060
and I don't know how to dark the heart with the nobody's,

1042
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,060
and then like, and then Donald is like,

1043
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,060
and then, you know, like, and nobody shows up,

1044
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,060
and he's like, you'll never figure out how to fucking nobody the heart dark with the dark heart,

1045
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,060
and then like, no one knows what's going on,

1046
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,060
and then all of a sudden, like, Goofy will chime in,

1047
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:33,060
and it's like, wait a minute, maybe we gotta heart the dark heart with the heart dark,

1048
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,060
and then everyone is like, holy shit, Goofy, you figured it out.

1049
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,060
He's like the only character who knows anything.

1050
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,060
He solves every problem.

1051
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,060
That's basically true, Jesse, but you know why?

1052
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,060
It's because Goofy, Goofy like fits the logic of Kingdom Hearts perfectly

1053
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:53,060
as basically the like, leads with his emotions, idiot, savant,

1054
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,060
that just like, like, because every solution to every problem is

1055
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:01,060
just believe in your heart and trust that you will, your friendship will win.

1056
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,060
That's just because Goofy is the only one who's fucked,

1057
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,060
so clearly he's just on a different level than everybody else.

1058
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,060
Donald fucks, Donald fucks.

1059
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,060
Donald totally fucks, get out of here.

1060
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,060
Also, sorry, I had to go and shit some more water, but I'm back now.

1061
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,060
Oh, that's cool, all right.

1062
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,060
I might have to go again soon.

1063
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,060
How exciting.

1064
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,060
Yeah.

1065
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,060
Well, all right, that's enough Kingdom Hearts bullshit.

1066
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,060
We've been talking about this shit for weeks now.

1067
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,060
For like weeks, for weeks and weeks now.

1068
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,060
Oh, since we're switching topics, and I was just, didn't you want to say something?

1069
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:36,060
Oh, right, I had a topic this week, and it was actually important.

1070
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,060
So, we were talking earlier about like, doing a charity thing,

1071
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,060
like maybe a stream or maybe bringing something up on the podcast,

1072
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,060
and no, I had something in mind that I wanted to bring up on the podcast,

1073
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,060
because, you know, I mentioned that.

1074
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,060
You mentioned that.

1075
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,060
Did we actually discuss that?

1076
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,060
Well, only a little bit, but it's not what you think.

1077
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,060
There's a specific thing.

1078
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,060
Yeah, well, like, you know, the thing about charities is that they're all scams, obviously.

1079
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,060
Yep.

1080
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,060
So, it's probably better to go with a GoFundMe,

1081
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
like to help one specific person who needs money,

1082
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,060
and I actually have a GoFundMe.

1083
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,060
It's not something for me.

1084
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,060
It's not my thing, but it's someone close to a friend of mine,

1085
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,060
not a person I've met, but an uncle of my friend called Ivan Ayala,

1086
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,060
and I'm going to link this here.

1087
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,060
It's called Angels for Ivan, and this is a GoFundMe that I want to fucking,

1088
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,060
that I just want to shove in everyone's face right now,

1089
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,060
since I have this platform.

1090
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,060
Angels for Ivan is a GoFundMe.

1091
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,060
This dude, my friend's uncle, my good friend,

1092
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,060
his uncle, a member of his immediate family, was in a horrific explosion!

1093
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,060
It's, uh, I'm assuming a workplace explosion.

1094
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,060
This is not a joke.

1095
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,060
This is real.

1096
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,060
This is 100% legit.

1097
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,060
Yeah, and I thought my job sucked.

1098
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,060
Yeah.

1099
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,060
I'll just read what it says here.

1100
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,060
In a horrific explosion in January of 2018,

1101
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,060
life changed dramatically for one loving and happy family.

1102
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,060
Ivan Ayala suffered third-degree burns on 60% of his body.

1103
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,060
He spent seven and a half months fighting for his life

1104
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,060
in the intensive care burn unit,

1105
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,060
and his wife took a leave of absence from work

1106
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,060
so that she could be at his side day and night

1107
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,060
through 27 reconstructive surgeries, skin grafts,

1108
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,060
and subsequent blindness in one eye,

1109
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,060
limited vision in the other,

1110
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,060
and the amputation of his right leg above the knee.

1111
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,060
Please consider becoming an angel for Ivan,

1112
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
and for his wife and two daughters

1113
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,060
as he continues his long road to recovery.

1114
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,060
Please read below for the whole story.

1115
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,060
And they got pictures here, and, like,

1116
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,060
if you're, like, squeamish,

1117
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,060
you know, be warned, because he got fucked up.

1118
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,060
They're straight fucked, yeah.

1119
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,060
I mean, it's brutal.

1120
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,060
Oh, I expanded.

1121
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,060
It's brutal.

1122
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,060
Yeah, he lost, like, his whole body,

1123
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,060
his whole skin, his face.

1124
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,060
He lost a leg.

1125
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,060
In the second picture, is this him,

1126
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,060
unlike, like, the far left with, like,

1127
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,060
the white rose in front of him?

1128
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,060
Uh, yeah.

1129
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,060
Yeah, that's just...

1130
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,060
Yeah, I think that was him pre-explosion, yeah.

1131
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,060
Oh, my God.

1132
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,060
Yep.

1133
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,060
Yep.

1134
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,060
So, he's a terrible explosion.

1135
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,060
And so, of course, yeah, medical bills.

1136
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,060
He's now, in addition to losing, like,

1137
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,060
both of his eyes and his legs,

1138
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,060
or one leg and most of his skin,

1139
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,060
he's, you know, probably also going to lose a house,

1140
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,060
because that's how it works in this country.

1141
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,060
Who?

1142
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,060
Being in an explosion costs money.

1143
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,060
Yep.

1144
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,060
So, they're asking for $25,000.

1145
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,060
That's their goal.

1146
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,060
And it's already gotten to $7,695, as of now.

1147
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,060
I've already donated.

1148
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,060
You know, I donate again if I come across enough money, too.

1149
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,060
But, you know, so I'm just throwing it out there.

1150
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,060
Yeah.

1151
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,060
On my platform that I have.

1152
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,060
Everyone, if you want to be an angel,

1153
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,060
if you want to be a literal angel,

1154
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,060
an angel for Ivan,

1155
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,060
if you don't like yourself,

1156
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,060
if you think you're a bad person,

1157
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
let's be honest, you probably are,

1158
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,060
the way to absolve yourself

1159
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,060
of everything bad you've ever done in your life,

1160
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,060
all those sad feelings and regrets,

1161
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,060
just give, just give, just give to charity,

1162
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,060
and it washes away the sins of the past.

1163
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,060
Yeah.

1164
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,060
If you've done something bad recently,

1165
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,060
just give money to a man who needs it

1166
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,060
and his family who needs it.

1167
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,060
He sure does need it.

1168
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,060
Holy shit.

1169
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,060
This is, this is way,

1170
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,060
I glanced at the lake before,

1171
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,060
but I'm looking at the pictures now.

1172
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,060
I mean, all right, it looks like,

1173
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,060
I'm looking at this last picture here.

1174
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,060
Yeah.

1175
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,060
He looks, I mean, he looks like,

1176
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,060
you know, he can still like live, right?

1177
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,060
He's not like...

1178
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,060
He's alive.

1179
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,060
He's home.

1180
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,060
Yeah.

1181
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,060
He's alive.

1182
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,060
But he, yeah.

1183
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,060
He's going to lose his house, you say?

1184
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,060
Is that the deal?

1185
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,060
Because he can't work because he got so fucked up?

1186
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,060
It says something in here about,

1187
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,060
in order to keep our house and keep our family from

1188
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,060
being on the street or something.

1189
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,060
So fucked.

1190
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,060
Like, is a man going from, you know,

1191
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,060
fully functional to completely unable to work,

1192
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
it's hard for me to think that that's only a loss

1193
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,060
of $25,000, that it's not, you know.

1194
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,060
Now that the family is fully reunited in their home,

1195
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,060
Ivan continues to struggle with the healing of his skin,

1196
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
adapting to daily activities without his right leg,

1197
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,060
and most of all, the loss of his vision.

1198
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,060
All he wants to do is to, again,

1199
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,060
provide for his family as he loved taking care of them.

1200
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,060
He is trying to maintain a positive outlook and look

1201
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,060
to the future with his wife, daughters, family and friends,

1202
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,060
but it is a long and hard road ahead.

1203
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,060
He is yet to receive any amount of financial compensation

1204
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,060
or any income since his accident,

1205
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,060
and the family is doing its best to pay the bills,

1206
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,060
now including expensive medication co-pays

1207
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,060
so that they can keep their home and provide Ivan

1208
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,060
with what he needs to continue to heal and recover.

1209
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,060
Man, there's no workers come for that shit

1210
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,060
if you're caught in an explosion at your job.

1211
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,060
Holy fuck.

1212
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,060
I don't see anything about, like,

1213
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,060
what the circumstances of the explosion were.

1214
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,060
No.

1215
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,060
I'm assuming it was a workplace thing

1216
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,060
because of that line about it.

1217
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,060
Yeah.

1218
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,060
I mean, I would think so.

1219
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,060
Yeah.

1220
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,060
Maybe not, maybe not.

1221
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,060
I mean, they don't specify where it happened,

1222
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,060
but still.

1223
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,060
Yeah, that's Ivan Ayala.

1224
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,060
I've never met him personally,

1225
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,060
but he's the uncle of one of my best friends in the world,

1226
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,060
my buddy Juan.

1227
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,060
If you've ever seen the old video of mine

1228
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,060
on the Blue Glow channel,

1229
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,060
Juan's PS4,

1230
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,060
where I borrowed his PS4 for a couple days

1231
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,060
and played Call of Duty

1232
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,060
and pointed my phone camera at the screen,

1233
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:54,060
this is a relative of the eponymous Juan,

1234
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,060
so he would certainly appreciate it

1235
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,060
and I would certainly appreciate it,

1236
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,060
and it would be a nice thing to do.

1237
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,060
So there you go.

1238
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,060
There's my topic for the day.

1239
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,060
Oh, man, I see you donated a hundred bucks.

1240
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,060
Yeah, sure did.

1241
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,060
Oh, that's very generous, Mage.

1242
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,060
Yeah.

1243
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,060
See, be like Mage.

1244
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,060
No, no, no.

1245
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,060
Oh, Jesse did.

1246
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,060
Oh, Jesse did.

1247
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,060
Oh, okay.

1248
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,060
Never mind.

1249
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,060
Mage, you're a greedy fuck.

1250
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,060
I donated, but it doesn't show up.

1251
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,060
I'm not sure.

1252
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,060
Well, it'll probably show up later or something.

1253
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,060
Yeah, it's given some time or something.

1254
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,060
Well, best wishes, man.

1255
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,060
I hope everybody ships in what they can.

1256
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,060
I'm glad I finally remembered to say that on the podcast

1257
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,060
because I've been meaning to.

1258
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,060
Oh, there it is.

1259
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,060
There you go.

1260
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,060
There it is.

1261
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,060
$30 from Mage Aurora.

1262
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
Hey, there you go.

1263
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,060
Awesome, thank you, Mage.

1264
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,060
Moving on.

1265
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,060
What else is going on, squad?

1266
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:52,060
You know, speaking of terrible things,

1267
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,060
speaking of bad things in this world,

1268
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:01,060
the Pizza Party podcast just has me so fucking mad all the time.

1269
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,060
What a disaster.

1270
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,060
You know, I've got something special for you, Ben,

1271
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,060
if we're going to talk about the Pizza Party podcast.

1272
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,060
Are we doing the segment?

1273
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,060
Are we starting the segment?

1274
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,060
Let's just jump right into it.

1275
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,060
Why the fuck not?

1276
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,060
Let me get this right here.

1277
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,060
OK, listen up, everybody.

1278
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,060
We've got an updated Pizza Party podcast

1279
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,060
shooting on segment song.

1280
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,060
Everybody, sing along if you know the words.

1281
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
Here we go.

1282
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,060
OK, here's a little remix for you guys.

1283
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:35,060
Benzé is gay.

1284
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,060
Hey.

1285
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:45,060
And he likes to suck dick, especially mine.

1286
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,060
Wait.

1287
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:51,060
As you know, calling each other gay is the mean way to say,

1288
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,060
I love you.

1289
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,060
But fuck the Pizza Party podcast.

1290
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,060
There you go.

1291
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,060
There it is.

1292
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,060
All right.

1293
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,060
All right.

1294
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,060
I'll take it.

1295
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,060
We had a message about that.

1296
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,060
We got some grievances.

1297
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,060
You want me to play that?

1298
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,060
No, no.

1299
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,060
I want to hear.

1300
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,060
I want to hear.

1301
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,060
This guy Cheesy Manfredo said it better than I could.

1302
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,060
Yeah, OK.

1303
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,060
I believe I've got that queued up right here.

1304
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,060
Let's get into it.

1305
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
The problem with the PPP.

1306
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,060
Go.

1307
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,060
Ben, what are these weak ass complaints

1308
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,060
against the Pizza Party podcast?

1309
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,060
Let me air out the real grievances.

1310
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,060
The Pizza Party podcast has been in a steady decline in quality

1311
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,060
for the past couple of years.

1312
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,060
And this is all due to the fundamental fact

1313
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,060
that the Pizza Party podcast is not incentivized to be better.

1314
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,060
Say what you will about the PCP,

1315
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,060
but at least they try to improve.

1316
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,060
The PCP restructured their whole fucking podcast

1317
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,060
because they knew they were fucking up.

1318
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,060
Damn right.

1319
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,060
There's a financial stake in the PCP,

1320
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,060
which is one of the main reasons why you all want to be on your best.

1321
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,060
The Pizza Party podcast has no financial stake.

1322
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,060
It only exists as filler between PanPizza videos

1323
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,060
on the Rebel Taxi channel,

1324
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,060
which Pan has made very clear since episode one of the podcast.

1325
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,060
And that was great at first because we had a very loose,

1326
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,060
a very entertaining podcast,

1327
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,060
but now all the jokes and all the bits

1328
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,060
and all the fucking talking points

1329
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,060
have been run to the fucking ground.

1330
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,060
The Pizza Party podcast is a zombie of a podcast

1331
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,060
that only exists to take up space.

1332
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,060
And you know what's even worse?

1333
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,060
They won't listen to this

1334
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,060
because they're on that bullshit mentality of,

1335
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,060
oh, well, this podcast has always been shit.

1336
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,060
If you don't like it, then don't watch it.

1337
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,060
Fuck off.

1338
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,060
Make a better podcast.

1339
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,060
If your podcast is shit, make a better podcast.

1340
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,060
Pizza Party got me fucked up.

1341
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,060
All right.

1342
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,060
There you go.

1343
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,060
That's what I've been saying this whole time.

1344
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,060
Right.

1345
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,060
Interesting that he cites like the financial incentives

1346
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,060
at play in the PCP

1347
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,060
as like a beneficial aspect,

1348
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,060
which I certainly would agree with.

1349
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,060
So I wonder if the cost structure,

1350
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,060
the payment structure of the Pizza Party podcast,

1351
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,060
obviously it's on PanPizza's channel.

1352
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,060
Maybe they just don't even get paid for it.

1353
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,060
Yeah, but well, I mean,

1354
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,060
maybe he doesn't put ads on the videos

1355
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,060
or doesn't have like a Patreon or anything,

1356
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,060
but like, people show up.

1357
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,060
Maybe the other guys just do it for the exposure.

1358
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,060
I'm just saying, like,

1359
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,060
if you earn money off a podcast

1360
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,060
that you're due with other people,

1361
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,060
especially regularly, I don't know that he does this,

1362
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,060
but it would be odd to me to just keep it all.

1363
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,060
Maybe they like, because he's got a big platform

1364
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,060
on his channel, maybe they like,

1365
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,060
maybe he doesn't monetize them or charge for them on Patreon.

1366
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,060
Maybe he doesn't actually make anything from them.

1367
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,060
Maybe. Maybe they're just filler in that sense.

1368
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,060
But I don't know, because I can't find the podcast.

1369
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,060
Hashtag where's the podcast.

1370
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,060
Yeah, good podcast.

1371
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,060
Nice job making an invisible podcast, my dude.

1372
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,060
It's not what I would have gone with,

1373
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,060
I'd say.

1374
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,060
No, indeed.

1375
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,060
I guess that's it for the segment of the problem

1376
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,060
with the Pizza Party podcast.

1377
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,060
I think we've covered, I think we've done some good work

1378
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,060
here today.

1379
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,060
Strong investigative journalism, as always.

1380
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,060
Go, as always,

1381
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,060
let the Pizza Party podcast know

1382
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,060
that we have some constructive criticism for them.

1383
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,060
What did he say?

1384
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,060
Oh yeah, and that line at the end about how

1385
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,060
the problem with them is that

1386
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,060
they wouldn't, and again, I've never listened

1387
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,060
to it, maybe once when Digi was on,

1388
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,060
just for a second,

1389
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,060
that like,

1390
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,060
they won't work to improve it

1391
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,060
because there is no

1392
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,060
like, because it's always been shit,

1393
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,060
and like, we're not going to change, and it's a filler show.

1394
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,060
You know, the thing is, I kind of

1395
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,060
empathize with that, because people all the time

1396
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,060
come to the PCP, and we'll leave like,

1397
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,060
hey guys, you should do this, this, this.

1398
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,060
Why aren't there more lectures on the channel, on the channel?

1399
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,060
Like, blah, blah, blah, you should be putting

1400
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,060
more effort into it, and it's a show

1401
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,060
designed with only a certain level

1402
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,060
of effort prepared to be put into it.

1403
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,060
So like, I kind of sympathize

1404
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,060
with that.

1405
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,060
Sure, but that's not a defense of anything.

1406
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,060
It's just a recognition of, you shouldn't

1407
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,060
expect more if you know what you're getting,

1408
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,060
I guess.

1409
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,060
We do fucking, we did try to improve things here,

1410
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,060
so I guess we're already doing better.

1411
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,060
We tried so hard, and got

1412
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,060
so far, and in the end, it made all the

1413
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,060
difference. If I could only- If I could only

1414
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,060
find the Pizza Party podcast,

1415
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,060
I could answer some of these burning

1416
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,060
questions, but- I don't even

1417
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,060
know how to,

1418
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,060
how can you fix what you can't see?

1419
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,060
Just go let those guys know.

1420
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,060
Where's the podcast? Where is it?

1421
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,060
Hashtag where's the podcast?

1422
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,060
That's what we need. Okay, moving on.

1423
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,060
Let's get to the rest of the voicemails for this

1424
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,060
week. We've got ten of them lined up.

1425
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,060
First one is from

1426
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,060
Zach. Let's get into it.

1427
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,060
Why did you guys say

1428
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,060
the editor contest is focused on audio

1429
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,060
editing, but then proceed to encourage the

1430
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,060
entrance to provide original graphic design?

1431
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,060
What if you guys get an entry with a great

1432
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,060
new design, but only decent audio, while

1433
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,060
another entry has fantastic audio, but

1434
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,060
no original design? Why not commission

1435
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,060
an actual graphic designer, or hold a

1436
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,060
separate contest to find the best possible

1437
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,060
new design, and ensure you'll pick the

1438
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,060
best possible audio editor without any doubts?

1439
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,060
Fuck you guys, I'm an audio

1440
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,060
editor, not a graphic designer.

1441
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,060
Sorry about that, Zach.

1442
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,060
Yeah, that's true.

1443
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,060
We did talk about that.

1444
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,060
We did mention that.

1445
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,060
That's a very good point, and

1446
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,060
I also put this in to remind myself

1447
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,060
to say in this episode that

1448
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,060
the hashtag piece of the editor contest

1449
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,060
is over, people, and we have all the

1450
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,060
entrance. By this, it'll be like five days

1451
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,060
since it ended or whatever.

1452
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,060
It'll be a full week when you're hearing this.

1453
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,060
We are listening to those.

1454
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,060
We'll be getting back to you, hopefully

1455
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,060
soonish.

1456
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,060
There's a person who had to hear herself say

1457
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,060
I'm going to flip veggies in three minutes

1458
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,060
for 30 times over.

1459
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,060
Did you like it?

1460
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,060
I can't honestly...

1461
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,060
I hate it.

1462
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,060
I hate myself.

1463
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,060
I have not listened to any of the entrance yet.

1464
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,060
I think May just listened to the most so far.

1465
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,060
I listened to all of them.

1466
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,060
That's dope.

1467
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,060
We actually had quite a few

1468
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,060
entries that had both

1469
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,060
good audio

1470
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,060
editors.

1471
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,060
This is kind of what I was saying.

1472
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,060
I don't think that editing a podcast

1473
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,060
is like...

1474
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,060
You don't need to be a super pro

1475
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,060
audio editor to do that.

1476
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,060
You don't need to have adequate

1477
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,060
audio editors.

1478
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
There were surprisingly a lot of entries

1479
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,060
who didn't listen to instructions

1480
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,060
at the...

1481
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,060
I'm not surprised by that.

1482
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,060
In the episode, we said

1483
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,060
make sure you cut this part, team,

1484
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,060
and make sure you do that.

1485
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,060
In one when she was interrupting Ben,

1486
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,060
I was like, you should cut that part out.

1487
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,060
I kind of understand leaving that part in.

1488
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,060
Maybe they were leaving it in because

1489
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,060
when she was making an example.

1490
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,060
There were other ones.

1491
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,060
Shout out to one boy.

1492
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,060
He didn't

1493
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,060
put notes of...

1494
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,060
He didn't credit himself.

1495
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,060
But the guy...

1496
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,060
He actually...

1497
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,060
You guys joked around and said

1498
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,060
everything is boring after Mage left.

1499
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,060
You just cut everything off

1500
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,060
when Mage left.

1501
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,060
And he did.

1502
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,060
He did it well.

1503
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,060
That's funny.

1504
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,060
We don't

1505
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,060
hardly cut anything almost ever.

1506
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,060
It's really rare that

1507
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,060
anything will be cut

1508
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,060
or whatever.

1509
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,060
Yep, absolutely true.

1510
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,060
Although, an editor offers the opportunity

1511
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,060
for someone whose job it is to make the show better.

1512
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,060
Possibly could cut...

1513
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,060
Quality of life things here or there.

1514
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,060
If something is a pointless tangent.

1515
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,060
I don't know.

1516
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,060
This whole show is a pointless tangent.

1517
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,060
Well, that's fair.

1518
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,060
It's a larger point here.

1519
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,060
As an audio man.

1520
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,060
I'm not going to lie.

1521
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,060
When we first rolled out the first video

1522
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,060
that we then updated.

1523
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,060
That first video was flawed.

1524
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,060
Because we should have talked more about the visual stuff.

1525
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,060
So it's totally fair to be pissed off

1526
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,060
that we weren't clear when that first one came out.

1527
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,060
I get the sense that

1528
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,060
people were submitting entries

1529
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,060
and they all pretty much looked the same

1530
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,060
and sounded the same.

1531
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,060
And we were like, shit.

1532
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,060
Everyone has just recreated the existing visuals.

1533
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,060
And then just done

1534
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,060
an adequate job of editing the audio.

1535
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,060
And like, that's not

1536
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,060
hard.

1537
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,060
I'm surprised you guys messed up like that.

1538
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,060
Because I do remember we specifically talked about

1539
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,060
wanting the visuals

1540
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,060
to be distinct and stuff.

1541
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,060
I know.

1542
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,060
It's because we included the visuals in the description.

1543
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,060
Which gave everybody the

1544
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,060
That did imply to people.

1545
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,060
Just use these.

1546
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,060
So it was fair to verify.

1547
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,060
But that doesn't impress.

1548
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,060
That just doesn't impress.

1549
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,060
And I mean, it's probably late to be saying this stuff anyway.

1550
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,060
But obviously the contest is over.

1551
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,060
But my point is just to Zach here.

1552
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,060
It's like, all along

1553
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,060
this is just me. I don't know if everybody else agrees.

1554
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,060
But I wanted an editor

1555
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,060
who's the full package.

1556
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,060
Who can do decent

1557
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,060
image work and when asked

1558
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,060
can provide art

1559
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,060
that's not terrible in some way.

1560
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,060
Like Ben was saying, and the audio has to be good.

1561
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,060
But we don't need like

1562
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,060
a serious crazy engineer

1563
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,060
to like, again, I would certainly take it

1564
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,060
if someone wanted to offer those services.

1565
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,060
But you know,

1566
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,060
kind of the main thing we wanted

1567
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,060
was like a refresh

1568
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,060
of the visuals anyway. Which I tried to add

1569
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,060
in the second version of the video and stuff.

1570
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,060
So, you know, I feel bad if I mislead

1571
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,060
anybody or got people's hopes up

1572
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,060
who may have only a portion of it.

1573
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,060
There was one entry that I would listen to

1574
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,060
I don't remember who it was.

1575
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,060
But it kind of struck me as

1576
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,060
odd. Like, they edited

1577
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,060
the audio quite a bit like

1578
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,060
you know, they spaced it out

1579
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,060
so we weren't talking over each other.

1580
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,060
But they also...

1581
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,060
I mean, several people did that.

1582
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,060
But like, that one specifically

1583
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,060
they cut out like bits and bobs here and there

1584
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,060
like trimmed some audio snippets.

1585
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,060
And like, in a way

1586
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,060
you know, you could say

1587
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,060
you improved the overall

1588
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,060
um...

1589
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,060
the audio, sorry

1590
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,060
I'm so sleepy it's really hard

1591
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,060
I'm tripping over my words. But like

1592
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,060
it also sort of like took away

1593
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,060
something from the product, I would say.

1594
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,060
Like, oddly like

1595
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,060
the charm was lacking of our just little

1596
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,060
nonsense of

1597
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,060
talks and stuff. Well, now

1598
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,060
I really want to give you these a listen and compare.

1599
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,060
Yeah, me too.

1600
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,060
That's almost like an artistic choice

1601
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,060
and kind of an aesthetic choice about how you want it to be.

1602
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,060
In my notes, I did make a mention

1603
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,060
that like, he seemed too

1604
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
thorough or something like that into editing

1605
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,060
and that kind of spooked me because

1606
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,060
like, in this snippet

1607
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,060
like in this preview

1608
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,060
it's all fine and good but like when it comes to

1609
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:36,060
actual episodes

1610
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,060
when people watch our episodes

1611
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,060
and they make comments it's like, oh then

1612
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,060
you know, you didn't say that thing

1613
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,060
or you missed out on that thing. But in the end

1614
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,060
you might have said it but it got, you know, cut

1615
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,060
or something. And I'm sort of like

1616
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,060
it's a little iffy about

1617
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,060
heavy editing of the audio.

1618
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,060
I would go for a light

1619
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,060
touch, I think.

1620
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,060
I think the best

1621
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
would be just, you know, to space out

1622
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,060
so we're not talking over each other.

1623
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,060
I don't even know

1624
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,060
about that. I don't even know if I would go

1625
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,060
that far.

1626
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,060
The shouting over each other is a...

1627
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,060
It's a tough balance because like if you

1628
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,060
edit it too much, it stops feeling conversational

1629
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,060
and feels a little like artificial.

1630
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,060
It's super weird to have like two people shouting

1631
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,060
over each other and then you take one and

1632
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,060
space it out.

1633
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,060
Not saying always to space it out but sometimes

1634
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,060
we're trying, you know,

1635
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,060
a conversation and someone speaks up and

1636
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,060
the other is, like Manchi said

1637
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,060
someone is talking and someone

1638
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,060
speaks up and the other person continues

1639
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,060
talking and they finish up.

1640
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,060
So, you know, you just space those two out

1641
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,060
so they're not talking over each other

1642
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,060
but when it's like a little shouting argument

1643
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:44,060
matched and you leave that in

1644
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,060
or something.

1645
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,060
There's definitely an art to it.

1646
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,060
I don't know. Yeah, I haven't listened to a single one

1647
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,060
so...

1648
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,060
Regardless of that though, I've seen a couple of cool stuff.

1649
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,060
I haven't looked through them all yet or anything.

1650
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,060
So there's your update people and the whole contest

1651
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,060
thing. We're looking at it.

1652
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,060
I'm hoping by next week, among us,

1653
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,060
we will all have listened and we'll be able to

1654
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,060
like start organizing some stuff and then

1655
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,060
we'll probably reach out and touch base

1656
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,060
with the people we...

1657
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,060
Because like we want to have a conversation

1658
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,060
here. So we're gonna, you know, talk to the person

1659
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,060
and see what they have to say for themselves.

1660
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,060
I just want to also say thank you to everyone

1661
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,060
who entered. Like, I listened to all of them

1662
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,060
and all of them had their

1663
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,060
strengths and weaknesses and stuff but they're all

1664
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,060
good. They weren't like

1665
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,060
super crappy or anything.

1666
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,060
I'm genuinely surprised that

1667
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,060
like pleasantly

1668
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,060
by all the effort people put into it

1669
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,060
is just, it's good. I'm happy. I'm happy

1670
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,060
with you all. Good job.

1671
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,060
I too am deeply grateful to everybody who entered

1672
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,060
and took the time to do it. That's super

1673
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,060
super swell. And we got a whole bunch to look through

1674
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,060
so that it couldn't be better for us.

1675
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,060
So I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled.

1676
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,060
Hell yeah.

1677
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,060
We're only an hour in. Are we going to

1678
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,060
continue with the voicemails?

1679
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,060
If anybody wants to like bring up something,

1680
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,060
we could do that but, you know,

1681
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,060
we could just do one round.

1682
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,060
The only thing I want to bring is bring myself to bed.

1683
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,060
I feel like I had a bunch of

1684
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,060
things.

1685
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,060
Maybe I already talked about your kidney

1686
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,060
stone.

1687
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,060
I don't know. You renounced keto for good

1688
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,060
and all.

1689
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,060
That's in the books.

1690
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,060
Let's discuss trees.

1691
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,060
I like trees.

1692
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,060
I don't know. We could just do a voicemail.

1693
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
You just want to bring up something. We can interrupt it.

1694
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,060
Wait, what are you, tell us about trees.

1695
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,060
I like them.

1696
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,060
Okay, let's do a voicemail.

1697
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,060
Okay, here we go.

1698
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,060
Next voicemail is from onezumerkunt.

1699
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,060
Let's go.

1700
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,060
Disgusting.

1701
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,060
So, uh,

1702
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,060
if traditional media

1703
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,060
is gay and dying,

1704
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,060
and digital media is gay and dying,

1705
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,060
well then what's a zoomer

1706
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,060
like me supposed to do?

1707
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,060
Maybe get out into the woods.

1708
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,060
Maybe get out into the forest and look at some trees.

1709
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,060
Everyone quickly into the forest.

1710
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,060
Die right along with it. That's what you're supposed to do.

1711
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1712
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,060
I don't know. The kid sounded like eight years old.

1713
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,060
He did. He sounded like ten or something.

1714
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,060
It makes me uncomfortable.

1715
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,060
Yeah.

1716
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,060
No, I'm way into it.

1717
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,060
I'm way into it.

1718
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,060
We need him younger. We have to go younger, guys.

1719
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,060
No.

1720
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,060
Can't say that now, dude.

1721
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,060
YouTube's cracking down.

1722
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,060
It's too real. It's too real.

1723
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,060
That's true. YouTube is cracking down.

1724
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,060
I'm luring in the youth.

1725
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,060
Did you hear how there's...

1726
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,060
YouTube now has the ability to just shut down comments

1727
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,060
on your entire channel?

1728
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,060
I did hear about that.

1729
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,060
So fucking weird.

1730
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,060
Is it like shutting down the comments section

1731
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,060
or shutting down your channel?

1732
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,060
The comments in this case.

1733
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,060
Yeah. They could disable comments on your entire channel.

1734
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,060
So I guess just to go into that...

1735
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,060
What if they suspect you of grooming kids?

1736
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,060
Well, not that you're grooming.

1737
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,060
What it is is that...

1738
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,060
Let's back it up a little bit.

1739
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,060
This is an interesting topic.

1740
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,060
I've never heard about this,

1741
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,060
but some family-friendly channels...

1742
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,060
There's a family that had a kid

1743
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
doing gymnastics.

1744
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,060
That video got demonetized

1745
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,060
and their whole channel got demonetized,

1746
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,060
I believe, or at least many of their videos.

1747
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,060
When they asked YouTube about it,

1748
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,060
YouTube said the reason for this is because...

1749
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,060
They later clarified, but I'll just put the whole information now.

1750
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,060
It's because your content

1751
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,060
has children

1752
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,060
and we detected that

1753
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,060
there are creepers,

1754
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,060
like sexy timestamps of your children

1755
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,060
and shit.

1756
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,060
It's like it's assembling

1757
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,060
a community of pedos.

1758
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,060
We at the YouTube team reviewed these timestamps

1759
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,060
and found them extremely sexy,

1760
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,060
and therefore,

1761
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,060
we decided to take action.

1762
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:46,060
Can a timestamp be considered

1763
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,060
lewd?

1764
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,060
Oh, that might be.

1765
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,060
A few hours ago,

1766
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,060
I saw a channel that I watched

1767
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,060
and he just reads out funny reddit stuff.

1768
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,060
And he uploaded a video

1769
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,060
of himself singing to his hamster

1770
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,060
and out of all of his videos,

1771
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,060
that one got demonetized.

1772
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,060
It's just...

1773
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,060
It's just a video of a hamster.

1774
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,060
Peter's going hog-wild.

1775
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,060
Oh, shit, I used the wrong term.

1776
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,060
They're gonna be so mad at me.

1777
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,060
Oh, no.

1778
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,060
Can't win.

1779
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,060
Remember that list

1780
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:24,060
of new phrases?

1781
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,060
Like, instead of grab a bull by the horn,

1782
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,060
say grab a rose by its thorns?

1783
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,060
Yeah.

1784
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,060
That was real.

1785
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,060
That's kind of a cute expression,

1786
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,060
grab a rose by its thorns.

1787
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,060
I guess so.

1788
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,060
But what's objectionable about

1789
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,060
grabbing a bull by its horns?

1790
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,060
It implies a violence towards the bull, perhaps.

1791
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,060
Does it?

1792
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,060
Does it, though?

1793
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,060
It provides at the very least self-defense

1794
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,060
or implies self-defense against a charging bull.

1795
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,060
Those horns doesn't harm the thing.

1796
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,060
I don't get it.

1797
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,060
I don't get it.

1798
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,060
What does he actually mean?

1799
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,060
Take a challenge head-on.

1800
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,060
But the thing is, a rose is very different

1801
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,060
from a charging bull.

1802
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,060
They are very different.

1803
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:12,060
The phrase doesn't mean the same thing anymore.

1804
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,060
Grabbing a rose by its thorns

1805
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,060
just means doing something really stupid.

1806
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,060
It's dumb.

1807
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,060
Yeah, it's a very different constant.

1808
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,060
The phrase works.

1809
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,060
I think you just go right in there

1810
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,060
and grab it by the thorns.

1811
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,060
Yeah, I think it works.

1812
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,060
I just don't know why it needed a new one.

1813
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,060
I don't get it.

1814
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:34,060
I think the context is like

1815
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,060
grab a bull by its horns

1816
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,060
because it would be probably a charging bull

1817
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:40,060
and instead of running away,

1818
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,060
you stand your ground and you charge the bull

1819
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,060
and you lift it by thorns.

1820
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,060
I looked up the list.

1821
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,060
They had another one.

1822
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,060
They changed to bring home the bagels.

1823
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,060
That's anti-semitic, my dude.

1824
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,060
What, do you hate Israel?

1825
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,060
What's that about?

1826
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,060
Come on.

1827
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,060
Because who are the real animals

1828
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,060
if not the Jews?

1829
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,060
If you don't think

1830
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,060
we should have bacon,

1831
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,060
that one makes way more sense to me

1832
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:10,060
than having a problem with grabbing a bull by the horns.

1833
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,060
Bacon doesn't imply death of an animal

1834
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,060
and whatnot.

1835
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,060
Fair enough, I guess.

1836
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,060
That's just dumb.

1837
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,060
Feed a fed horse

1838
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,060
is the change of that one long.

1839
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,060
That's funny.

1840
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,060
It is funny, but they weren't going for funny.

1841
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,060
It's like any reference to an animal

1842
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,060
being in any state other than

1843
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,060
perfectly healthy and content is unacceptable.

1844
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,060
It's just strange.

1845
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:36,060
In the correction one, they still used a horse

1846
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,060
but in the grab the bull by its horns,

1847
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,060
you have to be nice to it.

1848
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,060
You're being nice to the horse

1849
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,060
because you're feeding it.

1850
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,060
Can we do an objectifying animal like this?

1851
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:48,060
What if you just gently

1852
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,060
hold on to the bull's horn?

1853
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,060
That would be considered sexual assault

1854
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:54,060
mage and you need to let go right now.

1855
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,060
Alright, let's go to the next

1856
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,060
voice mail here.

1857
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,060
It's another message from our old friend

1858
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,060
ThemSnakes.

1859
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:06,060
It would be cruel to see the horse

1860
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,060
if it was fed already.

1861
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,060
If you're just pouring more food into its trough,

1862
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,060
it doesn't have to eat it or anything.

1863
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,060
It is a waste of time.

1864
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,060
But it does say feed.

1865
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,060
I guess.

1866
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,060
Moving on, let's talk about another of my favorite animals,

1867
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,060
ThemSnakes.

1868
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,060
My favorite pile of sentient snakes.

1869
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,060
Let's go now.

1870
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,060
St. Bans Cathedral.

1871
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,060
A beautiful building.

1872
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,060
Yet there is no Bans Saint to be seen.

1873
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,060
I have sat here

1874
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,060
for a month waiting for a meeting

1875
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,060
of the mines.

1876
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,060
I even learned how to use

1877
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,060
a fake computer for this.

1878
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,060
Perhaps

1879
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,060
if I want to reach you,

1880
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,060
I must sing a hymn.

1881
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,060
The Lord's

1882
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,060
Prayer should do the trick.

1883
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,060
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah.

1884
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,060
Autobiogenesis,

1885
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,060
ketogenic symphysis,

1886
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,060
doctor of the chase, cut the carbs,

1887
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,060
burn bridges, burn paths,

1888
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,060
communist your theories where I'm at,

1889
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,060
pop with my class, struggle,

1890
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,060
high marks, working hard,

1891
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,060
society apart, and re-built it

1892
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,060
in the image of God.

1893
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,060
I'm a saint, and you ain't.

1894
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,060
I've seen the doll, can't build the wall,

1895
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,060
cause there's no place I ain't already been.

1896
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,060
I'm a lonely snake, smuggling into myself,

1897
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,060
a living pile of fear with no hopes

1898
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,060
or dreams.

1899
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,060
If I don't hear, I'm back from you soon,

1900
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,060
I'll kill everything in the room.

1901
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,060
Red wedding, ready, set, go.

1902
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,060
To death, Macbeth, in the hellfire.

1903
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,060
Hamlet, venom flows into your chest.

1904
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,060
Heart stops, mic drops,

1905
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:38,060
blood in the mud puddle, time's up.

1906
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,060
Let the games begin.

1907
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,060
You're more where to find me, Ben.

1908
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,060
Them snakes on discord.

1909
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,060
I'm waiting.

1910
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,060
But I'm so fucking scared of him now.

1911
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,060
Oh my god.

1912
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,060
I'll be singed by beats that fire.

1913
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,060
That was the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life.

1914
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,060
That was fucking sick.

1915
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,060
Them snakes just kick things up a serious notch.

1916
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,060
Holy shit.

1917
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,060
It's too good.

1918
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,060
I don't know what to do about this.

1919
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,060
He's just supposed to talk to you, Ben.

1920
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,060
That's what he just wants.

1921
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,060
My instinct is to hide.

1922
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,060
He just fuels your absence in the cathedral.

1923
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,060
I guess I'm going to have to

1924
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,060
grab this bull by the horns

1925
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,060
if you're part of the expression.

1926
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,060
I won't, but let's move on

1927
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,060
to the next voicemail.

1928
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,060
Who's going to follow that one up?

1929
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,060
Ah, here we go.

1930
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,060
The voicemail from my old friend,

1931
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,060
I can't poop.

1932
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,060
Let's get to it.

1933
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:40,060
The opposite of Ben's problem.

1934
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,060
Here's the deal.

1935
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,060
If you have suds ago or so, who cares?

1936
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,060
You guys are talking about how sometimes it's troublesome to poop.

1937
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,060
You just can't get it out.

1938
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,060
It's like, yeah, okay, I've got problems like that sometimes.

1939
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,060
Yeah, I guess you could call this hashtag relatable.

1940
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,060
But then, the very same day

1941
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,060
that I was listening to that episode,

1942
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:58,060
I had trouble pooping.

1943
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,060
I went to bed. Okay, well, I guess I'm not pooping now.

1944
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
So, I wake up. I'm still having trouble pooping.

1945
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:04,060
I can't poop.

1946
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,060
What's wrong with me? No, it's not my problem.

1947
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,060
It's your problem. You guys,

1948
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,060
you ruin lives. You get people addicted.

1949
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,060
You're the reason why people are dying.

1950
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,060
And you're the fucking reason why no one can poop.

1951
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,060
Why can't we poop?

1952
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,060
Just let us poop, goddammit.

1953
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,060
Ben is pooping for all of you.

1954
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,060
We're the reason people are dying

1955
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,060
of constipation.

1956
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,060
I don't know.

1957
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,060
Get some fiber in your diet, man.

1958
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:30,060
Listen to prune man, who called in the other day.

1959
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,060
Get your prune on.

1960
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,060
Get your laxative on, if necessary, I suppose.

1961
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,060
Yeah, I don't know.

1962
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,060
I've still never eaten a prune in my life.

1963
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,060
Drink a lot of water.

1964
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,060
A lot of water. And I mean water, not like,

1965
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,060
soda.

1966
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,060
May have just been proselytizing at me

1967
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,060
for drinking soda all day.

1968
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,060
I'm so fucking...

1969
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,060
So it is fine, but now you have kidney stones, right?

1970
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,060
So don't drink soda while you have kidney stones.

1971
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,060
I mean, that is...

1972
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,060
Don't drink soda, period.

1973
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,060
Soda is a trap.

1974
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,060
It's bad.

1975
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,060
I say as I have my polar pop of diet...

1976
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,060
No, no, dude.

1977
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,060
Diet doc pepper, but...

1978
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,060
Do as I say, not as I'm doing.

1979
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,060
It's the sodium though, right?

1980
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,060
No, it's not the sodium.

1981
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,060
I don't know what it is.

1982
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:18,060
You say... I don't know what it is.

1983
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,060
It's all the rocks they make it with.

1984
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,060
Good, good, correct.

1985
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,060
Next moil...

1986
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,060
Next moil is from

1987
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,060
Def Jam Vendetta.

1988
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,060
Let's get to it.

1989
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,060
I remember that game.

1990
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,060
Used to be you wanted to make yourself known.

1991
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,060
You proved your worth

1992
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,060
as a street fighter or hustler.

1993
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,060
We don't fight

1994
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,060
out in the streets no more.

1995
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,060
We're organized now.

1996
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:48,060
Two gangster for the garden.

1997
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:50,060
So we've taken it underground.

1998
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,060
Underground.

1999
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,060
I'm a businessman

2000
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,060
and this is my

2001
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,060
business.

2002
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,060
My soldiers are legion.

2003
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,060
Method man, noray,

2004
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,060
capone, luda,

2005
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,060
red man, DMX.

2006
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,060
You want a shot at me?

2007
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,060
You gotta make it past these brothers.

2008
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,060
It's a dangerous world out there.

2009
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,060
Seems every time I turn around

2010
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,060
there's another young buck wants to take me on.

2011
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,060
I lay down

2012
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,060
for no man.

2013
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,060
You want to take what's mine?

2014
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,060
You gotta beat me.

2015
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,060
But nobody

2016
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,060
ever beats

2017
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,060
me.

2018
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,060
I...

2019
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,060
What's he talking about?

2020
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,060
Def Jam Vendetta.

2021
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,060
Oh yeah, Def Jam Vendetta.

2022
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,060
For the PSU.

2023
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,060
I went and listened to it.

2024
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:46,060
It's the verbatim line for line.

2025
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,060
Intro to Def Jam Vendetta.

2026
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,060
Even Red Man?

2027
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,060
Yeah, it's a rapper

2028
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,060
fighting game for the PSU.

2029
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,060
I was gonna say

2030
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,060
the line sound like from a video game.

2031
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:00,060
Yeah, Def Jam Vendetta.

2032
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,060
It's a classic back in the day.

2033
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,060
It's good.

2034
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:06,060
I think it actually reviewed decent.

2035
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,060
Is it like a WWE style game?

2036
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,060
There was Def Jam Vendetta,

2037
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,060
then there was Def Jam Fight for New York.

2038
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,060
Wait, is it a fighting game

2039
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:16,060
or is it like a rap battling game?

2040
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,060
The first Def Jam game was

2041
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,060
more like a straight wrestling game.

2042
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,060
Def Jam Vendetta was the sequel

2043
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,060
and they made it a lot more arcadey

2044
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,060
and a lot more fun.

2045
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,060
You create your character and you rise through the ranks

2046
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,060
and you buy ice with your money

2047
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,060
from winning your fights with the rappers.

2048
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,060
You buy ice? Ice like

2049
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,060
diamonds?

2050
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,060
Yeah, like diamond necklaces.

2051
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,060
It's awesome. It's a good game.

2052
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,060
It's the quintessential human experience

2053
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,060
Oh, yeah.

2054
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,060
The analysis that people are really clamoring for.

2055
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,060
Speaking of live games,

2056
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,060
did you decide what sort of big analysis video

2057
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,060
you're gonna do on what game?

2058
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,060
I voted for Fable.

2059
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,060
We're looking through suggestions.

2060
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,060
It's...

2061
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,060
Digi doesn't have time to do shit,

2062
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,060
so I'm taking it on myself to finish this

2063
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:06,060
Patoon video I've been talking about doing forever.

2064
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,060
So I have to like play Fable

2065
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,060
to do that and so that takes time.

2066
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,060
Just watch a Let's Play at times two speed.

2067
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,060
Well, I guess it's still a long time.

2068
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:16,060
Disgusting.

2069
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,060
That's basically what Digi does while watching you play anyway.

2070
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,060
So what's the real difference?

2071
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,060
I know. I do all the work and he does all the bullshit.

2072
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,060
All right, next voicemail.

2073
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,060
This one's from Tony.

2074
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,060
Tony Go.

2075
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:30,060
Hello, PCP.

2076
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,060
I want to ask why

2077
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:34,060
you all think Final Fantasy 7 is so good.

2078
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,060
I've heard so much praise

2079
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,060
about that game

2080
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,060
and it looks like garbage.

2081
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,060
The combat is garbage.

2082
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,060
I just want to know why so many people think it's so good.

2083
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,060
Please let me know.

2084
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,060
This is an interesting question.

2085
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,060
And I thought the last voicemail was 8 years old,

2086
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:52,060
but this guy was really...

2087
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,060
It's interesting.

2088
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:58,060
I've literally never played Final Fantasy 7

2089
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,060
and I kind of want to just to like...

2090
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,060
That's what Gib did.

2091
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,060
Experience it now because I know nothing about it at all.

2092
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,060
I sure did like it

2093
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,060
when it was new-ish.

2094
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,060
I don't think...

2095
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,060
I don't think I would really like a traditional JRPG anymore

2096
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,060
in the same way that I used to.

2097
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:16,060
So I don't know if I would like it as much as I did.

2098
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,060
Here's the correct answer.

2099
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,060
Here's the correct answer.

2100
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,060
The game is perfect and flawless.

2101
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,060
The combat system is perfect.

2102
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,060
The fighting is perfect. The gameplay is perfect.

2103
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,060
The material system is perfect.

2104
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:30,060
The stat mechanics are perfect.

2105
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,060
The story is perfect. The characters are all fucking great

2106
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:34,060
and fleshed out and three-dimensional.

2107
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,060
It's unique.

2108
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:38,060
It's got this great cyberpunk aesthetic,

2109
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,060
but then as the game goes on,

2110
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,060
it goes less cyberpunk and more into nature.

2111
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,060
It kind of works with the theme of the game

2112
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,060
because man's disregard for nature

2113
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,060
is ruining the planet.

2114
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,060
It's got all these great themes of environmentalism

2115
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,060
and spiritualism.

2116
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,060
And the story is so grandiose.

2117
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,060
The story is big,

2118
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,060
but also stays focused on the characters.

2119
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,060
So it's really grand,

2120
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,060
but also intimate at the same time.

2121
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,060
The characters, you fall in love with them.

2122
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:06,060
They all have their own arc, their own story,

2123
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,060
their own personality, they all interact great.

2124
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,060
There's all kinds of great minigames.

2125
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,060
You ride a motorcycle, you go ride a fucking snowboard

2126
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,060
at one level, you get lost in the ice,

2127
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,060
you can't find the map, you go around, you don't know where it goes.

2128
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,060
The story is fucking, you know, characters

2129
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,060
meet some grisly fates, you feel sad.

2130
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,060
It's the fucking, you meet the guy at the end,

2131
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:24,060
he's a really cool guy, he says,

2132
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,060
oh god, my mom, he was an alien.

2133
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,060
And he fucking burns people.

2134
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,060
He goes crazy.

2135
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,060
It's cool, it is good.

2136
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,060
So you're saying it's a story about family.

2137
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:36,060
It's a story about family.

2138
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,060
I was just watching the other day.

2139
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:40,060
It came out in like 2018.

2140
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,060
It was just like some video that was like

2141
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,060
seven secrets you probably don't know

2142
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,060
about Final Fantasy VII or something like that.

2143
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,060
And the conceit of it was just like,

2144
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,060
guys, there's still shit that we are

2145
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,060
uncovering about Final Fantasy VII

2146
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,060
today that people don't know about.

2147
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,060
And I can't remember any of the examples,

2148
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,060
but one of the things was just going into

2149
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,060
how much depth there really was

2150
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,060
in the dating mechanic

2151
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,060
which decides at the beginning of the game

2152
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,060
who you go on the date with.

2153
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,060
There's like a million choices.

2154
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,060
And it doesn't even tell you. It's not like some crappy,

2155
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,060
not like some newfangled thing where it's like,

2156
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,060
oh, you got five relationship points

2157
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,060
with this girl because you gave

2158
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,060
Chie a gift or some stupid crap like that.

2159
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:20,060
Aw, who do I pick? Do I marry Abigail

2160
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:22,060
or Leah or Emily? I just can't decide.

2161
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,060
It's organic. It's like a part of the game.

2162
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,060
It never advertises itself as a dating mechanic.

2163
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,060
It just happens in the background.

2164
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,060
You just select your choices and just depending

2165
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,060
on who you as the player organically

2166
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,060
are inclined or gravitate towards

2167
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,060
the other characters, that's the character

2168
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,060
you end up going on a date with halfway through the game.

2169
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:40,060
And it's like, it could be Barrett.

2170
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,060
You can go on a date with another dude.

2171
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,060
That's progressive. You can go on a date

2172
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,060
with the yuffy, the 16-year-old.

2173
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,060
That's even more progressive

2174
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,060
in some circles.

2175
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,060
That's considered progressive.

2176
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,060
You know, it's cool.

2177
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,060
It's a good game.

2178
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,060
Can you go on a date with Kate Sith?

2179
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,060
No, you cannot.

2180
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,060
Here's the thing.

2181
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,060
Did you know that if you cast Knights of the Round

2182
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,060
on Genoves...

2183
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,060
I think it's Genoves Synthesis, the very final one

2184
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,060
before you fight Sephiroth,

2185
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,060
then Safer Sephiroth

2186
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,060
just has significantly more HP

2187
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,060
when you fight him. It dynamically

2188
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,060
changes the stats of the bosses

2189
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,060
depending on what material you bring on.

2190
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,060
There's this whole mechanic in the last boss fight

2191
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:24,060
that you get to see is there at the end of the game.

2192
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,060
Depending on how well...

2193
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,060
The last boss fight is three boss battles

2194
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,060
and then a fourth story boss battle.

2195
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,060
That's not really real.

2196
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,060
But depending on how well you do

2197
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,060
in the first of this three-phase, massive-end boss fight,

2198
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,060
you get to the second phase

2199
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,060
and if you did really good,

2200
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,060
then you get to use your whole party

2201
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,060
in the battle for the first time in the game

2202
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,060
right at the end.

2203
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:48,060
You've got nine party members,

2204
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,060
but you use three at a time.

2205
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,060
They're all fighting,

2206
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,060
and you can switch between group A, group B, and group C

2207
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,060
to fight this guy all at once.

2208
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,060
It's fucking mind-blowing!

2209
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:00,060
It's the best game ever made.

2210
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,060
Final, one of my favorite moments

2211
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,060
is something that a completionist won't even see,

2212
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,060
but is still one of my favorite details

2213
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,060
about a casual play through

2214
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,060
Final Fantasy VII.

2215
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,060
It's that you learn limits

2216
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,060
and you got to do... Getting Cloud's

2217
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,060
Omni Slash Ultimate Limit

2218
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:18,060
is actually very challenging for new players

2219
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,060
because it takes a lot of work at the Colosseum and shit.

2220
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,060
But

2221
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,060
when you get to the endgame,

2222
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,060
even if you have an unlocked Omni Slash

2223
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,060
at the very final, like,

2224
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,060
Kino one-on-one epic

2225
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,060
Soul of Sephiroth vs. Soul of Cloud

2226
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,060
out-of-body experience battle,

2227
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,060
Cloud just... Doesn't matter if you haven't unlocked it.

2228
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,060
He just unlocks his ultimate

2229
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,060
Limit Break, Omni Slash,

2230
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:42,060
and you just use it on Sephiroth

2231
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,060
and think about what that implies

2232
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,060
about the character rising up

2233
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,060
and the ultimate version of himself to take on Sephiroth.

2234
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,060
It's like, what could be cooler than that?

2235
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,060
Nothing's cooler than that.

2236
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,060
Man, I can't wait for all this

2237
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,060
to be ruined in 10 years by the Final Fantasy VII.

2238
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,060
It was ruined many years ago, dude.

2239
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,060
We've covered this, Jesse and I,

2240
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,060
in various videos and whatnot.

2241
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,060
There's so many different, like,

2242
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,060
mini-games and, like, games in the game,

2243
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,060
like, different mechanics and all that.

2244
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,060
So much love.

2245
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,060
The Chocobo breeding is like this whole other experience

2246
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,060
in the game and there's, like, depth to it

2247
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,060
and stuff. And then you get, you know,

2248
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,060
you get, like, a blue one.

2249
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,060
They can go across rivers. They can get a green one.

2250
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,060
They can go over mountains. You get a black one.

2251
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,060
They can do both. You get a gold one, eventually,

2252
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,060
if you're really fucking hardcore.

2253
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,060
They can go anywhere it wants. You can go in secret caves.

2254
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,060
Secret caves!

2255
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,060
Yeah, Final Fantasy VII is a game about secret caves.

2256
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,060
Even some of the character's back stories

2257
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:36,060
are, like, secrets. They gotta be, like,

2258
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,060
the most hardcore motherfucker on the planet

2259
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,060
to even see parts of the story.

2260
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,060
You gotta be hard... You wanna know about

2261
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,060
Zack? You don't play Crisis Core.

2262
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,060
You don't fucking buy a PSP. No one's gonna do that shit.

2263
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,060
And that game's bad anyways.

2264
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,060
Put a new whole new character in it. Didn't belong there.

2265
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,060
No one cares about Jenna.

2266
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,060
Here's a tiny piece of analysis.

2267
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,060
Here's one tiny piece of analysis about that

2268
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,060
thing. I think that the developers,

2269
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,060
like, like, Vincent's story is, like,

2270
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,060
complete. I mean, the character is secret.

2271
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,060
But, like, even finding Lucretia, getting chaos

2272
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:06,060
to the ultimate limit, all that stuff

2273
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,060
is incredibly hard to find. And here's my theory.

2274
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,060
Because development costs

2275
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:12,060
and creating any one individual

2276
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,060
piece of content in a game, like a Final Fantasy,

2277
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:16,060
like the remake or whatever, has

2278
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,060
astronomically increased in, like,

2279
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,060
deep... Like, what do they have to make to make the Lucretia

2280
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,060
like, side story? They have to make, like,

2281
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,060
a new spooky area, like, make it

2282
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,060
available on the map by doing a couple of crazy things.

2283
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,060
You can only get there with the submarine, which is

2284
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,060
a whole other mechanic. There's a whole, like, the whole

2285
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:32,060
world map is doubled because you can go on the ocean floor

2286
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,060
and a submarine and explore, like, a crashed

2287
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,060
gal ninka. Indeed.

2288
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,060
Considering the fact that, like, that world already existed,

2289
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,060
it wasn't that much more work to make, like,

2290
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,060
one new character designed for Lucretia,

2291
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,060
which I think also shows up elsewhere in the game, too.

2292
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:46,060
I could be wrong. And, like, to give her a new area

2293
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,060
because, like, nothing happens there. It's not that complicated.

2294
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:50,060
Because it was... Like, the threshold

2295
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,060
for making that stuff

2296
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,060
is so much lower, that, like, look at a game

2297
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,060
like Final Fantasy XV, if you tried

2298
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:58,060
to put, like, that much content

2299
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,060
into a game like Final Fantasy XV,

2300
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,060
it would be exponentially just

2301
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,060
more dev hours, more work.

2302
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,060
And, like, would those guys be able

2303
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:08,060
to, like, justify it being, like,

2304
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:10,060
secret and that hard to find?

2305
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:12,060
They'd be terrified of doing that. Like, so much of what's good about that game

2306
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,060
you almost couldn't even do nowadays, especially,

2307
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:16,060
like you said, with the...

2308
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,060
with how Square Enix is now, like, the amount of money that it

2309
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,060
costs to make a, like, a AAA game and stuff.

2310
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,060
Like, I just like a game that respects

2311
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:24,060
my ability to find out

2312
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,060
its secrets. And it's like that with Vincent.

2313
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,060
It doesn't tell you anything. It doesn't tell you how to get Vincent.

2314
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:30,060
You gotta find him on your own. You gotta answer

2315
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,060
the dialogue boxes correctly. And the same thing with Yuffie.

2316
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,060
You gotta, like, find her,

2317
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,060
beat her, answer her, all of her dialogue.

2318
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,060
You gotta, like, really, like,

2319
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:40,060
play, like, this weird psychological game of, like,

2320
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,060
okay, how would I use reverse psychology

2321
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,060
to convince a 16-year-old ninja

2322
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,060
to want to join me when five seconds ago

2323
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,060
she just wanted to take my stuff? There's, like, a whole

2324
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,060
side story of her that you can go. You can go

2325
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:52,060
to see her hometown. And she's got, like,

2326
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,060
like, a completely optional

2327
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,060
character who is a secret, who you don't even

2328
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,060
have to have to beat the game. She's not

2329
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,060
even advertised in the game, really.

2330
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,060
And she's got, like, her own story. And her story

2331
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:04,060
has, like, all this depth and emotion

2332
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,060
to it of, like, how she comes from this ruined

2333
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,060
town that had this, like, this

2334
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:10,060
culture to it. And it was, like, taken over

2335
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,060
by, like, corporate interests and turned

2336
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,060
into a resort town. And so

2337
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,060
they don't, they don't have a culture anymore. So she's

2338
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:18,060
going to, you know, she became a thief to

2339
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,060
steal from people to get material. An analogy for Japan

2340
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:22,060
in the post-World War II era, perhaps?

2341
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,060
Who can say? Well, look at that. It's fucking,

2342
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,060
it's smart. It's, uh, it's

2343
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:28,060
brilliant. It is smart. It's fucking good.

2344
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:30,060
It's just... And you know what it reminds me of?

2345
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,060
I was, it's just a small last point here.

2346
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,060
It's just that I've been playing a Hollow Knight

2347
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,060
and trying to get the secret ending, um, or the

2348
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,060
there's many endings to Hollow Knight, but

2349
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,060
the true ultimate ending

2350
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:42,060
of To Get of Hollow Knight

2351
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,060
is so unbelievably challenging

2352
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,060
to actually do.

2353
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:48,060
You have to do, I wouldn't even go into it, but

2354
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,060
it's at the end of the Godmaster DLC. You have to do

2355
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:52,060
so much fucking shit and

2356
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,060
defeat, like, this ultimate gauntlet of

2357
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:56,060
every single boss in the game. All versions

2358
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,060
of them. Uh, and then you fight

2359
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:00,060
the true super version of the final boss

2360
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,060
for real this time.

2361
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,060
That's how you get the real, honest God ending.

2362
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,060
And I have heard, I just, I just

2363
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,060
hear these fucking babies

2364
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,060
just crying about how this makes

2365
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,060
the game worse because it's too hard.

2366
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,060
No! Break my spine, Hollow Knight!

2367
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,060
Make me regret being born!

2368
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,060
I want to be punished!

2369
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,060
I want to have to earn it, goddammit!

2370
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,060
Make me suffer so I can feel

2371
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,060
something positive briefly

2372
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,060
for that shining moment at the end.

2373
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:28,060
That's what I want!

2374
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,060
And games just don't do that, you know?

2375
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,060
Not as much anymore.

2376
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,060
I've heard, I've heard a completely

2377
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,060
baseless rumor about Pokemon

2378
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,060
that it's like, the new game

2379
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,060
it might have

2380
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,060
um, difficulty modes.

2381
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:44,060
I hope so.

2382
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,060
And there might be a folk.

2383
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,060
We'll probably find out in two days.

2384
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,060
Two days? Wasn't two days.

2385
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,060
Then the Pokemon Directs and the Pokemon Directs

2386
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,060
Oh my god!

2387
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:56,060
You guys will know by the time this comes out.

2388
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,060
Yeah. Well hot shit.

2389
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:00,060
Well there you go.

2390
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,060
How's that for an answer to your

2391
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:04,060
fucking question, guy?

2392
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,060
Yeah. Dude, is it good?

2393
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,060
No. That's the short answer.

2394
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,060
Alright, moving on.

2395
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,060
Uh, next voicemail is from

2396
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,060
uh, Kersh Keatman.

2397
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:16,060
Kersh Keatman. Okay, let's go.

2398
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,060
Did you really think you could

2399
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,060
disrespect anime

2400
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,060
and get away with it?

2401
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,060
Oh no.

2402
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,060
That's the end of the voicemail.

2403
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,060
I guess we didn't get away with it.

2404
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:38,060
We got called out.

2405
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,060
What was he snapping there?

2406
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:42,060
Like our collective neck, perhaps.

2407
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,060
I think he was slamming the phone down.

2408
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,060
Yeah, I was just going to say it sounded like he was slamming.

2409
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,060
Oh Allah,

2410
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,060
Best Guy Ever's World Famous

2411
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,060
No Madam President video, which is

2412
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,060
ripping off a vine, so not actually

2413
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,060
my original idea.

2414
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,060
That's just a high powered

2415
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,060
80s businessman on the phone

2416
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,060
making a deal. How dare you disrespect

2417
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,060
anime. Smash is on the ground.

2418
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,060
Cancel the deal. He's calling us

2419
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,060
on the phone. It's like a

2420
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,060
scare. It's like a dark and stormy night.

2421
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,060
It's like this part in the Resident Evil 2 remake

2422
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:14,060
where Claire, the phone rings.

2423
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,060
She answers it, not on the other end.

2424
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,060
He's dial tone phone?

2425
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:20,060
She just picks it up.

2426
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,060
Operator patched me through to the pro crowd.

2427
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,060
Did you think you could sully the name

2428
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:26,060
of anime and get away with it?

2429
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:28,060
And then like an old timey

2430
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:30,060
phone sound of like slamming in the receiver.

2431
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,060
Damn it.

2432
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:34,060
We've got big deals with those jabs.

2433
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,060
We can't jeopardize it now. We won't have you sullyin' them.

2434
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,060
The emperor is on the phone.

2435
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,060
We got the emperor on the phone.

2436
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,060
He wants to have a word with these pro

2437
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:44,060
crowd.

2438
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:46,060
Hey Jesse, is the

2439
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,060
Resident Evil 2 remake good and should I play it

2440
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,060
immediately?

2441
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:52,060
It is...

2442
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,060
Yes, it's great.

2443
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,060
The short answer is that it's fantastic.

2444
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,060
I have an inclination to be cynical

2445
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,060
and say like the original is better

2446
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,060
for this reason and this reason and this reason.

2447
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,060
But you know, as far as anyone is concerned

2448
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:06,060
who's not crazy like me,

2449
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:08,060
it's fantastic.

2450
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,060
Is that the one with the big spooky boy with the hat?

2451
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:12,060
The ex-con give it to ya.

2452
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:14,060
Yeah, that's it.

2453
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:16,060
I'm gonna do it like five times in a row.

2454
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:18,060
Damn you did.

2455
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:20,060
And I got the S-plus rank.

2456
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,060
I made sure to get it.

2457
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:24,060
And I thought to myself, alright,

2458
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,060
this is the best you can possibly do in the game.

2459
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,060
S-plus rank. I've conquered the game.

2460
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,060
Surely I will get the infinite ammo rocket launcher

2461
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,060
for my next play with you or the infinite ammo

2462
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,060
minigun.

2463
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,060
Oh, I got infinite ammo.

2464
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:38,060
Infinite ammo handgun.

2465
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,060
I said what is this shit?

2466
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,060
Take it back to GameStop. I don't even like it anymore.

2467
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,060
Is this for a handgun?

2468
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,060
Damn.

2469
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,060
I get you coming and going.

2470
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,060
I said you dirty dog.

2471
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,060
Alright, next voice mail. Here we go.

2472
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,060
This one's from Josh.

2473
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:56,060
Josh, go.

2474
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:58,060
So if there is a live action one piece movie,

2475
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,060
Gustav will be played

2476
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,060
by Will Smith.

2477
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,060
It's Rewind Time.

2478
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,060
Shit, what was that last one?

2479
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,060
Rewind Time.

2480
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,060
Oh, fuck.

2481
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,060
Listen, no.

2482
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,060
We got to get Benedict Cumberbatch

2483
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,060
and Sanji.

2484
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,060
We got to get...

2485
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,060
We got to get...

2486
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,060
Oh, God. Who is the guy in the Nike commercial?

2487
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:30,060
Oh, God.

2488
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,060
Colin Kaepernick.

2489
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,060
We got to get Colin Kaepernick

2490
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,060
as Luffy.

2491
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,060
Okay, sure.

2492
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,060
We got to get Robert.

2493
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,060
Oh, wait.

2494
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:44,060
We got to get Michael Cera

2495
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,060
as Zorro

2496
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,060
and John Cena

2497
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,060
as Nami.

2498
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,060
Yeah.

2499
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,060
And so on in that order.

2500
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:56,060
Eva Longoria as Frankie.

2501
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,060
Sorry, John Cena as Frankie.

2502
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,060
That's an actual recommendation.

2503
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,060
Oh, I was going to say Eva Longoria as Frankie.

2504
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,060
She's got the penach. She's got the style.

2505
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:06,060
Only she can hack it.

2506
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,060
She's got the character as Nica Roche.

2507
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,060
Wait, isn't that the character's name?

2508
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:12,060
I'm 16 and I'll do anything.

2509
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,060
Mr. Sheffield.

2510
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,060
I want to live.

2511
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,060
The greatest actress who ever lived.

2512
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:24,060
Oh, God.

2513
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:26,060
All right.

2514
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:28,060
Okay, another message. This one's called

2515
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,060
The Perfect Procrastinator's Voice Mail.

2516
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,060
All right.

2517
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,060
I'm intrigued. Go on.

2518
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,060
So, uh, you guys haven't been playing

2519
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,060
my recordings.

2520
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,060
So I decided to make a recording

2521
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,060
that maybe the PCP would like.

2522
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,060
They're all eight.

2523
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,060
Hippocrite is, uh,

2524
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,060
should videos and, um,

2525
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,060
gay.

2526
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,060
Yeah, you remember this guy named

2527
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:54,060
Ben St.

2528
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:58,060
Voice Mailers are funny, right?

2529
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,060
Yes.

2530
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,060
Yes, they are.

2531
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,060
Nick Minion, I'm like Mike Minion.

2532
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,060
Actually, this guy's a hellboy.

2533
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,060
Am I right in a name?

2534
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,060
I'm so stupid.

2535
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,060
I'm so homosexual.

2536
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:16,060
That's it. That's the end.

2537
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:18,060
That's the end of the Voice Mail.

2538
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,060
Um, well, I got a kick out of it.

2539
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,060
Yeah.

2540
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,060
We didn't say anything about me.

2541
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,060
All he did was ask if you heard about me.

2542
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,060
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2543
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,060
We just moved on to bigger and better things.

2544
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,060
He's already in full of a bunch of

2545
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,060
Andy Milanakis fake

2546
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,060
seven-year-olds.

2547
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,060
Oh, my God, Andy Milanakis exists.

2548
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,060
Maybe it's actually him,

2549
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:42,060
uh, and, you know,

2550
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,060
all our children voices are just slight

2551
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,060
voices he's doing.

2552
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,060
I just remembered, like, there used to be the show,

2553
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,060
the Andy Milanakis show, and it was, like, the trippiest

2554
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:52,060
shit.

2555
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:54,060
I never saw it.

2556
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,060
Now, Andy Milanakis,

2557
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,060
he'd be really good

2558
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:00,060
as Jin Bae.

2559
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,060
Remember how

2560
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,060
I, in the procrastination movie,

2561
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,060
I wanted a digitally town-scaled John Goodman

2562
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,060
to play Hippocrite?

2563
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,060
I stand by it.

2564
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,060
Obviously, Tom Cruise would blame me.

2565
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,060
We've been over this. That was, like, a year ago.

2566
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:20,060
We were talking about that or whatever.

2567
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,060
The digitally descaled John Goodman's Hippocrite.

2568
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,060
That's the best one.

2569
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:26,060
This guy's 43. He looks 12.

2570
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,060
Andy Milanakis? Yeah.

2571
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:30,060
I don't know if that's, like, a disorder or disease,

2572
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,060
but something's going on with that boy.

2573
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,060
Oh my god.

2574
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:36,060
Maybe he'll just live forever as a child.

2575
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,060
Remember that little girl from Batman

2576
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:40,060
who was, like, trapped as a little girl's body?

2577
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,060
Yeah.

2578
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,060
It was a fucking sick episode.

2579
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,060
That's the finale of the Andy Milanakis show,

2580
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:48,060
where he's breaking down in the hall of mirrors

2581
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,060
and Batman has to console him.

2582
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,060
I hope he has that,

2583
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:54,060
you know, positive and ending.

2584
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:56,060
Being covered by Batman.

2585
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,060
In better ways.

2586
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,060
And then sent to the insane asylum.

2587
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,060
Well, it's only fair.

2588
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,060
Okay, we've got one final message.

2589
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:06,060
Okay, and this is...

2590
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,060
Okay, this is a strange cryptic VHS tape we received.

2591
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,060
This is a...

2592
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:12,060
It's the Lost Tapes Archive Number One

2593
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,060
Ben St.

2594
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:16,060
What could this be?

2595
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:18,060
I don't know.

2596
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,060
Oh god.

2597
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:22,060
Let's prepare ourselves our guests.

2598
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,060
Here we go.

2599
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,060
Hey.

2600
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,060
I'm gonna give you something.

2601
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:30,060
Remember that time

2602
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,060
you left this tape in my house?

2603
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,060
I've been warming it under my pillow.

2604
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,060
It smells like gas.

2605
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,060
It's our baby together.

2606
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,060
Let's take a listen.

2607
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:44,060
I'm the P to the E and

2608
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,060
S, A, I and T.

2609
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,060
I love real playing,

2610
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,060
analysis and our T.

2611
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:52,060
I'm Ben St.licious.

2612
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:54,060
Did I feel good for you?

2613
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,060
Tell you what, Ben.

2614
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,060
Ben St.

2615
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,060
I got something else to tell you.

2616
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:04,060
Every time I open my mouth

2617
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:06,060
a universe is created.

2618
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:12,060
What the fuck did that mean?

2619
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,060
Um...

2620
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,060
Was that Tara Strong?

2621
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,060
Did we get Tara Strong in?

2622
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,060
Was that Tara Strong?

2623
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:22,060
No, I'm pretty sure someone was just

2624
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:24,060
mimicking her.

2625
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:26,060
Oh my god.

2626
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,060
That was a flashback.

2627
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:30,060
Dude, I feel like I just got punched in the face.

2628
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,060
Yes. Remember that?

2629
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,060
Remember when Tara Strong did that shit?

2630
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:36,060
Yeah, I absolutely hate

2631
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,060
the wood smacking and the noises.

2632
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,060
Oh.

2633
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,060
It's a deeply unpleasant individual, but

2634
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,060
you know.

2635
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:46,060
Post in the comments if you're Ben St.licious.

2636
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,060
Oh my god.

2637
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,060
Did any of you see

2638
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:56,060
it's from a couple months ago

2639
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:58,060
it sort of

2640
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,060
kind of blew up online.

2641
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:02,060
The video of Tara Strong

2642
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:04,060
yelling at her Uber driver.

2643
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,060
No.

2644
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,060
I think it was kind of a scandal

2645
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,060
because they were arguing about Trump or some shit.

2646
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,060
I didn't watch it. I don't know what the fuck

2647
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,060
I'm talking about. I just fucking...

2648
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:16,060
I just remember it being a thing.

2649
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,060
People were mad at her because there was a video of her

2650
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,060
kind of like

2651
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,060
laying into some hapless Uber driver.

2652
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:24,060
Okay.

2653
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:26,060
I mean, I assume Tara Strong was

2654
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:28,060
the Trump,

2655
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:30,060
anti-Trump individual here and was just, I don't know,

2656
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,060
like maybe they were wearing like a Trump hat.

2657
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,060
You know what? I'll watch it later.

2658
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,060
It doesn't matter. It's stupid. I'm sorry

2659
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,060
to bring it up. Who cares? Fuck it.

2660
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,060
Throw it in the garbage.

2661
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,060
Tara, she's...

2662
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,060
God, Tara, that's not very...

2663
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,060
Or maybe it's very Twilight-licious of her.

2664
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,060
We never really determined what exactly

2665
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:50,060
Twilight-licious means.

2666
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,060
This driver was just too

2667
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:54,060
Magalicious, I guess.

2668
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,060
If you know what I'm...

2669
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:58,060
Oh, I hear you.

2670
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:00,060
Hey, man, I sure hope I can find

2671
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,060
a fucking SoundCloud download

2672
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,060
of that them snakes

2673
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,060
and rats.

2674
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:08,060
There's links. I got links.

2675
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:10,060
Yeah, give me links.

2676
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,060
I'll get to you after the thing.

2677
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,060
Maybe we'll put the fucking SoundCloud link

2678
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:16,060
in the actual description.

2679
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,060
It's just soundcloud.com

2680
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,060
slash the-pro-crastinators, I think.

2681
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:22,060
And actually, after the one hour span

2682
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,060
from when I uploaded these

2683
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:26,060
before we started the episode to like now

2684
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:28,060
or whatever, two hours or whatever,

2685
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:30,060
someone already commented on here,

2686
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,060
like, holy fuck, on that them snakes video

2687
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:34,060
on them snakes tracks. So clearly some people

2688
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:36,060
are trolling these

2689
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:38,060
archives. The SoundCloud.

2690
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:40,060
So that's cool.

2691
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:42,060
Yeah.

2692
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:44,060
I'm fucking...

2693
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,060
I'm running with that. Them snakes blew it out of the park

2694
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,060
and this Lost Tapes archive

2695
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:50,060
number one, Ben St, also blew it out of the park.

2696
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,060
And the problem was,

2697
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,060
we got another voicemail.

2698
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,060
Ben St content is just where it's at.

2699
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,060
There's a lot of Ben St content coming at us

2700
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:00,060
all at once, I guess.

2701
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,060
I like it to cease.

2702
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:04,060
They're all attacking

2703
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:06,060
when Ben's weak on the toilet, leaking water.

2704
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,060
They know this is their time to strike.

2705
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:10,060
It's the hair cut, I'm telling you.

2706
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:12,060
I did not receive such a warm welcome

2707
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:14,060
when I had a lack of being able to produce

2708
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:16,060
on the toilet, so maybe it's

2709
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:18,060
those who poop more, receive more

2710
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,060
in the voicemails, whereas

2711
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,060
my constipation extended

2712
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:24,060
to digital content being provided

2713
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:26,060
by others to me.

2714
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:28,060
Okay, anyway, that's it.

2715
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:30,060
Wait, I have a correction to make.

2716
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:32,060
Because I looked it up after I said it

2717
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,060
because I was unsure.

2718
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,060
Because I said that Def Jam

2719
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:38,060
was like bad

2720
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,060
and then Def Jam Vendetta was the sequel

2721
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:42,060
and it was better. I got it backwards.

2722
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:44,060
Def Jam Vendetta was the first one.

2723
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:46,060
Def Jam Fight for New York was the sequel.

2724
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:48,060
It was in fact

2725
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,060
Fight for New York. That was the superior cool game.

2726
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:52,060
And that's

2727
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:54,060
I didn't want to get called out as a phony,

2728
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,060
so I made sure.

2729
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:58,060
And so that's it.

2730
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:00,060
That's all I got to fucking say.

2731
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,060
And don't forget to fucking do it.

2732
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:04,060
Unfortunately, people will be writing

2733
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:06,060
the problem is, Jesse, people already wrote

2734
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,060
the comments.

2735
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,060
They're gonna make themselves a fool.

2736
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,060
That's true. Because now that I've addressed it

2737
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:14,060
already in the same podcast, it is they

2738
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:16,060
who will look like the fool. I am

2739
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,060
the fucking master of this game.

2740
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:20,060
I am the chess master.

2741
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,060
I am the two boys in Kingdom Hearts 3,

2742
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:24,060
the opening, playing backgammon.

2743
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,060
I am the smart guy.

2744
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,060
Remember when that guy,

2745
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:30,060
maybe he didn't get here yet, but there's a moment where

2746
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,060
they're playing a fucking chess game

2747
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:34,060
or something with rules, presumably.

2748
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:36,060
One just wins, and the other guy's

2749
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:38,060
like,

2750
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:40,060
you fell right into my trap, bro.

2751
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:42,060
And he just puts

2752
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:44,060
seven more things on.

2753
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:46,060
The guy's like, what are you doing?

2754
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,060
I just put seven more guys. That's how it works.

2755
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:50,060
Who are those characters?

2756
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:52,060
Do they come back?

2757
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,060
Because I looked them up in the glossary, and it just said

2758
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:56,060
white-haired boy and black-haired boy.

2759
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:58,060
So is this gonna be like a fucking

2760
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:00,060
lost thing where the whole

2761
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,060
Kingdom Hearts story is like their chess

2762
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,060
game, figuring out their candidates

2763
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,060
for something? No, it's

2764
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,060
a metaphor. You'll find out who they are later

2765
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:10,060
if you don't already know.

2766
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:12,060
I'll just tell you. Because if you're gonna

2767
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,060
rip off lost, just give up, because

2768
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,060
you'll never be as cool as

2769
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:18,060
lost.

2770
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:20,060
Okay, alright.

2771
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:22,060
I mean, it's super obvious, in my opinion,

2772
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:24,060
but okay, fair enough.

2773
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:26,060
Anyway, patreon.com

2774
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:28,060
slash the procrastinators people, we need

2775
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:30,060
your money. So please

2776
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,060
give it to us, and if you send us $5,

2777
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,060
you get all the bonus episodes,

2778
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,060
and I think there'll be one coming out

2779
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:38,060
tomorrow. But also, don't listen to

2780
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,060
that, because today's episode is brought to

2781
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,060
you by gofundme.com slash angels

2782
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,060
for Ivan.

2783
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:46,060
The guy got his face burned and his body burned.

2784
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:48,060
Help him out. Just

2785
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,060
be the hero, and just do both.

2786
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:52,060
Just do both. Yeah, we really appreciate that.

2787
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,060
They're equally good.

2788
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,060
What could be more good

2789
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,060
in supporting your favorite podcast?

2790
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,060
You know what's free though?

2791
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:02,060
Yeah. Hugging trees.

2792
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,060
Hugging trees.

2793
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:06,060
Spending some time in the woods. Yeah, exactly.

2794
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:08,060
Ugh, that's outside.

2795
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,060
Yeah, the trees.

2796
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:12,060
Follow our tree-related updates at

2797
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,060
tpcrastinators on Twitter for all your

2798
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:16,060
tree news. We're re-adjusting.

2799
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:18,060
This is our new brand, and

2800
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,060
I guess we'll see you next time. There's SpeakPipe,

2801
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,060
link down below in the description.

2802
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,060
Send us all your voicemails, people. Keep them coming.

2803
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:26,060
They're just getting better, and I'm loving

2804
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,060
what you people are doing so far.

2805
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,060
And we'll put a SoundCloud link there, probably, too,

2806
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,060
if you want to go listen to them, but, you know, whatever.

2807
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:34,060
Who gives a fuck? But anyway, that's it.

2808
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,060
Thanks for being here. We will see you next week.

2809
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:38,060
Bonus episodes soon. Have a beautiful day

2810
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:40,060
and a wonderful life. Bye!

2811
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:42,060
Yeah! Bye!

2812
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,060
Goodbye!
