1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
I'm going to bless that guy that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,160
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,160
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,160
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
Son of a bitch.

11
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
Son of a bitch.

12
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
One, two...

13
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Leave that in.

14
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
One, two, three, sync.

15
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
One, two, three, sync.

16
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,400
Hello, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
It's Sunday, the 10?

18
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,880
No, it's Friday.

19
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,760
12.

20
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,120
I'm Ben Saint and Gibbontake is here.

21
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
I'm here.

22
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
That's true.

23
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,120
What's going on, Gibb?

24
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Well...

25
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,640
What's been going on?

26
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:53,800
Well, you know, I've been looking up and looking down, and I just haven't seen anything really.

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,680
It's sort of like the week sort of flew by and nothing happened at all.

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
That is so relatable.

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,920
I, too, have had my head buried deep in the sand.

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,120
You know, Talbart.

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Yeah.

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:19,440
I found his Twitter has another Twitter linked that I guess is the guy that runs it.

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,360
This guy, Peanards, and I guess he doesn't really tweet that much.

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,880
His last tweet was like a year ago.

35
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,440
All right, he tweets like, but he did a couple of funny tweets like a year ago, or no, it

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,200
was only like a month or two ago.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,600
Never mind.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,800
One of them was like, here, I'll just read it right now.

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,440
I was looking at them and they were really funny.

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,400
No, where was it?

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,360
No, where was it?

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
I can't find it.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,640
Gibb, I'm just really sorry.

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,400
My bit failed.

45
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
Yet more mysteries.

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,480
Yet more drama.

47
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,600
The drama of the missing tweet.

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,720
No, it was a really funny tweet about like role playing as an ostrich and putting your

49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,600
head in the ground.

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
No.

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Hang on.

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm going to hit at Peanard.

53
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm going to use the Twitter search function ostrich.

54
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
Come on.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Here we go.

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,720
December 16th, 2022.

57
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,800
All you care about is your stupid ostrich role play bullshit.

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm not listening.

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm bent over.

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,600
My head buried in six inches of sand, completely dead by suffocation.

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
One retweet.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
One retweet.

63
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,600
32 likes.

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,760
This is Talbart.

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,600
This is Talbart's material before he started chopping up Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan.

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,840
Well, I've been big mad this week, as you know.

67
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:59,240
I've been big mad this week about some stuff, about some old PCP stuff, and I'm cooled off

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
from it.

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,600
And I got to say, I was very unhelpful.

70
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,640
It was very pointless.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:15,600
As usual, it was very pointless and foolish and maybe a little embarrassing to be big

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
mad on the internet.

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,840
It is.

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,840
And that's how it goes.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,040
Do you want me to briefly summarize?

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:39,480
Well, it's a blood feud between you and Jesse over, I don't know.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Yeah.

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Basically, okay, it boils down to basically nothing.

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,840
It was pretty much just me getting mad.

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
All right.

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,240
We were basically done with the Radcon stuff, right?

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Everything was done.

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,040
Nate, I don't know if we've even said this on the show yet, but Nate actually finished

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
the OVA.

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,200
It's actually done, and we have it.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,520
And it's uploaded, it's just not published yet.

87
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,240
We could literally be watching it right now.

88
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,320
So it was like, wow, we're done.

89
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,160
And then Jesse, at the very last minute, said, hey guys, I got to claim my gas costs.

90
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,080
I paid for gas to get there.

91
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,720
Reimbursed my gas.

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:27,480
Oh, oops, looks like I have to get my girlfriend to get a letter in the mail from her bank

93
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,600
to prove the cost of a hotel stay or something.

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
And that's going to be, it's going to be another business week before I can get that

95
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
to you.

96
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Sorry.

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
And that, you know, it held it up for a week.

98
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,280
And you know, this did make me really mad, and I do think it's bullshit, but I did kind

99
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,280
of blow up and go ballistic and say, you're lying, there's no, it's all fake.

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,240
There are, this is just, this is just a time buying ploy.

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,040
This is, this is just a scheme.

102
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,880
This is a, this is a trick that you're pulling.

103
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
I did, I did say all that.

104
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,240
It turned out not to be true.

105
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
It turned out to be the case.

106
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Yeah.

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,880
But you know what, I don't know.

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't know.

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,240
No, you should have said, I wouldn't change a thing.

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,520
I wouldn't change a thing.

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
No, listen.

112
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have missed it for the world or some stupid thing like

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
that.

114
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,320
Wouldn't have missed, the, the, the, I mean, listen, here's the thing, you know, yeah,

115
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,160
I guess it turned out that the receipts weren't fake, but you know, they could have been

116
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
and that's what's so scary.

117
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,400
That says a lot about society that it could, it could have been true.

118
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,840
I don't need to, to like you about it.

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
No.

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,440
You seem to understand that what you were doing was a bit silly, but like over the top.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Um, yeah.

122
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,160
In the end, there was nothing to be gained by complaining and definitely nothing to be

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,500
gained by, uh, um, throwing, throwing around out allegations.

124
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,920
So you know, whatever, uh, def, did I need to post about it on Twitter?

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,040
No, definitely didn't need to do that.

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,200
I forgot, I forgot one of Nate, Nate bought me, uh, I think I've mentioned that Nate bought

127
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,840
me George Washington's rules of etiquette.

128
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,920
It's a little red book that has like, it's kind of bullshit.

129
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Actually, cause it's, it's not like he like swore by these rules.

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
It's just like when he was a kid, when he was like 14, he read a bunch of books about

131
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,880
etiquette and he just like took notes and he wrote down a bunch of rules in like a notebook.

132
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,920
And this is just like those notes that he wrote down.

133
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,040
So he didn't even come up with them.

134
00:06:50,040 --> 00:07:01,480
But um, one of them is like, uh, what, what is it, speak, speak not of, um, speak not

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,800
evil of those who are not present for it is unjust.

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:14,600
And uh, you know, the thing about it is even if everything I said, I mean, okay, hang on.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,760
Not to backpedal, but I didn't, I didn't, I didn't lie.

138
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,920
I didn't lie on Twitter.

139
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I didn't, I know that what I was accusing Jesse of turned out not to be true, but I

140
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,000
didn't lie and make false allegations.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,360
All I said was that, was that I was not beat was that, was that there was, there was whatever.

142
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,880
I mean, what you said implied that there was something happening and because people didn't,

143
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,920
people did not have the full context of the conversation.

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,800
They read your tweet and I was like, oh, I guess Jesse's the bad guy.

145
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,840
I guess Jesse is like, this is confirmed because you're, you're saying it.

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,520
Well, all right.

147
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
He wouldn't, he wouldn't, he wouldn't show me the proof.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,920
He said he had proof.

149
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,120
He wouldn't show me the proof.

150
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,840
He did that not because he didn't have the proof.

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,440
He did that to make me mad.

152
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,160
And you know what?

153
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,880
It worked.

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,680
He got me.

155
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
He freaking got me.

156
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
I got mad on the internet.

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,840
Um, yep.

158
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,880
Anyway, anyway, uh, whatever.

159
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,880
But even, even, even if everything that I said he was doing turned out to be true,

160
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,760
it would still have been a pretty ugly look.

161
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,320
It's a pretty ugly look to go to Twitter about it.

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,160
So, you know, I don't know.

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,520
Sorry.

164
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,840
Uh, that's all, I guess that's all I have to say.

165
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Did you apologize to Jesse?

166
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,120
No.

167
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,000
Could you do that?

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,320
No.

169
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
Come on.

170
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
No, no.

171
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,880
Do a little, do a little DM.

172
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,240
Do a little, I'm sorry.

173
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm, I actually, I actually won't do that.

174
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,960
I actually will not do that.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,680
Thanks for listening to the pro Christmas podcast, everybody.

176
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,200
Uh, I don't, I don't care what Jesse thinks.

177
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,960
I don't, I don't care if he's mad at me or, or if I was unjust.

178
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm not, I'm not sorry for his sake.

179
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
I'm sorry for my sake.

180
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,560
And, uh, I guess anyone who, uh, was annoyed by me,

181
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,360
that's, yeah, that's it.

182
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
I don't, I don't like Jesse.

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,040
I have not liked Jesse for years.

184
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,920
I don't care if the bridge is burned a good riddance,

185
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,960
but that's not an excuse to be, to be a punk about it.

186
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,000
So, so that's what I have to say about that.

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,520
Um, anyway, just want to get out ahead of that

188
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
because there were a bunch of comments being like,

189
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,280
can't wait to hear Ben rage on the next podcast.

190
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
And then I'm over it.

191
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm over my rage.

192
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Sorry.

193
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,800
If you want to hear me rage, you can go and listen to my

194
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,760
ranting on a Twitch about it, uh, uh, the last couple of streams that I did,

195
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,000
which, um, my stream viewership is up by the way.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
My streams were doing pretty well.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,560
It might be, it might be, it might be because I've been ranting and raving about that lately,

198
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,240
or it might also be because I'm playing battle network

199
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,560
and the freaking battle network collection is coming out.

200
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,200
And I guess that's like in the news, it might be boosting my numbers as well.

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,280
The last stream I did was like,

202
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,760
it was at like the same viewership as like I used to get back in like 2019

203
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,520
when I was, uh, you know, when I had a little thing going.

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,040
So that was cool.

205
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,320
Yeah.

206
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,760
Be nice if that would keep up.

207
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,680
Guess we'll see.

208
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,320
It might be, might also be because I've been very regular about my schedule.

209
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,920
I've been keeping to the Monday, Friday evenings thing.

210
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
So people know where to find me.

211
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,120
That's pretty cool.

212
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,080
Uh, yeah, I guess that's pretty cool.

213
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,640
Yeah.

214
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,680
Do you think that's pretty cool?

215
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,920
Would you, would you, I think it's pretty neat.

216
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,720
I mixed out at 12 viewers last stream.

217
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:12,680
I was getting about like the, the first couple streams I did for a few weeks there,

218
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I was getting maybe like 20.

219
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,600
I was maybe hitting like the mid 20s.

220
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,640
And then the last one I did, I was up at like, uh, I think I almost hit six.

221
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
And I think it did briefly hit 60.

222
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,800
I was like, sure, sure.

223
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,960
Nice.

224
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm wondering if, if my streams, because I changed, uh, the timing people saying,

225
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,880
oh, it's too early to do a stream.

226
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,920
You've like, I appeared as soon as it was over.

227
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,520
So I did the stream later and I got exactly the same number of people,

228
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,200
but different people, something maybe.

229
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,560
So I guess Saturday is potentially not a good day to do it.

230
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,280
Or nobody cares about a little old cab or fire emblem.

231
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,280
I mean, I can't speak to what people think about fire emblem.

232
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
Saturday, I don't know.

233
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,800
Saturday evening seems just as good as Friday evening.

234
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,320
I actually was, I'm not really sure whether I think that like weekdays or weekends

235
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,360
are better.

236
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,800
I think different people watch Twitch on those two different kinds of days for different reasons.

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:28,840
Yeah.

238
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,840
Some people watch a stream because the job is boring and they don't need to work.

239
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,400
Yeah.

240
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,840
So they're just like, ah, fuck it.

241
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm just sitting there.

242
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,120
I think a bunch of people have told me like, yeah, I'm watching this at work.

243
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,880
Like, yeah, this is, this is getting me through the work day or whatever.

244
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,600
Maybe I could move it into some part of the week.

245
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't know, the viewers aren't at the point, but it's nice to get viewers.

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,840
Are you streaming, do you do it once a week?

247
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,640
Just once, yeah.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,480
Yeah.

249
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,200
I think I used to do it once a week, back in 2019 or so.

250
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,920
And I think now, I don't know, I'm doing two a week now, and it seems to be good.

251
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,840
And I'm trying to keep my, I kept the last one to three hours.

252
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,560
I started getting like cramps in my abdomen around three hours.

253
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,160
And I was like, I'm going to take this as a sign from God to cut it at the three hour mark

254
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,480
before my average viewer number dips.

255
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,840
Abdomen?

256
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,840
Like from sitting?

257
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,840
Like in my guts.

258
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,080
I don't, yeah, I just started, I don't know, I started getting like cramps in my guts.

259
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm not, I'm not sure why they actually like went away right after I stopped streaming.

260
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,160
So maybe you were tensing that muscle.

261
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,880
When you were looking at Mega Man.

262
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Maybe it was, maybe it was Twitch chats.

263
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
It was Twitch chats fault.

264
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Well, I got to the part in Battle Network 2 where you go to the place where the poor and

265
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,400
the minorities live.

266
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,840
So I was probably really on edge because I was going through a bad part of town.

267
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,200
Yeah, I was watching that part.

268
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, the basically, the, the, the geography is pretty unclear.

269
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm pretty sure I am from a town called AC DC in a, which is like a, a suburb of a city

270
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,720
called Denden City, which is in a country called Electopia, which is sort of Japan.

271
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,400
And I have just, and I have traveled to, there's another place called Yumland that I have not

272
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,120
been to yet.

273
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,840
And I don't know what that's like, but I'm in another place, another country now called

274
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,560
Netopia and Netopia is just America.

275
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,520
It's America, but some people have French accents.

276
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,240
So I guess it's just like a general.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
It's just, it's the West.

278
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,800
There's French people.

280
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,000
There's, there's medieval castles and, and there's, and there's like back alley slums.

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,720
So, you know, it's got, it's, it's truly, it's truly got it all.

282
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:16,040
Well, yeah, I haven't got much to say about the story in Fire Emblem.

283
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,000
It's almost, it's almost non-existent.

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,440
It's just sort of like you go from one map to the other and they give you a brief,

285
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,880
like a paragraph or a sentence as to what's going on.

286
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh, I missed your stream yesterday, didn't I?

287
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah.

288
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,800
Where were you, huh?

289
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,240
I was, well, I was lifting, but that was like later.

290
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,560
So I was lifting for 24 hours straight.

291
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,440
Yeah, I was, I was, I lifted in the evening.

292
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,160
Ah, yeah.

293
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,480
And I, that was, so those were my evening plans was to lift.

294
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,720
I probably, I probably could have checked in around.

295
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,680
Maybe that's why.

296
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,360
Maybe that's why it was only a few people.

297
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,080
Everyone was lifting.

298
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,040
Everyone was lifting.

299
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,320
Everyone was lifting.

300
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,560
Yeah.

301
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
When she called me scrawny.

302
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
Can you fucking believe that shit?

303
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,280
Well, I'm trying to remember what did you lost

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,040
when I last saw you?

305
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,760
What were you like?

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,200
Because you weren't fat Ben at that point.

307
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I don't know if you'd been lifting for a while.

308
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
I, no, I had not.

309
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,800
That was like, that was like about a year ago, right?

310
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,280
The last time that was, yeah, last summer.

311
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,040
No, you were here, no.

312
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,320
2022 summer.

313
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,920
No, I, it was, I thought the last time you were here was when I was prepared.

314
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,400
It was when you got COVID, right?

315
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,640
Yeah.

316
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,600
That was in the summer.

317
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,280
We went to the beach.

318
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,120
What?

319
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,480
Well, I don't know.

320
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,040
I don't think you went to the beach, but like it was hot.

321
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,400
It was hot and we went to the beach.

322
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
And we did some beach things.

323
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,640
It was like, like off because Munchie was off uni.

324
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,520
Am I smoking crack?

325
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,040
I thought for sure that when you were, you got COVID

326
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,960
and that prevented me from doing the live Mega Man lecture.

327
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,280
True.

328
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,840
And that, and that was in like, I thought that was in like February.

329
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:13,480
No, that, I wasn't, it was all, it all happened in, in one big time

330
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,960
because I only got the COVID, I only came over and got COVID once

331
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,040
and that was when I was staying during the summer

332
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,360
because I remember it being really hot some nights.

333
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,000
Needy that, that Erecon going.

334
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,240
And then because I got COVID, I had to stay isolated for about a week

335
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,120
and then I hung out for a little time after that.

336
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,880
That's so funny.

337
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,360
I remember one of the last things that happened was we got like,

338
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,400
we went to that like waffle ice cream.

339
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,880
What was it?

340
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,240
Is there some sort of confectioner?

341
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,080
Yeah, the waffle pop place.

342
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah.

343
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
And we got a thing and we were walking.

344
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,680
And we were walking here.

345
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,520
We were walking down the old dusty trail.

346
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,320
I'm so confused.

347
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,000
I really thought that was in like March.

348
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,400
Wow.

349
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,280
Time, time is funny.

350
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,080
All right.

351
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,520
Because then it was like after that, it was, it was, you were trying to figure out how to do

352
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,760
the Mega Man thing by yourself instead of in front of a group.

353
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,440
And that took basically like a few months.

354
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,200
Well, it took, it took a few months to play all the games.

355
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,520
But you got that by that point, right?

356
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,320
You had played all, no, you hadn't played all games.

357
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,480
I was going to deliver the lecture without having played any of the games or most of the games.

358
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,560
And then, but I recorded the lecture at the end of August because I remember that was like,

359
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,200
I moved like literally the next day.

360
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,720
So it was the end of August.

361
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,840
And I thought it took me like three or four months to play through the game.

362
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,720
So August, what's before August, July, June, was it in like May or June?

363
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,640
I fucking maybe, did I, did I, did I blast through every Mega Man game in like two months?

364
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,720
Probably crazy.

365
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,200
I remember, all I remember was it was, it was hot.

366
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,760
It was like a hot time.

367
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,400
Maybe, yeah, you know what, you know, maybe you're right.

368
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah.

369
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:13,960
Okay.

370
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,000
Damn.

371
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,320
I thought that was longer ago.

372
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,960
That's crazy.

373
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,480
That means I thought it had been a year since then, but it's only been like eight months.

374
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,360
To all 10 months.

375
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,920
Well, no, about like eight, no, like eight months.

376
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,840
That's so weird.

377
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Usually these days when I remember things, they happened much longer ago than I think they happened.

378
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,040
What the fuck?

379
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,920
Explain, explain this shit to me.

380
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,320
Sorry.

381
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,200
Um, okay, well that, well that was a tangent.

382
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,640
Could it have been like really warm in March or something?

383
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, it might, it might have been unseasonably warm in like May.

384
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,400
I could look, I could look through Discord things to be like,

385
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,480
this is the 10th account about it.

386
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,920
Uh, yeah, whatever.

387
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,280
No, that, that, no, I guess that, that makes sense.

388
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,440
Yeah, it's probably, it was probably like May or June.

389
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,440
Yeah, whatever.

390
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,840
Cool.

391
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,240
Okay.

392
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,360
I believe it.

393
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,560
I'm just fucked up.

394
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,320
I'm just, I'm just so, I'm just, maybe I'm confusing it with when you were there for

395
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,720
New Year's because we're, because you're there for New Year's, right?

396
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,240
And then you were there again that summer.

397
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,640
Was I there for New Year's?

398
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
No, I don't think I was.

399
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,440
I think I was invited.

400
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,360
I think, was that like a big group of people?

401
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,240
I think, oh wait, there was a big group of people.

402
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,560
Some people came for New Year's and then you didn't, you didn't come, you didn't

403
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,280
end up coming.

404
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,240
And I think it was because there were, someone rescheduled or something happened to change

405
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,520
the schedule and you were like, you were gonna come, oh, you didn't come because like COVID

406
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
restrictions, right?

407
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,840
Yeah, there was a time I was going to come and it was going to be early in the year,

408
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,720
but I couldn't come because somebody in my family got COVID, like they tested positive.

409
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,200
The day, the day that I was supposed to fly.

410
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,320
So it was like, you don't know that you're safe.

411
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,040
So I had to, we all had to isolate and stuff.

412
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,880
So I had to change, I had to cancel that or like reschedule it for

413
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
summer of the same year.

414
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,160
And then it was a summer party and I bought that summer hat, which I still have,

415
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,920
which I like, and I'm going to be using soon when the fucking sun comes back.

416
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,720
Well, thank you for, thank you for helping me to reconstruct my shattered memories,

417
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
my chain of memories.

418
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
Just like Kingdom Hearts.

419
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,760
Just like Kingdom Hearts.

420
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

421
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,040
How did I, oh, anyway, Munchy called me scrawny.

422
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,080
All that's the same.

423
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,920
I would have been, yeah, I don't think I had been lifting basically at all for like almost a year

424
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,560
or at least six months or so the last time you were here.

425
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,720
Uh, now I weigh about the same, but I'm ripped.

426
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,400
It's not true.

427
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm only a little bit strong.

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,360
That's why I'm scrawny.

429
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,200
So it's larger your muscles, the less time you spend on Twitter.

430
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,760
It's just not no correlation, just sort of like a funny coincidence.

431
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,600
Not to, with the less my muscles, the less on Twitter or the, or is it like,

432
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,960
as one goes up, the other goes down.

433
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,560
As muscles go up, Twitter usage goes down.

434
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,240
Yeah, maybe so.

435
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,160
Maybe that means I got to get huge.

436
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,160
Munchy is, it's funny.

437
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:35,080
Munchy is like, Munchy's bench press is already, you know, he's done a lot less

438
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,840
lifting than me in life.

439
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,440
So he's, compared to me at it, he's a bit of a noob on his technique and things like that.

440
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,800
Nevertheless, his bench press is already like almost the same as mine.

441
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,160
It's just because he's bigger, which is, you know, that's, that's, that's just life,

442
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,720
I guess.

443
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,400
However, his squat is terrible.

444
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,240
And he has actually like injured himself several times while squatting and had to

445
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,680
like stop squatting because he got like, he like pulled an adductor or something.

446
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,280
So his squat is, is minuscule, but his bench press is threatening.

447
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,880
So, you know,

448
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,800
I think I did some workouts in that, that basement.

449
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,960
On the rack?

450
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,640
Yeah, I used the thing, but I couldn't.

451
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,240
Yeah, the power rack.

452
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,320
I couldn't lift the bar with anything on it.

453
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,400
I could only use the bar and only just.

454
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,720
What lift, were you trying to squat it?

455
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,440
I was, I was, I was just doing what they were doing.

456
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,520
So I was doing a curl and then I did a bench press.

457
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,320
Yeah.

458
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,560
And I don't, I don't think I did a squat yet to put that like

459
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
behind your back.

460
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,800
Yeah, on your shoulders, cringe.

461
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,480
That's literally the most important one.

462
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,560
Literally, literally the most important one.

463
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,800
I did that with the smaller weights, with the hand weights.

464
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh, hand dumbbells, dumbbell squats, disgusting.

465
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,000
That's, I was, I was doing some, some weightlifting tourism.

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,680
I wasn't really interested.

467
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,000
At least you're not one of those perverts that squats with the bar on their back,

468
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,240
but they put the fricking like roll pad on the bar to like, ooh, cushion it.

469
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,800
Ooh, I'll put the little cushion on the bar because I'm such a fucking idiot

470
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,080
that I rested on my fricking.

471
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,320
Cushion.

472
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,400
Wouldn't that just make it slip?

473
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,040
Well, there's, sometimes in the squat rack, you see a little circular,

474
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,760
it's like, it's like a Velcro round little cushion that you can sort of

475
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,200
like Velcro on to the center of the bar to like rest it on the back of your neck.

476
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,720
The thing about that is that.

477
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,640
All I'm thinking of is if it's not perfectly fixed to the bar,

478
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,400
then it would rotate, it would rotate and then it would slide down your back,

479
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,800
wouldn't it?

480
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,560
Well, there's like potential, that's all I'm asking.

481
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,480
Yeah, I see, I see what you mean.

482
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,840
I mean, it really shouldn't do that.

483
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,720
But the thing about it is you really don't need it,

484
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,760
because if you're squatting correctly, the bar is not, you know,

485
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,440
you got the little like, I don't know what it's called,

486
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
the little bone bulge on the back of your neck.

487
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,360
It gets it's a vertebra.

488
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,760
A shoulder pad.

489
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,200
No, no, no, on the neck, on the neck.

490
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,520
Yeah, I don't know.

491
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,560
I don't know bones.

492
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,840
You can feel the vertebra of your, of like the back of your neck.

493
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,160
Like if you're a freaking, yeah, if you're an idiot,

494
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,160
then yeah, it would be really uncomfortable to have the bar rest on your vertebra.

495
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,320
But you're not supposed to do that.

496
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,800
It should be on your shoulders.

497
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,240
It should be resting on your shoulders.

498
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
On your shoulder blades, that's the word.

499
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,480
Right, but no, not on the blades.

500
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,880
Like on the, on the, on the, on the divot between the trapezius and the,

501
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,520
whatever the shoulder muscle is called.

502
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,800
Oh, the trapezius.

503
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,480
Yes, the traps.

504
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,120
No, that's why they're called traps.

505
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,640
No relation, no relation.

506
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:50,840
Okay.

507
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,360
The trap is the big, well here, let's let's examine, let's examine.

508
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,400
Wait, is that, is that why they're called traps?

509
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,120
What, you mean boys?

510
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,560
I mean girls?

511
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,360
No.

512
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,720
Oh.

513
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:15,800
The, the, the like neck muscles, I've heard them refer to as traps,

514
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,400
like the big neck muscles when like Goku has one big one.

515
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it's the trapezius.

516
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,800
It's the trapezi, I think it's the trapezius dorsi.

517
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,240
Wow.

518
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,440
Or no, it's just the trapezius.

519
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,200
I never really thought about it that they would have a real name.

520
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,000
If you can believe it, they really do.

521
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,160
Like pecs or pectorals, like duh.

522
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,360
Right, so anyway, what was I talking about?

523
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,880
Here's, here's the view, the deltoid, right?

524
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,240
If you, if you squat correctly, the bar is resting on the divot between the trapezius

525
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,360
and the deltoid.

526
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,760
It's not resting on, on the bones of the neck.

527
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,840
So you really don't need that cushion.

528
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,960
What if you have a fucked up weird neck?

529
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:05,480
Uh, well, gosh, I mean, I guess if it's, I don't know, I mean, how fucked up are we talking?

530
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,960
Well, I guess I'm thinking of like, like Gamerneck, like it's going forward.

531
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
I got a bad case of Gamerneck.

532
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,280
Where it's like going, like leaning forwards a lot.

533
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,680
But that would get it further out of the way.

534
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,800
So it'll be like some sort of anti Gamerneck where you're like, your neck comes back.

535
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,920
I think maybe, maybe if you're really stiff and you have a bad range of motion,

536
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,880
it might be difficult to get it in the proper position resting on the deltoids.

537
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,040
I think a little bit of stretching and a little bit of practice would limber almost

538
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,080
anyone up to the point that it would, uh, that it would rest.

539
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,600
I mean, I mean, proper squat form takes practice.

540
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,440
It's, it's, it's a, it's a fairly, it's a fairly complex, complicated movement to do.

541
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,880
And you sort of just have to practice it and practice it until you get the form right.

542
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,000
So, yeah, but once you figure it out, the point is you don't need that pad if you're

543
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,960
doing it correctly.

544
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,440
But anyway, the reason I bring this all up, I don't know, I've started, I've started cycling

545
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,160
creatine. I've started doing that again in the hopes of, uh, becoming huge once more.

546
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,480
Once upon a time I was huge. It wasn't that huge, but I was dead.

547
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,960
I, I deadlifted 300 a couple of years ago and that's my goal again.

548
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,160
I'd like to deadlift 300.

549
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,960
I'm actually almost there.

550
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm at like 275.

551
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,480
So, but I'm sort of installing on my squad.

552
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,560
I've been stalling on my squad at like 220.

553
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,480
So, you know, I'm going to start cycling creatine again and hopefully blast,

554
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,320
blast past the plateau and become my best self.

555
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,480
The strong, I'll be the, I'll be the cutest and the strongest.

556
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,400
That's my goal.

557
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,560
I've completely stopped exercising or moving at all.

558
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,960
Idiot.

559
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,280
Idiot.

560
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,680
It's, I would die.

561
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Uh, you know, I mean, I will.

562
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,440
This is not, this is not, this is not life.

563
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,040
This is gradual death.

564
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,400
That's you.

565
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,800
That's, that's, that's Osho talking to you right now.

566
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,760
Oh, I love Osho.

567
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,200
Waste, waste in a way.

568
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,120
Do you know, do you know what I'm talking about?

569
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,960
I know from, and I learned about it from the red letter media episode where they

570
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,640
do a video of his.

571
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,360
Well, there's, um,

572
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,440
And he's like a, he's a, he's a cult leader.

573
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,720
Um, insane boy.

574
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,440
He's, he's like, I don't know whether he's insane, but he's just like very good at

575
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,080
manipulating people to believe his bullshit.

576
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,840
And he did it.

577
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,400
That's actually the, yeah, that one they're talking about in that one is

578
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,040
actually the same, it's the Rajneesh Purim cult that, uh, there's a down the

579
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,840
rabbit hole about the same, the same thing.

580
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,640
It's the same dudes.

581
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,440
Lamal.

582
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,720
And I guess there's also a documentary.

583
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,200
I think those guys, the red letter media guys knew about it because of a

584
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,000
documentary I know about it because of down the rabbit hole.

585
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,240
Also a documentary.

586
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,040
That honestly, uh, uh, Nuds Frederick Knudsen probably knew about it because of the

587
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,680
documentary.

588
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,560
Yeah, I need to get back into doing anything.

589
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,640
It's just been, when it's, when it's so cold, when it's so chilly, I mean, it's not

590
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
so much chilly anymore.

591
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,200
But yeah, all I wanted to do is wrap it in a blanket and sit on my chair.

592
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:40,280
I'm really happy that, um, the guys over at, um, what I will call Munchie House,

593
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,960
decided to get back into lifting with me.

594
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I don't think I would have the willpower to do it by myself.

595
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,000
Also, it's kind of dangerous to do it by yourself.

596
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,480
Oh yeah.

597
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,640
So I don't know, I was really happy that those guys, I think maybe like, maybe like

598
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,120
four months ago or something, we're like, we want to get back into it.

599
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,160
And I was like, hell yeah, I'm in.

600
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,520
You son of a bitch.

601
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,560
You son of a, and we've been, we've been pretty consistent about it, uh, for a while now.

602
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,480
And that feels really good.

603
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,360
And I'm really, uh, you know, I like that.

604
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:23,640
If I had, I think they, if they have to move, I'm, there's, I have a basement.

605
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,200
They have a really nice basement that has a lot of room and a lot of like ceiling space.

606
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,000
You've, you've been there.

607
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:29,800
Yeah.

608
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,720
Um, if they have to move, I might be able to move the rack.

609
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,640
I have space in my basement, but the ceiling is low.

610
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,600
So I think I could fit the rack there.

611
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,440
You know, it would probably be fine.

612
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,160
I would just have to do like sitting overhead presses, which is acceptable.

613
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,920
You have to dig a hole to stand in if you wanted to lift it up.

614
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:58,120
Well, at my old place at monkey house, uh, I deadlifted so hard that I crushed the concrete

615
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,360
under the, under the bars.

616
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,440
So when I would deadlift, like the, the, the plates would be sitting in like two

617
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,840
like crushed divots of like pulverized concrete.

618
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,360
Like you mean you dropped it afterwards?

619
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,520
Uh, I didn't like full on like drop it like freehand, but I did sort of like,

620
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,400
you know, I would, I would pretty much like hit it.

621
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,000
It would hit the ground pretty hard.

622
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,480
And yeah, eventually I cracked the ground and like it pulverized some of the,

623
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,640
some of the floor, whatever.

624
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,920
It's cheap.

625
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,560
I told, I told the guys I would, uh, I would patch it with like a patching putty.

626
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,040
Never did.

627
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,560
Just moved out.

628
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,480
Left the damage.

629
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,840
Lemau.

630
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,680
Um, moving that rack was such a nightmare.

631
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,720
It was like a whole, it added a whole other step to like the moving process,

632
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,520
but it was worth it because now I'm strong.

633
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,720
What do you, what do you think about that?

634
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,680
I don't know.

635
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,240
I don't need to see it till we believe it.

636
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,800
That's right.

637
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I am for, I look, I look pretty much the same.

638
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,680
Uh, I look pretty much the same.

639
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,760
Maybe I look a little bit more cut.

640
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't know.

641
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,960
I haven't like a lot.

642
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,080
I would have to like, I would have to like lose a bunch of weight.

643
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,440
If I like, I might look a little bit good.

644
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,760
If I cut like 20 pounds, I might, you might, I might be a little more noticeably

645
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,760
muscular than maybe I would have been to ever months ago, but like, I'm not going to do that.

646
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:38,040
I think I want to focus on getting huge for a while more until I start to feel like,

647
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,080
I don't know, until I feel like, wow, I'm actually a little bit ripped.

648
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,880
And maybe then I'll cut, maybe then I'll, I'll focus on cutting fat and becoming,

649
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,360
becoming cut like a diamond, shredded.

650
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,880
That's the goal.

651
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,760
I don't, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not ripped enough yet that I need,

652
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,840
want to be like, all right, time to cut, time to cut the fat and show these gains.

653
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,160
But soon, very soon.

654
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,640
You want to get abs that you could grate cheese with?

655
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,240
I mean, that'd be cool.

656
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,840
At the very least.

657
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,040
You don't even need to buy a grater.

658
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,920
It saves money.

659
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,760
Like to have huge shoulders.

660
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,720
Big, big, big bulgy shoulders are cool.

661
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,920
I have kind of bulgy shoulders.

662
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,160
I have kind of a wide shoulder pads.

663
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,960
I have kind of like a wide frame and like wide shoulders.

664
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,800
So I think it might be, I don't know, I think maybe to enhance my natural physique,

665
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,200
a big, big shoulders would be like, yeah.

666
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,520
Just lean into it.

667
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,280
Just lean into what's, what's already, what you've already got going on.

668
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,320
So, you know, that's the plan.

669
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,920
That's the plan.

670
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,120
Speaking of the plan, the perfect comic party last week.

671
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,600
Yeah.

672
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,360
Oh, I, I spent some time.

673
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,320
I made a little logo, I guess it's basically done.

674
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,040
You showed me the logo and I told you, I don't, I mean, I think I expressed to you

675
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,840
how much I liked it.

676
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,000
Let me just express, I love, I love it.

677
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,680
I love how it looks.

678
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,080
Thank you.

679
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,280
I can't wait to put it.

680
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,040
I want to put it, if you, if you have like a high res version,

681
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,640
I'd like to put it on the website and I, and I'd like to like maybe make it then,

682
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,680
well, maybe not yet, but soon make it the new channel icon.

683
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,200
I'm going to put it on the Patreon and stuff.

684
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,760
The website is live.

685
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:34,520
I figured it out if you, now, right now, if you go to perfectcomicparty.com,

686
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,520
it redirects you to the procrastinatorspodcast.com.

687
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,760
And the procrastinatorspodcast.com shows the new, the new website, which, I mean, it's not,

688
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,320
you know, and it's got most of the episodes.

689
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,120
It's got a lot of the episodes uploaded for download.

690
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,320
I'm working on getting them all up there.

691
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,880
It does not have, there's a stuff page that has links to the Dojan and Road to Radcon.

692
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,400
That stuff's not actually there yet.

693
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,000
It's just like a blank download link, but it will be there soon.

694
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:19,240
And I haven't actually looked to the site yet, but yeah, looking at all these text on the gradient.

695
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,440
It's, you know, it's pretty, you know, it's, it's a, it's a website written in HTML.

696
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,440
Yeah, let me, let me, let me look at it.

697
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
Let's, let's, let's throw up a screenshot.

698
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,120
I've never seen, I've never seen like a list in text, all of the PCP episodes.

699
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,880
Oh yeah.

700
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Like scrolling through history right now.

701
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,560
It's, I think I want to, somebody in a, in a comment suggested, yeah, when you go to the,

702
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:58,840
the archive list, you see all the episodes, all, there must be like 400 mp3s on here.

703
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,040
Um, if you go all the way down.

704
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,080
Oh, so it just opens a download link, okay.

705
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,600
Uh, let's, let me, well, well, some of these are not actually here.

706
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:21,000
If you go to maybe, okay, that one does, and yeah, it, yeah, it just downloads the mp3.

707
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,840
Um, but anyway, what was I saying?

708
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,280
Uh, shit, I was going to make a point about something, but it's gone.

709
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,920
Uh, the new website, it's got text on it.

710
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,080
Oh, I want to put the logo, I want to put the logo up top.

711
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,080
Yes, well, I think, I guess I can, I don't know if I was totally finished or.

712
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,800
Okay, okay, okay.

713
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,760
I think I was though, I, I did like, I did, I added the, I added the,

714
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,480
I can give you the Photoshop or the Clip Studio.

715
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,400
Do you have, do you have Clip Studio?

716
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,960
Well, I use Manga Studio, which is like supposedly the same program.

717
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,880
So it might work.

718
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,240
Okay.

719
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:09,880
I, otherwise I can send you a Photoshop with all the layers and you can move them around and stuff.

720
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,480
Uh, I, I mean, I do want the layers, but I mean, I, I think either one is fine.

721
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,960
Um, yeah.

722
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,720
So, yeah, if you look at, um, I made a Kofi, I made a PCP Kofi.

723
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,400
Uh, we should put that, we'll link that in places.

724
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,600
Stuff has, yeah, Road to Radcon and the Paradise Dosion and links to my site,

725
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,080
if anyone wants print copies, because they do have print copies of, of those sitting around.

726
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,440
Well, I do, I have a print copy of Paradise.

727
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,080
I have, I have a big box of Road to Radcon that I would like to get rid of if anyone wants one.

728
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,960
They have really the beautiful, the beautiful cover art by Mishi.

729
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,520
I already have my copy.

730
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,200
It's a collect, it's a collector's item.

731
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,800
I think I, I think I have like, I must have at least like 40 of those just sitting in a box.

732
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,680
I'd really like to get rid of them.

733
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,400
Uh, the PCP Dating Sim, the PCP Minecraft server, a link to Endless War and your website, my website.

734
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,720
Uh, I could maybe add anything else to think of.

735
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,560
Um, yeah, so I figured out all the URL fuckery and stuff.

736
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,280
I think I'm probably going to download all the files we had on Bluehost.

737
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,320
I'm probably going to take all the files off there and save them somewhere.

738
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,120
I would like to just cancel Bluehost and I wonder if, is there a way we can just like,

739
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,000
migrate the domain of a Procrastinator's podcast to Dreamhost?

740
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,160
Um, that's, should be possible.

741
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,440
It seems possible.

742
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:56,840
It's just sometimes hosting and stuff that can be annoying about how to maneuver it around.

743
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,360
Well, we don't really, we don't need to do that right away.

744
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,120
Cause like the website is working now, but like, you know, the Bluehost is now extraneous.

745
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,320
It's just extra hosting costs that we don't really need to pay.

746
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,920
So, uh, you know, I'd like to get rid of it as soon as possible, but it's not like super urgent.

747
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,160
So yeah, the new website and I'm going to, I'm going to, I'll try to like gussy it up a little

748
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,440
bit with like the, those icons you made and maybe I'll make the fonts a little bit.

749
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,640
I mean, this is kind of plain font is like fine.

750
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,640
Yeah. So it's just readable and it is.

751
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,680
But anyway, yeah, if you're, if you're listening to this, you can at the, at the, okay.

752
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,800
People asked for the podcast apps.

753
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,720
Uh, you know, I have not updated the Spotify or Apple podcast or anything like that.

754
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,560
But if what you want is like a downloadable mp3s that you can listen to,

755
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,120
if you want downloadable mp3s of all the episodes, all the past episodes ever,

756
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,880
they're here and they're on the procrastinatorspodcast.com.

757
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,560
And you just go to, yeah, the procrastinators podcast episode archive link.

758
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,360
And there's a whole list of them and they are mostly there.

759
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,200
And if anything is missing, you can let me know in the comments and I will try and get it up there.

760
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,440
Uh, yeah.

761
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,840
So I'm glad to have gotten that sorted out.

762
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,360
I was really, I was really banging my head first against like,

763
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,120
how do I actually put the files on the, the internet?

764
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,120
Like we own the domain.

765
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,960
How do I put the files there?

766
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,280
I had forgotten how to do that.

767
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,480
And then once I did remember it, I was like, okay, okay,

768
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,800
I remember how to put files on the internet.

769
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,480
But now how do I make it so that I've got the, I've got the original website.

770
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,480
I want to one, replace it with a new website and then two,

771
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,200
make a second domain redirect to it.

772
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,200
And figuring out both, I figured those out yesterday.

773
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,720
So I'm glad to have done that.

774
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,240
Yeah.

775
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,920
And, uh, that was like productivity wise.

776
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,800
That's most of what I, that's most of what I got this week.

777
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,360
But it's, but it's, it's not nothing.

778
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,640
So I feel okay about it.

779
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,480
Yeah.

780
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,040
Yeah.

781
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,600
Yeah.

782
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,080
Yeah.

783
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah.

784
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,040
It's not nothing.

785
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,840
It's not nothing.

786
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,920
You know, it's, you can say it's not nothing.

787
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,640
That's pretty good.

788
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Anytime it's not nothing, you should feel good about that.

789
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,240
It's like my old thermodynamics teacher used to say,

790
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,200
when you solve a physics problem, it's important to feel,

791
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,800
let yourself feel good about it so that you will condition yourself

792
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,520
to want to do more in the future.

793
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,920
If you beat yourself up about it, oh, I didn't do it fast enough.

794
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,200
Oh, I didn't do it good enough.

795
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,760
Then you're going to teach yourself that getting things done

796
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,160
just gives you pain and that's not going to.

797
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,520
I wish I had that advice when I was young.

798
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,840
I just ended up feeling pain constantly.

799
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,160
Well, you know, it's good advice.

800
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,400
It's hard to internalize and live by consistently, but I mean,

801
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,320
I, it's good if you can manage it.

802
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,320
I've been learning that basic lesson with my therapist.

803
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,440
I think I talked about it last time, just sort of noting down

804
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,080
things I've done and like just noting that they have been accomplished.

805
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,000
So I look back on the week and I'm like, oh, yeah,

806
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,640
I guess I did all that stuff because I often forget.

807
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,560
That guy, that guy was like a, that guy was like a Buddhist like

808
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,680
monk or something or he like worked at like a Buddhist temple,

809
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,760
like a couple of towns over.

810
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,840
And he was like an adjunct professor who they had got in to replace.

811
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,160
We had had like a much older, like a very accomplished older guy

812
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,520
who had written like the textbook.

813
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,680
He literally wrote the textbook for the class.

814
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,960
But that guy had like, he was very old and he was going through some health

815
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,200
things and I think he was got, he got too sick.

816
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,920
Like, like literally the year I showed up and was supposed to be taking

817
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,760
this class, they were like, he can't do this anymore.

818
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,400
We got to get it.

819
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,240
We got to get some new guy in.

820
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,200
So we got this fricking Buddhist guy and that guy,

821
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,520
he gave us all these like sage wisdoms and stuff and he was like, hey,

822
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,360
don't worry about it, just feel good about it.

823
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,520
But then he would assign, he would assign like PhD level questions to us.

824
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,560
And like we found where he was getting his homework questions for us

825
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,120
and they were, they were like PhD qualifying level.

826
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,680
So he would assign these unrealistically difficult things

827
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,920
and then he would just grade them like really leniently.

828
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,320
But it sucked because we didn't know that he was going to grade them leniently.

829
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,360
So we all would like get together and spend all night banging our head against

830
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,720
these things and not be able to figure out, turn in like shittily,

831
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,240
like barely solved, like probably wrong answers and then we would get them back

832
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
and he'd be like, oh yeah, well this was pretty much wrong,

833
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,840
but I guess you couldn't have known that.

834
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,880
So it'd be plus.

835
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,560
Hey, feel good about it though.

836
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,760
Take a minute and just feel good.

837
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,000
Feel good that you tried or something.

838
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,160
You tried and you accomplished.

839
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,680
You figured some of it out and like that's good enough.

840
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,960
Isn't the point purpose of school to be taught how to figure that out?

841
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,600
Well, that's what the textbook is for.

842
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,880
Not just tested on it.

843
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,920
Well, that's what the, well, I mean, he did give,

844
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,760
all you need to do, all you need to do to get good PhD results

845
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,000
for a baby, you just give them the same, like a series of tests

846
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,960
over and over again and then eventually they'll get it.

847
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,160
Just every day, just click.

848
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,520
Every day, give them a test.

849
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,880
Like, hey, can you, can you walk?

850
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,800
Let's test, let's test your walking.

851
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,840
Oh, you failed today.

852
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,160
Okay.

853
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,680
And then, you know, several hundred tests later, eventually they'll pass

854
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,280
and it's all because you, it's all because of your encouragement.

855
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,320
Yeah, so that was, that was the first thing I did in the week.

856
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,160
Oh, the logos.

857
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,280
Yeah, the logo.

858
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,240
They're so good.

859
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,560
I don't know if we want to like show them.

860
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,840
Do you want to show them or do you want to keep them a surprise?

861
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,880
I mean, let me just screen grab them right now because I've got them open.

862
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,240
Do you think this is at a point where it's like, yeah, this is finished.

863
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,880
We shall, we shall, this shall be what it is.

864
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,200
Because I can, I can, I don't really know what to edit about them.

865
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,480
I think they're pretty good.

866
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,000
I think they look, I would be perfectly, I'm perfectly happy with this

867
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,840
going on the, on the, the book.

868
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,120
Oh, you know what?

869
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,960
I know, I, I know I asked for the, I don't, I don't think I would put the,

870
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,240
on the, on the PDF.

871
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,320
I would want that for like maybe the website.

872
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,880
Yeah, yeah.

873
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,440
That's just the file as it appears currently.

874
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,680
Right.

875
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,800
No, I'm, I'm think this is perfectly good and like no notes.

876
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,880
This, this can go, this can go right on the, the comic or the, the zine or whatever we're calling it.

877
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,080
Yes.

878
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:07,560
So.

879
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,840
With regards to that,

880
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,760
well, kind of related, not exactly, but I've been making a PDF ready, a print version

881
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,080
ready of Clarissa for a, an Amazon Kindle direct publishing

882
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,280
sort of thing that Amazon can do, which is my next, my next goal.

883
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,800
I had sort of a crisis in this, this week where I was like talking to my therapist.

884
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,560
My therapist was like, well, I mean, don't you want to make money?

885
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,440
Like how, how, how expensive is this comic?

886
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,800
What are you going to set up for?

887
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,440
And I'm like, oh, I'm going to put it up on the internet for free.

888
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,720
Right.

889
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,520
And they're like, but what else would he, what, huh?

890
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,320
What are you stupid?

891
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,200
What are you idiot?

892
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,520
Right.

893
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,480
And I was like, oh no, I am, I am idiot.

894
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,280
Right, right.

895
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,200
I need to monetize.

896
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,120
I need to, I, I, I avoid it because I don't know.

897
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,120
I guess I should have a thing about it.

898
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:18,440
The thing about like putting a price tag on my work and statements and marketing and, I don't know.

899
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,080
Yeah, for sure.

900
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:28,360
It's, it's maybe, maybe a more like a, like a focused determination of whether what I've

901
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,200
made is good is whether it makes money.

902
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,160
And I'm like, I don't, I just want to avoid that whole question.

903
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,720
Yeah, I, yeah, I know what you mean.

904
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,840
No, that makes no sense.

905
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,600
But there's no harm in having the ability for people to buy it.

906
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:48,040
So I've been, I did the PC, the perfect comic party logo.

907
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,280
And then I started trying to figure out how to monetize and I've got a plan.

908
00:48:52,520 --> 00:49:01,400
And I'm going to make, I'm going to make closer chapters one to four into a PDF.

909
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,600
And I'm going to put that on Amazon so you can buy it as a Kindle digital version.

910
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,280
And with the Amazon Direct Publishing, I looked into this.

911
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,200
It's print on demand.

912
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,720
If you type in Amazon print on demand, that's a different service.

913
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,120
This is Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.

914
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,000
Okay.

915
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,080
Which was confusing for a bit.

916
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:33,800
But yeah, you make a book as a PDF or some other thing and it will be printable by the

917
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:39,080
consumer without me having to do any work printing it and sending it.

918
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,880
That's actually, yeah, the fact that you don't have to do the shipping yourself,

919
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,600
that probably saves you like so much money because Amazon can ship stuff so much cheaper

920
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,080
than you can.

921
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,720
They can.

922
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,560
They can obviously print it so much cheaper as well.

923
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,680
And Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Lord of Ghosts, which I will do as well.

924
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,640
I'll do the Lord of Ghosts.

925
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,640
I'll do a Redman version so you could buy a physical Redman thing for people who missed

926
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,280
the Kickstarter.

927
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,680
And it'll be, you know, it's going to be a storefront.

928
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,280
It's going to be, I'm going to sell my work.

929
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,480
I may even make a Bale JAPE hardback little book.

930
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,760
That's actually probably all that stuff together.

931
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,200
It's actually probably like a really good idea.

932
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,320
Yeah.

933
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,320
That's going to take a while to like settle those PDFs up because they're so exact.

934
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,360
They're so specific.

935
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,200
I was like opening all of the many tabs and like learning and relearning about exactly

936
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,840
what a margin is and what bleed means.

937
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:44,200
And when you, you know, when you set like, they have a system, I think for any print

938
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:51,720
company, but Amazon explained it as the size, the number of pages determines how big the inner

939
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,400
margin has to be because of, you know, the more pages there are, the less the book can open flat.

940
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,120
So you have to change the margins based on how many pages.

941
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,080
Now, because the spine is thicker?

942
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,200
Yeah.

943
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,920
The spine is thicker.

944
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,840
Therefore, the inner margin should be, it should be thicker to accommodate for readability,

945
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,240
you know that.

946
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,120
Yes.

947
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:23,320
And the choice of ink, the choice of paper quality changes certain things.

948
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,200
And I figured out all that for Clarissa at least.

949
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,320
Yeah.

950
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,520
I put in all the numbers.

951
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,240
I know the bleed.

952
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:36,360
I have the file that is the right dimensions in centimeters and inches and pixels or whatever.

953
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,840
And I'm going to put it up there.

954
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,640
I'm going to make it.

955
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,440
That's next week.

956
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm going to make it.

957
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,840
It's going to be made.

958
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,800
That rules.

959
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,920
That's really cool.

960
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,600
That's probably that's probably going to do.

961
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,400
That's actually, it actually sounds great.

962
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,400
I'm imagining like imagine if you could just make a book and you didn't have to take orders

963
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:03,000
and buy envelopes and address the envelopes and bring them and bring them to the post office.

964
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,240
Imagine that's incredible.

965
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,160
I want to check the quality before I like officially answer it.

966
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,880
I should look into it and see like how much am I really saving?

967
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,840
How much am I really saving by doing it myself?

968
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,040
For me personally.

969
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,160
For you it's worse because you're in the UK, I think.

970
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,800
Absolutely.

971
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,040
That's absolutely a major factor.

972
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:36,520
But also the whole printing and sending and organizing of all that is so much like hard labor

973
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,320
mentally and physically.

974
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:45,400
But like mostly just to keep track of everything that I should be getting a bigger,

975
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,000
a much bigger paycheck than what I'm actually getting doing it myself.

976
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,160
So the fact that Amazon takes care of all of that and they're such a large company that

977
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:02,040
they can print this stuff like without, they don't need to buy 100 of them.

978
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,440
Just let Daddy Bezos take care of that for you.

979
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,040
Just leave it up to him.

980
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,320
He'll take care of everything.

981
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,600
Don't worry about the money.

982
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,200
Don't worry about the money, Kip.

983
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,240
Just let Amazon take care of it for you.

984
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,120
Look, look.

985
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,160
It's so easy.

986
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,720
Isn't it just the easy thing to do?

987
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,280
Isn't it just the frictionless way to go about things?

988
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,960
We just make it so easy for you.

989
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:31,720
They'll have like a thing on the submit your PDF and there's a box checking,

990
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,120
like checked, like a use slave labor, yes or no.

991
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,040
If you click yes, much cheaper.

992
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,320
You get much better returns.

993
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,400
But if you uncheck it, less money, less money for you.

994
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,560
Hey, slaves need jobs too.

995
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:49,880
Click.

996
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,520
It would be wrong to take that slave's job away.

997
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,520
We're all trying to make it in our little world.

998
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,720
Well, I guess there's no ethical consumption under capitalism anyway.

999
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,680
Yeah.

1000
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,720
I mean, most people never think about any of that.

1001
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,480
The fact that I think about it is merely just a frustration for me.

1002
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:23,320
The fact that I know that I'm putting some slave into a work camp, at least I acknowledge.

1003
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,000
At least I'm aware that that's what I'm doing.

1004
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,880
No.

1005
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,240
Now I've made a kerfuffle, but it's fine.

1006
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,240
I'm also probably going to look into it and just see how much.

1007
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,920
I think I'll try with the Clarissa.

1008
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,960
I want to see if the quality is good because my initial reservations were,

1009
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,520
are they going to be good for image print?

1010
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,280
Because maybe it's just good for text.

1011
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,600
But they sell children's books that way, which are entirely illustrated.

1012
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:08,360
Obviously, you got your little publishing independent author and they're like,

1013
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,960
I want to sell my children's book.

1014
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
It has to be good enough.

1015
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,720
It can't be shit quality.

1016
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,760
Otherwise, nobody would ever use it.

1017
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,560
But I'm going to check.

1018
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,280
I'm going to do the Clarissa chapters one to four.

1019
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,760
And then if it's good, I'll do the rest of my books.

1020
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,520
And it'll all be available forever.

1021
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,480
And if that's not the case, I'll at least make PDFs that you can purchase if you want to support me.

1022
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,320
I'll put that on Amazon anyway, but also on Gumroad, I think, for the same price.

1023
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,600
Just in case you don't want Amazon getting anything.

1024
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:54,280
I got physical copies of, actually, at almost the same time.

1025
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,920
I got the two test copies of Slime and Punishment.

1026
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:04,040
And I got the test copy of the Radcon for Dojin.

1027
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:11,960
And the Dojin looks good, except the margins were a little bit, I was a little bit,

1028
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,120
I cut it a little close with the margins.

1029
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,080
And it's mostly fine, except some of the page numbers were cut off.

1030
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,560
So I adjusted the position of the page numbers.

1031
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,440
And I'm probably going to print another test copy.

1032
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,240
But other than that, the bleeds all looked OK.

1033
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,920
It's pretty nice.

1034
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,160
It looks like a little mini-manga.

1035
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,320
I guess I could post a picture of it.

1036
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,640
Maybe I'll do that.

1037
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,640
Let's see.

1038
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,200
Where did I?

1039
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,440
I'll post the logo that I sent you.

1040
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,840
So that's what it looks like, everybody.

1041
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,880
Yes.

1042
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,880
Oh, it looks so good.

1043
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,440
It looks so shiny.

1044
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,680
I love it.

1045
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,040
Imagine little enamel pins of that.

1046
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,280
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

1047
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,880
That's what I was thinking.

1048
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,520
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

1049
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,840
Oh, it's shiny, just like my favorite thing.

1050
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,520
A little enamel pin.

1051
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,800
It's got a little raised up thing.

1052
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,680
I did not even think about it.

1053
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,520
The perfect comic pin.

1054
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,960
The perfect comic pin.

1055
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,600
Yeah, true.

1056
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,080
Yeah.

1057
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:24,680
And I'm imagining, I'm just imagining, I don't know.

1058
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,880
You can make it different colors, different issues if you want.

1059
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,320
Oh, wait.

1060
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,920
I had another question.

1061
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:38,120
I had another thing to raise, but I will mention that in a moment.

1062
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,000
Let me just look at my PCP folder.

1063
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,760
Let me go to my Radcon folder.

1064
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,240
Let me go to the Dojin folder.

1065
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,280
And let me show you.

1066
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,160
Well, while you're doing that, I also have an announcement

1067
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,400
for a new version of the Gibbentake.site website.

1068
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,440
I'm revamping it.

1069
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,440
And it's going to be nice and good.

1070
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,200
That's probably also going to happen next week.

1071
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,200
Is it live now?

1072
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,160
Oh, next week, you said.

1073
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,480
Okay.

1074
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,040
Yeah, next week.

1075
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,960
Yeah, Ben Rodia.

1076
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:21,080
Ben Rodia, the person behind the famous giant punk plush

1077
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
that he gave me at Radcon floor.

1078
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:23,800
Meetup.

1079
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,920
I didn't know it was the same guy.

1080
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,840
Yeah, that's the guy.

1081
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,720
Oh, that's awesome.

1082
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:27,960
Okay.

1083
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,240
And he's just approached.

1084
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,880
He wanted to do the PCP website.

1085
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,240
Yeah, I know.

1086
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,520
I just said.

1087
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,360
Ben was like, is more like, better, better as a list.

1088
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,640
And I guess, I guess we don't need like a big revamp.

1089
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,200
I just said.

1090
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,440
Okay.

1091
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,160
I mean, I said, yeah, he said he would do it.

1092
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,840
And he said he would make it fancy.

1093
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,920
And he said he would charge some money to make it fancy.

1094
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,640
And I said, well, I can just make it, I can make it cheap

1095
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,560
and quick and dirty for free.

1096
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,520
And that's what I did.

1097
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,240
So I don't know.

1098
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,200
Yeah.

1099
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,320
We can, we can, I don't know, we can make it fancy if we want to.

1100
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,640
Yeah, just mentioning that I can't do it quick and cheap and fancy.

1101
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,200
So it's going to look, it's going to be good.

1102
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,560
I'm liking how it's look.

1103
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,360
There's a triangle.

1104
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,400
There's a triangle.

1105
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,600
Do you want, you quick, cheap, fancy, you know, pick two.

1106
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,720
I went with quick and cheap.

1107
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,480
True.

1108
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:19,720
Yeah.

1109
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,600
But yeah, that's, that's a, that's a cool thing.

1110
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,840
Currently there's like the punk, the runaway from snakes game.

1111
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,160
Being implemented right now.

1112
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,320
Do you have any like images of what it's going to look like or?

1113
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,960
Mostly I'm excited because it's away from the shitty WordPress thing.

1114
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:47,000
And it's so much more user friendly to upload like new comic pages too.

1115
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,640
Did you, was it, was your old website on WordPress?

1116
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,360
Yeah, it was a WordPress website because I don't know how to build websites.

1117
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,360
And it's so restrictive and so convoluted and terrible and bloated.

1118
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,320
And so this new one, I've been given instructions on how to edit

1119
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,960
like HTML and, and, you know, add new pages.

1120
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:18,600
Add new pages by simply getting the images and then like naming them correctly,

1121
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,960
putting them in a folder that gets uploaded.

1122
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,520
And then just editing the data file to say this is a new comic is of this kind.

1123
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,000
Like whether it's a long scrolling comic or like a one page at a time,

1124
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,480
like one panel at a time, like a bell jpeg comic.

1125
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:35,720
Yeah.

1126
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,640
And then like the, the, the image it's referencing,

1127
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,560
and it just makes all the pages by itself.

1128
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,440
That's, that's very convenient.

1129
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,720
Which is going to be very useful for when I have like a billion comics.

1130
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,280
Does it, does it make the new web page?

1131
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,440
And it makes it so that it like links to the previous page and the next page?

1132
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,600
Yeah, there's button stuff.

1133
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:56,840
That's good.

1134
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,360
That's really good.

1135
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,160
Yeah, I don't know.

1136
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,360
It's all, it's all involved.

1137
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,560
It's all incorporated.

1138
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,880
And the things I would do is like edit like,

1139
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,680
like styles of fonts and stuff to taste.

1140
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,240
Yeah.

1141
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,840
Most of all the functionality is all there and it's, I don't need to touch it and it's great.

1142
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,120
That's pretty good.

1143
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,360
Yeah. That's a Saint, on Saint comics, when I upload a new page, I have to like

1144
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:24,120
copy paste another page file and just change the like where the links go, you know,

1145
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,320
update the new page so that it links to the one before it and the one after it on the next,

1146
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,200
on the next links, which is, you know, quite, quite tedious.

1147
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,720
So that's, that's a big, that's big.

1148
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,840
Yeah. That's, that's cool.

1149
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:39,880
That's cool.

1150
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,880
I intend to have like, yeah, all the Clarissa stuff.

1151
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:50,520
And then Bailej2 will go on there and it'll be so simple to upload that it'll make comics

1152
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,120
easier as a prospect.

1153
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,560
I won't have to think about anything.

1154
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,720
I'll just make it and then it's on the website.

1155
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,480
It's going to be easier than fucking, I don't know, what, what's the tapas?

1156
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,160
I hate that.

1157
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,840
Or webtoon or.

1158
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,360
I hate tapas.

1159
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,720
Microsoft paint, Microsoft paint fan ventures.

1160
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,800
If that still exists, probably does.

1161
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,640
Yeah, it still exists.

1162
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,880
Although I haven't been in a while.

1163
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,320
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

1164
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,840
I made, I made one of those.

1165
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,400
I mean, Beast Pages was one of those.

1166
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,080
Do you remember Horstuck?

1167
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,480
Oh, vaguely.

1168
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,880
Wait, about, about Gib, right?

1169
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,000
About like Gib and the horse.

1170
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,720
It was Gib.

1171
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,800
It was going to be Gib and the horseshoe crew, but in Homestuck, but it didn't get very far in it.

1172
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,480
It was just me in my room, fucking around.

1173
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,760
There's a few GIFs.

1174
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,720
I could put that on there.

1175
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,920
That could be like a little secret.

1176
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,240
That's, that's your, that's your bard quest.

1177
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,760
Yeah, yeah, I've got a multiple bard quest.

1178
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,720
I've got, I've got Pocket Boys, the instantly abandoned Nuzlocke comic.

1179
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,640
Right, right, right, right.

1180
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,720
I didn't even get to like the first gym leader.

1181
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:00,680
I instantly.

1182
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,960
I was like, yeah, whatever.

1183
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,560
I instantly abandoned a Nuzlocke comic once upon a time.

1184
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,680
I mean, a long time ago, like before I ever posted online.

1185
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,160
But I did make like one page of one of those stick, like stick figures.

1186
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,840
Hope I never, hope I never find that.

1187
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:20,680
Yeah.

1188
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,960
So there's Canon Story.

1189
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,120
There's fucking Pocket Boys.

1190
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,240
There's Red Noir.

1191
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,160
There's Red Man.

1192
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,200
There's Bell Jape.

1193
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,160
Clarissa Gunsmoke.

1194
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,120
The Lord of Ghosts.

1195
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,760
And what did I, what else did I say?

1196
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,240
Something.

1197
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,120
I said something else.

1198
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,680
I posted the picture of the red.

1199
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,560
Oh, and the horse stock.

1200
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,000
Horse stock can go on there as well.

1201
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,480
Secret, secret horse stock.

1202
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,880
I posted the picture of the Radcon for Paradise Dojin.

1203
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,000
Yeah.

1204
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,640
As you can see there, it's a real thing.

1205
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,840
I have one of them now.

1206
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,080
And I, and I got, and the margin.

1207
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,400
We're going to get, we're going to get splashed by the water.

1208
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,200
It's coming.

1209
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,480
We're going to get splashed.

1210
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,960
I also got, yeah, Slime and Punishment.

1211
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,920
I got two copies of it in slightly different colors.

1212
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,680
And in two slightly different page weights.

1213
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,720
And, you know, I went with the firmer page weight.

1214
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,960
And I got to say, it's actually, it's actually really big.

1215
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,080
It's really big to the point that it's a little bit floppy.

1216
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Because like the pages are just so large.

1217
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,040
And because it's, it's cut like, you know, it's cut landscape

1218
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,160
instead of a vertical.

1219
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,560
So it has a short, it has, the spine is on the short side.

1220
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,720
So even at like the, I'm going to, I'm going to ask her like,

1221
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:34,120
what if we went like, what if we used like unusually stiff paper?

1222
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,400
I might try to order like a test and see like.

1223
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,000
Wait, sorry, for the slime?

1224
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,680
Yeah, for Slime and Punishment.

1225
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,240
It's, it's, you said it was a hardback, but it's still floppy?

1226
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,760
No, no, no, no, it's, it's soft cover.

1227
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,040
Okay.

1228
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,320
It's, it's soft cut.

1229
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,680
It's not like, it's, you know, it's, it's floppy.

1230
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,760
Like, you know, like a, it's, it's very similar to, um,

1231
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,680
the paper quality is very similar to like the, the, the problem sleuth books.

1232
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,600
It's just that it's, it's just that it's like

1233
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,920
much bigger, like it's, I don't know, eight, eight and a half by 11

1234
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,360
is the size of a piece of paper and that doesn't sound that big,

1235
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,360
but like the fact that it's like a 250 page book of that size is actually,

1236
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,480
it's like quite large.

1237
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,400
I'm almost thinking I overdid it on, on the bigness.

1238
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,920
Yeah, like a size, like a sheet of A4.

1239
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,040
Um, I think that's A4.

1240
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,560
Eight and a half by 11.

1241
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,680
Yeah.

1242
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,280
Wait, I've got a, I've got a measuring thing.

1243
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,240
Normal, I mean, in America, that's normal printer paper.

1244
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,000
And I think it's probably the same.

1245
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,560
Eight and a half.

1246
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,560
Well, that's, that's a little bit bigger than my A4 sheet of paper right here.

1247
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,560
Eight and a half.

1248
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,680
I think I've got like eight.

1249
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,320
So it's, you've got an extra half inch by 11.

1250
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,480
Oh no, this is, yeah, it's more of a square.

1251
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:57,640
Yeah.

1252
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,280
Is it?

1253
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:58,520
Yeah.

1254
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,480
A little bit more square.

1255
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:00,680
Oh.

1256
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,000
I think.

1257
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,200
Huh.

1258
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,520
Okay.

1259
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,680
Well, um.

1260
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,800
This is not A4.

1261
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,040
It's a U.S. standard.

1262
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,680
Hang on, hang on.

1263
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,440
A4 size in inches.

1264
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:14,840
Maybe I'm wrong.

1265
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,640
I'm just looking at it.

1266
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,600
Yeah, this says A4 is eight, it's eight and a quarter by 11.67.

1267
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,520
So I mean, it's pretty close.

1268
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:23,720
Yeah.

1269
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:24,600
Yeah.

1270
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,520
Um, you know, U.S. is, yeah, a little bit, a little bit wider and a little bit shorter.

1271
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,000
You know what the difference is for?

1272
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,800
It's actually, um.

1273
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:42,360
Why would they, why would they do such a thing as to have a different standard of normal paper?

1274
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,200
That is, that is stupid.

1275
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,360
Same, same with like different plugs.

1276
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:54,600
They, I'm actually, I would have, I would have preferred the book to be, you know, less long

1277
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:01,880
and more tall, but just the fact that the panels were like Twitter sized means they're like

1278
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,640
relatively quite wide.

1279
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:09,080
So honestly, having the book be like the proportions of the panel would make it like

1280
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,720
really long and it would look really weird as a book.

1281
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,360
And so I, I, I stretched it out vertically a little bit just to make it a little more square.

1282
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,280
And as a result, there's kind of like some, there's like an inch or two of black space

1283
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,280
sort of at the top and bottom of most pages.

1284
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:27,240
It's a little bit of wasted space, but I think it just makes the book a more appealing shape.

1285
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,160
Uh, I don't know.

1286
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:37,000
I had to, I had to sort of work, uh, you know, just find the best compromise for page size

1287
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,640
and all that.

1288
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,160
But anyway, yeah, it's really large.

1289
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:44,760
And so I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask for maybe another sample, uh, with like stiffer paper

1290
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,680
and see like, I don't know, does that make it better or does that just like turn it into

1291
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:54,440
cardboard and, or does it, does that cost like twice as much in which case it's probably not

1292
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:54,920
worth it?

1293
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,240
The one that I got is like, it's pretty, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's very similar in, in

1294
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:05,400
quality paper quality to, uh, problem sleuth books, except that the paper, the inner pages

1295
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,600
are like coated.

1296
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,480
The inner pages are like, not laminated, but they're like UV coated, which makes them,

1297
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,760
it, it, it crushes the blacks.

1298
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,960
Like when they're like the uncoded pages, the black is kind of gray.

1299
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,720
The coated pages are like, the blacks are black and like the pages are mostly black,

1300
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,560
like it's black pages with the image set on it.

1301
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,600
So like it really needed that, uh, even though it costs more, but that's the price.

1302
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,640
Each individual page is coated.

1303
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,080
Yeah.

1304
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:35,400
Yeah.

1305
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,080
Oh yeah.

1306
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,280
I mean, because it's, because it's, um,

1307
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,160
Yeah.

1308
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,320
Yeah.

1309
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:39,400
Yeah.

1310
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,680
It's full, it's full color.

1311
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah.

1312
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,720
So much.

1313
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:41,960
Yeah.

1314
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,680
You want it to be as dark as possible.

1315
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:44,920
Yeah.

1316
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,640
That's where, that's where a lot of the, that's where a lot of the printing cost went

1317
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,280
is making like every page full color, uh, like coated, you know.

1318
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,920
But it had to, it had to be that way.

1319
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:02,040
Uh, I cut, I'm wondering, looking at it, it's so large.

1320
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,240
I'm wondering if maybe I could have got away with making it a little smaller

1321
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,800
and maybe that would have saved some money.

1322
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,400
Yeah.

1323
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:18,600
I think I started building the PDF for a, a bell jpeg book to be around the same size

1324
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,240
as the Homestuck and Problem Sleuth books because they felt, they felt good.

1325
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:23,400
Yeah.

1326
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,080
So I'm like, I don't need it to be bigger than that.

1327
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,600
Yeah, they're a good size.

1328
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,840
I don't know, whatever.

1329
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,920
It's kind of, it's kind of cool that it's big also.

1330
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,120
It's cool that it's big and because I went with this one printer, the prices are not.

1331
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:44,040
This, this printer is like, the price is decent.

1332
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,240
The price is decent for like a hundred copies.

1333
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,320
And I'm hoping I can sell at least a hundred copies.

1334
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,640
I would be, I would be like, all right, cool.

1335
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,960
I accomplished my goal if I sell a hundred at, at a hundred copies.

1336
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,320
It's cheap enough that I can sell them for what I think is a reasonable price,

1337
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,160
which is going to be around the 30 to $35 range plus a little bit of shipping.

1338
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,720
And if I go, if I go higher than that though, if I sell like 200 copies,

1339
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,400
the price like drops tremendously.

1340
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,720
If I could sell 200 copies, I would like double the profit on every individual copy

1341
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,600
because it's just that cheap to print in bulk.

1342
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,680
So like, wow.

1343
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:25,400
Yeah, it literally is like, it's, it's barely more expensive to print like

1344
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,160
300, it's, it's only like 50% more to print 300 copies as opposed to printing 100.

1345
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,280
And then it's like, yeah, to, and then to go to 500 is only like, it only,

1346
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,160
it only adds like another like 50% on, on that.

1347
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,480
So like, yeah, it's really,

1348
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:47,960
it would be, I have to check with, with, with the Amazon thing and like how,

1349
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,400
because they don't do bulk, it's just right when somebody buys one.

1350
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,640
That's, that's the, that's where the, that's where the profit margin is.

1351
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,520
It's in the bulk printing that gives you like the per copy discount.

1352
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:08,280
That's where you find my skills lie more in like just making the, the, the comics.

1353
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,720
Oh, not me.

1354
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,760
I'm terrible at that.

1355
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,480
But marketing, marketing and production, that's, that's where I make my money.

1356
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,720
The comic and afterthought, the content meaning what is garbage.

1357
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,960
What I mean is like, I would,

1358
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,440
it would take so much more effort for me to do all of that extra stuff.

1359
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:28,840
Yeah.

1360
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,200
That I would not end up making that much of a profit

1361
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,960
as opposed to going through something, some other thing.

1362
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,560
The, the, the, the, the fact of the matter is you gotta,

1363
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,080
you only have so much energy and so much time to spend and you do,

1364
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,840
there is a choice to be made.

1365
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,640
How much time do you want to spend?

1366
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,400
Yeah.

1367
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,720
Looking into production details and getting the work produced and trying to like squeeze

1368
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,040
out a higher profit margin by, you know,

1369
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,640
such and such versus how much time do you want to be drawing comics?

1370
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,120
And I, and I'm going to have to say that, yeah, I probably,

1371
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,640
I probably do spend an above average amount of time

1372
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,800
on the one side trying to like find the perfect,

1373
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,320
the perfect paper coding and the perfect book size

1374
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,600
and the perfect like printing, printing company

1375
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,520
with the best shipping costs and all that.

1376
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,000
And that's a, and that's a compromise.

1377
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,560
You gotta, life is a series of choices.

1378
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,040
And I made some.

1379
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,920
But I just, I don't know if I just find it so satisfying, I find it so,

1380
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:41,000
I think a lot of people would find that kind of thing really tedious and aggravating

1381
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,960
and don't get me wrong.

1382
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:48,680
It's, it's not not that, but it's hugely gratifying to, to like find

1383
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:53,240
what feels like a good solution and be like, yes, it's just right.

1384
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,480
It's, it's the perfect paper size.

1385
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,520
I found a good deal.

1386
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,320
I'm, nothing is being wasted here.

1387
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,920
I am getting the, I am getting the best return on my investment I could possibly get.

1388
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,880
It's a, it's great.

1389
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,360
So, you know, yeah, yeah.

1390
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,800
When I was on a roll with the Lord of Ghost comic, it did feel good.

1391
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:17,960
Like, if I like get printing, like I bought like label paper that I could print on to.

1392
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,560
So I was printing out the labels and sticking them on the envelopes and putting the things in.

1393
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:28,120
I had already pre-drawn the, the doodles that I needed to do.

1394
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,400
And then for the signatures, I would just sign them, put them all in.

1395
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:40,280
And then it'd be like a big, huge wheelbarrow of, of comics to put to the post office.

1396
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,440
And it was like, it felt good to get through a lot of that.

1397
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:53,240
But it's just a little, it's, it's, it's really mostly the headaches of items being sent back

1398
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,480
or just getting destroyed in customs.

1399
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:55,960
Yeah.

1400
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:01,080
And me not really having a, like a proper, like I'm not a business.

1401
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,960
I don't have all those funny numbers they need sometimes.

1402
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,280
Yeah.

1403
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,880
Oh, what a, what a fuck.

1404
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,240
What a whole big thing.

1405
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:14,440
Filling, filling out the customs forms for international shipments was always like,

1406
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,360
I would, I would get to the post office and then I would have to go and like find the slips

1407
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,280
and then spend like an hour standing there, like filling out slips with like,

1408
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,640
because they already have the information written on the envelope, but no, you got to

1409
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:30,680
copy the information from the envelope onto the slip and then you give them the slip

1410
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:35,240
and then they have to look at the slip and manually type in what you wrote on the slip.

1411
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,520
That seems pointlessly convoluted.

1412
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,440
It really, it really does.

1413
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,720
It really does.

1414
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:48,760
Like, like when I went to the post office, I had like the Royal Mail like affiliated like

1415
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,480
news agents.

1416
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:56,920
I go in there and I have the, I went to the Royal Mail site and I printed out there like

1417
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,680
template for stuff.

1418
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,400
And so because that's all there and I typed it all up and it's all fine, I signed it.

1419
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,080
They just put it in a bag.

1420
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,960
They just take it's like, is this for stuff prepaid?

1421
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,600
Yes.

1422
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,080
Okay.

1423
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,440
They just grab it.

1424
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
So it's like takes like two seconds.

1425
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,320
I went to the star, star, star, star.

1426
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,600
I went to the star, star, star, star.

1427
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,840
Star, star, star, star, star, star.

1428
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,480
Star, star, star, star, star.

1429
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,200
That's sorry.

1430
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,360
That's what I was thinking while you were talking.

1431
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,640
While you were talking just now.

1432
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,600
I just wasn't listening.

1433
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,400
I was thinking of that.

1434
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,240
Yeah.

1435
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:31,640
Turtle.

1436
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,680
Turtle dreams.

1437
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,320
Turtle memes.

1438
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:37,560
Yeah.

1439
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,520
You know, yeah, I don't, this is, this is a damn, what I was just saying right there

1440
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,240
I know I said it's really satisfying but also it's a little bit depressing to say what I just said

1441
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:58,680
and think of it like, you know, I could spend, I could stand to spend more time actually drawing.

1442
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,000
Couldn't I?

1443
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,600
I mean, you like what you like.

1444
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,640
I think if you, if you enjoy that process, that's not a problem.

1445
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,920
It's just, that's just how it is.

1446
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,080
Yeah.

1447
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,960
I mean, to, I mean, to, I do to a degree.

1448
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,200
I do to a degree.

1449
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,280
I mean, you know, I don't know.

1450
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:20,520
I feel like, I don't know, I feel like most artists probably spend more time on their actual craft

1451
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:24,200
and, and, and, and find, you know, I don't know.

1452
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,960
I feel like a real, a real artist.

1453
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,240
I'm just gonna say I'm not a real artist.

1454
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:27,960
I'm a fucking fake.

1455
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,440
I'm a fraud.

1456
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,080
I'm a phony.

1457
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:36,280
A real artist has like a publisher to like do all that stuff for them because they don't want to think about that.

1458
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,160
I would say you're an artist.

1459
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,160
You're just not on that Sigma grain set.

1460
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,840
You're not gristling in the ground.

1461
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,840
I'm not on that Sigma grain set.

1462
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,280
I'm off the grind set.

1463
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,480
And I mean, me neither, honestly.

1464
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,680
I'm not like drawing as much as I really should be if I want to be like

1465
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,760
getting enough, throwing enough stuff at the wall to make something stick.

1466
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,640
Because I also, like despite like the idea of like self publishing and Amazon and stuff,

1467
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,160
it would also be nice if I could go to a publisher and say, here's my thing.

1468
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,040
What do you think?

1469
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,480
Can this be, can you do it?

1470
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,800
Can you put it in your publication?

1471
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,320
Yeah.

1472
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,200
Yeah.

1473
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,640
Oh, you know that.

1474
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,400
Oh, I wanted to raise this issue with you.

1475
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:24,440
And I guess there's no reason not to just talk about it on the podcast

1476
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,760
about the perfect comic party.

1477
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,080
I mean, I think we said that the first issue is just going to be you and me.

1478
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,520
But we're going to, after that, we're going to, we're going to make a call for submissions for like

1479
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,520
other people to submit stuff.

1480
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:36,840
Yeah.

1481
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,160
Right.

1482
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,320
Well, I was thinking,

1483
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:49,240
what about, what's, we, I think we need to hammer out and elaborate a like a rights agreement

1484
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,680
for that.

1485
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:57,000
Like what rights, what publication rights are we being granted by a someone that submits

1486
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,560
and allows their stuff to be print printed and here.

1487
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,360
And here, okay.

1488
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,880
For instance, for instance, like what if, what if we eventually decide that we want to like

1489
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,960
print physical copies of the perfect comic party.

1490
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,280
Yeah.

1491
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,400
See this, this is what I want to avoid.

1492
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,240
Right.

1493
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,960
Well, I have some, I have some thoughts.

1494
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,800
Like if we were to do that, we would have to do all of that stuff to make it like

1495
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,360
sale smoothly and all that.

1496
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,640
I was just thinking like, I don't want it to get big.

1497
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,840
I don't want to make a whole like thing about it because then you have to do all that stuff.

1498
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,640
Fuck you.

1499
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,120
What's the point of doing it if it's not going to get big?

1500
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,240
I want this to blow up.

1501
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,080
I want this to, I want this to change.

1502
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:39,560
Okay.

1503
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,280
Now you're right.

1504
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:40,680
You're right.

1505
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:45,000
I just, I just don't like, I just don't like all of that, that, that stuff.

1506
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:52,040
Well here, I don't know if we are going to need to like draft a contract per se.

1507
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,000
We might need to, maybe we need to write out some copy and have people just be like

1508
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,000
check a box or something.

1509
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,080
Uh, I'll look into it.

1510
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:07,240
But here's, here's what I think would be a reasonable, uh, agreement.

1511
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,840
I think that it would be, I think that the agreement would be if like, if we publish

1512
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:18,120
your thing in the perfect comic party, we don't take any like of your rights away.

1513
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,960
Like, like it's still your content.

1514
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:25,720
You own the comic and you're allowed to publish it in whatever other places you, you choose.

1515
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,480
Uh, but you know, by giving us this thing to publish in the perfect comic party,

1516
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:37,720
you do, you know, you give us the right to, you know, it's, you know, it's, it's for,

1517
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,840
it's forever a part of this issue of the perfect comic party.

1518
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,880
And we do have the right to print that issue, you know, we can reprint that issue,

1519
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,160
including the, the comic that you gave to us for it.

1520
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,400
And I, and I feel like that's fair.

1521
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,320
Uh, yes.

1522
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,360
Like, like, like, like we, we can, like you give it to us.

1523
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:02,280
We, we can print it in this collection and we have the right to reprint this collection.

1524
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,440
But you still have the right to print your stuff.

1525
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:07,400
Right.

1526
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:12,200
You, you retain rights, all the rights to your stuff and you can print it elsewhere as well.

1527
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,200
It's not exclusive, it's not an exclusive agreement.

1528
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,520
So you say print, like this is going to be physical.

1529
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,240
Oh, well, I'm not, I don't know.

1530
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:27,400
Well, in the option that it is physical, money needs to go into production of it.

1531
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,760
So we would sell it.

1532
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:35,400
And then is there like an agreement that they get a cut somehow for that issue?

1533
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,000
I don't know.

1534
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,760
I was kind of thinking, I was kind of thinking no.

1535
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,800
So it's a, it's a, it's a risk.

1536
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:50,600
It's a, it's a, your capital, your, there's a hypothetical capital that you may not get if

1537
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,920
you, if you pledge to the, if you put your comic forward for the perfect comic part.

1538
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:55,160
Yeah.

1539
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,320
I mean, we're not, we don't have any active plans to do that at the moment.

1540
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:04,440
But I mean, I don't know, what if like, what if it's, what if it's, you know,

1541
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:11,160
enough of a success that we do maybe a dozen of them, and then we want to like print of,

1542
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,040
like a, a collected volume of them, right?

1543
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,800
Maybe we could print a collected volume that is like, you know, maybe a hundred or so pages of

1544
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,120
stuff, 200 pages.

1545
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:24,680
I don't, I don't know.

1546
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,920
It's just, it's something we could do.

1547
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:32,520
And I, I would, I would hate to be like a year down the line, I would hate to be like,

1548
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,080
hey, this piece, this perfect comic party thing's going pretty well.

1549
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,880
We should print it as physical copies.

1550
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:41,000
Oh no, we didn't, we didn't even think about that.

1551
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,240
We didn't have any agreement with our artists about like, do we have the right to print

1552
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,000
your submissions?

1553
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:54,120
Yeah, that's, that's, it's, it's sensible to get contracts, even if, even if nothing's gonna come

1554
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:54,760
over it, I guess.

1555
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:59,800
I, I think it's a reasonable stipulation to be like, hey, if you give us your comic and you

1556
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,760
want us to put it in our publication, okay, we'll do that.

1557
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:10,040
And we, we, you're not handing over any rights of yours, but you do give us the right to,

1558
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,960
yeah, to print, to print this stuff.

1559
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,400
To print and profit from, yeah.

1560
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:18,520
Okay.

1561
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,080
Because I mean, right.

1562
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,200
I don't know how these things work normally.

1563
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,600
So like, it sounds okay, I guess, as long as they know that that's what it is and they sign it

1564
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,960
and they say, yes, I would like that.

1565
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,600
I don't mind.

1566
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,880
I don't, I don't think it's unfair because like, yeah, if we were to do it print, like, like,

1567
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:44,520
we're responsible for doing all the printing and we're, we're the ones,

1568
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,120
and I mean, it's not like it's sold under the pretense that it's our content.

1569
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,800
Like it's still your content.

1570
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,000
You'll be fully credited for it and all that.

1571
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,960
I, I'm not, I don't know, this, I'm not trying to say like,

1572
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,720
I mean, the way that it is now, there's no real money on the table for anyone.

1573
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:10,840
You, you're being paid an exposure and so are we because like, we're not selling it.

1574
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,560
And if we, if we were to print it later, I don't know, it would be sort of a separate

1575
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:20,360
thing that is like, we're printing, I don't know.

1576
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:27,800
I know, I know what you're saying, like, like, the perfect comic party

1577
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:36,040
is as like a collection, it's, it's more than simply the comics in a line it has,

1578
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:43,400
it will have like, other stuff to it, I guess, like, I don't know how much stuff is not like,

1579
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:47,960
it's going to be like articles and stuff necessarily, yeah, it might be, but like,

1580
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:58,760
like, it's, it's not the exactly the same as the comics individually.

1581
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1582
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,440
It's a, it's a periodical that features submissions.

1583
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:11,240
Uh, I guess, I guess it's, I guess it's basically like,

1584
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,840
I think that any, any potential money from sales is at this point hypothetical,

1585
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,360
is probably not a huge amount, even if it were to ever materialize.

1586
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:27,480
And furthermore, I just think it's un, it's impractical.

1587
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,120
Here's the thing, it's impractical to the point that I think it would stop us from doing it.

1588
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:37,080
If we were to, if we had to maintain some sort of like individual agreement with every individual

1589
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:43,960
submit, submitter, like, okay, if we ever sell this copy of the podcast, of the comic,

1590
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:48,440
you are entitled to, you know, some percentage of the cut of whatever sales are made and we'll

1591
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,200
have to calculate that in the future. If we had to do that for every individual submission,

1592
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,120
I think we would simply be like, it's too much trouble and we're just not going to do it.

1593
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,160
Yes.

1594
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:01,800
So I think, so I think we, I think we need to stipulate, listen, if you give us this thing to

1595
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:06,040
put in the thing, we might print it in the future and we might sell it and it might,

1596
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:09,080
and it will include the thing you gave it to us and you're just, and you're just going to have

1597
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:13,400
to be okay with that. And I, and I feel like it's not unfair.

1598
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,920
Sure. I think comment commenters, let me know what you think about that.

1599
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,520
If you feel like it.

1600
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:24,840
I think, yeah, very clear contract. I know how contracts usually look.

1601
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:30,200
They're so weird and annoying. And you just assume it's fine to just say yes.

1602
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,160
I just have like a little, little explanation.

1603
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:44,120
Uh, like, you know, what you just said, and then yes, no sign here, please, if you want that.

1604
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,320
Right. Right.

1605
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,200
But I think that's.

1606
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,600
But I think that, yes, as long as that's all, that's all good.

1607
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:59,560
We'll just have to figure out a way to like get like an electronic signature or, or just a check box

1608
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:04,840
or, you know, it's something in writing to confirm like, yes, you know, I give you,

1609
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,440
I submit my content under this, under this understanding.

1610
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,040
I'll have to look into how to, how to do that.

1611
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,000
Yeah, I have no idea.

1612
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,960
Yeah, I don't, I don't really either.

1613
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,760
I suppose that could be something that's on the website.

1614
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,120
Like perfect comic party. You click on that.

1615
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,800
You see that things are going to be like, submit your comic and then a link to the email

1616
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,320
or something.

1617
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, under the submission, oh, a submissions page.

1618
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,560
Yeah, something like that.

1619
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,440
Yeah. Yeah, a submissions page is a good idea.

1620
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,320
And on the submissions page, there should be, yeah, like a.

1621
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:47,800
Like, like you type in the information and there would be like a little thing and then

1622
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:55,000
that would create an email to us with, with the, the thing signed and your comic.

1623
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,400
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

1624
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:05,240
Oh, what if, what if someone, what if someone like submitted someone else's comic

1625
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,840
and pretend and, and impersonated them?

1626
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:14,520
Well, if that was the case, hey, I don't know.

1627
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:20,280
How do you verify that the person putting a thing is the person who

1628
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:24,280
has the rights to sign the thing saying that this thing will be the thing?

1629
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,960
I guess if that happened, we would probably have to like,

1630
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:32,760
issue an apology and then like, you know, retract that content from like any future,

1631
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,360
like reissues of the, of the, of the files.

1632
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:41,560
I'm talking, I'm talking about printing at this point, but like, we can, we can,

1633
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:46,760
we can do all this under the assumption of like, we can, we don't have to think about that right

1634
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:52,040
now. Yeah, we can, we can, we can make all the same, we can have all the same stipulations

1635
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:58,280
about, yeah, like a digital PDF and it's fine. I'm thinking about the future.

1636
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,760
No, it's good. It's good to think about the future.

1637
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,840
Empire building, empire building.

1638
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,440
I'm building my empire. I'm building my Gibb and take empire with the, the, the comics on

1639
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:15,560
Amazon and the, the new website and potentially like a Fire Emblem video after I finished

1640
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,640
playing all those games gets, get some new viewers.

1641
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,040
You really think, you really think you might make a video?

1642
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,880
I mean, the possibility is there.

1643
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:30,200
That would be, I mean, I, I ask because like, do I even dare to hope for such a thing?

1644
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,440
Well, I mean, I, I never stopped the, the possibility of making that dark cloud video.

1645
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:41,480
I just have been, you know, I have been playing it in dark cloud too.

1646
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:46,120
Dark cloud and dark cloud too. I was going to play them, get it and make a lore video about

1647
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:54,120
and all of that. But like, and then the Fire Emblem, I mean, initially it was like

1648
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:59,240
the point of that playing all those games is not to make a video,

1649
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:03,560
but the fact that I'm playing all of those games and I'm also streaming the video.

1650
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:10,360
So I have like an archive of all the footage means that it's not out of the realm of possibility,

1651
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:15,640
not that difficult to put together something if I have something to say by the end,

1652
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:22,760
which I probably will. It might just be like a boring like fire and bloom retrospective,

1653
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,040
like I've seen like a billion of those. I never click on them because I'm like,

1654
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:31,080
I haven't played them yet. But how interesting could they possibly be? I have no idea.

1655
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:41,240
I don't know. I don't know either. Yeah, I've got a damn actually earlier when we were talking about

1656
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:47,080
about how your visit was in the summer, not in the winter, like I thought that made me realize

1657
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:53,480
like, oh, I guess, I guess making the Mega Man video didn't take quite as long as maybe it took.

1658
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:58,360
That means that means it didn't take as long as I was thinking it took. That means I,

1659
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,880
that just makes me feel like, ooh, I really should have had another video out by now. Like,

1660
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:07,880
ooh, I really should be. You're taking a potential good thing. Like, oh, that video didn't actually

1661
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,880
take so long. That was quite quick. No, you took it as an opportunity to feel bad about the fact

1662
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:19,720
you've made another video. Yeah, I mean, I thought it took, I guess it took, I remember it thinking

1663
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:24,760
that it took about five months. But I mean, I guess including editing, editing took a little over a

1664
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:31,160
month. Playing the games took a few months. And then I guess it maybe worked a little bit.

1665
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:37,480
Yeah, like the script and the setting up the board and all that. Yeah, it was probably about

1666
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:44,840
five months. But now, ooh, it's been, it's been almost five, it's been about four months.

1667
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:49,160
It's been almost four months since that video came out. And I have not, yeah.

1668
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,640
No way, it's been four months. Well, it's been three and, about three and a half.

1669
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,520
Yeah, that video came out on November, November 20th. What?

1670
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:01,240
I know. I know. It's really bad. It's really bad. And I have really not

1671
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,520
really started. What even was I, oh, I know what I was doing. I was being depressed in January,

1672
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:13,720
that's all. Lol. La-Mow. I have really not- I got my shit together though. My shit is now together.

1673
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:23,000
So epic. No more of that. The hydraulic shit compressor. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think that's what

1674
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,400
it's called. But right, that just makes me think, ooh, I should be further along in the process

1675
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:35,240
of my next video. Ooh, I should be cringing a little bit that I haven't gotten more done.

1676
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:40,200
But on the upside, that makes me think, well, maybe the next one won't take that long. Maybe I

1677
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:45,400
can get the next one done in only a month if I put my mind to it. You are playing the battle

1678
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:51,000
network games, which are much longer to play. That's true. And that's, yeah, that's for like a

1679
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,800
future. That's me working towards an even further in the future, like my next, next lecture.

1680
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,280
Like that's like maybe two videos down the line.

1681
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:05,720
So, I mean, I am putting, yeah, I am putting in work towards that, but that's, but that's not

1682
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:10,360
going to pay off immediately. What I really, what I really need is another video out like in the next

1683
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:17,240
not that long. Just, just so that people that like pledged to my Patreon after the first one,

1684
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:22,840
no like, okay, no, Ben is still making more videos. He's not like, he didn't just make the one and

1685
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:29,160
then he quit the internet and my money is going to nothing. So, you know, I gotta, I gotta get on

1686
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:35,080
that, but I told myself I would go to get on that, but after after I'll get on that

1687
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:42,840
after we get the first, we get the first perfect comic party done, get that published.

1688
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,760
And then I'd start the slime and punishment Kickstarter. And then when that Kickstarter is

1689
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:52,600
underway, then I'll be like, okay, well now that can go in the background. And now's the time when

1690
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,080
like, all right, let's let's actually get down to brass tacks about my next video.

1691
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:02,680
Yeah, which I, which I think I have, I think I have decided is probably going to be at like a

1692
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,720
history of the PCP.

1693
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:07,720
LaMau.

1694
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:14,840
LaMau, lol. Okay. LaMau. Well, I guess that's all I really have to

1695
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:22,840
say about anything. Yeah, my here is like blowing directly on me.

1696
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,240
Perfect. One's the other way.

1697
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:34,280
Yeah, I've got a similar, like I've, Clarissa Gunsmoke chapter five, I haven't been drawing because of

1698
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:41,160
website and Amazon stuff. Right. And perfect comic party. It was like after chapter four was

1699
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:46,600
finished, I was like, ah, that was a good bunch of progress. But then there's all these little bits,

1700
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:51,000
all these little bits of things that need to get done. And they all sort of are holding each other

1701
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,160
up, not exactly holding each other up, but like, all of them are important and all of them need

1702
01:33:55,720 --> 01:34:02,600
my attention. Yeah. So I'm like, I can't really spend like all day drawing. I've got to

1703
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:09,160
figure this stuff out instead. But here you are. But soon, soon I'll be back to getting that stuff

1704
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:17,720
done. That'll be fun. I mean, I really let myself, I really let myself get, get thrown off this past

1705
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:25,880
week with all the various things that, that made me, that made me a rage about the, the RADCON

1706
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:32,360
funds and things. So that didn't, that didn't really help. I didn't really help anything. But

1707
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:40,840
you know, that, that too will be over. That, that too will be a thing of the past soon. One hopes.

1708
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:50,440
Uh, I, I, I, you know, I, I was like, I was about to say that like, I have had to deal with that.

1709
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,960
The truth is, I didn't have to deal with that. The truth is, I could have simply ignored it.

1710
01:34:55,480 --> 01:35:00,840
Which everyone else does or has been doing. And honestly, at the time, I'm like, why is everyone

1711
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:05,400
else ignoring this? Everyone, nobody else cares. I'm the only one that cares. Everyone hates me.

1712
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:11,480
Uh, everyone's against me and my enemy. Um, and you know, in hindsight, I'm like, I should have just,

1713
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:17,720
I should, I should just, I should also. It's better if it's just not, it's better just not

1714
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:23,240
worry about it actually. Everyone else knows that. And I am the only one that doesn't.

1715
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:29,400
It was a little distracting for me when it was all blowing up and you were all getting mad at

1716
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:35,560
people for not saying anything. I'm like, but I don't know. Like the receipts will come when they

1717
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:41,320
come. I mean, I'm, I'm trying to, I'm trying to do stuff. That's true. Yep. That's true. Yep.

1718
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:52,200
Well, I made, I've made a nuisance of myself and uh, anyway, the next topic is uh,

1719
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:57,400
next topic. Oh, oh, nothing. I actually, actually that's everything. I just want to shout out Prince

1720
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:03,320
Isolation. Prince Isolation was in my stream chat and they mentioned they were doing an Aliyup comic.

1721
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:11,080
Oh. An Aliyup from, from Endless War, little, little adventure she's going on. And I, I,

1722
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:16,760
I read it and it was really good. I hope they post it somewhere other than their discord.

1723
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,200
I haven't seen that. The, the person that did the Endless War Aliyup comic

1724
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,800
messaged me and asked about like putting the Aliyup comic in

1725
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:31,320
the perfect comic party. And I told them, definitely submit it. We just haven't worked out like what

1726
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:36,600
the submission process is going to be yet, but like when we have it, like, yeah, absolutely. Uh,

1727
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:47,320
yeah. Yeah. So I get fricking uh, the Aliyup like guest, guest, guest art, like side, side stories.

1728
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:53,080
I guess. I got to bring Belle Jape back. I was thinking of, of, um,

1729
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:59,000
was that, wait, Aliyup, your Aliyup was from Belle Jape, right? Yeah. Yeah. I forgot.

1730
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:06,600
What did, well, what did you think? Well, I just thought she's just one of my characters.

1731
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,360
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, sorry. I'm sorry. I was thinking of Canon Story. She wasn't,

1732
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:15,800
no, she was not in Canon Story. She was from Belle Jape, which is the Pumped one. Yeah. Sorry.

1733
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:19,960
I was, I was mixing the two up. No, no, no. Yeah. She's from the Pumped Belle Jape. Okay.

1734
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:27,160
Yeah. Um, what was I going to say? I don't know. Oh yeah. Yeah. Belle Jape. Belle Jape 2,

1735
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:32,760
I've had ideas of where it could go because they're floating on lava. Spoilers, they're floating on

1736
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:37,960
lava. Right. And I've had many different ideas of where they could float to or what they could have

1737
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:44,120
happen in the larger world. Like, ooh, when does this take place on the timeline? I feel like

1738
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:50,360
originally Belle Jape was just a bunch of bullshit. I was just making it up. I really,

1739
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:57,160
I think I should not focus so much on like pre-planning something like Belle Jape 2.

1740
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,480
I should just get into it when I finish with Clarissa. I think I should just draw. I think I

1741
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:10,920
should just hop on, maybe on a stream like I did before. Just. Is that how you did Belle Jape 1?

1742
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,560
Yeah. I just, I was on YouTube streaming and I was like, what if I just made it? I made a comic.

1743
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:24,360
You know, I made Canon Story on YouTube and a few like commenters,

1744
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:28,920
chatters were like, oh, do this, do that. I was like, okay, there's only like three people there,

1745
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:34,520
but like, it was enough to get me to think about what happens next. And I was like, okay, let's do

1746
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:40,520
the same thing, but this time let's do color. Let's do a little more effort. And that's

1747
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:45,560
turned into something really fun and good and everyone likes it. So like, yeah,

1748
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:49,720
well, I don't need to, I don't need to change it. Belle Jape 2 is going to be like Belle Jape.

1749
01:38:52,200 --> 01:39:00,280
Maybe I could, maybe that's, oh, I'd have to stream more, but like maybe I could do that with

1750
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:03,240
Biscopades, draw it on stream and maybe that could be that. People have mentioned that. I

1751
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:08,280
saw people mentioning that in your Mega Man stream that you should stream. Well, actually,

1752
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:13,560
I can't remember. It was somewhere. Maybe, I don't remember, but maybe somebody said that. Yeah,

1753
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,200
I mean, because like, you know, I think I mentioned that if we're putting it in the

1754
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:25,240
magazine or whatever, then that sort of takes away the like panel by panel, what do you call it,

1755
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:33,160
user suggestion element to a certain degree. But maybe a replacement for that would be,

1756
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:38,840
yeah, I draw it live on stream and people can weigh in on it and be like, I'll do this, do that.

1757
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:46,920
And it's sort of a different kind of, hmm, damn, but I hate Twitch though, but I hate being on stream.

1758
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:54,120
But it makes a lot of sense. Maybe I'll think about that. You don't think about that.

1759
01:39:54,920 --> 01:40:00,920
Because yeah, it would be a little, I was thinking it would feel weird to be like drawing it

1760
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:09,160
just like, yeah, kind of the whole idea of it was like that it would be user submitted,

1761
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:15,560
user suggestions. So maybe that's the way I could recapture that, even though it's changing the

1762
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:21,640
format up a little bit. Just realizing that my process for bell shape, I'll have to go,

1763
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:27,240
I kind of want to go back and check. I think I unlisted all of those, but I think I didn't

1764
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:34,840
know what the text was. I think I drew the image or made the GIF and I had the idea in my head,

1765
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:40,280
like, oh, punk do this, punk do that. But then afterwards, I would put it on the website and

1766
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:48,200
then come up with something funny to write underneath. That's a pretty good system, I think.

1767
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:55,880
I'm commenting on something, but I'd have to do it pretty soon after I draw it.

1768
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:04,440
If that's how the first one got made, then yeah, why not do it again? Why not do it the same?

1769
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:11,560
Follow more or less the same strategy. Everyone likes the same stuff.

1770
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,720
That's right. With the same methodology. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if it worked the first time.

1771
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,400
Imagine if Andrew Hussie finished Homestuck and then tried make Homestuck again.

1772
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:34,120
But this time with green aliens that weren't trolls or chairs. I think he probably

1773
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:44,040
would not do that because like, yeah, Homestuck worked once, but you kind of can't do it again.

1774
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:50,520
Well, the same setting. Yeah. Just sort of like funny little cartoon comic about somebody doing

1775
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,960
some wacky shit in a little place. Well, that's, I mean, and then it grows in scope. Oh, it's a

1776
01:41:55,960 --> 01:42:02,120
perfect formula. You can't go wrong. Did you read Psycholonials? You did read Psycholonials.

1777
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:08,120
Yeah. Yeah. Are you, I can't tell if you're serious, like he should have just done that.

1778
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:16,680
I mean, I think I would have enjoyed reading whatever he did in a comic style,

1779
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:22,520
in a Homestuck problem-sleuth comic style, just because I like the way he comes up with the

1780
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:30,840
comedy with all the little bits. Yeah. And with Homestuck was a lot of the funny dialogue and

1781
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:36,520
heartfelt character stuff, but Problem Sleuth was like, meat and potatoes sort of,

1782
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:43,240
what if there was a comic and it was like this? It's like, I love that, more please,

1783
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,800
but there was no more. So you're saying that you think he should have gone back and made

1784
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:53,800
another Problem Sleuth rather than another Homestuck? Yeah, you don't need to do everything

1785
01:42:53,800 --> 01:43:01,800
the same, because like the way Act Six sort of deviated into teen melodrama a little too hard

1786
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:09,160
and a little too verbose and like overly, overly big text all the time, so much text,

1787
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:13,160
and it just really wasn't that useful. It really wasn't that interesting.

1788
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:22,840
SpongeBob yelling at the burger meme, you forgot the funny! Definitely. Yeah. I mean, I think I've

1789
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:29,400
said many times that like, yeah, pound for pound, I do have to say Problem Sleuth is a better work

1790
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:35,320
because it wastes less of your fucking time. It just introduces concepts and then just takes them

1791
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:41,480
to that logical extreme in a big finale, which is completely insane compared to what Star says.

1792
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:47,480
The finale wraps it all up so cleanly. It's like so many like things introduced earlier,

1793
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:52,280
it all comes first full circle and they come back and the scope gets bigger and bigger and

1794
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:58,040
bigger and then it all comes together in the end remarkably, remarkably clean in a way that Homestuck

1795
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:06,760
did not manage, I'm sorry to say, but yeah. You know, I liked Psycholonials. It was definitely

1796
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:16,200
not that. Yeah, it was, I liked it. It was, I thought the ending was a bit dumb, but you know.

1797
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:19,560
Basically what I'm saying is the Beljapes- Moment to moment, I thought it was enjoyable.

1798
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,240
Beljapes Problem Sleuth and I'm doing Problem Sleuth now. I'm the one who does it.

1799
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:28,040
Right. Beljapes Problem Sleuth and Clarissa is Homestuck?

1800
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:36,600
Is Whistles the Clown. Right, yeah. What if Andrew Hussey made another Whistles?

1801
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:39,880
What if he continued Whistles? That would be pretty good.

1802
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:46,040
That would be amazing. That would actually be- That would require him to sit down and do something.

1803
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:53,560
Yeah, true. I mean, his comics were really good. Like, the art in Whistles is like really nice.

1804
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,520
Yep. So, I think a lot of people would probably really appreciate that.

1805
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:03,640
I mean, a lot of his core fans would probably be like, oh my god, Whistles 3?

1806
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:12,760
That kind of seems like a Hussey thing to do, actually, is just surprise everyone by just

1807
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:16,440
picking up an old idea that everyone thought was completely abandoned and being like,

1808
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:19,640
yeah, I fully committed to it and I finished it while no one was looking.

1809
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:27,080
He says he'll be coy about like, I'm coming back to a thing and everyone think it'll be Whistles,

1810
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:33,640
but then it's BardQuest. Yeah. He'll fully finish BardQuest and everyone will be like, oh, okay.

1811
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:41,320
Okay, cool. Thanks. I appreciate it. That would be a Hussey thing to do.

1812
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:46,440
I was really wondering what the Bard was going to do next. Now I know. Yeah.

1813
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:53,240
This is going to level up. I'll take what I can get.

1814
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:58,200
Fun fact. This is obvious, but I don't know if people even think about it.

1815
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:05,720
Belljape sounds like jailbreak. True. That's why it's like that.

1816
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:09,800
Okay. I know that. I was aware of that.

1817
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:16,600
All the people who minds blown, say so in the comments. Say that your mind was blown if it was.

1818
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,920
All right. You finished typing? You finished typing down there? All right. Thank you.

1819
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,080
The only other thing I did this week was I made bombed hands, esteemed hands meme.

1820
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:39,160
Yeah. I saw that. I don't know. I think it was just sort of like, it was in the

1821
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:42,280
thralls of all of the bullshit and I just needed something to distract me.

1822
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:50,680
Right. And I thought of the funniest idea. I don't know why this made me buckle over,

1823
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:57,560
on the floor. I lost all of the breath when I made esteemed hands,

1824
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:01,320
but it was lamp oil, rope and bombs where the things being discussed.

1825
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:05,080
Yeah. I watched it and I was like,

1826
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:10,600
it's so basic. This doesn't really, this doesn't really track.

1827
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,120
Esteemed lamp oil.

1828
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:19,480
It just, it killed me. I don't know why. Even just thinking about it.

1829
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:24,200
You just love lamp oil and rope and bombs. Just admit that you just like those things.

1830
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:29,080
I don't need to admit it. I say that all the time. It's not a secret.

1831
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,360
Okay. Good.

1832
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:41,320
I love, I love, I think something about it. It's a very basic idea. It's like the default

1833
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:48,760
bread, but I haven't seen it before. And something about it being such a basic idea,

1834
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:54,440
taking two memes and putting them together, but like not in a smart way, not in a,

1835
01:47:54,920 --> 01:48:00,520
and it's not an effort shitpost. It's truly the laziest little joke.

1836
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:08,040
It just completely destroys me, especially the super bit crushed.

1837
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,720
From like 14 years ago, I downloaded the lamp oil, rope and bombs line,

1838
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:21,800
like the original upload. And it's like 240p, 144p sound quality.

1839
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:29,560
Ah, can't go wrong. Can't go wrong with lamp oil.

1840
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:38,280
Gigi, you can't and you didn't. And you know, I watched the video and I just kind of like

1841
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:44,600
had my fingers steepled in front of me and I'm just nodding like mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm,

1842
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,640
yep, lamp oil, rope, bombs, got it, got it.

1843
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:56,200
I think as well, the fact that it's not that funny to other people makes it funny.

1844
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:03,240
It took, and it took a while, and it took a while for like the lamp oil, rope and bombs to even

1845
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:08,280
count. So it's like the first minute I'm just kind of like, when's, when's the, when's the joke?

1846
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:15,160
Like the first time he is like, but what if I were to purchase bombs? That's the first time

1847
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:20,600
it happens. Yeah. And then it's just normal for so long. And then he says, oh, that's the steamed

1848
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:24,600
rope. It's just it takes such a long time for the second one.

1849
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:32,440
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no, I, I,

1850
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:42,760
you're making me, you're, I'm, I'm laughing, I'm laughing at the thought of how much you enjoy

1851
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:50,520
making it. I know. I think I enjoy the fact that I enjoyed making it, which makes it funnier.

1852
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:55,880
It's like multiplicative. Right, right, right. I think I piqued the mic a couple times there.

1853
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:05,720
That's not so good. That's good. That's fine. Uh, LeMau, uh, well. Oh, that I needed that one.

1854
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:13,400
That's what I needed in my life. Uh, how's, uh, how's Runescape? Oh, I'm glad you asked.

1855
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:21,880
Yeah. Runescapes go in great. I have gotten, uh, I've been mining coal and adamantite ore

1856
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:27,640
in just, just, you know, casually while I rewatch on cinema at the cinema again.

1857
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:35,160
Uh, love that series. I talked about that before. I said I may have done, I may,

1858
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:39,320
there's one of the potential lecture subjects that I could have talked about.

1859
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:46,040
Oh, wait. What was it? On cinema at the cinema. Oh, god, I've been meaning to watch that for years.

1860
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:53,480
Yeah. It's the Tim Heidecker, like fake movie review show turned into like, you know, drama,

1861
01:50:54,040 --> 01:51:01,800
like, like real drama, like big joke. It's fun. Uh, there's not a good explanation of what it is,

1862
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:06,600
but, uh. I know that like, it involves like, like they had like characters and they would

1863
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:12,840
like tweet in character. They, yeah, Tim Heidecker and Greg Tarkington using their real names play

1864
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:21,080
two movie reviewers, um, who are both have terrible taste in movies. Uh, one of them is a

1865
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:25,400
pretentious snob about how much, despite not knowing that much, and the other one

1866
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:32,520
is an arrogant, uh, egomaniac who thinks that he deserves everything in the world

1867
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:39,720
for his shitty show that's terrible. Um, and they hate each other, but they need each other

1868
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:44,680
and they just continually make this show and they have like the, the highlights are the,

1869
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:50,840
the Oscar specials where they do a live stream. Every Oscars, I guess they'll be doing one,

1870
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:55,400
like this year, but it might be behind a paywall. I think they've paywalled stuff.

1871
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:00,920
That's a, that's a certain, a certain point. They stopped posting like publicly. You gotta

1872
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:07,640
subscribe to a thing to see new episodes. And I'm like, eh, whatever. I'm, I can't be bothered for

1873
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:15,640
that. Um, but the, the, the, the on cinema live specials, live Oscar specials where the Oscars

1874
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:22,520
is happening and they live stream a movie show, like discussing the Oscars and who's gonna win.

1875
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:32,200
And, uh, it's just a big farce. It's an opportunity for Tim to like get drunk or like fake drunk.

1876
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:37,400
He does drink actual booze, I think, but he's like faking being like a real,

1877
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:44,760
like a abusive like guy who like shouts at people and throw stuff and trashes the place.

1878
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:53,720
And it's just great. It's just, it's just really fun. I, and it's, it's really fun, especially

1879
01:52:53,720 --> 01:53:00,520
during the live broadcasts, because you can, you can notice moments where like the characters break

1880
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,920
and they can't stop laughing. They really try to hold it in. They never like completely break,

1881
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:09,720
but there's like moments where Tim or Greg, they're like, they try and stifle a laugh because

1882
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:15,640
it's so absurd what's happening. I, my friend of mine was telling me about it and he said that

1883
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:24,440
there's like, he said that there's a timeline somewhere. There is. There's a, yeah. It includes

1884
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:28,760
like their, their, like their, cause it includes like out of show stuff, like their tweets and

1885
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,880
stuff that are kind of like part of it. Uh, and, and I don't know what else is involved, but it's

1886
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:41,000
like, yeah, they started as a little podcast. I think it was a podcast of like a basic idea of

1887
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,680
like, what if two guys have a really half-assed movie review show, whether they don't have anything

1888
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:52,920
to say at all and they would record it on their phone whenever they were together, just as like a

1889
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:58,120
little bit and then people liked it. So they continued it into, until it became a show.

1890
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:07,720
God, how many seasons, season nine, the trial, season 10, season 11, that only goes to 2019,

1891
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:14,440
this timeline. I know they, I know they've done, I'm pretty sure they've done more.

1892
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:21,080
I guess I'll, it's an, it's an outdated timeline.

1893
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:30,200
But yeah, after season 11, they sort of had their own website where they would post episodes

1894
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:35,800
and stuff. And so I guess, because Adult Swim was not backing it as much,

1895
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:41,320
they couldn't, they, they couldn't really keep doing the stuff unless they had the money. So

1896
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:49,800
fan funded from that point, I guess. But they, they, they do it in universe where Tim is like

1897
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,720
a grifter, like an Alex Jones type, like trying to get your money.

1898
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:59,080
Selling brain pills, yeah. Yeah, all that sort of stuff. He plays all those sorts of like,

1899
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:09,080
like nasty people roles. And it's fun. Yeah. But anyway, that's what I've been doing.

1900
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:12,280
It sounds, it's all, yeah, it sounds really cool. And I've been meaning to, I've been meaning to

1901
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:15,720
watch it. People told me about it years ago and I was like, oh, that sounds really cool. That

1902
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:20,840
sounds really interesting. Oh, what an avant-garde work of postmodern deconstruction.

1903
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:33,240
Where is it? Can I share the playlist? What a, what a deconstruction of the way that the modern

1904
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:42,360
media is disseminated, popular culture. Right. This is on cinema, Decker, Decker and Decker.

1905
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:53,080
Decker is like a, like a, a James Bond, like a Tim High Decker is James Bond kind of guy.

1906
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:56,760
Well, not James Bond. He would hate that. He's just, he's just so short. They're like two minutes

1907
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:01,320
long. These are the podcasts at the beginning. You can scroll down to the first episode. You

1908
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:04,200
might want to start with those. This is just the playlist that has everything in it.

1909
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:12,120
And yeah, on cinema season one, episode 101, the first few seem to be out of order.

1910
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:15,880
These podcasts are two minutes. I'll just, I'll, why not listen to them as well?

1911
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:19,720
There's like 50 of them, but yeah, you can listen to them, get an idea of it.

1912
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:28,200
I recommend that the time investment. I assume these are in chronological order.

1913
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:31,400
Yeah. There's a few that look like they're out of chronological order,

1914
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:36,680
but they are not. I double checked. Okay. Something about the, the titling was wrong,

1915
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:41,240
but yeah. Right. I'm gonna, this is good. Thanks for the link. I'll probably,

1916
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:47,560
probably watch this or watch this or wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1917
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:53,400
Okay. Hang on. Some of these are dated that they're seven years ago, but maybe they were like

1918
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:57,080
posted seven years ago, but they're actually older than that. They are a bit older than that.

1919
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:01,400
Okay. Okay. I think the, the show started in like 2012.

1920
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:08,280
Yeah. And the podcast was before that. So the podcast was not uploaded to YouTube till later.

1921
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:14,920
It was an iTunes podcast. Little iTunes show. Gotcha.

1922
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:22,360
But yeah, I've been, I've been re-watching this while I play RuneScape. I have now

1923
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:30,520
2,759 adamantite ore, which is what I need for my fletching challenge. So I no longer need

1924
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:41,240
Addy. And now I just need, I need 160,000 more coal. I'm just going to mine some coal for a long

1925
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:48,360
time. Oh, and I've hit level 92 mining. That's a big milestone. Apparently-

1926
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:57,800
Max? No, Max is 99, but the, because of the way, excuse me, because of the way that

1927
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:05,960
the, the experience like escalates, what's the word, over time, it's a-

1928
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,840
The progression or-

1929
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:14,120
Exponential. It's an exponential curve. The halfway point from level one to 99 is level

1930
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:19,800
92, apparently. I see, yeah. So I'm halfway there. Gotcha.

1931
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:25,320
I think I will get beyond the experience for 99 getting all of this coal.

1932
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:31,800
Are the benefits also like exponential? Like is it like a, is it a significantly big jump from like

1933
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:37,560
level 92 to level 93? Like in terms of what it actually gives you?

1934
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:44,680
Not really. There's, on the, on the wiki, there's a little graph that shows you the,

1935
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:54,040
the percentage chance to mine a particular rock every tick, every game tick at specific mining

1936
01:58:54,040 --> 01:59:00,840
levels. And for the more difficult to mine things, even at level 99, it only gets as high as like

1937
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:07,640
20%. But for some things, you can get to a like 100%, like iron ore at a certain point

1938
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:13,960
is 100%. Like every game tick you click on it, you instantly get it. So it's, it's really not

1939
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:21,160
that useful to get to level 99 for most people, other than like bragging rights and for the

1940
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:27,880
few occasional very, very high skill requirement things. So it's not so much you are good at

1941
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:31,880
mining. It's that you can physically mine certain things that other people can't.

1942
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:37,640
Like amethyst. I can mine amethyst now, but it's, I'm not a member.

1943
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:41,240
But it doesn't make you better at mining the things you could already mine.

1944
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:45,320
It does, but just not, not that much. I see. Okay.

1945
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:53,080
So like getting from level 91 to 92 is like one experience, a one percentage chance increase

1946
01:59:53,080 --> 02:00:00,200
for like coal. Right. But it, but it takes like 10 times as much experience to get that extra one

1947
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:06,280
percent. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like a thing you need to do. That's why, that's why RuneScape is

1948
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:13,880
stupid, but I love it. Sure. It's so pointless. I think the best, I mean, the best games are

1949
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:21,640
a little bit like fucked up. If everything, if everything is like perfectly balanced and perfect,

1950
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:26,040
it's like the games, like you can't make a game like that. That's not like kind of boring.

1951
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:33,160
A system that's totally, well, even chess, you know, who goes first, white or black, you know,

1952
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:38,600
it's not perfectly balanced. That's probably not, that's probably not actually true,

1953
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:43,240
but a lot of the time, you know, a game being unbalanced or like weird.

1954
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:50,920
It's not so much that it's unbalanced. It's just that the time sink and the way you get

1955
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:58,120
the experience in old school RuneScape was so, it was just so tedious that most people

1956
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:07,080
wouldn't bother, which kind of made it so much more prestigious of a thing to get to the maximum

1957
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:13,880
skill. Yeah. Because you have to be kind of insane to bother. Yeah. I feel, yeah. I feel, yeah.

1958
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:20,520
Yeah. So it's like, yeah, like no normal person is going to go for 99.

1959
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:26,840
Yeah. And even beyond that, there's loads of people on YouTube who do like extreme

1960
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:38,200
challenge runs of like many different types to like hand cuff themselves in like ridiculous

1961
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:45,640
fashions. Have I talked about Settled before? I think I have. I mentioned his like Mauritania

1962
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:52,040
locked. Oh, yeah, you've mentioned them. Yeah. But there's other ones where like you, there's like a

1963
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:59,640
lot of people who like stick to a chunk and they have to perform some sort of action within that

1964
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:05,080
chunk or every action possible within that chunk before they can unlock a different chunk. And

1965
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:12,120
a chunk is just sort of a loaded like grid square of like a bunch of like at some distance.

1966
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:17,400
You know, like in Minecraft, they have chunks. You mean blocks?

1967
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:26,440
Not blocks, but like biome chunks? Chunks that are like loaded in. So like if you are in one

1968
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:33,240
chunk, it sort of loads one chunk at a time. So if you walk towards something, the whole

1969
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:42,200
chunk will load at once. It's just like an area of 250 something squared grid on the ground.

1970
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:49,880
Gotcha. But anyway, you have like accounts that are built to be stuck in a particular

1971
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:55,960
chunk and have to try and figure out how to either gain enough experience doing the like

1972
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:02,520
really inefficient methods of gaining experience that exist in that chunk to achieve some kind of

1973
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:09,880
goal for themselves. Like people take RuneScape, an already tedious game, and make it far more

1974
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:17,400
tedious and they love it. And I love watching it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're there to,

1975
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:23,960
if you're there for the tedium, if you're there, if that's if you're there to grind.

1976
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:32,360
It's the grindiest game there ever was. The Sigma grind set. No, it's something

1977
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:43,240
higher. The Ligma grind set. There you go. That's when that's when you love that's when you're

1978
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:48,600
such a hustler that you grind just for the sake of grinding. You're not even getting anything out of

1979
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:56,200
it. You're not even making any money. You're not winning anything. The true grind is just for the sake

1980
02:03:56,200 --> 02:04:01,640
of the grind. You love toil. Yes, you love toil so much. We're all house elves over here.

1981
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:09,320
We just love it. We love being enslaved and toiling forever. It's what we want. Please don't give me

1982
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:16,520
the sock. Don't give me the sock or I'll give you the cock. You read Harry Potter, right?

1983
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:23,640
Yeah, it's a little bit of a cultural juggernaut when I was the perfect age to be reading it.

1984
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:28,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I read, I read the first book I read, actually, it was the first book I

1985
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:35,720
could read by myself without parents is the first Harry Potter book. I was reading, I was reading

1986
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:45,800
Animorphs. I was reading Animorphs before Harry Potter. I think, I think, yeah. But I read Dita

1987
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:54,520
Jackson's review of the Hogwarts legacy. And they said, you know, of course, I read the

1988
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:59,560
damn books. Everybody read the damn books. That was my age at that time. And

1989
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:08,680
their, their, their review on polygon was really good. I liked it. I watched Yahtzee's,

1990
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:13,400
I watched a zero punctuation for the first time in a long time. I watched Yahtzee's review of

1991
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:24,120
Hogwarts legacies. Oh, yeah. Also, the long story short, the game is, everybody seems to,

1992
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:29,240
everybody seems to agree on the things that are not that good about the game. And it's just that

1993
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:36,200
it just kind of feels like a very sort of like flat and not really that deep or immersive. It's

1994
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:40,440
an open world, but it's all just kind of like, I don't know, people seem to think it's not that,

1995
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:45,640
it's not that magical. It's all, it's all, it's all just kind of by the numbers.

1996
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:54,600
Yeah. Very, well, what do they say? Gita said like, you know, like in the, in the context,

1997
02:05:54,600 --> 02:06:00,760
like they, they, they tried to make legacy as unrolling as possible. They tried to divorce

1998
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:05,720
it as much as they could from like, you know, they put it, they put a trans character in there.

1999
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:11,560
They made, they gave it a bunch. I mean, I saw the trans character and I thought it was like,

2000
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:17,560
I don't know. Well, what was the, what was the name of the trans character? It was like,

2001
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:23,400
yeah, they had some, some, some male sounding name. It was like a mean spirited sort of joke.

2002
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:28,520
Like, well, we'll, we'll give you a trans character like that. I didn't, it didn't feel

2003
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:33,560
right, but I didn't care. Well, I'm not sure. I'm not really sure what the mindset was there,

2004
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:38,280
but I, I don't know. Gita said that it felt like they tried to divorce it from that and they tried

2005
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:42,520
to make it more inclusive. They put more, you know, they put more like people of color. They put

2006
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:46,280
more like, they put, I think there's like Indians or there's like people from Africa and stuff

2007
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:53,400
in, in there. And it's like, okay, cool, I guess, but it kind of just, it kind of just serves to

2008
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:59,080
remind you that the books aren't like this. Like, like it's actually kind of weird that the, that

2009
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:05,080
the game is like so much more like diverse and inclusive when it's set in like 1885. And then

2010
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:11,000
you read the books that are set in like, you know, the nineties or whatever. And it's like,

2011
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,640
where did all the minorities go? It just makes you wonder like, what happened?

2012
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:21,160
There were minorities in the books. There's a, there's a hand, there's a handful of them.

2013
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:21,560
There's a handful of them. There's a hand full of them. There's a hand full of them. There's a

2014
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:26,800
hand full of them. There's a hand full of them, Xiao Cheng. There's a, I, there's a handful.

2015
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:31,960
Yeah. That's what you get. That's what you get. When you get Xiao Cheng, there's like,

2016
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:39,240
okay, there's like two black kids. There's a, there's the one who is like,

2017
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:46,040
the, the Gryffindor announcer kid. I forgot his name. Tom B NZ.

2018
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:50,920
No, he has an Irish name.

2019
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:56,560
Sean Finnegan, I thought that was the white boy in the film.

2020
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,160
No, that's not Seamus.

2021
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,800
Oh, Seamus, yeah.

2022
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:02,720
There's Seamus Finnegan, but that's not who I'm that's not who I'm thinking of.

2023
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,160
People of Colored Future and Harry Potter.

2024
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,320
What's the he's a Gryffindor kid.

2025
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:12,720
And in the movie, it was Thomas something or like Derek.

2026
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,440
Dean Thomas, Dean Thomas.

2027
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:15,440
Yes. Yes.

2028
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:18,440
See, I didn't I didn't even realize he was black reading in the books,

2029
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:21,240
but like he might have been like, you know, fair enough.

2030
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:26,000
There was another there's a there's a there's a Slytherin kid named Blaise

2031
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,120
Zabini, who is mentioned completely offhand like once.

2032
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:33,800
And then in like book six, he has like one interaction with Harry.

2033
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,000
There's Cho Chang, there's the Patel sisters.

2034
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,400
There's Oh, no, it's Lee Jordan.

2035
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:41,800
No, wait, hang on.

2036
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,520
OK, Lee Jordan and Dean Thomas are both black in the movies.

2037
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:48,480
And I think maybe only one of them is mentioned to be black in the books.

2038
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:52,320
And I didn't even notice something like that.

2039
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:55,240
Right. But it's literally like a handful of characters.

2040
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,960
Did I did I mention those?

2041
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:03,000
Oh, and of course, and who could forget who could forget Kingsley Shacklebolt?

2042
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:07,200
Yes, the weirdest fucking name.

2043
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:10,840
Yeah. And then in the movie, they give him that.

2044
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:12,440
They give him that hat.

2045
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:16,160
I don't know, something something weird about Kingsley Shacklebolt.

2046
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,640
Yeah, but he's a bad ass.

2047
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,120
But he's kind of a bad looks cool.

2048
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:24,600
And he's a he's a he's a.

2049
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:26,400
I don't know. I think he's fucking stupid.

2050
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,680
It looks dumb. It's probably insensitive of me.

2051
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:32,480
But in the but it's not like a traditional African sort of guy.

2052
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,040
Yep. Yeah, probably.

2053
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:36,680
Well, that's what that's weird, though.

2054
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:40,000
Isn't that weird that they gave that they made the one black adult?

2055
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,440
They gave him this like freak.

2056
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,880
They gave him like a freaking African.

2057
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:48,040
It's like they put him in that, you know, that orange, like patterned fabric

2058
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:53,560
that that all the fricking Democratic senators wore when they knelt

2059
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:56,760
on the Senate floor that one time during the BLM thing.

2060
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:59,200
I don't know what that is at all.

2061
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:06,880
Hang on, senators kneeling African cloth.

2062
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:10,200
Here we go. Found it. First result.

2063
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:14,640
Senators kneeling the Kente cloth, the Kente cloth.

2064
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,560
And I don't know what it is.

2065
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,640
I just know it's an African thing.

2066
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:21,880
I mean, African clothing is like very colorful and cool.

2067
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:23,240
Sure.

2068
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:26,240
It's oh, no.

2069
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:28,520
It's just a bit.

2070
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:31,280
I don't know. It's just a bit weird that there's one black adult

2071
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:34,920
and there's one named black adult and they gave him this like traditional

2072
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,880
African garb.

2073
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:39,480
Like, why isn't he just dressed like a wizard, you know?

2074
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,360
Maybe he's nobody else.

2075
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,840
Where's that hat?

2076
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:45,720
Maybe he's from Africa and they have different ways.

2077
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:46,560
Well, maybe he.

2078
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:48,440
Well, maybe he is.

2079
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:49,640
I mean, it's fine.

2080
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:51,320
It's fine the way he looked.

2081
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,120
But it's fine.

2082
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,480
Blaze Zabini doesn't wear a hat.

2083
02:10:55,320 --> 02:10:57,640
So it's OK, I guess.

2084
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:02,400
I'm talking about the I don't know

2085
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:09,440
if I mentioned on the podcast before, but I remember reading that, you know,

2086
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:15,200
JK Rowling in one of her many moments, I forget which moment she was just

2087
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:18,760
doing some stuff and just getting controversy and controversy and stuff

2088
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:21,320
could have just been general.

2089
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:24,720
But the people, you know, the actors of Harry Potter, they were like,

2090
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,600
yeah, we don't like what JK Rowling is saying.

2091
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:30,720
But the ones that defended her saying, this is outrageous.

2092
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:35,840
You can't attack a woman for being a woman or whatever the fuck they said.

2093
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:36,280
Right.

2094
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:36,720
Right.

2095
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,640
And they're just defending her.

2096
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,720
I don't even think they knew too much, but like it was funny to me.

2097
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:46,840
It was amusing that there was the actors for Bellatrix Lestrange

2098
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:48,840
and Lord Voldemort.

2099
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:51,040
Those are the only ones.

2100
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:52,640
The villains.

2101
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:54,720
I think Luna Lovegood, too.

2102
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:55,800
Oh, no.

2103
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:56,760
Yeah, no.

2104
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:59,040
I think I saw Luna Lovegood saying,

2105
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:03,960
hey, she's just she's just defending women's spaces.

2106
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:09,280
She's just speaking up for the right of women to have male free spaces.

2107
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:12,680
What do you want them to be raped?

2108
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:14,920
Stop it.

2109
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,680
Yes, leave her alone.

2110
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:18,680
Yes.

2111
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,080
Do it.

2112
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:25,520
It's just so I love sexual assault.

2113
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,240
Hmm.

2114
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:33,160
As a as a leftist, as a radical leftist, I do love sexual assault.

2115
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,600
Clip that. Clip that, everybody.

2116
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:43,920
But yeah, that's been playing the Fire Emblem and the play in the RuneScape.

2117
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:49,040
Oh, and I continued watching Utena, which is good.

2118
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:50,600
And also.

2119
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:55,160
Star Trek, the next generation.

2120
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:58,040
I'm just watching that every so often now.

2121
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:00,000
Put on an episode of Star Trek.

2122
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:03,120
Yeah, the good old that I never watched the entire show before.

2123
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:04,880
I've seen like bits on TV.

2124
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:07,240
So I'm like, fuck it.

2125
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:09,040
Same. I like filling.

2126
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:12,160
I feel I like filling the hours with good stuff instead of crap.

2127
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:19,560
Yeah, I've seen a bunch of episodes that I used to just catch one here and there on

2128
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,240
on TV sometimes.

2129
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:25,800
I think I've mentioned that like when I was a little kid and I would see it was

2130
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,320
the next generation, usually, I would I would sometimes catch the show when I

2131
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:37,960
stayed up late and I would be like, when are they going to get like where they're going?

2132
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:41,040
Like, is there an episode later where like,

2133
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:42,680
we made it, we made it.

2134
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,960
Yeah, we got to Earth or we got to.

2135
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:49,000
I mean, I guess in Voyager, they are literally like trying to get back to Earth.

2136
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:53,400
Or no, no, Deep Space Nine is that one of them is like that.

2137
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:55,880
The Enterprise.

2138
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:57,840
I think it's just called the Enterprise.

2139
02:13:58,040 --> 02:13:59,240
I don't know. I don't know Star Trek.

2140
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:01,360
I've never watched Star Trek.

2141
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:05,960
But they the first episode, they're just going.

2142
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:10,720
They're leaving Earth and they they have like Q appears and he's like,

2143
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:13,200
huh, humans, you suck.

2144
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:15,920
And they're like picked hearts like no.

2145
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:19,160
Wait, they're leaving Earth in the first episode.

2146
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:24,000
They're they're yeah, they're leaving Earth and they're going to go out to explore

2147
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:26,000
and see stuff. That's the the idea.

2148
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:30,520
And Q is there saying humans are so war like and monstrous.

2149
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,160
I'm here to stop you.

2150
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:36,040
I'm here to tell you to go back or perish and then Picard convinces him with a

2151
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:43,160
speech that actually humans have evolved beyond the war from the past.

2152
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:44,400
And we're good now.

2153
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:46,400
We're Star Trek.

2154
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:48,320
And everyone says Star Trek.

2155
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:54,600
And then Q is like, you will not stand between us and our trek through the stars.

2156
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:56,000
Our Star Trek.

2157
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:59,080
And everyone said, oh, my God, he said it.

2158
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:05,120
Q said, hmm, that would be okay, but I'll be keeping an eye on you, little boy.

2159
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:06,520
And then he disappeared.

2160
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,040
And that's the first episode.

2161
02:15:08,240 --> 02:15:10,960
And so the idea is beyond that.

2162
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:13,720
I guess they're just going out into the world.

2163
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,720
Yes, as an explorer exploratory just seeing seeing what's going on.

2164
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:23,440
He says at the beginning of every episode, what, you know, seek seek out new life

2165
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,840
and new new frontiers.

2166
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:29,080
Yeah, yeah, classic classic.

2167
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:31,240
That space is so big, you guys.

2168
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:32,880
So I really what's in there?

2169
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:37,040
I really should have paid attention and maybe I wouldn't have had that expectation then.

2170
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:40,280
But is it the first episode?

2171
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:44,440
I think it's no, I think it's I think it's like most episodes start with

2172
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,080
or maybe they end with that narration.

2173
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:47,960
He says that a lot.

2174
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:52,320
I think it does start that before like the song comes in.

2175
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:53,480
It's either.

2176
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:03,480
It's either Deep Space Nine or Voyager that like the premise of the show is

2177
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:08,480
like there's a warp malfunction and they end up stranded somewhere like far from

2178
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:13,320
the Federation and it's like the show is about like them trying to

2179
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,440
trying to survive on their way back.

2180
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:21,800
Yeah, I don't I thought Deep Space Nine was like a space station rather than a ship.

2181
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,120
Oh, I think so.

2182
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:26,040
They deal with the comings and goings of different people.

2183
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:29,680
Yeah, but they are stationary, generally speaking.

2184
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:31,080
It's probably Voyager.

2185
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:34,440
That's the we have to get back.

2186
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,200
Back to the future.

2187
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:41,160
So there's the Star Trek, then there's the next generation, meaning

2188
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:43,400
and we're doing Star Trek again.

2189
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:46,600
I think original Star Trek is just we're just going out and going out.

2190
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,720
Fine stuff. Yeah, I'm thinking of the subtitle.

2191
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:50,320
So like

2192
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:54,320
so Star Trek and then Star Trek, the next generation, AKA Star Trek.

2193
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:57,960
But we did it at second time as smarter, smarter this time.

2194
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,840
Then Star Trek Deep Space Nine was next,

2195
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:04,440
which is takes place on a deep space, the ninth one.

2196
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:08,880
And then Star Trek Voyagers were voyaging.

2197
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:10,680
Star Trek.

2198
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:11,760
Was that it?

2199
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:14,160
There was another one, wasn't there?

2200
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:19,520
I mean, I think Star Trek Expedition, Star Trek,

2201
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:24,160
Travel Agency and Star.

2202
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:28,880
I mean, I'm I know there's like later ones, like there's that animated one.

2203
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,280
And I think there's one.

2204
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:35,960
Well, I'm thinking of the before before it got reinvigorated with like J.J. Abrams

2205
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,200
movies and stuff. Wait a fucking second.

2206
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:43,400
There was an animated series between the original series and next generation.

2207
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:45,680
What? What the fuck?

2208
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:47,440
Yeah, I'm animated in what way.

2209
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:49,840
What do they look like? Is it like Thundercats?

2210
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:52,880
I said like kind of.

2211
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:56,120
Yeah, it looks like this.

2212
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:57,640
You know, I've seen these care.

2213
02:17:57,640 --> 02:17:59,040
I've seen these drawings before.

2214
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,440
Wait, yeah, I've seen I've seen the one where it's like like Spock.

2215
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:04,880
He's like putting his face over his hand.

2216
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:09,280
Or he's like hand over his face like yeah.

2217
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,240
OK, well, I forgot about that.

2218
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:14,440
There's the original series, the animated series, the next generation,

2219
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:18,040
Deep Space Nine Voyager Enterprise.

2220
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:20,920
Well, what the remember that just as you were saying what what happens.

2221
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,640
Well, OK, there's Enterprise and then like

2222
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:26,320
13 years later, they made Discovery.

2223
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:28,320
And I think that's kind of when the yeah.

2224
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,600
What is it? What is Enterprise?

2225
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:31,800
Enterprise, I don't know.

2226
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:32,840
I've just heard of it.

2227
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:38,000
I only know Star Trek through Mike's The Class and Rich Evans.

2228
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:40,720
And they have talked about all the shows a little bit.

2229
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:44,360
Follows the adventure of the first crew of the Starship Enterprise.

2230
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:47,400
Who's the who's who's the captain?

2231
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:49,600
Is it Archer, Jonathan Archer?

2232
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:52,720
Jonathan Archer, yeah, it was a guy.

2233
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:55,440
Voyager was a lady.

2234
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:57,880
I've like literally never seen this guy before.

2235
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:00,720
Played by Scott Bakula. OK.

2236
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:04,320
More like yeah, Voyager is Janeway.

2237
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:07,000
Janeway, and I think I think the people's

2238
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,280
impression of Janeway is that she's sort of like a

2239
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:14,320
she's sort of a loose cannon, like she sort of like breaks protocol.

2240
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:18,040
Just when she feels like it.

2241
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:24,000
That's what I've heard people say about her is that she's kind of a renegade.

2242
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,640
In a way that like, like, you know,

2243
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:31,120
freaking Picard would be like he would like, you know, he would he would call a

2244
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:34,800
freaking council and be like, let's have a vote on like what the what the

2245
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,800
Federation would want us to do in the situation.

2246
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:44,680
And Janeway will just be like, damn, damn the the the the prime director.

2247
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:48,200
We're all going to die. Get out. Fire the torpedoes.

2248
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:49,120
I might be completely.

2249
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,200
Shoot everybody you see.

2250
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,400
Don't even don't don't wait for my command.

2251
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,680
I might don't even wait for my command.

2252
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:55,960
I might be wrong about that.

2253
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:59,880
That's just what I feel like I've picked up through the grapevine.

2254
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,680
You have. Yeah, I'm enjoying enterprise.

2255
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,720
I really, really like.

2256
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,760
Every time I see the next generation,

2257
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:11,360
I'm like, that is the coziest place I've ever seen that that set.

2258
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,480
Yeah.

2259
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:15,280
Like the fact that the new shows are so dark.

2260
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:18,440
I'm like, yeah, but like life is dark.

2261
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:20,160
Turn the lights on.

2262
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:26,920
I want to see that that well lit, soft lighting, carpeted space adventure.

2263
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:31,000
It's the sort of thing I can curl up with a mug of cocoa and watch.

2264
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:34,880
Those set, you know, say what you want about Star Trek, the next generation.

2265
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:36,480
But those sets.

2266
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:40,760
Well lit, very professionally lit.

2267
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:43,320
Oh, oh, it's lit.

2268
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:45,680
All right. Oh, it's lit.

2269
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:51,200
I can see every I can see every detail of that blinking control panel.

2270
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:52,320
It's funny.

2271
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:57,480
It's funny how they have the same sets and the same hallways and you can you can.

2272
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:01,120
And it's funny that like you can identify like what part of the ship they're in,

2273
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:04,920
if you know what to look for, because they have all the same sets and all the sets

2274
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:07,960
are like there's there's specific parts of the ship.

2275
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:11,600
So they'll they'll pass through like the same hallway on the way to get to the same

2276
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:15,160
elevator and like the way to the bridge and stuff.

2277
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,840
Yeah, like they put I mean, I haven't I've only two episodes in so far.

2278
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:20,480
Oh, yeah. Oh, right, right.

2279
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:22,600
But I've just seen other I've seen bits.

2280
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:23,480
I've seen bits.

2281
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:28,080
I've just not watched the show in its fullness and it's like I've just seen.

2282
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:32,440
I've just seen I've seen I've seen a map and I've seen somewhere I saw an image

2283
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:36,840
that showed like, oh, yeah, if you look at the map, like when they're in this hallway,

2284
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:42,880
like it's it's it's here in the interior map of the of the ship or whatever.

2285
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:46,400
But they don't have them all connected.

2286
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:50,440
Those sets those sets aren't connected in that exact way because like how do they move?

2287
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:52,600
You mean.

2288
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,160
Well, they disconnected.

2289
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:56,840
Well, you know, that's that's the magic of television.

2290
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:00,600
You know, you don't actually have to build the ship and like actually travel through.

2291
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:06,720
I know, but like like it's it's I guess extra attention to detail that they would

2292
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:11,920
know what hallway to use, what set to use for a generic walking show.

2293
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,640
There's there's probably there's probably bits.

2294
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:20,240
I bet some nerd on some forum in like the year 1992 wrote like a big thing

2295
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:25,280
about like in this scene of they actually walk through the maintenance bay before

2296
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,080
they get to the bridge, but like the maintenance bay is actually on the other

2297
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:31,800
side from the the pleasure quarters, so, you know, they wouldn't have had to walk

2298
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:34,120
through that room in this case pleasure quarters.

2299
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:37,480
No, I would the holodeck the holodeck is what I'm talking about.

2300
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,000
Have you seen it?

2301
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:41,760
Yeah, you ever watch you ever watch

2302
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:44,760
the real gyms like Simpsons Mysteries?

2303
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:46,320
Yes, I love those videos.

2304
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:49,400
Have you seen the one about the Rumpus room?

2305
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:51,880
Yes, I do.

2306
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:56,000
It's the it's the one that that Homer is sitting in a beanbag chair.

2307
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:56,400
Yeah.

2308
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:00,280
During the episode where they're all fighting over the comic book and he looks

2309
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:02,520
out the window. Yeah, I think so.

2310
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,880
When the lightning flashes and he's like, oh, they're fine.

2311
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:07,080
Like that's a little one moment gag.

2312
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:10,320
And then that room just most of the time just doesn't exist.

2313
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,040
Yeah, it doesn't exist.

2314
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:15,440
Sometimes it's referenced most of the time it doesn't exist.

2315
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:20,000
When it does exist, its location is kind of inconsistent.

2316
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:24,680
And sometimes the house exterior is shown in a way where like there probably should

2317
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:30,280
be a window that would look out from the Rumpus room, but there is no window there.

2318
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:34,880
But like, you know, in the Simpsons, they do have a general house layout where like

2319
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:39,720
you understand how like the kitchen and the the front hall and the stairway up to

2320
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:43,240
the bedrooms and the living room all fit together.

2321
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,840
And sometimes they put a Rumpus room there and sometimes they don't.

2322
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:50,480
And they know what really nobody really knows where the stairway leading to the

2323
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:55,000
basement is, because it never really appears unless it's needed and someone's

2324
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:56,000
going to the basement.

2325
02:23:56,200 --> 02:24:01,680
But yeah, in in they put they put the same thought into the the Star Trek where

2326
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:05,960
like there's a general idea that like if they have to go to the med bay,

2327
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:10,480
well, you know, the the engine room is on the way to the med bay.

2328
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:15,600
So they might pass through the engine room while they're walking or whatever.

2329
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:16,720
It's just good.

2330
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:19,720
It's good stuff, continuity, consistency.

2331
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:21,520
You like you like that?

2332
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,960
No, no.

2333
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:27,000
I don't really have that much to say about Star Trek,

2334
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:28,720
because I haven't watched that much of it.

2335
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:32,640
I've just I've just seen mostly TNG.

2336
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:35,680
Used to see it as a kid on TV sometimes.

2337
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:38,680
I hope to finish the entire show.

2338
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:42,040
And then I'll be so smart.

2339
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:46,880
You'll be as smart as Peacard.

2340
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:48,960
Peacard, so clever.

2341
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:50,800
Like Pecan.

2342
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,520
It's pecan.

2343
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:54,360
It's a pecan pie.

2344
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:55,040
Do you say pecan?

2345
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:56,280
Oh, John, look pecan.

2346
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:59,440
Do you say pecan or pecan?

2347
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:02,400
I actually do say I actually do say pecan.

2348
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:05,440
I think in the south, they say pecan.

2349
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:06,920
Yeah, I don't think I.

2350
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:09,680
Yeah, cringe, cringe.

2351
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:11,440
Pecan just sounds funny anyway.

2352
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:12,680
True.

2353
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:15,280
A pecan pie.

2354
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:17,480
No, I'm sorry, pecan pie.

2355
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:22,440
I'm sorry, P E C A N pecan pecan.

2356
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:26,240
There's no pecan if it were pecan.

2357
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:28,400
Then I don't know, they would.

2358
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,640
You would have an age in before the end.

2359
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:34,640
Right, exactly, exactly.

2360
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:39,440
Yeah, I mean, I don't think I have anything else to.

2361
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:41,280
I don't have any other topics.

2362
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:49,080
We could do one piece or we could do voicemails or we could do nothing.

2363
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:54,280
We could do what did we do last time with one piece?

2364
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:56,120
Do we do it after voicemails?

2365
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:58,040
I think we did it before.

2366
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:58,880
OK, let's do it.

2367
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:02,600
All right, let's let me read.

2368
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:05,280
I forgot to I forgot to read it.

2369
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:08,920
You little rascal, even though you told me to.

2370
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:10,880
Is it 1077?

2371
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:13,800
1077, yes.

2372
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,560
I it came out during your stream.

2373
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:18,200
So I mentioned it in the stream chat.

2374
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:20,600
Right. And then I said I was going to go read it.

2375
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:25,440
But then instead I rated Nate's stream

2376
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:28,760
and Nate was reading one piece, but I didn't stick around.

2377
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:32,800
That's why I was reminded because I was doing his one piece stream.

2378
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:34,360
Yeah.

2379
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:39,120
Oh, does he have another person in the Talking Pirates?

2380
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:41,520
Were you jealous? You really should be Talking Pirate.

2381
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,160
Oh, you're right.

2382
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:48,120
Well, yeah, I'm a Talking Pirate and I'm here to tell you.

2383
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,360
I think.

2384
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:52,400
OK, I very funny and true.

2385
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:57,000
I mean, to be pedantic, I think that the implication is that

2386
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:01,280
we're we're talking pirates like we're they're talking about pirates.

2387
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:04,480
Yeah, but it would only become a pun if there were multiple people on the show.

2388
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:10,160
That's true, true and valid.

2389
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:14,280
I thought you're asking like who

2390
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:17,440
is the new girl?

2391
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:20,360
Michelle, she's just silent.

2392
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:21,960
She's like, I hate one piece.

2393
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:23,360
I hate one piece. I hate one piece.

2394
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:25,600
I've never. Oh, but look, she just can't.

2395
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:26,880
Oh, but look at there.

2396
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:29,160
But look at but look at Caesar.

2397
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:32,080
Oh, but look at Caesar, though.

2398
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:34,680
Cold season cold.

2399
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:37,680
Jerma's cold blooded voyage volume 32.

2400
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:40,400
Wait a sec. It's all vega punks fault.

2401
02:27:40,600 --> 02:27:42,160
Hmm.

2402
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:43,080
All right. Yes.

2403
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:47,040
I went back because I was lost.

2404
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:52,480
I will recount this cover arc because it might be important.

2405
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:53,880
OK.

2406
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:57,400
So Jerma, right?

2407
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:01,080
The the guys who are at the whole cake arc.

2408
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:04,280
They saved Sanji or they were trying to take Sanji or no,

2409
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:07,080
they were there for the wedding, but then everything went fucked up.

2410
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:10,880
And so they became good guys to help Sanji and everyone escape.

2411
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,880
Um,

2412
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:18,040
Caesar was also there and in their escape,

2413
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:21,040
Caesar was like, please take me with you, Jerma.

2414
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:25,400
And so the Jerma siblings, they flew over

2415
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:31,520
and they got onto their castle snail ship thing kingdom.

2416
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:33,320
Right. They're floating kingdom.

2417
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:36,640
I mean, the whole the whole cakes did the big mom people.

2418
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:38,120
No, no, no, Caesar did.

2419
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:38,840
They got away.

2420
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:43,760
They basically Caesar did some really fucked up stuff and they stole.

2421
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:44,960
They stole pudding.

2422
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:49,960
It's a little hard to know because I think Blackbeard has pudding now.

2423
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,080
But pudding was stolen in the escape.

2424
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:56,240
Is pudding still evil or is she good now?

2425
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:57,880
She she I think she's good.

2426
02:28:58,080 --> 02:29:01,160
She did she like decided she likes Sanji.

2427
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:02,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2428
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,240
That's why she she changed her tune.

2429
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:07,560
I was like, I love you Sanji.

2430
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:11,240
It's like actually heartfelt and cute that they like each other.

2431
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:12,320
Yeah.

2432
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:19,320
But yeah, the thing with whole cake, the Jerma were like two of them were captured

2433
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,720
and the other siblings came and broke them out and they ran away.

2434
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:25,080
Caesar came with them.

2435
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:29,840
And then I guess he bumped into Judge and then they were like, who's this clown?

2436
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:31,040
They fought for a moment.

2437
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:35,880
But then they remembered that shared past and what we were in the previous

2438
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:40,480
cover art pages were like, Oh, the Mads scientists.

2439
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:43,840
They were remembering that was their thought their thought bubble.

2440
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:47,160
Like, oh, yeah, we were in the Mad Scientist thing together.

2441
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:49,400
And don't you remember that vagabond guy?

2442
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:51,200
He's the reason everything got fucked up.

2443
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:52,880
Is it because he won that?

2444
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:57,440
Is it because he like won that contest with the flower gunpowder?

2445
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:00,000
Yeah, he won the contest and he's the best scientist.

2446
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,760
Oh my god, it's just like Dr.

2447
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,960
Light was granted funding for his for his improved AI over Dr.

2448
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:09,600
Wiley's gear system, the double gear.

2449
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:13,120
These guys with their double gears

2450
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:17,120
and they fought for a while and they're tired of hunting.

2451
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:22,800
I'll show the world that my green blood technology was was right all along.

2452
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,200
Well, I mean, yeah, that's that's mega punk who did that.

2453
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:28,040
Oh, shit, you're right.

2454
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:29,040
So it's the other thing.

2455
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,800
It's my smile fruits.

2456
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,360
My shitty my shitty smile fruits are better than

2457
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,880
Vega Punks good actually work right fruits.

2458
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:38,760
Fuck that guy.

2459
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:43,720
So, yeah, these two seem to have come to an agreement of some kind that they are

2460
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:49,720
like with each other against why were they against each other is important.

2461
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:52,440
Why were they against each other in the first place?

2462
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:56,280
Because they were it was a scientist like competition.

2463
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:59,960
Oh, right. And they were all they were all fighting for second place.

2464
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:02,280
But Vega Punk was the guy who was better than them all.

2465
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,880
So in this moment, I guess they're like, wait a minute,

2466
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:06,760
why don't we just kill Vega Punk?

2467
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:07,760
Why don't we kill that guy?

2468
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:08,960
That's in the present, though.

2469
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:10,680
That's not like back in the past.

2470
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:12,560
Now, this is the present that they're thinking.

2471
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:15,000
Yeah, they're saying this is all Vega Punks fault,

2472
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,440
which is at least why they stop fighting and I don't know what else it means.

2473
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:20,920
But I guess we'll know next week if this continues.

2474
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:24,760
I guess I forgot that they were fighting in the present.

2475
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:27,320
Yeah, it's like like a bunch of weeks ago.

2476
02:31:27,320 --> 02:31:28,560
They started the Thought Bubble,

2477
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,560
which opened up with the mad scientists.

2478
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:32,320
Yeah, what?

2479
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:33,600
And then it's finishing.

2480
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:34,440
Why were they fighting?

2481
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:36,760
Did they just like happen to run into each other somewhere?

2482
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:38,520
And they were like, yeah, it's you again.

2483
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:40,880
They ran into each other because Caesar Clown,

2484
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:44,560
who was on whole cake, escaped with the German siblings,

2485
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:49,920
you know, Sanji's brothers and sisters and sister as they came back.

2486
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:52,720
You can see them in like Ichiji and

2487
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:54,840
right, Kujo, I can't remember her name.

2488
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:56,440
Right.

2489
02:31:57,240 --> 02:31:59,640
Just sort of hanging out, being like, yeah, they're fighting.

2490
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:03,000
They're still like, they don't give a shit.

2491
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:07,320
And in the in the thing, I went back,

2492
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:13,720
pudding was Kid Matt and if I can cracker was turned poison full.

2493
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:15,880
It looks like the poison from punk has a cracker.

2494
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:16,920
So I thought Caesar did it.

2495
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:19,960
Who's cracker cracker cracker was one of the

2496
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:22,120
the

2497
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:26,680
what do you call them, the commanders of the of the big mom pirates who

2498
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,720
Luffy defeated with Gear 4th.

2499
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:31,120
That was the introduction of Gear 4th into the comic.

2500
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:32,200
OK.

2501
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:35,000
And he smashed his crackers that he kept making.

2502
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,880
They had a cracker fruit.

2503
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:40,160
He beat the shit out of him.

2504
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:42,360
And then.

2505
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,920
Yeah, so.

2506
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,640
Pudding was Kid Matt.

2507
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:51,760
But then we later see pudding aboard Blackbeard ship.

2508
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:55,680
Kidnapped like imprisoned with Kobe, I think.

2509
02:32:57,240 --> 02:33:00,880
So I don't know who whether Blackbeard was there or whether Caesar gave it,

2510
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:04,680
gave pudding to them or I don't fucking know what's going on.

2511
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:07,080
Yeah, yeah.

2512
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:10,360
But anyway, it's a lot to keep track of for sure.

2513
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:13,960
That's that's a little reminder of what the fuck this cover is about.

2514
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:16,520
Yeah, OK.

2515
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,920
So I mean, long story short, Caesar and

2516
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:21,520
Jerma are teaming up and not Jerma.

2517
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:22,800
Wait, is his name Jerma?

2518
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,560
Judge, Caesar and judge are teaming up.

2519
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:28,720
Or it seems that way.

2520
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:30,600
Seems that way.

2521
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:34,000
OK, I'm.

2522
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:39,400
Partway through the chapter and OK, so

2523
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:42,560
Shaka says they're talking about King.

2524
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:45,680
They just they just noticed that these guys are Lunarians.

2525
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,600
And Shaka says

2526
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:53,480
he talking about King, he said he was called Abler and he was a test subject.

2527
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:55,520
Who escaped punk hazard with Kaido.

2528
02:33:55,720 --> 02:34:01,320
So I guess that that's how they got Lunarian DNA was from King.

2529
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:03,160
OK, yeah, make about that.

2530
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:05,400
The thing was the thing was Zorro

2531
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:08,240
seeing like he's the one who knows all the information.

2532
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:11,040
He just took him really far too long to put it together.

2533
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:12,160
He's colorblind.

2534
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,200
He's colorblind.

2535
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:16,320
Hey, it doesn't have depth perception anymore.

2536
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:17,680
Right.

2537
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:18,840
That changes your color.

2538
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:20,640
Right.

2539
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:23,480
In that case, pay attention to the flames on their backs.

2540
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,080
Right. OK, so the.

2541
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:29,760
So when the flame is on.

2542
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:32,080
They're like they're invincible kind of.

2543
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:38,000
But when the flame is off, they're like super fast or something like that.

2544
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:41,880
Like there's a reason they turn it on and off, right?

2545
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:43,720
Oh, yes, yes.

2546
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:45,960
They do.

2547
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:48,040
They don't fight.

2548
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:49,920
They can't do damage.

2549
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:53,840
I think I can't remember exactly, but I think King only attacked

2550
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:55,480
when his flames were off.

2551
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:56,880
Yeah.

2552
02:34:57,080 --> 02:35:00,360
And that's the only time he was vulnerable as well.

2553
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:03,080
So when he's got his flames on, he's not attacking.

2554
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,280
Yeah, yeah.

2555
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:08,280
Which means that you've got to attack when they attack.

2556
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:11,160
That's so fucking strong.

2557
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:12,280
Don't do this.

2558
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:14,800
It is very strong.

2559
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,480
Mainly Lunarians are the main aliens.

2560
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:20,760
They're not from the moon, though, right?

2561
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:22,960
Despite the name.

2562
02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:25,160
Well, we don't know.

2563
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:25,960
OK.

2564
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:30,080
The only thing we know about Lunarians are that King is one of them

2565
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:33,200
and they have these characteristics.

2566
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:37,880
When when Enel went to the moon, there were like some other aliens there that were not.

2567
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:41,000
There were Mole Man on the moon.

2568
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:45,480
And that's considered canon because it was a cover story, I think.

2569
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:47,600
Yeah, yeah.

2570
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:51,120
I mean, the moon's pretty big.

2571
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:54,520
Maybe there's Lunarians as well.

2572
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:59,160
I feel like they said someone said that Lunarians like came.

2573
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,840
They lived on the red line.

2574
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:04,640
But I mean.

2575
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,040
It could be.

2576
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:08,280
Could be a big important thing.

2577
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:09,160
I don't remember that.

2578
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:10,760
I was thinking.

2579
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:15,800
Hey, did we talk about this that like the red line is artificial?

2580
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,360
I think I had that as a pretend like an idea.

2581
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:22,440
Yeah, OK, maybe it was built and therefore

2582
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:26,400
cut off the oceans from one another so that they could be more easily controlled.

2583
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:32,880
Definitely. I mean, if that's true, then it wouldn't make any sense for them to like be from there.

2584
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:36,720
Because like it didn't exist for that long.

2585
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:39,440
I guess it could have existed for like a thousand years.

2586
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,120
Maybe the devil fruit is like, I got the line line fruit.

2587
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:45,760
Line line.

2588
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:48,160
Yeah, maybe.

2589
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:50,840
I was thinking it was one of the one of the

2590
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:54,800
the ancient weapons that might have created it.

2591
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:58,800
I think I think I think we talked about this already.

2592
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:05,240
I think in fact, I think you probably said that and that's where I got that idea.

2593
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:07,840
Yes. Yeah.

2594
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:11,360
OK, just I'm I'm paying attention.

2595
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:12,520
I am paying attention.

2596
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:16,560
I'm I'm I'm also reading Nami's butt.

2597
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:18,760
There it is.

2598
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:22,320
Let's show that.

2599
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:23,320
Let's show that.

2600
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:25,480
Let's make let's make let's make zoom in.

2601
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,960
Let's make real sure to show that.

2602
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:33,240
We wouldn't want the listeners to feel like they're missing out.

2603
02:37:33,960 --> 02:37:34,960
It's petite.

2604
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:37,040
It's petite.

2605
02:37:37,240 --> 02:37:40,240
It's got that thigh gap.

2606
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:42,200
This is important.

2607
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:43,920
True.

2608
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:47,040
So very true.

2609
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:51,160
Jin boy, Jin boy, that's good.

2610
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:54,000
Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt should do double damage

2611
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:56,680
because Jin boy is water elemental.

2612
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:59,360
So lightning should do double and it did.

2613
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:01,600
Yeah, it worked pretty, pretty effective.

2614
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:03,080
Hey.

2615
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:04,960
Oh, he splashes into the floor.

2616
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:07,120
The way is it called the wave wave fruit?

2617
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:08,360
It's so awesome.

2618
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:09,680
Yeah.

2619
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:11,480
The being able to swim through solid.

2620
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:13,520
And that was it was

2621
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:15,440
senior pink. I was going to say Mr.

2622
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:18,160
Yeah, senior pink.

2623
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:20,920
Is Brooke able to like sense

2624
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:23,840
where he is through like soul magic?

2625
02:38:24,040 --> 02:38:27,760
Because he like senses that he's swimming through the floor.

2626
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:30,240
No, I think he just saw.

2627
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:32,640
He saw it or he heard the splash.

2628
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:35,040
And so it's like he's under the floor.

2629
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:36,120
Watch out.

2630
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:39,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think you're right.

2631
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:43,040
But it looked like he fell because he was damaged.

2632
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,840
I will decree one.

2633
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:48,360
Anyone who threatens Nami saw him face Kevin.

2634
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:50,480
Decree nine.

2635
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:57,280
Anyone who makes her scream will receive dot, dot, dot.

2636
02:38:57,480 --> 02:39:02,280
The numbers used might be a pun as nine and one can be combined to form Kui,

2637
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:06,440
which can imply fishing, seafood in some contexts.

2638
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:08,720
OK.

2639
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:13,760
Yeah, because because Jim Bae is a fish and Sanji cooks fish.

2640
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:15,680
Yes.

2641
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:16,680
Oh, true.

2642
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:20,360
You could you could use knives and cut him.

2643
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:23,160
It's his one weakness, actually.

2644
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:27,680
He's being being cooked, being filleted.

2645
02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:28,800
Oh, there's another.

2646
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,680
There's Lilith's butt.

2647
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:34,480
Let's let's show it.

2648
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:39,640
Let's let's let's not neglect to show it.

2649
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:42,000
Poo boy.

2650
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:45,920
Bubble gun bubble, something else.

2651
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:49,200
Hey, ho.

2652
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:51,920
Let's go.

2653
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:54,320
You and Nate are exactly the same.

2654
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:56,320
I.

2655
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:00,520
I don't know these these butts are not.

2656
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:01,560
They're not that great.

2657
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:02,920
They're OK. They're fine.

2658
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:05,400
I'm a I'm a boob, the fact that they are being drawn.

2659
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,880
I'm a drawn attention to a boob guy.

2660
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:09,520
Yeah, I heard I heard Nate.

2661
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:12,440
I heard Nate saying that it's kind of unusual.

2662
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:15,120
There are like so many butts on display and it's kind of true.

2663
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:19,880
Yeah, Oda Oda doesn't really focus on but I don't know.

2664
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:24,280
I I would have to to go back and like actually count

2665
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:26,320
how many gratuitous butt shots there are.

2666
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:28,840
I don't really remember there being that many.

2667
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,360
There's two in this chapter draws your attention to it,

2668
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:34,000
but maybe the ever so often maybe it just happens.

2669
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:37,200
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

2670
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:41,360
After some serious reason, we have to we have to we're going to have to look into

2671
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:44,280
this deeply green.

2672
02:40:44,480 --> 02:40:45,920
Oh, here we go.

2673
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:47,920
Bubble gun.

2674
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:49,800
She brushed it off like it was nothing.

2675
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,880
Huh. Green blood gives you the pros and cons of having a fruit ability.

2676
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:55,560
And these bubbles were designed to hurt.

2677
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:58,000
OK, so.

2678
02:40:58,160 --> 02:40:59,360
Yeah, they're weak too.

2679
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:03,120
They're they're they're weak as same as any fruit user.

2680
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:04,920
OK.

2681
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:08,640
Which is a I'm glad because otherwise there'd be way too upbeat.

2682
02:41:08,840 --> 02:41:10,960
It would be. Yeah, if it were like.

2683
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:15,600
If it were like, yeah, actually lumarian blood like means that like now they they

2684
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:18,320
they're fine in water and see some doesn't do anything to them.

2685
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:21,040
And yeah.

2686
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:27,960
Also, I'm I'm yeah, you you read, but I have a comment.

2687
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:30,960
Go ahead.

2688
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:37,960
I think this is the first time we've heard one of these seraphim speak.

2689
02:41:38,840 --> 02:41:42,400
Um, yeah.

2690
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:45,680
I didn't realize they had like they could talk.

2691
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:50,920
I think that's and have a personality, but this little Hancock,

2692
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:56,840
she's she's doing I think I saw someone on Twitter say that they thought that young

2693
02:41:56,880 --> 02:42:01,920
Hancock might be the only one that can have feelings because it's like

2694
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:06,520
specifically tied to her fruit power is like emotions.

2695
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,560
And I don't know if that's true or not.

2696
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:16,040
But I mean, I I have no reason to believe that the others don't have anything to say.

2697
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:19,680
Yeah, but they it could be like that.

2698
02:42:19,880 --> 02:42:24,200
I feel like because Zoro said, oh, you're more than a robot.

2699
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:25,920
You're I can sense humanity in you.

2700
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:29,000
Like he could tell that the little mehawk

2701
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:31,200
was not just a robot.

2702
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:33,560
It was a person like he sense something.

2703
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:37,320
So like I feel like that means a little bit.

2704
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:41,520
He just doesn't feel like talking that much, I guess.

2705
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:44,480
OK, I see nor Jim Bay nor Kuma.

2706
02:42:44,680 --> 02:42:46,280
They're all quite quiet people.

2707
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:48,080
True. That's true.

2708
02:42:48,280 --> 02:42:53,680
I think I think it was tectonic improv in my discord mentioned something about this.

2709
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:58,720
And it seems like yeah, the original boa Hancock uses the mellow mellow fruit

2710
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:03,560
by like if it makes you fall in love with her or something.

2711
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,560
This baby one does not do that.

2712
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:10,800
This one this one gets you by making you think that she's cute.

2713
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,760
She does a little wink and they go, oh, so that's good.

2714
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:17,080
That's good that it doesn't work the same way.

2715
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:19,200
Uh.

2716
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:23,960
I'm a little unsettled, honestly,

2717
02:43:24,160 --> 02:43:27,720
because it's up is he's turned to stone.

2718
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:29,440
He's dead.

2719
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:33,360
So is Frankie, you're you're on and Lilith, too.

2720
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:37,760
You're unsettled by that, that that's a problem for you.

2721
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:41,760
Well, you know, I feel like being made of stone is not so good.

2722
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:47,040
Oh, he's been in he's been in tougher jams than he's gotten himself.

2723
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:53,760
Out of it, you know, it's on the one hand.

2724
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:56,520
On yeah, on the one hand, it's like,

2725
02:43:56,720 --> 02:44:01,440
oh, no, if the Seraphim continue to be enemies,

2726
02:44:01,640 --> 02:44:02,800
then he's dead.

2727
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:06,680
But this just sort of means that, oh, they'll be friends again.

2728
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:07,920
I guess because she'll undo it.

2729
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:12,960
Is it is the only way to undo it is if they like choose to undo the stone thing?

2730
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:14,200
Is that how it works? I forget.

2731
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:15,960
That's how I understand it.

2732
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:17,520
Yeah.

2733
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:21,280
It's like, like, I remember a time.

2734
02:44:21,480 --> 02:44:28,360
Not like long ago, but like not that long ago in the canon of the story,

2735
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:32,000
Hancock and Blackbeard were fighting.

2736
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:38,040
And she she had the ability to unstone a bunch of people on the mirror.

2737
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:40,560
Marines were there also.

2738
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:43,240
Or something, there was something going on.

2739
02:44:43,400 --> 02:44:48,440
But she had the she had the bargaining chip of being able to unstone people.

2740
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:53,040
So presumably they would stay like that otherwise.

2741
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:54,400
Yeah.

2742
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:58,520
OK, well, I mean, I guess she'll have to either get her

2743
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:05,800
to help them out or they'll have to figure some other secret trick to unstone

2744
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,040
somebody. I'm on the last bit now and I see Shaka has been assassinated.

2745
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:13,480
Oh, my God, this is gruesome.

2746
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:16,520
It's like a pretty gruesome panel.

2747
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:18,160
Yeah. Damn.

2748
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:19,640
Shaka, he's been shot.

2749
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,680
What's going on? Who was that?

2750
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:23,080
He's been shooted.

2751
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:26,480
It's nothing I would hope with a single shot.

2752
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:30,000
Shot through these. Who's that you brought with you, huh?

2753
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:33,960
OK, so I mean, seems like it wasn't Shaka.

2754
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:38,480
And and unless this is an elaborate ruse to fake his own death.

2755
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:40,600
Yeah, yeah.

2756
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:42,560
And Vega, I don't know.

2757
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:45,040
Vega Punk seems genuinely surprised by this.

2758
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:49,600
So it doesn't seem like Stella is like now is evil.

2759
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:54,120
I mean, he seems I feel like it's it's pretty clear that Vega Punk is not the one

2760
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:56,400
pulling the strings. Yeah.

2761
02:45:56,600 --> 02:46:00,600
It was always a bit weird, the idea that he would be outed as a villain

2762
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:06,240
soon after being agreeing to like go with the Straw Hat Pirates on their journey.

2763
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:06,720
Yeah, you're right.

2764
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:08,040
And being an enemy of the world government.

2765
02:46:08,040 --> 02:46:09,040
That'd be like a little weird.

2766
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:10,680
You're right.

2767
02:46:11,880 --> 02:46:13,160
But yeah, have his own plans.

2768
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:18,080
Like, I don't know, I don't think it's that outrageous, but yeah.

2769
02:46:18,280 --> 02:46:22,240
Yeah, it's a little different than law with having like their pirates.

2770
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:27,440
So ultimately, we know that their alliance will end and it did after Kaido.

2771
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:29,360
So.

2772
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:32,280
But either way, yeah.

2773
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:34,360
So this chapter,

2774
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:38,400
brief recap, everyone's fighting the Seraphim

2775
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:42,920
and some people are doing not so good.

2776
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,440
Yeah, true.

2777
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:48,000
Yeah, Sanji seems to be holding his own against Jim Bae for the time being.

2778
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:51,320
I think Nami and Sanji and Brooke will be OK.

2779
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:52,720
Yeah.

2780
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:56,160
I mean, Sanji and Brooke against Zoro and Luffy will be OK.

2781
02:46:56,360 --> 02:46:59,680
But Usopp, Lilith and Frankie, they fucking are dead.

2782
02:46:59,880 --> 02:47:01,200
Yeah, they're toast. Yeah, it's over.

2783
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:04,040
It's it's freaking over.

2784
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:07,400
And then Shaka gets shot in the head and with a little pistol gun.

2785
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:13,280
I imagine they'll probably end up in the tank with Vega Punk.

2786
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:15,760
Well, maybe.

2787
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:19,080
Well, I mean, yeah, it's someone.

2788
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:23,000
Whoever's whoever's pulling the strings and just shot Shaka and is keeping these CP

2789
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:28,160
nine, these CP agents in here is probably the same person who's controlling the.

2790
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:30,560
The Seraphim, right?

2791
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:37,000
So I mean, I imagine they will take these stone statues and bring them to the tank.

2792
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:42,520
OK, so here is my thought process.

2793
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,640
Where's Stussy?

2794
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:47,760
Yeah, where is she right now?

2795
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:49,840
Haven't seen her.

2796
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:51,320
She was with someone.

2797
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:54,800
She was with one of the groups that we just looked at.

2798
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
And now she's.

2799
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:59,560
Oh, no, wait, she was with Chopper.

2800
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:00,840
Wasn't she wait?

2801
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:03,640
No, she was she was with she was with Sanji.

2802
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:05,920
Stussy, I was thinking of Bonnie.

2803
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:09,720
Stussy Bonnie is also on the on the loose.

2804
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:12,000
And Chopper is as we haven't seen Chopper.

2805
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:14,560
Yeah, Chopper is the assassin.

2806
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:16,200
He learned to learn to shoot.

2807
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:17,560
He did it. Yeah.

2808
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:19,120
He got his little poofs.

2809
02:48:19,320 --> 02:48:22,200
He violated his Hippocratic Oath

2810
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:26,200
and became a demon.

2811
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:30,160
He's he's like unlocked blood on his hooves.

2812
02:48:30,360 --> 02:48:35,240
He awakened his human, human devil fruit and became the worst thing ever.

2813
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:37,440
A person.

2814
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:44,280
Wait, the worst, monsterful man.

2815
02:48:44,480 --> 02:48:47,320
Are his are his new like post time skip forms.

2816
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:49,480
Is this is that his awakened like zone?

2817
02:48:49,480 --> 02:48:50,520
Is that what that's about?

2818
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:52,480
No, no, I don't think so.

2819
02:48:52,480 --> 02:48:55,080
I think Luchi and Kaku awaken their zones

2820
02:48:55,280 --> 02:48:57,280
and that's why they look different now, right?

2821
02:48:57,480 --> 02:49:01,320
Yeah, I mean, I think there's

2822
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:07,040
potential for like Chopper to have found a medicinal way of awakening a devil fruit

2823
02:49:07,240 --> 02:49:10,160
with his rumble ball, but maybe it's just for him.

2824
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:11,560
Yeah.

2825
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:12,280
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

2826
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:14,560
Because like the idea that he can do all of these

2827
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:18,360
different forms, whereas normally a zone can only have three forms,

2828
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:21,040
he can have like seven plus a giant monster.

2829
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:24,840
Maybe for him, it's just him using like medicine to fuck with it.

2830
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:29,360
Just kind of means that like his forms are like a different thing than like

2831
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:31,720
yeah, classical, whatever awakening.

2832
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:34,440
What does it what does awakening even mean?

2833
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:36,960
It just just just level out better.

2834
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:41,520
Yeah, it's just you figure out that you can actually do an even better animal.

2835
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:42,600
You can do it.

2836
02:49:42,800 --> 02:49:46,400
You can utilize this power in a way that you thought was not possible before.

2837
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:48,200
You can do more with it, right?

2838
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:49,200
Or whatever.

2839
02:49:53,400 --> 02:50:00,320
Well, yeah, so it's interesting with Chopper because like maybe his ability

2840
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:02,720
to do that is like going to be revolutionary,

2841
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:06,520
but nobody really thinks about it because he's a little reindeer and he's a little

2842
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:08,800
cute reindeer and he never gets recognition.

2843
02:50:08,800 --> 02:50:10,280
He never gets a good bounty.

2844
02:50:10,480 --> 02:50:12,880
He's the most impressive medicinal mind in the world.

2845
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:15,360
It would be it would be pretty funny if he like, yeah,

2846
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:20,000
if he hit with his like five berry bounty, like completely revolutionizes

2847
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:23,200
like fruit technology or something.

2848
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:24,160
And it's like, yeah,

2849
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:26,640
Vega Punk will have a field day with his medicine.

2850
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:28,040
Yeah, that's interesting.

2851
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:33,040
Yeah, anyway, like them to get to talk about science and shit.

2852
02:50:33,240 --> 02:50:34,760
That'd be cool.

2853
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:38,440
So the very end of the chapter, Shaka gets shot in the head

2854
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:42,120
and blood has come out of his head and there's blood coming on the thing.

2855
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:43,800
But then there's a few panels.

2856
02:50:43,960 --> 02:50:49,760
It says katak, katak, katak, meaning a

2857
02:50:49,960 --> 02:50:55,520
footstep that goes one, two, which I'm assuming is like a heel.

2858
02:50:55,720 --> 02:50:59,280
So like a high heel, heel, toe, katak, katak.

2859
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:02,720
That's what I'm assuming that might be referencing.

2860
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:06,040
I think I think, though,

2861
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:11,440
that Stussy was wearing the same clothes as everyone else with the big round shoes.

2862
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:13,320
I'm not sure it could be her.

2863
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:17,760
The only reason it could be her is just because she's mysterious.

2864
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:20,640
She's been on the island before.

2865
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:23,160
Do we know that?

2866
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:27,600
Yeah, remember when you phoned up, like we need help.

2867
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:29,920
We need help from that mysterious person.

2868
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:31,720
And it turned out it was Stussy.

2869
02:51:31,920 --> 02:51:33,880
OK, OK.

2870
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:35,720
So like she was on the island.

2871
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:37,240
Yeah, that's looking.

2872
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:42,480
And meaning that she knows the island, she knows a bit about stuff and she can go

2873
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:44,640
around places and she's mysterious.

2874
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:49,240
And she's already shown to be a double agent for

2875
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:52,240
the Cypher pole.

2876
02:51:52,440 --> 02:52:00,320
And she's she's also a vampire and a clone of a lady

2877
02:52:00,520 --> 02:52:06,600
that was on the Rocks Pirates, who is an old lady who is now got the son,

2878
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:10,520
Edward Weevil, a son of Whitebeard going around.

2879
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:11,200
Right.

2880
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:14,200
So she is obviously very important to something.

2881
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:16,640
Why she's killing people, I don't know.

2882
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:20,280
But the fact is she very easily could be.

2883
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:23,800
I think I think she's she's going to walk down there with a kutuk

2884
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,840
like high heel and she's going to be like, haha.

2885
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:28,080
Yeah, I'm evil.

2886
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:31,240
I think that sounds pretty dang plausible.

2887
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:35,280
That's that's the best theory I got.

2888
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:36,520
No, you don't got it.

2889
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:38,000
I have it now.

2890
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:40,160
It's now I heard it.

2891
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:41,320
I've internalized it.

2892
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:42,120
It was easy.

2893
02:52:42,320 --> 02:52:46,120
I put it in a marketplace of ideas for free and how it's been used and abused.

2894
02:52:46,320 --> 02:52:48,520
Exactly. Exactly.

2895
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:50,560
I mean.

2896
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:53,720
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

2897
02:52:57,360 --> 02:52:59,400
Fucking I don't know what her.

2898
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:06,720
I mean, you know, she she betrayed the other CP guys as in Kaku and

2899
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:14,880
Luchi. So, you know, this is just a continuation of that trend of betraying the CP.

2900
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:18,600
So, yeah, it all kind of, yeah, it kind of makes a lot of sense.

2901
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:20,400
They're making a lot of sense right now.

2902
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:25,640
Whatever she's doing, I think if she's a clone of a rocks pirates person,

2903
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:28,960
I think that fact might be.

2904
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:33,800
Like indicative of motivation for her.

2905
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,920
Yeah, because why else would it?

2906
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:40,400
Why else would you have her be also a clone of a famous pirate from a pirate

2907
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:45,840
crew that was almost reforming when big mom and Kaido said, hey,

2908
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:47,200
let's reform the rocks pirates.

2909
02:53:47,400 --> 02:53:48,800
Remember the rocks pirates?

2910
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,160
Let's do that again.

2911
02:53:50,360 --> 02:53:55,920
I wonder if there's some, I don't know, some kind of like thing that only someone

2912
02:53:56,120 --> 02:54:02,560
with like that DNA could could access like a secret room,

2913
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:07,280
like the Paw Paw Fruit information room or something like that.

2914
02:54:07,480 --> 02:54:13,840
Yeah, I'm seeing a situation where Bunny is going to be integral to saving everyone.

2915
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:16,000
Yeah, because she's nowhere to be found right now.

2916
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:18,360
Yeah. And Kuma.

2917
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:19,400
Where's Kuma?

2918
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:23,160
Kuma's in he's climbing Red Line to Marijwa, I think.

2919
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:24,240
Yeah.

2920
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:28,840
Yeah, from for a moment there, I thought he was flying towards Egghead.

2921
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:30,800
Although.

2922
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:34,880
Is he on the other side of the red line to Egghead?

2923
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:36,920
I don't think so.

2924
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:40,320
No, no, he's not.

2925
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:42,200
They're in the New World, right?

2926
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:47,520
The the Revolutionary Army HQ is in the New World and so is this.

2927
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:52,880
I think I want to say, yeah, I think he probably is in the New World.

2928
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:55,080
So he would be on the same side.

2929
02:54:55,200 --> 02:55:00,720
So it's not like he's climbing the Red Line to jump over it and get to new Egghead.

2930
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:03,120
Probably not.

2931
02:55:03,320 --> 02:55:05,280
I wouldn't think I wouldn't following the program.

2932
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:07,360
I wouldn't assume so.

2933
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:10,120
Yeah.

2934
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:15,360
Don't know what he's doing, but I haven't seen him in a while.

2935
02:55:15,560 --> 02:55:18,200
Yeah, Bonnie's around.

2936
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:23,520
So Sentomaru is talking about Ohara.

2937
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:26,680
But he didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know.

2938
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:30,280
Yeah, we already knew that the world government is here to destroy the world

2939
02:55:30,480 --> 02:55:33,360
of the island because of information they have.

2940
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:37,800
I like the panel where it's like, by the way, this happened like 12 years ago.

2941
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,480
Refresher on the Ohara.

2942
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:43,760
It happened 12 years ago in in the comic and in real life.

2943
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:49,880
Yeah, look at that little that little drawing of Aokiji in the bottom right.

2944
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:51,240
He's so.

2945
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:52,240
Yeah.

2946
02:55:52,840 --> 02:55:54,920
Mm hmm.

2947
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:56,680
Very cool.

2948
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:59,160
Mm hmm.

2949
02:55:59,360 --> 02:56:03,400
Niko Rubin's got a little like square smile.

2950
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:04,560
She's a little tiny.

2951
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:05,560
She looks silly.

2952
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:06,600
She looks very silly.

2953
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:08,160
Wait, wait, wait.

2954
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:12,360
Let's let's get a let's get a zoom.

2955
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:13,440
I don't know what to do.

2956
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:16,560
The more I look at it, the funnier it gets.

2957
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:20,160
It's just a little like the the the the ink

2958
02:56:20,280 --> 02:56:22,520
uses just a little too thick for a mouth.

2959
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:23,920
It didn't quite, but it doesn't matter.

2960
02:56:24,120 --> 02:56:24,960
It's fine, whatever. Yeah.

2961
02:56:25,160 --> 02:56:28,880
Yeah, yeah, print it, print it, send it to the send of the printers.

2962
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:30,040
Hell, yeah.

2963
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:32,960
Um, okay.

2964
02:56:33,160 --> 02:56:37,640
Well, I guess I don't really have that much else to say about this chapter.

2965
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,400
It was good.

2966
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:43,200
I liked it.

2967
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,840
I had fun.

2968
02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:46,680
Uh, uh, the Seraphim.

2969
02:56:46,800 --> 02:56:48,520
Yeah, I think I think it's probably true

2970
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:51,560
that if a young what's her shit?

2971
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:57,560
The Amazon, um, not Bellatrix Hancock can speak, then probably all of them

2972
02:56:57,760 --> 02:57:00,080
have the ability to speak and all that.

2973
02:57:00,280 --> 02:57:09,400
But I mean, she only spoke to like do a fricking strategic thing.

2974
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:12,880
She might not not actually like have, I mean,

2975
02:57:13,080 --> 02:57:15,480
she's probably like a complete sociopath

2976
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:19,080
who can only like who can only fake emotions.

2977
02:57:19,280 --> 02:57:24,520
Yeah, that would be like she can speak if she needs to for some strategic purpose,

2978
02:57:24,520 --> 02:57:30,200
but like she doesn't wouldn't do it normally because like she's a killing machine.

2979
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:35,240
Yeah, that bubblegum will be useful.

2980
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:38,080
Right. Yeah, it was pretty good.

2981
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:44,480
I was at the if only if only well, Luffy could get little Hancock

2982
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:48,800
because Luffy doesn't care about women.

2983
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:51,160
He might still think she's cute.

2984
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:54,200
No, no, he probably wouldn't care.

2985
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:58,320
Yes, it's an odd it's odd because it's a different kind of thing.

2986
02:57:58,520 --> 02:58:02,520
The idea, the joke before is that Luffy doesn't he's asexual, you know, he doesn't

2987
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:04,040
like, huh, beautiful woman.

2988
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:05,240
What's that? I don't care.

2989
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:06,280
What if what if the fact?

2990
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:07,360
Hey, do you have any meat?

2991
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:08,960
You know, like that's that's his bit.

2992
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:12,040
But like when it's a little cute girl, it's a different kind of thing.

2993
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:14,240
But I haven't seen Luffy do like it.

2994
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:17,040
Oh, it would be kind of funny.

2995
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,760
And I would kind of buy it if like, oh, my God,

2996
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:23,400
now Hancock's power works on Luffy because she's not hot.

2997
02:58:23,400 --> 02:58:27,160
Now she's cute and that and he's and he's and Luffy's normal enough

2998
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:30,240
that like he cares about that sort of thing.

2999
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:34,160
But I could also see it just being like he doesn't give a fuck about anything.

3000
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:37,240
Yeah, I mean, at this point, I think.

3001
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:43,480
Who in the crew, if not Luffy, could resist the cute rays?

3002
02:58:44,240 --> 02:58:45,640
Maybe maybe Zoro.

3003
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:48,480
I was thinking Zoro, yeah.

3004
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:56,040
I don't I don't think Zoro would be particularly moved by a by a cute vulnerable being.

3005
02:58:58,480 --> 02:59:02,200
He does have that that Nico, Nico Robin probably would not.

3006
02:59:02,200 --> 02:59:04,200
I'm not Tashiki or was it Tashiki?

3007
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:09,520
The person who we know is Tashiki, like the underling to smoker.

3008
02:59:09,880 --> 02:59:11,520
But like, what was the name?

3009
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:13,520
Is it Kuina, a Kushin?

3010
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:15,400
Kuina. Yeah, I want to say it's Kuina.

3011
02:59:15,400 --> 02:59:18,000
Yes. You know, that's true.

3012
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,400
So he might feel some does have emotions.

3013
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:24,760
But yeah, I'm not saying he doesn't feel I don't feel like he's like.

3014
02:59:26,600 --> 02:59:27,480
Yeah, he might.

3015
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:32,800
He doesn't get as riled up in the same way as the others.

3016
02:59:32,840 --> 02:59:36,080
I think what do you think about Nico Robin?

3017
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:42,400
Do you think Nico Robin could be would be or maybe Nami might be cutthroat enough

3018
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:47,240
that she might not be Nami and Nico Robin could be.

3019
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:49,000
I could see it going either way.

3020
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,320
I could see it going either way for both of them.

3021
02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:58,760
I think I think because Lilith smiled and she got that Nami would also.

3022
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,440
I think Nico Robin.

3023
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:03,800
She finds things cute that are pathetic.

3024
03:00:03,800 --> 03:00:04,600
You're right.

3025
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:09,800
She really likes the dark things and she likes dark things.

3026
03:00:09,800 --> 03:00:13,000
And like, she finds pathetic things adorable.

3027
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:14,320
What do you? Is there an example?

3028
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:16,320
I don't remember.

3029
03:00:17,320 --> 03:00:18,040
Oh, what was it?

3030
03:00:18,040 --> 03:00:20,040
It was what's his name?

3031
03:00:20,040 --> 03:00:23,920
Kanji Rose, shittily drawn dragon beast.

3032
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,880
They used to climb the elephant.

3033
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:28,960
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

3034
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:33,600
To climb, so and she was like, oh, my God, you can do it.

3035
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:37,280
Like, it's like such a terrible drawing and everyone was like,

3036
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:38,680
oh, this guy sucks.

3037
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:40,960
But she was almost in tears about how much she loved.

3038
03:00:40,960 --> 03:00:45,400
Well, I mean, when she she was so sad when he died, I forgot about that.

3039
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:46,520
That's so funny.

3040
03:00:46,520 --> 03:00:47,920
It was such a nice little moment.

3041
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:49,320
I've totally forgot about that.

3042
03:00:49,320 --> 03:00:54,000
OK, on the one hand, I mean, Bella, not Bella, why do we keep Boa?

3043
03:00:54,440 --> 03:00:56,440
Boa being like, oh, this is agonizing.

3044
03:00:56,440 --> 03:00:57,280
Oh, it hurts so bad.

3045
03:00:57,280 --> 03:00:58,840
Like that is kind of pathetic.

3046
03:00:58,840 --> 03:01:00,640
But yeah, I think that.

3047
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:01,640
Well, not not pathetic.

3048
03:01:01,640 --> 03:01:04,440
And I think she would see through the manipulation.

3049
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:05,720
I think is what I mean.

3050
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:07,000
Like she would need. I agree.

3051
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:12,280
She would need it to be like genuinely unsettling for her to actually like it.

3052
03:01:12,280 --> 03:01:12,920
So right.

3053
03:01:12,920 --> 03:01:16,400
And if it's if it's if it's a normal if it's a normie kind of cute,

3054
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:18,920
she's like, yeah, OK, OK, sis.

3055
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:20,320
Agreed 100 percent.

3056
03:01:20,320 --> 03:01:23,680
And I think that rules and I hope and I hope that we get to see.

3057
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:26,880
I hope that we get to see this just it completely not work on her

3058
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:28,680
because I think that's what that's what would happen.

3059
03:01:30,200 --> 03:01:33,200
No, yeah, if it worked on Lilith, it would probably work on Nami.

3060
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:36,680
I think.

3061
03:01:36,680 --> 03:01:39,120
Although Lilith might be like.

3062
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:42,160
Lilith seems kind of like hyper emotional or she seems very

3063
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:45,040
she seems very emotional and prone to like yelling and stuff.

3064
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:49,240
Nami is a little more calculating, but she's might still.

3065
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:53,560
I honestly think Nami is a little prone to yelling and emotional as well.

3066
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:58,640
Yeah, yeah, she she's she's one of the ones along

3067
03:01:58,640 --> 03:02:03,680
with Zoro Zoro and Usopp and Chopper will always scream at stuff.

3068
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:05,880
You're you're right, actually. And Brooke as well.

3069
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:10,200
I think Zoro would probably because Zoro

3070
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:13,160
yeah, has this like.

3071
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:18,560
Memory of like a young girl that like died and that he like traumatized him.

3072
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:22,560
I feel like he probably would be vulnerable to little little boa being like,

3073
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:24,560
oh, it hurts.

3074
03:02:25,880 --> 03:02:30,000
Yeah, I think I'm thinking I'm thinking Robin would just yeah, see through it.

3075
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:32,680
So that's so cool.

3076
03:02:32,680 --> 03:02:35,560
I hope I hope we get to see that.

3077
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:39,760
Anyway, that I just wanted to say one more thing.

3078
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:43,560
The top with Caesar and George.

3079
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:46,880
They hate Vegapunk.

3080
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:51,560
I had I think Cassidy in in your chat was hinting

3081
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:55,280
that it could be Caesar with the gun.

3082
03:02:56,200 --> 03:03:02,480
Oh, or Josh Caesar is the one who has used a gun before as a weapon.

3083
03:03:03,360 --> 03:03:08,760
I yeah, when did he the thing is, though, how did he how would he have got here?

3084
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:13,920
Well, you know, that's the thing.

3085
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:18,320
He is a scientist, so I know he could probably science his way in

3086
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:21,240
and he can fly himself, I think.

3087
03:03:21,240 --> 03:03:24,040
Yeah, can he just fly like from island to island?

3088
03:03:25,440 --> 03:03:26,600
I I think so.

3089
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:27,480
I don't really know.

3090
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:31,560
I think it's really fucking good cloud his his his poison cloud fruit

3091
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:34,520
means he can fly a bit, but he needs to land at some point.

3092
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:37,320
I don't think that was ever explained, but that's how I assume.

3093
03:03:38,480 --> 03:03:40,960
If he could just travel between islands with no ship,

3094
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:44,760
like that would be like amazing, amazing capability of that fruit.

3095
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:48,960
But then like, why couldn't smoke or do that?

3096
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:50,280
Could smoke or do that?

3097
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:51,960
Or would he get tired and have to lay out?

3098
03:03:51,960 --> 03:03:56,640
Yeah, I think it's yeah, it's probably there's limits to how much

3099
03:03:56,640 --> 03:04:00,960
you can you can do that and fly and whatever smokers got.

3100
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:05,440
Can a could could ace just turn into a cloud of fire and go from island to island?

3101
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:09,280
No, he had to use that little that little like rocket propelled sailboat.

3102
03:04:11,640 --> 03:04:15,240
Yeah, yeah. So I could I could see it being Caesar.

3103
03:04:15,240 --> 03:04:16,520
Yeah, I could see it being Caesar.

3104
03:04:16,560 --> 03:04:19,920
And, you know, he got here somehow when no one was paying attention.

3105
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:25,160
Because like that flashback or that that cover story is like

3106
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:27,760
as soon as they left whole cake.

3107
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:30,360
Meanwhile, everyone else was in Wano doing Wano stuff.

3108
03:04:30,360 --> 03:04:33,440
Yeah. So there's potentially a lot of time

3109
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:37,080
to judge and Caesar to hatch a plan to infiltrate Egghead

3110
03:04:37,360 --> 03:04:40,720
and do some some some little sneaky, you know what?

3111
03:04:40,720 --> 03:04:42,720
Totally plausible.

3112
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:46,720
Think the Stussy theory makes sense.

3113
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:49,400
But I mean, you know, this.

3114
03:04:49,400 --> 03:04:52,600
It would make sense for for us to be the motivation makes sense.

3115
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:54,920
Yeah, plus it would just like, oh,

3116
03:04:54,920 --> 03:04:57,760
that's why we've been seeing it in the cover arc story.

3117
03:04:57,760 --> 03:05:00,680
It's like, OK, because it's going to be immediately relevant to

3118
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:04,120
what's what's happening on the island.

3119
03:05:04,920 --> 03:05:06,920
Yeah, that's pretty good.

3120
03:05:08,040 --> 03:05:11,360
I buy it. So and if he and if he's here,

3121
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:15,080
then probably judges here too, right, maybe.

3122
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:20,040
Yeah, I don't know why they would both be like physically together.

3123
03:05:20,040 --> 03:05:22,880
Yeah, I feel like Caesar would be sneaking around.

3124
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:25,520
Judge would be nearby with his ships.

3125
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:29,800
And that's probably not necessary.

3126
03:05:29,800 --> 03:05:30,800
Probably not.

3127
03:05:30,800 --> 03:05:34,520
I really don't know, because it's sort of like they want to get back at Vega Punk.

3128
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:37,560
Therefore, what do they do?

3129
03:05:38,360 --> 03:05:40,920
What are they doing right now?

3130
03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:45,160
Caesar might be they are doing that assassinating people.

3131
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:49,600
Or he's assassinating the people.

3132
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,040
He's got control of the seraphim.

3133
03:05:51,040 --> 03:05:54,840
If they're not here doing this, then I don't know what they are doing.

3134
03:05:55,040 --> 03:05:57,760
Yeah, why would say why would Caesar have control of the seraphim?

3135
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:02,440
That's why Stussy would have the control,

3136
03:06:02,440 --> 03:06:07,040
because she had the little yeah, this CP zero thing.

3137
03:06:07,560 --> 03:06:10,720
But wouldn't Vega Punk's orders supersede her orders, though?

3138
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,560
That's the thing that's confusing.

3139
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:19,240
I would only I would assume that either Stussy knows how to operate

3140
03:06:19,240 --> 03:06:22,880
the computers and change the programming somehow or Caesar does.

3141
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:26,840
The only thing that's weird about Caesar being here is.

3142
03:06:32,720 --> 03:06:38,120
If surely he knows that Luffy is here or he will find out

3143
03:06:38,760 --> 03:06:43,080
and he's fucking terrified of the straw hats because they beat the shit out of him.

3144
03:06:43,320 --> 03:06:44,320
Right.

3145
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:49,000
And they forced him to collaborate with him and their their assassination of big mom.

3146
03:06:50,080 --> 03:06:52,880
I think so, eventually.

3147
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:53,880
Yeah.

3148
03:06:57,320 --> 03:07:01,800
Maybe, I mean, it could I guess it could still be a fake assassination

3149
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:05,200
and like Stussy and Chaka are like collaborating.

3150
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:06,880
For what purpose, though?

3151
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:08,840
They've been collecting agents.

3152
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:16,600
I mean, well, that would explain how how the seraphim are in their control

3153
03:07:16,600 --> 03:07:18,560
because Chaka is Vega Punk.

3154
03:07:18,560 --> 03:07:23,480
And so Chaka has basically the highest authorization to order them.

3155
03:07:23,880 --> 03:07:24,600
True.

3156
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:26,840
So that would that could explain that.

3157
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:30,080
Because without without.

3158
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:32,800
Yeah, without without a Vega Punk giving orders,

3159
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:37,560
there's no real explanation for why Vega Punk can't just tell the seraphim to stop.

3160
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:44,720
Did they didn't they say and didn't they say there was some line about like.

3161
03:07:46,680 --> 03:07:53,120
The set like one seraphim one CP zero can't like contradict another one's orders.

3162
03:07:53,880 --> 03:07:58,480
Like like like once one had given an order, another CP can't just call it off.

3163
03:07:58,480 --> 03:08:01,280
Like an even higher order has to be given for it to change.

3164
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:04,000
Yeah, I think they did say something like that.

3165
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,800
I feel like they said something like that, which would which if true would mean that

3166
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:12,600
like if Chaka says something, then Vega Punk, no other Vega Punk can intercede

3167
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:17,000
because there's no higher authority would have to carry that one out before another order could be given.

3168
03:08:18,880 --> 03:08:19,800
That's crazy.

3169
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:21,080
So so I don't know.

3170
03:08:21,080 --> 03:08:25,120
That makes me think maybe Chaka actually is faking his death.

3171
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:29,760
You want to you want to go voice mails?

3172
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:30,960
Yeah.

3173
03:08:31,640 --> 03:08:33,840
Well, let's do a little voicemail.

3174
03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:39,120
Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

3175
03:08:39,640 --> 03:08:44,400
If you want to leave a PCP voicemail.

3176
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:47,240
OK, there's not there's not that many.

3177
03:08:47,240 --> 03:08:49,000
He's a normal amount.

3178
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:55,720
OK. First one image, we got an image from Prince Isolation.

3179
03:08:55,720 --> 03:09:03,720
I think it's OK.

3180
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:04,560
It's me.

3181
03:09:06,400 --> 03:09:08,200
Oh, I think these are stream moments.

3182
03:09:09,720 --> 03:09:15,400
Oops, threw up a little and then get it.

3183
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:20,120
Oh, I'm.

3184
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:31,120
I'm asking who about a little green gummy little green gummy bear while Munchy is benching 500 behind me.

3185
03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:32,120
That's true.

3186
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:33,120
That's true.

3187
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:35,120
Oh, God, my potassium.

3188
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:40,120
Yeah, I keep having like weird heart palpitations and complaining about them on stream.

3189
03:09:42,120 --> 03:09:47,120
And then game gamers tavern instructed me on stream that I should get more potassium.

3190
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:51,120
And then I can he had a similar issue once and that potassium helped.

3191
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:53,120
So I've been trying to eat more bananas.

3192
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:57,120
And then don't trust anyone.

3193
03:09:57,120 --> 03:09:58,120
They will always betray you.

3194
03:09:58,120 --> 03:10:01,120
True, true, true.

3195
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:04,120
Give I'm watching you.

3196
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:05,120
Don't worry.

3197
03:10:05,120 --> 03:10:06,120
I'll betray you.

3198
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:08,120
Aha.

3199
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:09,120
I knew it.

3200
03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:10,120
You can trust me to do that.

3201
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:11,120
Thank you.

3202
03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:12,120
Thank you for proving me right.

3203
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:13,120
There we go.

3204
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:14,120
Oh, thank you.

3205
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:17,120
I knew you'd come through for me.

3206
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:23,120
Grievance hashtag and I'm grievance number 2793 on September 5th, 2016.

3207
03:10:23,120 --> 03:10:24,120
Trixie.

3208
03:10:24,120 --> 03:10:26,120
I assume that's as Trixie did this, this, this and this.

3209
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:27,120
Yes, yes, yes.

3210
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:28,120
I'm a very.

3211
03:10:28,120 --> 03:10:32,120
Yes, I am a very cantankerous and generally unpleasant person.

3212
03:10:32,120 --> 03:10:33,120
It's true.

3213
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:38,120
Anyway, let's move on to the next one.

3214
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:44,120
It's another image and a voicemail from Prince's isolation again.

3215
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:46,120
God, not another one.

3216
03:10:46,120 --> 03:10:48,120
Oh, this is.

3217
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:49,120
Oh, this is give.

3218
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:53,120
Oh, little Pikmin.

3219
03:10:54,120 --> 03:10:56,120
Martha's going to die.

3220
03:10:57,120 --> 03:10:59,120
Oh, this is from my stream.

3221
03:11:01,120 --> 03:11:04,120
Did you carve a pumpkin and put it on your head?

3222
03:11:04,120 --> 03:11:06,120
Oh, it's because you have the V2.

3223
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:09,120
Hey guys, let's play Fire Emblem.

3224
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:11,120
Always with it.

3225
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:13,120
There's so many reinforcements.

3226
03:11:15,120 --> 03:11:22,120
I've only watched you play Fire Emblem one time and boy, it sure does take a while.

3227
03:11:22,120 --> 03:11:23,120
It does.

3228
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:25,120
Boy, it sure does take a while to play it, to do a battle.

3229
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:26,120
Yeah.

3230
03:11:26,120 --> 03:11:27,120
Just like in real life.

3231
03:11:28,120 --> 03:11:29,120
Yeah, that's true.

3232
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:30,120
I don't remember the Pikmin.

3233
03:11:30,120 --> 03:11:31,120
What was the Pikmin from?

3234
03:11:32,120 --> 03:11:33,120
Yeah.

3235
03:11:34,120 --> 03:11:35,120
Why are you holding a Pikmin?

3236
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:38,120
I would say that though.

3237
03:11:38,120 --> 03:11:39,120
I would say.

3238
03:11:44,120 --> 03:11:46,120
It's a little Pikmin in real life.

3239
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:48,120
Oh my God.

3240
03:11:49,120 --> 03:11:50,120
Yeah.

3241
03:11:50,120 --> 03:11:52,120
All right, let's listen to the voicemail.

3242
03:11:53,120 --> 03:11:55,120
Three, two, one, go.

3243
03:11:56,120 --> 03:12:00,120
Oh, I just realized that I haven't contextualized the last image that I sent.

3244
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:04,120
So that is, you know, been streaming.

3245
03:12:04,120 --> 03:12:13,120
And so the next one, this one is Gib streaming, you know, as I made some eclectic fan art

3246
03:12:13,120 --> 03:12:16,120
of these two content creators streaming.

3247
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:18,120
Aren't I original?

3248
03:12:18,120 --> 03:12:23,120
Aren't I just the most fucking original fan in the world?

3249
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:24,120
Okay, enjoy.

3250
03:12:25,120 --> 03:12:26,120
We did.

3251
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:31,120
I did have a little moment where I said, oh, I threw up a little bit in my mouth because

3252
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:32,120
it just happened.

3253
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:35,120
I don't know why I'm saying Kieris to this.

3254
03:12:35,120 --> 03:12:37,120
I think it's a gummy bear.

3255
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:44,120
Maybe I'm just generally contemplating the gummy that is something I would do.

3256
03:12:44,120 --> 03:12:48,120
I did at one point step away and through my fridge and eat some and eat some gummies that

3257
03:12:48,120 --> 03:12:50,120
I just had sitting around.

3258
03:12:51,120 --> 03:12:57,120
One of these days, one of these days, how much do you think I should sell like a pound

3259
03:12:57,120 --> 03:12:59,120
of gummies for like, like 25 bucks?

3260
03:13:00,120 --> 03:13:01,120
25 bucks a pound?

3261
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:04,120
I can't visualize a pound of something.

3262
03:13:04,120 --> 03:13:11,120
I think it would be like a sort of a big handful size, you know, maybe like the size of like

3263
03:13:11,120 --> 03:13:12,120
a roll of toilet paper.

3264
03:13:12,120 --> 03:13:13,120
Yeah, probably smaller than that.

3265
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:20,120
A little smaller than a roll of toilet paper, but like a little plastic bag filled with

3266
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:21,120
little gummies in it.

3267
03:13:21,120 --> 03:13:22,120
Yeah.

3268
03:13:22,120 --> 03:13:23,120
25.

3269
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:24,120
25 bucks?

3270
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:27,120
Seems kind of steep, but I guess candy is just cheap.

3271
03:13:27,120 --> 03:13:28,120
So.

3272
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:30,120
I mean, I mean, a pound is a lot.

3273
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:31,120
A pound is a lot.

3274
03:13:32,120 --> 03:13:34,120
We've eaten that for a while.

3275
03:13:34,120 --> 03:13:37,120
Well, I mean, I wouldn't, but most people would.

3276
03:13:37,120 --> 03:13:41,120
You know, I'll try to see like how much it would actually cost me to make.

3277
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:46,120
You know, as always, I'll have to, I'll have to find, figure out the cost and then, and

3278
03:13:46,120 --> 03:13:48,120
then figure out price from there.

3279
03:13:50,120 --> 03:13:51,120
These are.

3280
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:57,120
Yeah, I mean, you'll be like competing with candy factories that can make billions of

3281
03:13:57,120 --> 03:14:01,120
candies with one cent of production.

3282
03:14:02,120 --> 03:14:03,120
Yeah.

3283
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:07,120
I can't, I can't really compete on, I can't really compete on economy of scale.

3284
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:10,120
So I'll have to make them cute.

3285
03:14:10,120 --> 03:14:12,120
I'll have to make them cute and funny somehow.

3286
03:14:12,120 --> 03:14:13,120
And like.

3287
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:15,120
Cute little.

3288
03:14:16,120 --> 03:14:20,120
Like people, I don't feel like people would need gummies in bulk.

3289
03:14:20,120 --> 03:14:23,120
They could buy little packets and then you could have the price, you could mark the

3290
03:14:23,120 --> 03:14:27,120
price up so that they, they're like, Oh, it's only a couple bucks.

3291
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:28,120
But like.

3292
03:14:29,120 --> 03:14:30,120
Scaled up.

3293
03:14:30,120 --> 03:14:34,120
It would be sound, it would sound like an unreasonable number, but scaled down.

3294
03:14:34,120 --> 03:14:35,120
It's a cute little package.

3295
03:14:36,120 --> 03:14:37,120
A cute little package.

3296
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:41,120
But I mean, if I were buying some gummies, like on a Kickstarter, I would hope to get

3297
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:43,120
like a pretty large amount.

3298
03:14:43,120 --> 03:14:44,120
I would hope.

3299
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:45,120
Yeah.

3300
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:47,120
That's what I was thinking to do a Kickstarter.

3301
03:14:47,120 --> 03:14:51,120
We're like, Hey, who, anyone who buys a pound of gummies, like if I can sell like

3302
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:53,120
20 pounds of these, then like, we're good.

3303
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:54,120
You should sell them.

3304
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:59,120
I would, I would say, I would set the, I would set the goal to like, I would set the goal

3305
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:00,120
to like 50 bucks.

3306
03:15:02,120 --> 03:15:05,120
And then like anything over and above that is just, is just gravy.

3307
03:15:08,120 --> 03:15:09,120
I don't know.

3308
03:15:10,120 --> 03:15:11,120
Yeah.

3309
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:15,120
So I was a bit of a different beast making a food product for Kickstarter.

3310
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:16,120
Yeah.

3311
03:15:16,120 --> 03:15:21,120
On, you know, I just, it would be inconvenient to make little packets cause like it's kind

3312
03:15:21,120 --> 03:15:25,120
of like, why do I even want to bother with making like a $5 sale?

3313
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:28,120
Like I got to go all the way to the fricking post office.

3314
03:15:28,120 --> 03:15:29,120
No.

3315
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:30,120
Yeah, I get it.

3316
03:15:30,120 --> 03:15:31,120
Yeah.

3317
03:15:31,120 --> 03:15:36,120
I'm just thinking of like in a shop, like a little packet of something, not like a tiny

3318
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:41,120
thing, but like to get, to get the size of a Haribo gummy bear packet.

3319
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:42,120
Yeah.

3320
03:15:42,120 --> 03:15:43,120
Yeah.

3321
03:15:43,120 --> 03:15:46,120
If I was putting them in shops, that would be a whole different story.

3322
03:15:46,120 --> 03:15:52,120
That's like a whole process to do that that I don't even, I don't even understand.

3323
03:15:52,120 --> 03:15:54,120
And this is all off topic.

3324
03:15:54,120 --> 03:15:57,120
Thank you, Prince, for the fan, for the fan art.

3325
03:15:57,120 --> 03:15:58,120
Thank you.

3326
03:15:58,120 --> 03:15:59,120
For the stream moments.

3327
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:00,120
I like mine a lot.

3328
03:16:00,120 --> 03:16:01,120
I really appreciate it.

3329
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:02,120
It's cool.

3330
03:16:02,120 --> 03:16:03,120
Okay.

3331
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:08,120
Next one is called literally world ending user experience three, two, one go.

3332
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:10,120
Ben on stcomics.com.

3333
03:16:10,120 --> 03:16:15,120
I noticed that the Beescapades when you're reading Beescapades, the tab, the name of

3334
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:18,120
the tab says the vapors instead of Beescapades.

3335
03:16:18,120 --> 03:16:22,120
All the other products are correct, but I guess you forgot to change that one when you

3336
03:16:22,120 --> 03:16:23,120
made up page.

3337
03:16:23,120 --> 03:16:26,120
So I don't know if you want to fix it or something.

3338
03:16:26,120 --> 03:16:27,120
I don't know.

3339
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:28,120
Okay.

3340
03:16:28,120 --> 03:16:29,120
Bye.

3341
03:16:29,120 --> 03:16:30,120
Bye.

3342
03:16:30,120 --> 03:16:31,120
Yeah.

3343
03:16:31,120 --> 03:16:34,120
I didn't thank you for, I'm going to put that in my notes.

3344
03:16:34,120 --> 03:16:37,120
I actually noticed there's a couple of broken links.

3345
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:45,120
So pages 83 and 90 and 106 have like, like their next button is like broken, which sucks.

3346
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:47,120
So that's not good.

3347
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:48,120
That's not good.

3348
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:50,120
I have to, I have to fix that.

3349
03:16:50,120 --> 03:16:52,120
I will get on that.

3350
03:16:52,120 --> 03:16:58,120
I'll do that at some point after maybe when I'm, maybe when I'm actually drawing it or

3351
03:16:58,120 --> 03:17:00,120
something, I'll, I'll, I'll get around to fixing that.

3352
03:17:00,120 --> 03:17:02,120
It's actually not, it's not hard to fix at all.

3353
03:17:02,120 --> 03:17:05,120
Actually, actually it would take me literally like five minutes.

3354
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:07,120
Maybe I'll just do it right after this.

3355
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:11,120
If I remember.

3356
03:17:11,120 --> 03:17:14,120
Next one is called a but a epic comic smiley face.

3357
03:17:14,120 --> 03:17:16,120
Three, two, one, go.

3358
03:17:16,120 --> 03:17:17,120
Also two things.

3359
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:20,120
I just read the escapades for the first time and it was so good.

3360
03:17:20,120 --> 03:17:22,120
Why didn't I read it sooner?

3361
03:17:22,120 --> 03:17:27,120
It's so funny and adventurous and engaging and the mechanics are great and the diction

3362
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:28,120
is so awesome.

3363
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:32,120
Then you feel good about it and yourself for making it.

3364
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:38,120
On three pages, there were technical issues with the website on 83 and 90.

3365
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:39,120
That's what I just said.

3366
03:17:39,120 --> 03:17:44,120
Next buttons that were below the page, the comic page, didn't have the right links.

3367
03:17:44,120 --> 03:17:48,120
And then on page 106, it shows that there's a second image, but it isn't loading.

3368
03:17:48,120 --> 03:17:49,120
That's the.

3369
03:17:49,120 --> 03:17:52,120
So yeah, that's, that's still Rob.

3370
03:17:52,120 --> 03:17:54,120
That's what I fucking comic anyway.

3371
03:17:54,120 --> 03:17:55,120
Okay.

3372
03:17:55,120 --> 03:17:56,120
Hey, good catch.

3373
03:17:56,120 --> 03:17:59,120
Too bad I caught them all first idiot.

3374
03:18:00,120 --> 03:18:03,120
You say with those websites still broken.

3375
03:18:03,120 --> 03:18:04,120
Yeah.

3376
03:18:04,120 --> 03:18:05,120
Yeah.

3377
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:09,120
Yeah, it's still broken, but like I knew it was broken this whole time.

3378
03:18:09,120 --> 03:18:11,120
Don't you look like a fool now.

3379
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:13,120
Um, Lamal.

3380
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:14,120
Okay.

3381
03:18:14,120 --> 03:18:16,120
Next one is called Kaga D's nuts.

3382
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:19,120
Three, two, one, go.

3383
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:26,120
Catching up on my PCP and I noticed that give has been playing some fire emblem.

3384
03:18:26,120 --> 03:18:27,120
Yeah.

3385
03:18:27,120 --> 03:18:28,120
You're not already aware.

3386
03:18:28,120 --> 03:18:34,120
There's this neat little PlayStation game called caring saga made by the creator of

3387
03:18:34,120 --> 03:18:41,120
the series shows a Kaga, AKA the guy that Nintendo desperately wants to erase from

3388
03:18:41,120 --> 03:18:42,120
existence.

3389
03:18:42,120 --> 03:18:49,120
Like he wasn't even named at all in the 30th anniversary art book collection for fire

3390
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:50,120
emblem.

3391
03:18:50,120 --> 03:18:56,120
So that's a little bit fucked up at least they had the dignity to credit him for

3392
03:18:56,120 --> 03:18:59,120
the switch release of the first fire emblem.

3393
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:02,120
So that's something I guess.

3394
03:19:02,120 --> 03:19:08,120
But anyway, caring saga literally just PlayStation fire emblem.

3395
03:19:08,120 --> 03:19:12,120
It's got these gorgeous right works.

3396
03:19:12,120 --> 03:19:17,120
Um, animation is not nearly as cool as a GBA games, but you know, it looks nice in

3397
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:20,120
its own way and it's a fun little rock.

3398
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:22,120
I highly recommend.

3399
03:19:22,120 --> 03:19:23,120
Okay.

3400
03:19:23,120 --> 03:19:26,120
I'm looking at it.

3401
03:19:26,120 --> 03:19:27,120
Tearing.

3402
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:32,120
I thought you said curing.

3403
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:35,120
It's the caring saga.

3404
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:37,120
We care about this.

3405
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:40,120
We care about you, the player.

3406
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:42,120
Oh, little tiny fruit fly.

3407
03:19:42,120 --> 03:19:43,120
No.

3408
03:19:43,120 --> 03:19:47,120
All of these images I'm finding on Google are very, very small, but I will post one

3409
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:48,120
anyway.

3410
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:51,120
So I can see what I'm looking at.

3411
03:19:51,120 --> 03:19:58,120
So like it's like little guys, little RPG.

3412
03:19:58,120 --> 03:20:03,120
Oh, look at him.

3413
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:04,120
Wait a minute.

3414
03:20:04,120 --> 03:20:07,120
Look at his face.

3415
03:20:07,120 --> 03:20:09,120
Oh, this is a better image.

3416
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:13,120
So yeah, it's grid based, but it's individual.

3417
03:20:13,120 --> 03:20:14,120
They're zoomed in.

3418
03:20:14,120 --> 03:20:16,120
So they're more like people.

3419
03:20:16,120 --> 03:20:17,120
I'm sorry.

3420
03:20:17,120 --> 03:20:23,120
All I can see is the weird tangent of how like the line of his collar leads directly into

3421
03:20:23,120 --> 03:20:26,120
the line that I think is his mouth.

3422
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:28,120
And that's just bad.

3423
03:20:28,120 --> 03:20:29,120
That's just bad design.

3424
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:32,120
That's just bad illustration work right there.

3425
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:34,120
That's a right angle.

3426
03:20:34,120 --> 03:20:36,120
Can I have right angle?

3427
03:20:36,120 --> 03:20:43,120
No, it's like the one line becomes the other line in a very way that is making me think

3428
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:46,120
I'm seeing some sort of an illusion.

3429
03:20:46,120 --> 03:20:48,120
Don't like it.

3430
03:20:48,120 --> 03:20:49,120
What is this called?

3431
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:50,120
Curing saga?

3432
03:20:50,120 --> 03:20:51,120
Tearing saga?

3433
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:52,120
Tear.

3434
03:20:52,120 --> 03:20:56,120
Like I'm crying about it.

3435
03:20:56,120 --> 03:20:59,120
Okay, so what are we going to do about this?

3436
03:20:59,120 --> 03:21:01,120
I'm going to cry about it.

3437
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:02,120
What's the solution?

3438
03:21:02,120 --> 03:21:07,120
I'm not going to play it for the Fire Emblem series, but I will probably have a look at

3439
03:21:07,120 --> 03:21:09,120
it because this looks nice.

3440
03:21:09,120 --> 03:21:12,120
There's a game that a bunch of people have recommended me.

3441
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:15,120
I'm drawing a blank on what it's called, but somebody made a...

3442
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:18,120
Super Mario Brothers 2.

3443
03:21:18,120 --> 03:21:22,120
No, it's somebody made an indie battle network.

3444
03:21:22,120 --> 03:21:25,120
It's called something like...

3445
03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:26,120
Butthole network.

3446
03:21:26,120 --> 03:21:28,120
Love is in the heart or something.

3447
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:30,120
That's not what it's called.

3448
03:21:30,120 --> 03:21:35,120
Indie battle network, one step from Eden.

3449
03:21:35,120 --> 03:21:38,120
A couple people have recommended me a game called One Step From Eden.

3450
03:21:38,120 --> 03:21:41,120
I think they might have even had a voicemail about it.

3451
03:21:41,120 --> 03:21:46,120
But I have not looked at it, but I will probably check it out at some point.

3452
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:49,120
Next one is an image.

3453
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:52,120
What is...

3454
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:53,120
Let's see.

3455
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:56,120
Is this a reference to something?

3456
03:21:56,120 --> 03:21:59,120
I don't quite understand.

3457
03:21:59,120 --> 03:22:00,120
Yeah, I'm not...

3458
03:22:00,120 --> 03:22:03,120
I mean, I ate my food and I'm big and fat.

3459
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:07,120
And I didn't finish my food and I'm a skeleton.

3460
03:22:07,120 --> 03:22:09,120
Why didn't you finish your food?

3461
03:22:09,120 --> 03:22:10,120
You could have averted this.

3462
03:22:10,120 --> 03:22:16,120
I don't know. I guess I like skeletons too much.

3463
03:22:16,120 --> 03:22:17,120
This reminds me...

3464
03:22:17,120 --> 03:22:20,120
Isn't there like a meme or something that's like...

3465
03:22:20,120 --> 03:22:22,120
Big fat capital...

3466
03:22:22,120 --> 03:22:26,120
This is like a big fat capitalist who's like telling one guy with one...

3467
03:22:26,120 --> 03:22:30,120
There's like a black guy with no cookies and there's like a white guy with one cookie

3468
03:22:30,120 --> 03:22:32,120
and the capitalist is telling the black guy like that guy.

3469
03:22:32,120 --> 03:22:36,120
No, no, he tells the white guy that guy wants to take your cookie.

3470
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:41,120
The capitalist has like a huge plate piled up with cookies or something.

3471
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:44,120
I feel like this reminds me of...

3472
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:46,120
I like the skeleton. The skull is a cool...

3473
03:22:46,120 --> 03:22:49,120
The skeleton looks really cool actually.

3474
03:22:49,120 --> 03:22:52,120
The angle on it looks good.

3475
03:22:52,120 --> 03:22:54,120
It's like our logo.

3476
03:22:54,120 --> 03:22:56,120
It's like our new logo to soon to debut.

3477
03:22:56,120 --> 03:22:57,120
Oh my god.

3478
03:22:57,120 --> 03:22:58,120
Spoilers!

3479
03:22:58,120 --> 03:22:59,120
Wow!

3480
03:22:59,120 --> 03:23:01,120
Broilers?

3481
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:05,120
Is that like black pudding or is that a sausage?

3482
03:23:05,120 --> 03:23:08,120
I thought it was like toast.

3483
03:23:08,120 --> 03:23:11,120
It looks like a biscotti.

3484
03:23:11,120 --> 03:23:12,120
You know biscotti?

3485
03:23:12,120 --> 03:23:16,120
Yeah, I thought it was a lighter color.

3486
03:23:16,120 --> 03:23:17,120
Yeah.

3487
03:23:17,120 --> 03:23:20,120
But it's shaped like one.

3488
03:23:20,120 --> 03:23:23,120
If it's a sausage, why is it off your plate?

3489
03:23:23,120 --> 03:23:25,120
You sloppy fuck.

3490
03:23:26,120 --> 03:23:27,120
Look.

3491
03:23:27,120 --> 03:23:28,120
Just throwing your food around.

3492
03:23:28,120 --> 03:23:31,120
Yeah, I was just playing with it and I died.

3493
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:33,120
Turned to a skeleton.

3494
03:23:33,120 --> 03:23:37,120
You were too busy tossing your biscotti around.

3495
03:23:37,120 --> 03:23:40,120
You couldn't bother to be asked to take a bite of it.

3496
03:23:40,120 --> 03:23:44,120
I like how you're just pointing at it.

3497
03:23:44,120 --> 03:23:46,120
Maybe I'm asking, are you going to eat that?

3498
03:23:46,120 --> 03:23:50,120
Yeah, it looks like you're saying that but I'm dead so I can't speak.

3499
03:23:50,120 --> 03:23:51,120
You're going to eat that?

3500
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:53,120
Hey buddy, are you going to eat that?

3501
03:23:53,120 --> 03:23:54,120
Nope.

3502
03:23:54,120 --> 03:23:56,120
Don't mind if I do.

3503
03:23:56,120 --> 03:24:01,120
It's just sort of like if it was like, oh Ben eats so much that I starve to death.

3504
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:03,120
But my food is still there.

3505
03:24:03,120 --> 03:24:05,120
Ben has not done this.

3506
03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:07,120
I have not done this to you.

3507
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:11,120
You did this to yourself and I'm just here to capitalize on it.

3508
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:14,120
Well, true words.

3509
03:24:14,120 --> 03:24:17,120
Gabe, if you died, would you let me eat your egg and biscotti?

3510
03:24:17,120 --> 03:24:18,120
Yeah.

3511
03:24:18,120 --> 03:24:21,120
Yeah, thank you.

3512
03:24:21,120 --> 03:24:24,120
This might happen one day.

3513
03:24:24,120 --> 03:24:25,120
Oh no.

3514
03:24:25,120 --> 03:24:29,120
And I'm going to need to know that I have your consent.

3515
03:24:29,120 --> 03:24:34,120
That means if I ever have a breakfast that consists of a single fried egg and a bit of biscotti,

3516
03:24:34,120 --> 03:24:38,120
that means somebody's out there with a sniper rifle.

3517
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:44,120
You have to put the meal down and immediately exit the building.

3518
03:24:44,120 --> 03:24:45,120
Sick.

3519
03:24:45,120 --> 03:24:49,120
All right, the next one is a vocaru.

3520
03:24:49,120 --> 03:24:50,120
You ready?

3521
03:24:50,120 --> 03:24:51,120
Yep.

3522
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:53,120
All right, three, two, one, go.

3523
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:57,120
Checking Twitter, doing what I do.

3524
03:24:57,120 --> 03:25:00,120
A new picture of Gibbente.

3525
03:25:08,120 --> 03:25:09,120
Oh my God.

3526
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:10,120
Fast.

3527
03:25:10,120 --> 03:25:12,120
Yeah, what's going on?

3528
03:25:12,120 --> 03:25:13,120
Wow.

3529
03:25:13,120 --> 03:25:16,120
Wow, it doesn't sound healthy.

3530
03:25:16,120 --> 03:25:20,120
Did I even put a picture of myself lately?

3531
03:25:21,120 --> 03:25:24,120
I don't think I've seen a new one that lately.

3532
03:25:24,120 --> 03:25:30,120
The last one was like the, wait, wait, wait, there was the one of you and you could just

3533
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:33,120
just the back of your head, but you could sort of see your face in the mirror.

3534
03:25:33,120 --> 03:25:34,120
No.

3535
03:25:34,120 --> 03:25:35,120
Was it that one?

3536
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:36,120
Yeah, it was a selfie.

3537
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:39,120
I thought that one was pretty funny.

3538
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:41,120
No, it was cool.

3539
03:25:41,120 --> 03:25:42,120
Yeah.

3540
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:44,120
Not funny.

3541
03:25:44,120 --> 03:25:48,120
It was funny that like you can only just barely see your face.

3542
03:25:48,120 --> 03:25:49,120
Oh yeah, a little bit.

3543
03:25:50,120 --> 03:25:55,120
I was fucked up about like the hairs on the back of my neck.

3544
03:25:55,120 --> 03:26:00,120
I was like, oh shit, these feel like they go way down, like way too far down.

3545
03:26:00,120 --> 03:26:04,120
And I was like, shit, I got to find, I got to take a picture of the back of my neck to

3546
03:26:04,120 --> 03:26:07,120
confirm that I don't look like a freak back there.

3547
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:10,120
Turns out look normal and it's fine.

3548
03:26:10,120 --> 03:26:17,120
But then it turns out that the image I took just happened to be nicely put together, I

3549
03:26:17,120 --> 03:26:20,120
was just sort of like, yeah, that's kind of an interesting image.

3550
03:26:20,120 --> 03:26:23,120
It's kind of like an alternative selfie.

3551
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:26,120
An alternative selfie.

3552
03:26:26,120 --> 03:26:29,120
But with the regular kind.

3553
03:26:29,120 --> 03:26:31,120
I just won't do.

3554
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:37,120
Sorry, I'm an hour behind on sleep because it was daylight savings time last night.

3555
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:42,120
So that's, you have to, you have to excuse me.

3556
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:44,120
The next one?

3557
03:26:44,120 --> 03:26:46,120
Yes, another vote.

3558
03:26:46,120 --> 03:26:47,120
Next one.

3559
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:49,120
No, no, no, the next one is the mongoose.

3560
03:26:49,120 --> 03:26:50,120
Oh, that was that?

3561
03:26:50,120 --> 03:26:51,120
Yes.

3562
03:26:51,120 --> 03:26:52,120
Okay.

3563
03:26:52,120 --> 03:26:53,120
Yeah.

3564
03:26:53,120 --> 03:26:54,120
Three, two, one, go.

3565
03:26:54,120 --> 03:26:55,120
Yeah.

3566
03:26:55,120 --> 03:26:57,120
I don't know, Jesse.

3567
03:26:57,120 --> 03:27:04,120
You've been acting connoisseurs lately.

3568
03:27:04,120 --> 03:27:09,120
I mean, LeMau, I don't know.

3569
03:27:09,120 --> 03:27:15,120
What if the PCP was among us?

3570
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:17,120
Who would be sus?

3571
03:27:17,120 --> 03:27:19,120
Who would be the imposter?

3572
03:27:19,120 --> 03:27:21,120
Who would be sus?

3573
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:23,120
And who would win?

3574
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:31,120
Vote now.

3575
03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:36,120
Jesse and Trixie, imposters, voting them out, throwing them in the air a lot.

3576
03:27:36,120 --> 03:27:38,120
That's my bid.

3577
03:27:38,120 --> 03:27:42,120
No, weird be the imposters because there's two of us.

3578
03:27:42,120 --> 03:27:49,120
We've been systematically picking off everyone, making them stop showing up to the show and

3579
03:27:49,120 --> 03:27:51,120
quit the server.

3580
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:53,120
Yeah, we started with Jeff.

3581
03:27:53,120 --> 03:27:56,120
Was it Jeff kicked first?

3582
03:27:56,120 --> 03:27:57,120
He wasn't really kicked.

3583
03:27:57,120 --> 03:27:58,120
He wasn't really kicked.

3584
03:27:58,120 --> 03:28:00,120
He was sort of like, see you guys, yeah.

3585
03:28:00,120 --> 03:28:03,120
It was sort of like, yeah, this isn't really a thing.

3586
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:10,120
And then we killed monkey, we stabbed him, got him with our alien face.

3587
03:28:10,120 --> 03:28:11,120
Yes.

3588
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:13,120
Everyone came around like, oh, shit, there's a body.

3589
03:28:13,120 --> 03:28:14,120
What's going on?

3590
03:28:14,120 --> 03:28:15,120
There's a big old eye.

3591
03:28:15,120 --> 03:28:16,120
Right.

3592
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:17,120
We just kept killing.

3593
03:28:17,120 --> 03:28:19,120
We just kept killing.

3594
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:26,120
I mean, I think the only other official kill was Trixie, and that was suicide.

3595
03:28:26,120 --> 03:28:29,120
Trixie tripped out of the airlock.

3596
03:28:29,120 --> 03:28:30,120
Oh, no, DeVoo.

3597
03:28:30,120 --> 03:28:36,120
DeVoo also, I mean, we never found the body, so we don't know what happened to DeVoo.

3598
03:28:36,120 --> 03:28:40,120
Presumed suicide as well.

3599
03:28:40,120 --> 03:28:46,120
But I mean, that's the mark of a really excellent kill is that you think it was a suicide.

3600
03:28:46,120 --> 03:28:49,120
I like Amongus.

3601
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:52,120
Me too.

3602
03:28:52,120 --> 03:28:55,120
Oh, Amongus.

3603
03:28:55,120 --> 03:28:57,120
I get it.

3604
03:28:57,120 --> 03:28:59,120
I get it.

3605
03:28:59,120 --> 03:29:00,120
Lol.

3606
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:01,120
All right.

3607
03:29:01,120 --> 03:29:05,120
Next one is Kongalooia final.

3608
03:29:05,120 --> 03:29:07,120
Let's go.

3609
03:29:07,120 --> 03:29:10,120
Oh, the URL ends in bonk.

3610
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:12,120
Oh, yeah.

3611
03:29:12,120 --> 03:29:14,120
That can't be a coincidence.

3612
03:29:14,120 --> 03:29:15,120
Yes, it can.

3613
03:29:15,120 --> 03:29:17,120
It absolutely can.

3614
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:19,120
I don't think so.

3615
03:29:19,120 --> 03:29:20,120
All right.

3616
03:29:20,120 --> 03:29:22,120
Three, two, one, go.

3617
03:29:37,120 --> 03:29:39,120
Oh, oh, oh.

3618
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:41,120
He made Mootslow.

3619
03:29:41,120 --> 03:29:43,120
He kept you high.

3620
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:46,120
But this Kong is a fuck of a guy.

3621
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:51,120
The number guy can make a cramlin' cry out.

3622
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:55,120
Kongalooia.

3623
03:29:55,120 --> 03:29:59,120
Kongalooia.

3624
03:29:59,120 --> 03:30:03,120
Kongalooia.

3625
03:30:03,120 --> 03:30:08,120
Kongalooia.

3626
03:30:08,120 --> 03:30:12,120
Kongalooia.

3627
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:15,120
Kongalooia.

3628
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:20,120
Kongalooia.

3629
03:30:20,120 --> 03:30:23,120
Kongalooia.

3630
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:29,120
Kongalooia.

3631
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:30,120
Kongalooia.

3632
03:30:30,120 --> 03:30:32,700
Behold!

3633
03:30:47,900 --> 03:30:48,860
You just keepacking

3634
03:31:00,120 --> 03:31:07,120
Oh, let's be those pineapple scones.

3635
03:31:07,120 --> 03:31:11,120
Grace, now let's all reach a zen.

3636
03:31:11,120 --> 03:31:18,120
Don't you understand?

3637
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:24,120
Oh, yeah.

3638
03:31:24,120 --> 03:31:26,120
Wow.

3639
03:31:26,120 --> 03:31:28,120
Nice.

3640
03:31:28,120 --> 03:31:30,120
It's just undeniable.

3641
03:31:30,120 --> 03:31:32,120
Yeah, it is nice.

3642
03:31:32,120 --> 03:31:34,120
He gave it his all.

3643
03:31:34,120 --> 03:31:36,120
He did.

3644
03:31:36,120 --> 03:31:38,120
And he did it.

3645
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:40,120
The mad lad, he pulled it off.

3646
03:31:40,120 --> 03:31:42,120
I'd buy that on cassette tape.

3647
03:31:42,120 --> 03:31:46,120
I would buy that on eight track.

3648
03:31:46,120 --> 03:31:49,120
I would buy that on a disc.

3649
03:31:49,120 --> 03:31:52,120
I would buy that on a floppy.

3650
03:31:52,120 --> 03:31:54,120
I would buy it with a mouse.

3651
03:31:54,120 --> 03:31:56,120
I would buy it in a house.

3652
03:31:56,120 --> 03:32:03,120
Just an impressive level of execution on display on this little project.

3653
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:05,120
All right.

3654
03:32:05,120 --> 03:32:07,120
I think we've got...

3655
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:09,120
I think the next one might be related.

3656
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:11,120
The next one is called,

3657
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:13,120
A Reveal and an Announcement,

3658
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:16,120
Dry Dump December at DustyDumps.com.

3659
03:32:16,120 --> 03:32:18,120
Three, two, one, go.

3660
03:32:18,120 --> 03:32:21,120
Hello, it is me, Dusty Dumps.

3661
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:23,120
I hope you enjoyed the Kong Luya track.

3662
03:32:23,120 --> 03:32:26,120
The Saga, the Kong Luya Saga.

3663
03:32:26,120 --> 03:32:29,120
That waschly dump.

3664
03:32:29,120 --> 03:32:32,120
Well, anyway, I'm here to announce that the DZD Moysmel album

3665
03:32:32,120 --> 03:32:34,120
that I announced almost a year ago

3666
03:32:34,120 --> 03:32:38,120
is finally done and it's out now.

3667
03:32:38,120 --> 03:32:40,120
Yo!

3668
03:32:40,120 --> 03:32:41,120
It's on Bandcamp.

3669
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:43,120
It's 23 tracks long

3670
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:47,120
with wildly varying lengths from tracks that are like 10 seconds long

3671
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:50,120
to epic seven-minute oddities.

3672
03:32:50,120 --> 03:32:52,120
Holy shit.

3673
03:32:52,120 --> 03:32:55,120
Our album exclusive, five of them are bonus tracks

3674
03:32:55,120 --> 03:32:57,120
that you can only get if you get the full album.

3675
03:32:57,120 --> 03:33:01,120
Each track comes with a little blurb describing the lore of the track

3676
03:33:01,120 --> 03:33:03,120
and the conception of it,

3677
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:05,120
and each track also comes with lyrics.

3678
03:33:05,120 --> 03:33:07,120
You can sing along at home.

3679
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:10,120
The album is at a pay what you want model

3680
03:33:10,120 --> 03:33:13,120
so you can pay me five billion dollars for it,

3681
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:15,120
or just zero.

3682
03:33:15,120 --> 03:33:17,120
I think I will.

3683
03:33:17,120 --> 03:33:19,120
Oh, that rules.

3684
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:21,120
The album includes tracks such as

3685
03:33:21,120 --> 03:33:23,120
B for Kringus Bingus,

3686
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:25,120
The Tale of the Golden Witch,

3687
03:33:25,120 --> 03:33:27,120
the Natehead theme song,

3688
03:33:27,120 --> 03:33:29,120
Lord of Ghosts vs. King Herod,

3689
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:31,120
and many, many more.

3690
03:33:31,120 --> 03:33:33,120
Check it out.

3691
03:33:33,120 --> 03:33:36,120
My next voicemail will just be a link to the album.

3692
03:33:36,120 --> 03:33:38,120
Okay, see ya. Bye. Hope you enjoy.

3693
03:33:38,120 --> 03:33:40,120
Thank you, David.

3694
03:33:40,120 --> 03:33:43,120
Thank you, Dusty Dumps.

3695
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:46,120
I might have forgotten a couple of those.

3696
03:33:46,120 --> 03:33:49,120
I might go and refresh my memory.

3697
03:33:49,120 --> 03:33:51,120
All of these were played as voicemails.

3698
03:33:51,120 --> 03:33:53,120
Maybe there's some secrets.

3699
03:33:53,120 --> 03:33:55,120
He did say there were some exclusives.

3700
03:33:55,120 --> 03:33:57,120
Yeah, exclusives.

3701
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:59,120
We should post this.

3702
03:33:59,120 --> 03:34:01,120
We'll definitely put it in the description.

3703
03:34:01,120 --> 03:34:03,120
Maybe we'll post this on Twitter,

3704
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:05,120
or post this around.

3705
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:07,120
I'm definitely going to pick it up,

3706
03:34:07,120 --> 03:34:09,120
and I'll probably drop,

3707
03:34:09,120 --> 03:34:11,120
probably pay.

3708
03:34:11,120 --> 03:34:13,120
I'll actually probably pay something.

3709
03:34:13,120 --> 03:34:15,120
Anyone that picks that up,

3710
03:34:15,120 --> 03:34:17,120
throw this guy a little bit.

3711
03:34:17,120 --> 03:34:19,120
Tip this guy for his...

3712
03:34:19,120 --> 03:34:21,120
for his...

3713
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:23,120
all the work he's put into this.

3714
03:34:23,120 --> 03:34:25,120
I appreciate it a lot.

3715
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:27,120
Awesome.

3716
03:34:27,120 --> 03:34:29,120
All right.

3717
03:34:29,120 --> 03:34:31,120
Mutsandu.bandcamp.com

3718
03:34:31,120 --> 03:34:33,120
That's from Mutsandu.

3719
03:34:33,120 --> 03:34:35,120
Kongeluya to you, sir.

3720
03:34:35,120 --> 03:34:37,120
I tip my hat.

3721
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:41,120
Just great.

3722
03:34:41,120 --> 03:34:43,120
Great stuff.

3723
03:34:43,120 --> 03:34:45,120
You want to do the next one?

3724
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:47,120
Cool.

3725
03:34:47,120 --> 03:34:49,120
Next one is an image.

3726
03:34:49,120 --> 03:34:51,120
Oh.

3727
03:34:51,120 --> 03:34:53,120
Okay.

3728
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:55,120
Medical man.

3729
03:34:55,120 --> 03:34:57,120
It's a bunch of tweets of me asking

3730
03:34:57,120 --> 03:34:59,120
why isn't Medeker dead yet?

3731
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:03,120
Oh, it's my...

3732
03:35:03,120 --> 03:35:05,120
it's my plebe and the weave,

3733
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:07,120
hair, head image here.

3734
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:09,120
With the soyjack

3735
03:35:09,120 --> 03:35:11,120
on it, of course.

3736
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:13,120
Medeker is staying alive to own the libs.

3737
03:35:13,120 --> 03:35:15,120
I was just...

3738
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:17,120
freaking...

3739
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:19,120
Keemstar was like...

3740
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:21,120
he's dying any day now.

3741
03:35:21,120 --> 03:35:23,120
He's on my show.

3742
03:35:23,120 --> 03:35:25,120
He's almost dead. He's going to be dead real soon.

3743
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:27,120
Why would you trust a thing Keemstar says?

3744
03:35:29,120 --> 03:35:31,120
Oh, God, you're right.

3745
03:35:31,120 --> 03:35:33,120
I'm so stupid.

3746
03:35:33,120 --> 03:35:35,120
I'm so fucking stupid.

3747
03:35:35,120 --> 03:35:37,120
Damn it. Keemstar would say the most

3748
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:39,120
entertaining thing.

3749
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:41,120
That's not necessarily true.

3750
03:35:41,120 --> 03:35:43,120
I guess that would...

3751
03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:45,120
I guess it would be

3752
03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:47,120
get more people to watch if he was like,

3753
03:35:47,120 --> 03:35:49,120
this guy is going to be dead tomorrow.

3754
03:35:49,120 --> 03:35:51,120
And he's second now.

3755
03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:53,120
Tune in to watch him die alive.

3756
03:35:53,120 --> 03:35:55,120
Before the show, he was like,

3757
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:57,120
hey, Medeker, what if I actually tell them

3758
03:35:57,120 --> 03:35:59,120
you're going to die?

3759
03:35:59,120 --> 03:36:01,120
What if we keep saying you're going to die?

3760
03:36:01,120 --> 03:36:03,120
And I say, no, this is it. No, this is it.

3761
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:05,120
He'll be dead immediately after this

3762
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:07,120
show concludes.

3763
03:36:07,120 --> 03:36:09,120
And he was like, yeah, tell him that.

3764
03:36:09,120 --> 03:36:11,120
The idiots will believe anything.

3765
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:13,120
And they were right. I did.

3766
03:36:13,120 --> 03:36:15,120
Well,

3767
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:17,120
consider this lib owned, I guess.

3768
03:36:19,120 --> 03:36:21,120
Next one is called Derriere.

3769
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:23,120
Three, two, one, go.

3770
03:36:23,120 --> 03:36:25,120
Fucking tussle, bro.

3771
03:36:25,120 --> 03:36:27,120
You want to fight? I'll fight you to the last man.

3772
03:36:27,120 --> 03:36:29,120
And

3773
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:31,120
I'll send a battalion.

3774
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:33,120
I'll send a rap stallion

3775
03:36:33,120 --> 03:36:35,120
to your house to knife you.

3776
03:36:35,120 --> 03:36:37,120
And then

3777
03:36:37,120 --> 03:36:39,120
I'll invite you to

3778
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:41,120
this coffin I've prepared

3779
03:36:41,120 --> 03:36:43,120
out

3780
03:36:43,120 --> 03:36:45,120
by your mother's derriere

3781
03:36:45,120 --> 03:36:47,120
in the field.

3782
03:36:49,120 --> 03:36:51,120
I'm going to kill you, Ben.

3783
03:36:51,120 --> 03:36:53,120
Damn, fuck.

3784
03:36:53,120 --> 03:36:55,120
By your mother's derriere in the field.

3785
03:36:55,120 --> 03:36:57,120
Was that

3786
03:36:57,120 --> 03:36:59,120
was that Ethan Ralph?

3787
03:36:59,120 --> 03:37:01,120
No, wait, why would it be?

3788
03:37:01,120 --> 03:37:03,120
I thought it sounded a little bit

3789
03:37:03,120 --> 03:37:05,120
like a Southern accent at the very end

3790
03:37:05,120 --> 03:37:07,120
there, but no.

3791
03:37:07,120 --> 03:37:09,120
Ethan Ralph was watching the PCP

3792
03:37:09,120 --> 03:37:11,120
and says, I guess my mom's dead.

3793
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:13,120
Well, you know, because his baby

3794
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:15,120
was the samurai, you know, it's

3795
03:37:15,120 --> 03:37:17,120
no, I thought you meant like the actual

3796
03:37:19,120 --> 03:37:21,120
Yeah, the actual Ethan Ralph

3797
03:37:21,120 --> 03:37:23,120
has an actual samurai

3798
03:37:23,120 --> 03:37:25,120
reincarnated.

3799
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:27,120
Oh, wow. In the ghost of

3800
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:29,120
Roseanne.

3801
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:31,120
Whatever his fucking name is.

3802
03:37:31,120 --> 03:37:33,120
The

3803
03:37:33,120 --> 03:37:35,120
Well, I guess my mom's dead and she's

3804
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:37,120
buried in the field and

3805
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:39,120
there's going to be a battle. Bring it on.

3806
03:37:39,120 --> 03:37:41,120
It's going to send a battalion

3807
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:43,120
and a rap scallion. Which one are you more

3808
03:37:43,120 --> 03:37:45,120
scared about?

3809
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:47,120
I don't know, one good

3810
03:37:47,120 --> 03:37:49,120
one good rap scallion can really get

3811
03:37:49,120 --> 03:37:51,120
some work done.

3812
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:53,120
Probably I could

3813
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:55,120
be harder to defend myself against an

3814
03:37:55,120 --> 03:37:57,120
entire battalion, if I'm being honest.

3815
03:37:57,120 --> 03:37:59,120
My house is not like

3816
03:37:59,120 --> 03:38:01,120
positioned for like military defense.

3817
03:38:01,120 --> 03:38:03,120
So I'd probably be pretty weak to a frontal

3818
03:38:03,120 --> 03:38:05,120
assault.

3819
03:38:05,120 --> 03:38:07,120
Next one is called Bencon 4 3 2

3820
03:38:07,120 --> 03:38:09,120
1 go.

3821
03:38:09,120 --> 03:38:11,120
Do we actually know if anyone funded

3822
03:38:11,120 --> 03:38:13,120
Ratcon 4 because they wanted to see

3823
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:15,120
more Bencene?

3824
03:38:15,120 --> 03:38:17,120
No.

3825
03:38:17,120 --> 03:38:19,120
No.

3826
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:21,120
Wait, we don't know that.

3827
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:23,120
It could be that everyone did that

3828
03:38:23,120 --> 03:38:25,120
for that reason. It could be

3829
03:38:25,120 --> 03:38:27,120
and it should be

3830
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:29,120
but I can't prove it.

3831
03:38:29,120 --> 03:38:31,120
Nobody knows

3832
03:38:31,120 --> 03:38:33,120
at the end of the day. We only have hearsay

3833
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:35,120
and speculation.

3834
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:37,120
Next one is

3835
03:38:37,120 --> 03:38:39,120
called Sonic Review 3 2 1

3836
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:41,120
go.

3837
03:38:41,120 --> 03:38:43,120
Sonic the Hedgehog is amazing.

3838
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:45,120
I love everything about Sonic the Hedgehog.

3839
03:38:45,120 --> 03:38:47,120
He's blue.

3840
03:38:47,120 --> 03:38:49,120
He's fast.

3841
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:51,120
He has an attitude

3842
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:53,120
and he eats the same kind of food

3843
03:38:53,120 --> 03:38:55,120
that you and me do.

3844
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:57,120
Hot dogs.

3845
03:38:57,120 --> 03:38:59,120
Chili dogs.

3846
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:01,120
Really.

3847
03:39:01,120 --> 03:39:03,120
I love hedgehogs.

3848
03:39:03,120 --> 03:39:05,120
Just in general.

3849
03:39:05,120 --> 03:39:07,120
They're alright.

3850
03:39:07,120 --> 03:39:09,120
The only thing about it

3851
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:11,120
is

3852
03:39:11,120 --> 03:39:13,120
I tried to play Sonic

3853
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:15,120
and

3854
03:39:15,120 --> 03:39:17,120
I thought the point was to go fast

3855
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:19,120
but like every time you build up

3856
03:39:19,120 --> 03:39:21,120
a little bit of speed you just ran into

3857
03:39:21,120 --> 03:39:23,120
something.

3858
03:39:23,120 --> 03:39:25,120
What was the point?

3859
03:39:25,120 --> 03:39:27,120
Didn't you watch the Davoo video?

3860
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:41,120
That's one of those reviews I hear

3861
03:39:41,120 --> 03:39:43,120
all about. You gotta watch that

3862
03:39:43,120 --> 03:39:45,120
Davoo video where she talks about

3863
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:47,120
how it's about

3864
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:49,120
controlling your momentum

3865
03:39:49,120 --> 03:39:51,120
to get the big loops.

3866
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:53,120
Blue Hedgehog's

3867
03:39:53,120 --> 03:39:55,120
Nightmares.

3868
03:39:55,120 --> 03:39:57,120
If only it was Green Hedgehog.

3869
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:59,120
If you want to play a game

3870
03:39:59,120 --> 03:40:01,120
a man

3871
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:03,120
after your own heart who wants a game

3872
03:40:03,120 --> 03:40:05,120
that's just about going fast

3873
03:40:05,120 --> 03:40:07,120
that's Oolulilia

3874
03:40:07,120 --> 03:40:09,120
that's Platform Masters.

3875
03:40:09,120 --> 03:40:11,120
Did you ever see footage of Platform Masters?

3876
03:40:11,120 --> 03:40:13,120
No.

3877
03:40:13,120 --> 03:40:15,120
He was making a game

3878
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:17,120
for a while

3879
03:40:17,120 --> 03:40:19,120
and it was going to be called Platform Masters

3880
03:40:19,120 --> 03:40:21,120
and it was like

3881
03:40:21,120 --> 03:40:23,120
let me see if I can find a screenshot of it.

3882
03:40:23,120 --> 03:40:25,120
Oolulilia

3883
03:40:25,120 --> 03:40:27,120
Platform Masters

3884
03:40:31,120 --> 03:40:33,120
Yeah, here we go.

3885
03:40:33,120 --> 03:40:35,120
Platform Masters Development, New Forested Mountains.

3886
03:40:37,120 --> 03:40:39,120
Okay.

3887
03:40:39,120 --> 03:40:41,120
So basically

3888
03:40:45,120 --> 03:40:47,120
Platform Masters

3889
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:49,120
is a game

3890
03:40:49,120 --> 03:40:51,120
where you just

3891
03:40:53,120 --> 03:40:55,120
where you just go

3892
03:40:55,120 --> 03:40:57,120
where you just hold the forward button

3893
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:01,120
and go really fast.

3894
03:41:01,120 --> 03:41:03,120
There are platforms and there are objects to jump on

3895
03:41:03,120 --> 03:41:05,120
but

3896
03:41:05,120 --> 03:41:07,120
it's just about

3897
03:41:07,120 --> 03:41:09,120
accumulating a huge amount of speed

3898
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:11,120
and getting really high

3899
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:13,120
is pretty much the point of it.

3900
03:41:13,120 --> 03:41:15,120
Was he in the middle of a dive right there?

3901
03:41:15,120 --> 03:41:17,120
They were flying.

3902
03:41:17,120 --> 03:41:19,120
I think the idea is that

3903
03:41:19,120 --> 03:41:21,120
it literally works kind of like

3904
03:41:21,120 --> 03:41:23,120
a Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters

3905
03:41:23,120 --> 03:41:25,120
where your character just holds

3906
03:41:25,120 --> 03:41:27,120
their arms out and it makes them

3907
03:41:27,120 --> 03:41:29,120
and it makes them fly.

3908
03:41:29,120 --> 03:41:31,120
Oh, there's something I really like

3909
03:41:31,120 --> 03:41:33,120
about the way this looks.

3910
03:41:33,120 --> 03:41:35,120
If you watch

3911
03:41:35,120 --> 03:41:37,120
his logs where he talks about development

3912
03:41:37,120 --> 03:41:39,120
like

3913
03:41:39,120 --> 03:41:41,120
he's got the speed counter and the height counter

3914
03:41:41,120 --> 03:41:43,120
and pretty much

3915
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:45,120
he designed the game

3916
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:47,120
so that you could achieve tremendous

3917
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:49,120
heights and outrageous speeds.

3918
03:41:49,120 --> 03:41:51,120
But

3919
03:41:51,120 --> 03:41:53,120
a lot of what he talks about

3920
03:41:53,120 --> 03:41:55,120
is about the parallax scrolling of the backgrounds

3921
03:41:55,120 --> 03:41:57,120
and he very carefully

3922
03:41:57,120 --> 03:41:59,120
calculated the distance

3923
03:41:59,120 --> 03:42:01,120
of every object in the background

3924
03:42:01,120 --> 03:42:03,120
and he made it parallax scroll

3925
03:42:03,120 --> 03:42:05,120
as you move in a

3926
03:42:05,120 --> 03:42:07,120
completely scientifically accurate way.

3927
03:42:07,120 --> 03:42:09,120
Even like there's one where you're on the moon

3928
03:42:09,120 --> 03:42:11,120
and you can see Earth

3929
03:42:11,120 --> 03:42:13,120
in the sky and the Earth will

3930
03:42:13,120 --> 03:42:15,120
parallax scroll very slowly

3931
03:42:15,120 --> 03:42:17,120
at a scientifically accurate rate

3932
03:42:17,120 --> 03:42:19,120
to you traveling like thousands of miles an hour

3933
03:42:19,120 --> 03:42:21,120
across the surface of the moon.

3934
03:42:21,120 --> 03:42:23,120
That's great.

3935
03:42:23,120 --> 03:42:25,120
Yeah, that's where

3936
03:42:25,120 --> 03:42:27,120
you really want your development resources going.

3937
03:42:27,120 --> 03:42:29,120
But yeah,

3938
03:42:29,120 --> 03:42:31,120
it's kind of Sonic inspired.

3939
03:42:31,120 --> 03:42:33,120
You can see there's little jump platforms.

3940
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:37,120
Can I play it?

3941
03:42:37,120 --> 03:42:39,120
I don't think a playable version was ever released.

3942
03:42:39,120 --> 03:42:41,120
No, I like this.

3943
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:43,120
I like how it looks. I just want to jump around in it.

3944
03:42:43,120 --> 03:42:45,120
I don't know,

3945
03:42:45,120 --> 03:42:47,120
but I think that all that ever surfaced of it

3946
03:42:47,120 --> 03:42:49,120
was videos of him

3947
03:42:49,120 --> 03:42:51,120
showing development progress.

3948
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:53,120
Unfortunately.

3949
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:55,120
I guess I'll watch those then.

3950
03:42:55,120 --> 03:42:57,120
Yeah, they're kind of...

3951
03:42:57,120 --> 03:42:59,120
It's interesting to hear him

3952
03:42:59,120 --> 03:43:01,120
just how focused he is

3953
03:43:01,120 --> 03:43:03,120
on the parallax scrolling

3954
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:05,120
is remarkable.

3955
03:43:07,120 --> 03:43:09,120
I think that...

3956
03:43:09,120 --> 03:43:11,120
The next one is called

3957
03:43:11,120 --> 03:43:13,120
Funny Voice Mail.

3958
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:15,120
Wait, hang on.

3959
03:43:15,120 --> 03:43:17,120
Yeah, 3, 2, 1, go.

3960
03:43:17,120 --> 03:43:19,120
So that last voicemail was kind of bad

3961
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:21,120
and I kind of wish I didn't send it.

3962
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:23,120
I thought it was a good jumping off point.

3963
03:43:23,120 --> 03:43:25,120
So, okay.

3964
03:43:25,120 --> 03:43:27,120
So if Sonic the Hedgehog

3965
03:43:29,120 --> 03:43:31,120
and Shadow the Hedgehog

3966
03:43:31,120 --> 03:43:33,120
were in a gay

3967
03:43:33,120 --> 03:43:35,120
romantic relationship,

3968
03:43:35,120 --> 03:43:37,120
do you think Sonic

3969
03:43:37,120 --> 03:43:39,120
would be the top or the bottom?

3970
03:43:41,120 --> 03:43:43,120
That was a nice break there.

3971
03:43:43,120 --> 03:43:45,120
He tried to keep a straight face.

3972
03:43:45,120 --> 03:43:47,120
He just blurred it out.

3973
03:43:47,120 --> 03:43:49,120
I'm not sure if that laugh

3974
03:43:49,120 --> 03:43:51,120
was part of the kayfabe or not.

3975
03:43:53,120 --> 03:43:55,120
I don't fucking know.

3976
03:43:57,120 --> 03:43:59,120
I think they'd both be tops

3977
03:43:59,120 --> 03:44:01,120
and that's why they can't... fuck.

3978
03:44:01,120 --> 03:44:03,120
No, Shadow was the bottom.

3979
03:44:03,120 --> 03:44:05,120
You think?

3980
03:44:05,120 --> 03:44:07,120
You'd be a bottom and then Maria

3981
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:09,120
would be the top.

3982
03:44:09,120 --> 03:44:11,120
Well...

3983
03:44:11,120 --> 03:44:13,120
It's just how it is.

3984
03:44:13,120 --> 03:44:15,120
Is that like incest?

3985
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:17,120
I don't...

3986
03:44:17,120 --> 03:44:19,120
I don't know anything about the story.

3987
03:44:19,120 --> 03:44:21,120
I just know that he likes Maria.

3988
03:44:21,120 --> 03:44:23,120
He likes Maria, but she died?

3989
03:44:23,120 --> 03:44:25,120
Is she a sister?

3990
03:44:25,120 --> 03:44:27,120
I don't...

3991
03:44:27,120 --> 03:44:29,120
I don't know.

3992
03:44:29,120 --> 03:44:31,120
I think maybe he was made in a lab

3993
03:44:31,120 --> 03:44:33,120
and she adopted him.

3994
03:44:33,120 --> 03:44:35,120
Maybe so they're probably not.

3995
03:44:35,120 --> 03:44:37,120
Look at them, they don't look blood related.

3996
03:44:37,120 --> 03:44:39,120
Yeah,

3997
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:41,120
it's probably fine.

3998
03:44:41,120 --> 03:44:43,120
Shadow's clearly a bottom because he's

3999
03:44:43,120 --> 03:44:45,120
an underling.

4000
03:44:45,120 --> 03:44:47,120
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.

4001
03:44:47,120 --> 03:44:49,120
Sorry.

4002
03:44:49,120 --> 03:44:51,120
I was going to say hedgehog.

4003
03:44:51,120 --> 03:44:53,120
He's a hedgehog?

4004
03:44:57,120 --> 03:44:59,120
He's an edgy boy,

4005
03:44:59,120 --> 03:45:01,120
but he just wants someone to love him.

4006
03:45:01,120 --> 03:45:03,120
Kind of shy.

4007
03:45:07,120 --> 03:45:09,120
Just by their very nature,

4008
03:45:09,120 --> 03:45:11,120
they curl up into a little bulb and someone comes close

4009
03:45:11,120 --> 03:45:13,120
and they're like, don't touch me.

4010
03:45:13,120 --> 03:45:15,120
Don't come near me.

4011
03:45:15,120 --> 03:45:17,120
Don't come near me.

4012
03:45:17,120 --> 03:45:19,120
That's what I say when I'm the top.

4013
03:45:19,120 --> 03:45:21,120
I say don't come near me.

4014
03:45:21,120 --> 03:45:23,120
Don't come in my sight, slave.

4015
03:45:23,120 --> 03:45:25,120
That's not true.

4016
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:27,120
It's the other way around.

4017
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:29,120
They say that to me.

4018
03:45:31,120 --> 03:45:33,120
I have nothing else to say about this stupid question.

4019
03:45:33,120 --> 03:45:35,120
Next one is called

4020
03:45:35,120 --> 03:45:37,120
How Angry Was Ben St.

4021
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:39,120
This Episode Scale of 1 to 10?

4022
03:45:39,120 --> 03:45:41,120
I'm down to like a light 3.

4023
03:45:41,120 --> 03:45:43,120
I'm down to a strong 3 to a light 4.

4024
03:45:43,120 --> 03:45:45,120
I'm down to a 5.

4025
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:47,120
I'm only at like 6 or 7.

4026
03:45:47,120 --> 03:45:49,120
It's going up.

4027
03:45:49,120 --> 03:45:51,120
How are you going to ask this question?

4028
03:45:55,120 --> 03:45:57,120
I'm down to like a normal.

4029
03:45:57,120 --> 03:45:59,120
I'm down to a manageable 3 or so.

4030
03:45:59,120 --> 03:46:01,120
That's where I put myself.

4031
03:46:01,120 --> 03:46:03,120
What do you think?

4032
03:46:03,120 --> 03:46:05,120
Am I right?

4033
03:46:05,120 --> 03:46:07,120
Yeah, I'd say you've calmed down.

4034
03:46:07,120 --> 03:46:09,120
I have calmed down.

4035
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:11,120
I was at 9.

4036
03:46:13,120 --> 03:46:15,120
It was not a productive place to be.

4037
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:19,120
I'm back.

4038
03:46:19,120 --> 03:46:21,120
Baby.

4039
03:46:21,120 --> 03:46:23,120
I'm back and better than ever.

4040
03:46:23,120 --> 03:46:25,120
Next one is called

4041
03:46:25,120 --> 03:46:27,120
A Little Pome for Y'all

4042
03:46:27,120 --> 03:46:29,120
Let's do one go.

4043
03:46:29,120 --> 03:46:31,120
This is not my voice.

4044
03:46:31,120 --> 03:46:33,120
Okay.

4045
03:46:33,120 --> 03:46:35,120
This is nothing more

4046
03:46:35,120 --> 03:46:37,120
than brief electrical impulses.

4047
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:39,120
These that you hear right now

4048
03:46:39,120 --> 03:46:41,120
is not my voice.

4049
03:46:41,120 --> 03:46:43,120
It's true.

4050
03:46:43,120 --> 03:46:45,120
I am an invisible man

4051
03:46:45,120 --> 03:46:47,120
and whispers in your ear the news

4052
03:46:47,120 --> 03:46:49,120
that in my now you are invisible too.

4053
03:46:51,120 --> 03:46:53,120
Imagination games.

4054
03:46:53,120 --> 03:46:55,120
Don't tell us Mr. Sensible Guy.

4055
03:46:55,120 --> 03:46:57,120
I was always there among the crazy.

4056
03:46:57,120 --> 03:46:59,120
I see if we ever knew what a game was

4057
03:46:59,120 --> 03:47:01,120
or even what is imagination.

4058
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:05,120
This is not my voice.

4059
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:07,120
I am just whispering in your ear.

4060
03:47:09,120 --> 03:47:11,120
Fog Jesse Wood.

4061
03:47:13,120 --> 03:47:15,120
Okay.

4062
03:47:17,120 --> 03:47:19,120
That was a nice poem I guess.

4063
03:47:19,120 --> 03:47:21,120
That was a nice poem.

4064
03:47:21,120 --> 03:47:23,120
Right.

4065
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:25,120
I don't want it.

4066
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:27,120
I don't want to comment on the end part.

4067
03:47:27,120 --> 03:47:29,120
Next one is called

4068
03:47:29,120 --> 03:47:31,120
A May Neutral.

4069
03:47:31,120 --> 03:47:33,120
Next one is called Benefit of the Gib.

4070
03:47:33,120 --> 03:47:35,120
Three, two, one, go.

4071
03:47:53,120 --> 03:47:55,120
Yeah.

4072
03:48:13,120 --> 03:48:15,120
Yeah. I can take you more seriously

4073
03:48:15,120 --> 03:48:17,120
without the silly voice.

4074
03:48:17,120 --> 03:48:19,120
Yeah. I can't tell if

4075
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:21,120
if this is a sincerely meant

4076
03:48:21,120 --> 03:48:23,120
sentiment or not.

4077
03:48:23,120 --> 03:48:25,120
Well they said it was sincere.

4078
03:48:25,120 --> 03:48:27,120
Well they said

4079
03:48:27,120 --> 03:48:29,120
they did use that word.

4080
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:33,120
Is that a quote from someone else

4081
03:48:33,120 --> 03:48:35,120
or I mean

4082
03:48:35,120 --> 03:48:37,120
it's fair criticism.

4083
03:48:37,120 --> 03:48:39,120
I mean it's fair criticism.

4084
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:41,120
I don't know.

4085
03:48:41,120 --> 03:48:43,120
I'm coping. I'm coping.

4086
03:48:43,120 --> 03:48:45,120
I'm trying to get better.

4087
03:48:45,120 --> 03:48:47,120
Ben because we used to do a podcast.

4088
03:48:47,120 --> 03:48:49,120
I know it's unproductive.

4089
03:48:49,120 --> 03:48:51,120
I know it can be

4090
03:48:51,120 --> 03:48:53,120
unproductive sometimes.

4091
03:48:53,120 --> 03:48:55,120
I know I get a little

4092
03:48:55,120 --> 03:48:57,120
heated over some things occasionally.

4093
03:48:57,120 --> 03:48:59,120
I know I hold grudges

4094
03:48:59,120 --> 03:49:01,120
for

4095
03:49:01,120 --> 03:49:03,120
whatever.

4096
03:49:05,120 --> 03:49:07,120
It's probably something I should be working on.

4097
03:49:13,120 --> 03:49:15,120
Try not to let it

4098
03:49:15,120 --> 03:49:17,120
try not to let it

4099
03:49:17,120 --> 03:49:19,120
hold me back from doing some things

4100
03:49:19,120 --> 03:49:21,120
that I'm trying to do.

4101
03:49:21,120 --> 03:49:23,120
Trying to get this

4102
03:49:23,120 --> 03:49:25,120
new video.

4103
03:49:25,120 --> 03:49:27,120
Trying to get another video out soon.

4104
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:29,120
Do the comic party.

4105
03:49:29,120 --> 03:49:31,120
Rebrand the show.

4106
03:49:31,120 --> 03:49:33,120
We're moving forward.

4107
03:49:33,120 --> 03:49:35,120
We're moving forward.

4108
03:49:35,120 --> 03:49:37,120
It's the 90s.

4109
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:39,120
Our music is about something now.

4110
03:49:41,120 --> 03:49:43,120
The 90s.

4111
03:49:43,120 --> 03:49:45,120
In the 90s.

4112
03:49:45,120 --> 03:49:47,120
Our music is about the 90s.

4113
03:49:47,120 --> 03:49:49,120
That's Alex Yeek.

4114
03:49:49,120 --> 03:49:51,120
If you're familiar.

4115
03:49:51,120 --> 03:49:53,120
He tells a

4116
03:49:53,120 --> 03:49:55,120
an old metalhead.

4117
03:49:55,120 --> 03:49:57,120
He's like ugh metal sucks.

4118
03:49:57,120 --> 03:49:59,120
It's all screaming.

4119
03:49:59,120 --> 03:50:01,120
It's the 90s. Our music is about something.

4120
03:50:01,120 --> 03:50:03,120
Our music is about things now.

4121
03:50:05,120 --> 03:50:07,120
Great. Great stuff.

4122
03:50:07,120 --> 03:50:09,120
Well shit that was the last voicemail.

4123
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:11,120
Was it?

4124
03:50:11,120 --> 03:50:13,120
Being critical of me.

4125
03:50:13,120 --> 03:50:15,120
It's fine.

4126
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:17,120
He's mean.

4127
03:50:17,120 --> 03:50:19,120
He was mean. He's mean to me.

4128
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:21,120
Give.

4129
03:50:21,120 --> 03:50:23,120
Stop him.

4130
03:50:23,120 --> 03:50:25,120
Arrest him.

4131
03:50:25,120 --> 03:50:27,120
Arrest him.

4132
03:50:27,120 --> 03:50:29,120
I am not your policeman or woman.

4133
03:50:29,120 --> 03:50:31,120
Hmm.

4134
03:50:31,120 --> 03:50:33,120
Well.

4135
03:50:33,120 --> 03:50:35,120
I guess he'll get away.

4136
03:50:35,120 --> 03:50:37,120
With it.

4137
03:50:37,120 --> 03:50:39,120
I guess I can't do shit.

4138
03:50:39,120 --> 03:50:41,120
Didn't we have voice jail?

4139
03:50:41,120 --> 03:50:43,120
You could put him in there.

4140
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:45,120
Put him in voicemail?

4141
03:50:45,120 --> 03:50:47,120
No.

4142
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:49,120
You have to repent.

4143
03:50:49,120 --> 03:50:51,120
This is what you get.

4144
03:50:51,120 --> 03:50:53,120
You get voicemailers.

4145
03:50:53,120 --> 03:50:55,120
Maybe if he didn't put a funny filter on his voice

4146
03:50:55,120 --> 03:50:57,120
I would put him in voice jail.

4147
03:50:57,120 --> 03:50:59,120
But he did.

4148
03:50:59,120 --> 03:51:01,120
So it's okay.

4149
03:51:01,120 --> 03:51:03,120
All is forgiven.

4150
03:51:03,120 --> 03:51:05,120
That's it.

4151
03:51:05,120 --> 03:51:07,120
Thanks everyone for your voicemail.

4152
03:51:07,120 --> 03:51:09,120
I think.

4153
03:51:09,120 --> 03:51:11,120
What do you think?

4154
03:51:11,120 --> 03:51:13,120
I'm thinking we can have the website

4155
03:51:13,120 --> 03:51:15,120
more or less online

4156
03:51:15,120 --> 03:51:17,120
and pretty much done by next week.

4157
03:51:17,120 --> 03:51:19,120
Probably even by the time you listen to this.

4158
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:21,120
And

4159
03:51:21,120 --> 03:51:23,120
I don't want to make any promises about

4160
03:51:23,120 --> 03:51:25,120
when the perfect planning

4161
03:51:25,120 --> 03:51:27,120
podcast will be out, but I will be

4162
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:29,120
starting to work on

4163
03:51:29,120 --> 03:51:31,120
I'll be starting to draw more stuff.

4164
03:51:31,120 --> 03:51:33,120
I'll be starting to draw this week.

4165
03:51:33,120 --> 03:51:35,120
I can't put it off any longer.

4166
03:51:35,120 --> 03:51:37,120
And

4167
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:39,120
And thanks for that guy who said

4168
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:41,120
that he liked Biscopades. That means a lot to me

4169
03:51:41,120 --> 03:51:43,120
that somebody thought it was good.

4170
03:51:43,120 --> 03:51:45,120
Yeah, I liked it.

4171
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:47,120
Thank you.

4172
03:51:47,120 --> 03:51:49,120
I'll do my best.

4173
03:51:49,120 --> 03:51:51,120
I need to write an outline.

4174
03:51:51,120 --> 03:51:53,120
What I need to do is take some notes

4175
03:51:53,120 --> 03:51:55,120
and outline okay. Here's where we're at in Biscopades.

4176
03:51:55,120 --> 03:51:57,120
Here are the elements that I had

4177
03:51:57,120 --> 03:51:59,120
previously introduced.

4178
03:51:59,120 --> 03:52:01,120
And then block out a little thing like okay.

4179
03:52:01,120 --> 03:52:03,120
Here's where I want the story to get

4180
03:52:03,120 --> 03:52:05,120
over the course of however many pages

4181
03:52:05,120 --> 03:52:07,120
of Biscopades I want to do. How many pages do you think

4182
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:09,120
I should do? How many pages of Clarissa

4183
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:11,120
do you want to put in?

4184
03:52:11,120 --> 03:52:13,120
There's

4185
03:52:13,120 --> 03:52:15,120
I think like 17 or 18

4186
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:17,120
pages.

4187
03:52:17,120 --> 03:52:19,120
Okay.

4188
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:21,120
You can do however many you want.

4189
03:52:21,120 --> 03:52:23,120
It doesn't need to be a big thing, but yeah.

4190
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:25,120
Are you going to do it like standard comic page

4191
03:52:25,120 --> 03:52:27,120
format?

4192
03:52:27,120 --> 03:52:29,120
I will give you the template

4193
03:52:29,120 --> 03:52:31,120
for you to slot your images into.

4194
03:52:31,120 --> 03:52:33,120
Yeah, that would be.

4195
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:35,120
That would be great.

4196
03:52:35,120 --> 03:52:37,120
There'll be

4197
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:39,120
a left or a right page.

4198
03:52:39,120 --> 03:52:41,120
Okay, cool.

4199
03:52:41,120 --> 03:52:43,120
So you can put things in margins and stuff.

4200
03:52:43,120 --> 03:52:45,120
Yeah, give me that.

4201
03:52:47,120 --> 03:52:49,120
Yes.

4202
03:52:49,120 --> 03:52:51,120
This is the week that I get cracking on that.

4203
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:53,120
Yes.

4204
03:52:53,120 --> 03:52:55,120
I will

4205
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:57,120
I guess make that

4206
03:52:57,120 --> 03:52:59,120
PDF.

4207
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:01,120
And then also next week maybe

4208
03:53:01,120 --> 03:53:03,120
I'm going to take

4209
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:05,120
book.

4210
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:07,120
I think the website will come before

4211
03:53:07,120 --> 03:53:09,120
the Amazon thing.

4212
03:53:09,120 --> 03:53:11,120
Oh, you mean the Clarissa

4213
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:13,120
book?

4214
03:53:13,120 --> 03:53:15,120
Yeah, for my

4215
03:53:15,120 --> 03:53:17,120
end of things.

4216
03:53:17,120 --> 03:53:19,120
Because

4217
03:53:19,120 --> 03:53:21,120
that would be great.

4218
03:53:21,120 --> 03:53:23,120
I don't even know if it works

4219
03:53:23,120 --> 03:53:25,120
outside of the U.S.

4220
03:53:25,120 --> 03:53:27,120
It might just be a U.S.

4221
03:53:27,120 --> 03:53:29,120
specific Amazon

4222
03:53:29,120 --> 03:53:31,120
that's fine. At least a bunch of people

4223
03:53:31,120 --> 03:53:33,120
can buy it.

4224
03:53:33,120 --> 03:53:35,120
I'd be surprised

4225
03:53:35,120 --> 03:53:37,120
if Amazon wouldn't ship to the U.K.

4226
03:53:37,120 --> 03:53:39,120
Yeah.

4227
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:41,120
I would also be surprised,

4228
03:53:41,120 --> 03:53:43,120
but I think it was on Amazon.com

4229
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:45,120
not .co.uk, but I guess

4230
03:53:45,120 --> 03:53:47,120
Amazon.com is the main one.

4231
03:53:47,120 --> 03:53:49,120
Yeah.

4232
03:53:49,120 --> 03:53:51,120
So I don't know. I still got lots of

4233
03:53:51,120 --> 03:53:53,120
guides to read

4234
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:55,120
on the thing like how to

4235
03:53:55,120 --> 03:53:57,120
upload your thing and what's the

4236
03:53:57,120 --> 03:53:59,120
specifications.

4237
03:53:59,120 --> 03:54:01,120
That's just a lot of stuff.

4238
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:05,120
I know what you mean.

4239
03:54:05,120 --> 03:54:07,120
I know what you mean.

4240
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:09,120
Yeah.

4241
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:11,120
Um,

4242
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:13,120
all right.

4243
03:54:13,120 --> 03:54:15,120
Let's put

4244
03:54:15,120 --> 03:54:17,120
our nose to the grindstones.

4245
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:19,120
They're the next week on the Pro Crastinators

4246
03:54:19,120 --> 03:54:21,120
podcast.

4247
03:54:21,120 --> 03:54:23,120
Patreon.com.

4248
03:54:23,120 --> 03:54:25,120
If you want bonus episodes, if you want behind

4249
03:54:25,120 --> 03:54:27,120
the scenes,

4250
03:54:27,120 --> 03:54:29,120
discussion to listen to

4251
03:54:29,120 --> 03:54:31,120
if you want to have your name

4252
03:54:31,120 --> 03:54:33,120
in the thank you

4253
03:54:33,120 --> 03:54:35,120
page of the upcoming

4254
03:54:35,120 --> 03:54:37,120
periodical.

4255
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:39,120
We'll be doing that.

4256
03:54:39,120 --> 03:54:41,120
And

4257
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:43,120
anything else

4258
03:54:43,120 --> 03:54:45,120
before we end?

4259
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:47,120
Patreon.com.

4260
03:54:47,120 --> 03:54:49,120
I don't even know if you said that.

4261
03:54:49,120 --> 03:54:51,120
I think I did, but it's okay.

4262
03:54:51,120 --> 03:54:53,120
We can say it again.

4263
03:54:53,120 --> 03:54:55,120
Follow me on Twitch

4264
03:54:55,120 --> 03:54:57,120
and Gib.

4265
03:54:57,120 --> 03:54:59,120
Give and take on Twitch.

4266
03:54:59,120 --> 03:55:01,120
Thank you

4267
03:55:01,120 --> 03:55:03,120
for listening and we'll see you next week.

4268
03:55:03,120 --> 03:55:05,120
Goodbye.
