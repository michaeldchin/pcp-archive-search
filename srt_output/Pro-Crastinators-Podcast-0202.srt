Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,840
This is number 202, don't check that dial, you're in the right place, I promise you.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,520
I'm the best guy ever, and we've got Tom Oliver.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:26,840
I am ready for another action-packed episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Same.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
Same.

We've got Gibbontake.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,840
Take a look at my brother.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
He's Ben Saint.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Take a look at my brother.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
He's Ben Saint.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Take a look at my brother.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
He's Ben Saint.

Take a look at my brother.

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
He's Ben Saint.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Take a look at my brother.

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Take a look at my brother.

25
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
He's Ben Saint.

27
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Take a look at my brother.

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

29
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
He's Ben Saint.

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
Take a look at my brother.

31
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

33
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

34
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

35
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

36
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

37
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

38
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

39
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

40
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

41
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

42
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

43
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

44
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

45
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

46
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

47
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
He's the only one I got, unfortunately.

48
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
All right.

49
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Let me, let me quickly.

50
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
I don't have to spend too long on it.

51
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Guys, I've developed a new skill.

52
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
I can read the minds of presidential candidates.

53
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
This is Bernie Sanders at this very moment.

54
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
The blacks.

55
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
What did the blacks betray?

56
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Why?

57
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Why?

58
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I give the blacks everything.

59
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
And they just, they give me shit every day.

60
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
He fought their rights.

61
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Why can't they vote for me?

62
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,840
He got arrested protecting their fucking right to be in our society.

63
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Like the damn white savior that he is, god damn it.

64
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
And frankly, we're all sick of it, us in the black community.

65
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
It's okay.

66
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
It's okay.

67
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
It's not just yet.

68
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
South Carolina.

69
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,840
South Carolina is a freakish, little mutant state.

70
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Black people in South Carolina are not like other black people.

71
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
They're South Carolinians, i.e. they're freaks.

72
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
They're monsters.

73
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Listen, funny thing, funny thing about the South, this is a factoid that I learned.

74
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
People in South Carolina overwhelmingly voted for Joe Biden.

75
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Even ones that reported agreeing with Sanders on like every issue.

76
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
It's got to be optic stuff.

77
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah, ones that said they were for Medicare for all voted Biden.

78
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Ones that describe themselves as very liberal voted Biden and so on and so forth.

79
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,840
It's just like a cultural, like social pressure expectation thing.

80
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,840
They all just like Joe Biden and you're expected to like Joe Biden if you're a South Carolinian.

81
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Got to be the O.Q., the Obama question.

82
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
It's got to be a factor here.

83
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Maybe.

84
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Partially.

85
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Maybe South Carolinians don't look up who does what.

86
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Funny thing, there was this guy, this House Majority Whip James Clyburn is like a very

87
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
I learned what a whip is from House of Cards.

88
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I know what that is.

89
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
I actually don't know what a whip is.

90
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Tell me what a whip is.

91
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
What they do is they get their party to vote for the things they collectively decide they want.

92
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
That's what a whip does.

93
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
They literally call the vote.

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,840
They want to get the representatives of the party.

95
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,840
If the leader says we're doing this thing and the whip will get all of the other people

96
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
to do it.

97
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
That's the idea.

98
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah.

99
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
To literally whip them into line.

100
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
As in he convinces other people to vote.

101
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
I mean, yes, correct.

102
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
But isn't that what all representatives do?

103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
No, no, no.

104
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
They're arguing their case.

105
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,840
It's in what do you call it, inside thing.

106
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,840
It's not like whipping the voters into shape.

107
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
It's whipping the other representatives of that party.

108
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Right.

109
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I know.

110
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
I know.

111
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
But I thought that's what representatives do.

112
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
They go to Congress.

113
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
They make speeches.

114
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
They talk about stuff.

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
They make proposals and then they vote on them.

116
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
I kind of thought...

117
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Yeah, and then the whip just changes their vote.

118
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Just destroys them.

119
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Inside our politics stuff.

120
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,840
We probably would want purely the will of the people from whatever area they're from

121
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
to pressure people.

122
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,840
This is like an internal congressional pressure system.

123
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
The idea that a local community votes in a representative says,

124
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm going to do this for the local community.

125
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,840
He goes up and he's part of a party and then a guy from the top says,

126
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,840
change what you say.

127
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Change what you're doing because the leader of the party says, fuck you.

128
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
I've got a whip here and I'm going to fucking whip you.

129
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
That's the reality.

130
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,840
But I was elected and my local constituents, they won't mean it.

131
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
They won't mean it.

132
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,840
No, no, no.

133
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
Whopam.

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Whopam.

135
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Whopam.

136
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
The upshot it.

137
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
I stayed up last night watching the results.

138
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
The upshot is this.

139
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Bad result for Bernie yesterday, but they are...

140
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Is he surging ahead overall?

141
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
He did surge ahead with Nevada.

142
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
South Carolina has almost...

143
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,840
I think Bernie is still ahead in delegates, but not by very much.

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,840
South Carolina is the most populous state that has voted so far.

145
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
They have the most representatives that voted so far,

146
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,840
and they also happen to be the worst state.

147
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,840
By the time people hear this, Super Tuesday will be over,

148
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
which will basically determine the whole rest of this fucking shebang.

149
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Why is that the case?

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Because this happens to be one day called Super Tuesday

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,840
where I think 13 different states vote,

152
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,840
including really big ones like California and Texas.

153
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
I think Texas.

154
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,840
So you get so much momentum if you win at all from that thing.

155
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,840
A big part of the delegate count is decided on Super Tuesday for some reason.

156
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Is it like once the results come in, everyone who hasn't voted yet

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,840
in their states will be like, oh, I can see who's going to win,

158
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
so I'm just going to vote like that?

159
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Yes, that is the effect of reality.

160
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Basically, yeah.

161
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Isn't that stupid?

162
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
It shouldn't work that way basically.

163
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
But wait a minute, isn't that stupid?

164
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes.

165
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,840
I think the moral of the story is that the more you dig into this process,

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
the more you realize that 99% of it is asinine and moronic,

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
and it doesn't serve any purpose.

168
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
There's been two caucuses so far.

169
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
At the Iowa caucus, sometimes they had to flip coins

170
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
to determine who got a delegate.

171
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,840
In Nevada, sometimes they pulled cards out of a deck.

172
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Such fucking cringe.

173
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Yeah.

174
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
You got to decide the shit somehow.

175
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
I like the theming.

176
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I like the theming that in the Vegas state,

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,840
they flip cards to determine who gets the fucking delegate.

178
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,840
That's some like homestuck level, like a modus,

179
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
fetch modus level.

180
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
I say we upgrade that.

181
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,840
We have it so that the candidates have to personally speed run.

182
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
What's that sonic level that looks like Las Vegas,

183
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
like the gaming zone or whatever?

184
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,840
They should be decided based on that scale.

185
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
I think they should add a clause that says

186
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
that any candidate who successfully back hovers

187
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
and clips through the walls of the White House

188
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
into the Oval Office.

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Whoever can do it with the least amount of A presses.

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Through the wall.

191
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I could see Bernie doing that.

192
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I haven't seen the inside of the White House,

193
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,840
but I now definitely think there is an endless staircase

194
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
up to the Oval Office.

195
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,840
You need a certain amount of political stars to gain access,

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
or you could do the backers long trial.

197
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,840
You have to get 120 delegates.

198
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
It's like how many...

199
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,840
No, that's what they're going to do if they force a brokered convention.

200
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,840
It's like what's the fewest number of delegates

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,840
you can get and still cheat your way through the walls

202
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
into the Oval Office.

203
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
That's been the race.

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
They coveted zero delegate winner, which I'm looking forward to.

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
The fabled. Nobody thought they could do it

206
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
until they unlocked New Tech.

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
It was called Super Delegates.

208
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Before I explain how Super Delegates work,

209
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm going to have to explain. Parallel universes.

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
It turns out they can actually...

211
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
We don't accept Super Delegates.

212
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
There are no tool-assisted runs in this competition.

213
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Right. Very much.

214
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
This is just a hypothetical run.

215
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
You could potentially get it,

216
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,840
but if you're playing on the real hardware, it's more difficult.

217
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,840
That's true, but you've got to use the Japanese copy

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
of the electoral voting system.

219
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
You've got to long jump from Japan to get into the White House.

220
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
It saves you a couple of frames here and there

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
when you long jump.

222
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Buildup speed. Ah ha, funny. Ah ha, hee hee.

223
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
I would care a lot more about politics

224
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,840
if they were all true gamers and they play video games all the time.

225
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,840
There's an account on Twitter called GamerPrez.

226
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Have you seen this guy? Yeah, I'm aware of him.

227
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Let me...

228
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Is it Andrew Dang?

229
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,840
No, it's Ace Watkins, GamerPrez 2020.

230
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
GamerPrez is pretty great.

231
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Does he stream?

232
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
No, he's just... Not that I know of.

233
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
No, he does.

234
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Yeah, he twitched out TV slash...

235
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Oh, no, he was streaming from PAX this weekend.

236
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Well, he needs to clip into the White House.

237
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
I mean, obviously, this is his turf.

238
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Society is like a big game of Smash Bros.

239
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Yes, we're all playing the same game,

240
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
but many are forced to play with a sideways joycon.

241
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
We need policies that let all Americans play

242
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
with the GameCube controls.

243
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,840
They can hit beefy Joker combos to the best of their ability.

244
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,840
You know, when you put it like that, I understand.

245
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
At last, I see.

246
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
That's a good one.

247
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
This is, by the way,

248
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
speaking of broker conventions,

249
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
whipping delegates into producing the results desired and whatnot.

250
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Wait, wait, I just want to say...

251
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,840
The reason I brought up the House majority whip James Clyburn

252
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,840
is that he endorsed Biden, and I guess it made a huge difference.

253
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
But what I'm confused about

254
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,840
is how are the people of South Carolina

255
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,840
so clued in that they know who their state's

256
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,840
House majority whip representative in Congress...

257
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I don't know who my local representative is.

258
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I don't.

259
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
I think they probably just...

260
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
But not clued in an ignorant enough

261
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,840
to not know that the Medicare for all guy is Bernie Sanders.

262
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,840
I think, Ben, that's a very revealing question.

263
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I think what it says is that, I mean, fair...

264
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Whether it speaks well to human society or not,

265
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I think people identify themselves with a guy

266
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
that clearly they like, like this representative

267
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
from their area and whatnot,

268
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
and they think, I'm going to trust this guy

269
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
rather than independently investigating which candidates

270
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
may or may not represent their interests best.

271
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
No, it's not. He's from Delaware.

272
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
He's just very popular in the South.

273
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Well, okay.

274
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
What I'm saying is that this Clyburn guy,

275
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,840
he's not like a big... He's a representative.

276
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
And I'm saying, I don't know my representative.

277
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I feel like most Americans probably don't know

278
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
who they represent.

279
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
To me, if my local representative was like,

280
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
hey, guys, actually Warren is going to be really great.

281
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
I don't fucking care what you think. Who are you?

282
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I mean, I heard that...

283
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
But apparently these people are clued in enough

284
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,840
to know who their local state rep is,

285
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,840
but not clued in on the race enough to be like,

286
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,840
boy, I'm very liberal. I'm for Medicare for all.

287
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
I think the system needs reform from the ground up

288
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
and not just moderate change.

289
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
But my neighbor said Biden's a nice guy,

290
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
so I'm going to vote for him.

291
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
But what this may speak to,

292
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
it's the fact that most voters are, in fact,

293
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,840
like older adults who know those sorts of things more,

294
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
as opposed to our generation.

295
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
I don't know. That's my best guess.

296
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm just saying, but then they should know who Bernie is.

297
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
They should know that Bernie's...

298
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
They should know the policy difference.

299
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,840
I mean, Bernie does better with younger voters than older, so...

300
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,840
It could be like there's like a local news

301
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
that sort of shits on Bernie or something,

302
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,840
and they're like, ah, yeah, fuck him.

303
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Fuck that guy. He's got white hair.

304
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,840
He does. My... Unlike Biden.

305
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
God, let me just... Let me complain.

306
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,840
The thing I hate most about Biden is his haircut,

307
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,840
and I don't like how he keeps it long in the back.

308
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Like a mullet?

309
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
It's like a little long, I don't know.

310
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Every time I see him from behind, I'm like,

311
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
dude, just trim me off the fucking back of your head, dude.

312
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Why do you keep it long back there? It's fucked up.

313
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
It's fucked up, man.

314
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
It's unfortunate.

315
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
The thing that keeps me going, though,

316
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,840
demographically, not similar at all to the United States,

317
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,840
the Democrats in South Carolina are basically Republicans,

318
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
because there's just...

319
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
In some parts of the country, I think black people just are Democrats,

320
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
even if they're conservative, right?

321
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Because I think it's just like...

322
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I've heard something like that.

323
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
It's just like societally expected.

324
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Like, if you're black, you should be a Democrat.

325
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
That's just what people think.

326
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
But like, South Carolina is a very conservative state.

327
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
So they're basically just Republicans that call themselves Democrats

328
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
because that's what you're expected to do.

329
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,840
So, I don't know. It's a highly unrepresentative state.

330
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
It's the worst state in the Union.

331
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,840
We should crack it off into the sea.

332
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Let's vote. What's the worst state?

333
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I mean, you know, this might have been a setback for you

334
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
for South Carolina. I would go with...

335
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Florida might be the worst. Florida...

336
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I think Florida and South Carolina are...

337
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Florida's cool.

338
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I mean, the whole South is pretty bad.

339
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,840
And Florida men. Countless Florida men doing all kinds of kooky stuff.

340
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
That's true.

341
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
I'm a fan of those.

342
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Florida's very entertaining.

343
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
If nothing else.

344
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
If any state was going to succeed

345
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
and become an anarcho-capitalist godland,

346
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
it would be Florida in my guess.

347
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
So I have hope for them.

348
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
A guy on Twitter the other day...

349
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,840
A guy on Twitter the other day was sincerely arguing at me

350
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
that we should have no minimum wage

351
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,840
because, sure, workers might not be able to buy that 70-inch TV they wanted,

352
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,840
but collectively, employers would hire more people.

353
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,840
So even though individuals would be getting paid less,

354
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,840
on the whole, the total working class would be more employed

355
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
and be getting more money.

356
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
And no.

357
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Oh, God.

358
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
It's a complicated fucking... I don't know.

359
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
That's not...

360
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
That's the worst fucking idea I've ever...

361
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Yeah, no minimum...

362
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah, just let them pay fucking workers like fucking 50 cents an hour

363
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
if they want.

364
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Like, sure, okay.

365
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I mean, great idea.

366
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,840
1,000 guys at, like, 0.1 PC pennies.

367
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Just employ the entire population of the United States at 0.1 cents an hour.

368
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,840
I mean, they can dig and do that, but the only problem is,

369
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,840
let's say you do employ the entire working class at, like, 50 cents an hour.

370
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,840
They can't buy any of the product those companies need to stay in business,

371
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
so they'll inevitably have to adjust prices anyway.

372
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,840
The thing that a business will do, they will always do that.

373
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,840
They will always hire the fewest number of people at the lowest wage possible.

374
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Sure.

375
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
The argument that, like, if you lower the minimum wage,

376
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,840
businesses will hire more people is total bunk,

377
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,840
because there's no incentive for them to hire more people than they need.

378
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Well, there's a little incentive.

379
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Just because wages are lower.

380
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
They still want to hire the least number of people,

381
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
no matter what the wage is.

382
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
If you have more workers, like, if you can...

383
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
It depends on, like, what your business is and what it needs,

384
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,840
because, like, for example, if you can hire two workers and double your production,

385
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,840
and now it costs the same as it was to hire one worker before,

386
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
then, theoretically, you could do that,

387
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,840
because it could be a bigger benefit to you to double your production speed

388
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
than to just reduce your overall labor costs.

389
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,840
There could be benefits down the pipeline of your particular business.

390
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Well, I mean, yeah, sure.

391
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
I guess so.

392
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
But, like...

393
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Okay, I'm losing...

394
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
It's a very complicated question.

395
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
There's a lot of factors, but, like, on the whole,

396
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,840
a minimum wage seems like a safe thing to have.

397
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
A business might be able to...

398
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Yeah, okay, I guess it's true.

399
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,840
I don't think it makes any sense.

400
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
I don't think lowering the minimum wage is so...

401
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,840
I think that a business that cannot pay a living wage should just die.

402
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
I think that's how we should do it.

403
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I guess we have to die, because we can't afford to pay Eleazar a living wage.

404
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
We don't hire him full-time.

405
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
He's not working 40 hours a week for us.

406
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Ben, would you say that's true of any business, regardless of size?

407
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Yes.

408
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Because you know that I was...

409
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
You know, I happened to hear your boy, Vouch, the other day,

410
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,840
who was doing a debate where he argued because that his channel was so small,

411
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
he was exempted.

412
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
You just said it matters regardless of size, Ben.

413
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Wait, weren't you?

414
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Yeah, I watched it.

415
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Yeah, okay.

416
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,840
But I mean, Vouch himself said he felt that his business was exempted

417
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,840
because he was so small, it didn't make sense economically, for a small-sized business.

418
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Do you disagree with that?

419
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Exempt from what?

420
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,840
From paying the people who work for him a living wage.

421
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:51,840
I think morally, it just shouldn't be the case that you can get away with not paying people a living wage,

422
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
whatever a living wage happens to be.

423
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
I agree.

424
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I mean, is it also true that Bernie Sanders himself couldn't pay his wages,

425
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,840
his workers $15 an hour because their organization couldn't afford it?

426
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
That is true.

427
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Didn't that also happen?

428
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
That did happen.

429
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
Well, obviously scale matters.

430
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,840
I mean, that would probably be...

431
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
I don't know.

432
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Where are you getting that information?

433
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
I don't know how much Bernie...

434
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
I don't remember.

435
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
I don't know how much Bernie pays his employees, do you?

436
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
It was like a year or so.

437
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,840
It was a while ago, they were talking about how we couldn't afford to pay $15 to whoever was working for him.

438
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,840
If he can't, then I'm sure nobody else on the campaign show can.

439
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,840
You hear, like, Khloé Bouchard is apparently fucking withheld benefits

440
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
and withheld payments from her employers and stuff.

441
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Well, the point here is just to say, these things seem like Amazon can't afford,

442
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
so they did.

443
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Fantastic.

444
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Like a mom-and-pop shop that's trying to get off the ground doesn't seem appropriate

445
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,840
to hold the exact same standard for them as a giant corporation.

446
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Well, this...

447
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
These things should probably vary.

448
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
This brings up...

449
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
I was watching a video.

450
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
And let the workers decide if they want to work at those places or not.

451
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,840
There was an interesting point someone was saying that the minimum wage actually helps,

452
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,840
like, fuck up the way business is done because, like, if you have a minimum wage,

453
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,840
like, big corporate interests, like big corporations like Amazon, like Apple and stuff,

454
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
you can afford to pay higher minimum wage while you're driving smaller businesses out

455
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
of the equation.

456
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,840
So you basically, like, consolidate corporate and business interests like a hand of smaller

457
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
and fewer, fewer companies.

458
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Which kind of makes sense.

459
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Yes, sure.

460
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
But here's the thing.

461
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Here's the thing with the minimum wage.

462
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Like, we're talking about $15 an hour, but $15 an hour is not, like, a mathematically

463
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
arrived at number.

464
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,840
It's like a slogan that sounds good because it's better than the deal that everybody

465
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
has now.

466
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Like, living wage is different from state to state.

467
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
And, yeah.

468
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,840
The whole thing is that there is so much inflated costs and all of the things we buy already

469
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
because corporations are trying to ring every dime they can out of their customers.

470
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Like, even if you can't have a living wage in terms of, like, paying $15 an hour, like,

471
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,840
just ethically speaking, like, if you're working full time, you should be able to at least,

472
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,840
like, afford a minimum standard of, like, supporting yourself, you know?

473
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Because, like, a lot of the common defense I hear of against, like, the minimum wage

474
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,840
and stuff is that, like, oh, a lot of these jobs weren't designed to live off of.

475
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
And it's like, that could be true.

476
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
But that doesn't change the fact that, like, the reality is there are people who have to

477
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
take these jobs and need to live off of them.

478
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
And so, like, there is a problem here and it needs to be addressed.

479
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,840
It's the same thing with Medicare for All.

480
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
You know, like, a lot of the argument is that it's so fucking expensive.

481
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
How are we going to pay for it?

482
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
It doesn't make any sense.

483
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
It's like, yeah, it's expensive and that is a problem.

484
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,840
But that doesn't change the fact that, like, when the coronavirus comes around and we all

485
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,840
have to take, like, a month off of work and quarantine, everyone's going to go, like,

486
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,840
$40,000 a debt in medical bills.

487
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,840
So, like, there are problems that need to be solved, regardless of these issues.

488
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
And the discussion needs to be had at some point.

489
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
We can't just keep kicking the can down the road.

490
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Uh, yeah, that all sounds pretty reasonable.

491
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Um, workers of the world tonight.

492
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I don't know what else to say about that.

493
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
A minimum wage is good.

494
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Raising the minimum wage, I don't know.

495
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
I think it's good.

496
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Like, you could say that, like, oh, it might kill smaller businesses and only the juggernauts

497
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
will survive.

498
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I mean, maybe.

499
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,840
But do you think Amazon wants to be forced to pay all its workers $15 an hour?

500
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
No.

501
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
At the end of the day, no.

502
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
That costs them a lot of money and that's good.

503
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Well, I guess it comes down to, like, how does the equation play out long term for Jeff

504
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Bezos, right?

505
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Like, he pays his employees $15 an hour and that's bad.

506
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,840
But, like, maybe 10 years from now, uh, all of the local competition for Amazon is destroyed.

507
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,840
And so everyone has to buy from Amazon now and now he's making more money that easily

508
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
pays for the $15 and then some.

509
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
So, like.

510
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,840
I mean, I, I, I don't, I don't think that's, that doesn't seem very likely.

511
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,840
That doesn't seem very likely that demand, that demanding Amazon pay more would through

512
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,840
some, like, weird, I mean, through, through some kind of like accidental math calculus

513
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
actually ends up making the money.

514
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,840
It just seems really unlikely and like an outside scenario.

515
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
I mean, I don't know.

516
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm just saying it's possible.

517
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
I just, I'm not an economist.

518
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm no fucking expert.

519
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Isn't there a phenomenon that is already happening like with Walmart and like squeezing out businesses

520
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,840
where they plop down and they can afford to undercut businesses there because they have

521
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
so much funding from their, you know, international business that like they're able to sell things

522
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
cheaper.

523
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
So people just go there and it squeezes out.

524
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,840
I think the whole like big shops destroying small businesses is just a thing that is naturally

525
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
always going to happen.

526
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Yeah.

527
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,840
And the workers being paid fairly is not the tipping point.

528
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
It's, it just slowly always happens.

529
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
It depends.

530
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Like it matters which tool you use to solve a given problem too.

531
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,840
So like, is the solution to all of these concerns make a nationwide like set limit for minimum

532
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,840
for any given job, or is it to like for Amazon, for the people who specifically work at Amazon

533
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,840
to like, if they want to unionize, that seems like the right kind of move.

534
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
And if they want to fire everybody, I mean, fair enough, but like it's for the workers,

535
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,840
I would argue, to negotiate these issues with their specific employers because not every

536
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
employer is in fact the same.

537
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,840
And there's always going to be differences between these things that have to be worked out

538
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,840
based on the specific circumstances of that employment.

539
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Sure.

540
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
That'd be my guess.

541
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Sure.

542
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Well, it is, I mean, it is for, I mean, under capitalism, right?

543
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,840
We can accept capitalism for now, for the sake of this discussion.

544
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,840
It is the responsibility of an employer or a union on behalf of the employers to negotiate

545
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
these things.

546
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Things like Medicare for all $15 minimum wage and gives those, that party more bargaining

547
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,840
power and just like a better place coming into the negotiations.

548
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
I don't know.

549
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
If you're living-

550
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,840
I think there's just a good faith argument to be had that does that specifically, does

551
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,840
that solve all the problems we want and not generate more than it fixes?

552
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
There's an argument to be had.

553
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,840
I come down, I come down on the side that like, okay, we've got this gig, we've got the gig

554
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,840
economy, we've got high employment, but high underemployment, lots of people working, having

555
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
to work multiple jobs, lots of people like being underemployed working jobs that don't

556
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
pay enough to live on.

557
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,840
That seems to be a situation in which the employers have all the power, right?

558
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,840
They've got all the workers they want, but they have them at like, they have them working

559
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
for no benefits at really low wages.

560
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,840
That seems like a situation in which the employers are the ones with all the advantages and so

561
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,840
it would seem like a good idea to pass reforms that, you know, balance the scales.

562
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
For situations like that, sure.

563
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,840
I'm definitely sympathetic to causes like that.

564
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah.

565
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
That's my opinion.

566
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,840
I didn't think this would go on for this long, but anyway, hope Bernie wins on Super Tuesday,

567
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
guys.

568
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Well, everyone will know what's happened by the time they're listening to this.

569
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Yeah.

570
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
I'll be curious to see what people think.

571
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
No, this is going to be great.

572
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,840
This is going to be great because this episode is going to go up on next Friday, right?

573
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
So that's like when Radcon starts.

574
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,840
So we can go directly into Ben either celebrating or raging about this very topic mere hours

575
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
after this airs.

576
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Yeah.

577
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Let's address that.

578
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
By the time, when you're here in this, we're half an hour in, give or take.

579
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Like two hours after this goes live, we check in at 4 p.m. into the Radcon for Paradise House

580
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,840
and we'll be kicking off the festivities, probably with a live stream as fast as possible on that

581
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
day.

582
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,840
That's the plan for me anyway.

583
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
We'll see.

584
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
We'll see what's going on there.

585
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,840
So, hey, Tom, our flight is on Friday morning.

586
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
I believe so.

587
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,340
I think you told me, Ben, that you were getting in around the same time as me, which I thought

588
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,840
was around noon, but correct me if I'm wrong.

589
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
On Friday, though, right?

590
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
On Friday, yeah, yeah.

591
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Okay.

592
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
On the sixth.

593
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I gotta get, I'm nervous.

594
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
You gotta get your shit together is what you gotta do, Ben.

595
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
I do have to get my shit together.

596
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
All right, Ben, poster update, status.

597
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
What's the deal?

598
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
How are we doing?

599
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,340
Wasn't yesterday the deadline for people to get their pictures in?

600
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Okay.

601
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
That's true, Ben.

602
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,600
But as you and I discussed, there's tons you could have done before having every single

603
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
person in.

604
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,220
And by the way, there are three outliers.

605
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,180
It's literally too late if you're hearing this and you didn't already respond, but I

606
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,180
tried so many ways to reach those last few people.

607
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,060
I'm sorry, but fuck you if you just didn't.

608
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
What else can I say?

609
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Yeah.

610
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
We'll do our best.

611
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,060
We'll put like a blank, empty thing with like your initials or something on there.

612
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
I don't know.

613
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,740
You'll get your fucking credit.

614
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Fuck you.

615
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm surprised there's only three.

616
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,060
I figured there would be more.

617
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
They trickled in.

618
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
Oh, and you know what?

619
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Good news.

620
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,540
One of the three is Riddle My Ass Batman.

621
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,220
So let's just slap Batman in there with a confused look on his face.

622
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
Yeah.

623
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
Okay.

624
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
That one's covered.

625
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
But the other two.

626
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
Wait, he'd be the Riddler, right?

627
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Yes.

628
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,220
Well, he is in fact Batman.

629
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Wait.

630
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
No, he's Riddle My Ass Batman.

631
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
No, he's Riddle My Ass Batman is the Riddler.

632
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
No, Batman is one of his characters.

633
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
He's one of his characters.

634
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Yeah, he talks to Batman.

635
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,220
He's kind of a fusion.

636
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
He's both Batman and the Riddler.

637
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
No, no, no.

638
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,900
He's the Riddler and he says Riddle My Ass Batman.

639
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
He is the Riddler.

640
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
You're right.

641
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
But he also speaks as Batman.

642
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Well, he's not the same guy when he does that.

643
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
Yeah, but he's just playing a character.

644
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
He's two characters.

645
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,900
He's two characters.

646
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
That's true.

647
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,060
I think the true core of Riddle My Ass Batman is the ass, I think.

648
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,220
I'll just draw him as a weird composite of the two.

649
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
It's fine.

650
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
Sounds good.

651
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,780
And the other two, I mean, I'll reach out to him one last time, but they're fucked.

652
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,620
But you, Ben, here's Inside Baseball.

653
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
We did the math.

654
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,380
You have until the end of March 4th to get that done.

655
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,060
That's when Munchie needs it to print it.

656
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,940
If not, we will lose several hundred dollars in printing costs, which we'd like to avoid

657
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
if possible.

658
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
Yes.

659
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
I know about that.

660
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
I know that.

661
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm actually going to start it today after this very recording.

662
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Sounds good.

663
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Sounds good.

664
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
I'm very excited.

665
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,580
Oh, and you know what I discovered?

666
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,740
I've long regretted.

667
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,580
I was looking at the Shovel Knight Kickstarter, for example, and I was like, oh, they've got

668
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,780
like a cool banner behind their thing at the top.

669
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
How do we do that?

670
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,980
Because I didn't think it was possible.

671
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,100
Turns out, once you have a successful Kickstarter, you can go in and edit like the image behind

672
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,660
the top of your Kickstarter page.

673
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:29,140
I never did it for Radcon 3, but for Radcon 4, I want to put that poster art once it's

674
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,740
there behind it in big, glorious, you know, artistry, so everybody can see.

675
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,380
So there's further motivation to not fuck it up.

676
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,740
I didn't realize our Kickstarter became an art piece once it was successful.

677
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,580
Only after it succeeds, but yeah, I guess so.

678
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,060
That's pretty silly.

679
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I got to tell you.

680
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:52,900
This very day, I finally sat down and I have been building an outline of my Nate's Mysterious

681
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,820
Unnamed Lecture that I'll be doing, but I have a basic framework for it.

682
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,300
I've been going over the details.

683
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,780
I think it's going to be meaty.

684
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,180
I think it's going to be juicy.

685
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,100
I can see where meme potential lies, and a lot of those things just emerge as they come

686
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,300
up naturally, so I can't predict everything, but a lot of epic memory and I can't wait

687
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,380
to point out all the little minutiae that I care about that nobody else does about this

688
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
particular thing.

689
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
Oh, it's going to be good.

690
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,700
It's going to be like a live, you know what?

691
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,300
I was going to say some of this spoily, but I just won't say it after all.

692
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
It's going to be good.

693
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,700
It's going to be fun, and I can't wait.

694
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
Yes.

695
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,980
God, Radcon 4 is so close.

696
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,380
It's so nerve-wracking.

697
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,580
I always get that sort of, that anxiety about that.

698
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,380
I get those coronavirus shakes.

699
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
It's weird whenever I fly, you know what I'm saying?

700
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,660
Ben, I'm going to bring masks for us when we have to go to Logan, so we don't die.

701
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Not a bad idea.

702
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,700
It has been a case of coronavirus in Boston.

703
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,660
I saw that article a month ago, and I was like, Ben, what did you do?

704
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,540
The odds were extremely likely it came through Logan Airport, wouldn't you say?

705
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,060
Oh, I mean, it's almost probably, like 100%, absolutely.

706
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,660
So the whole place is infected?

707
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,660
Yeah.

708
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Maybe.

709
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Could be around there.

710
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,860
I can't wait for Radcon 5 coronavirus as we infect all of you.

711
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,460
Yeah, that'll be fun.

712
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,960
Radcon 5.

713
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
It'll be like the eclipse.

714
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,560
There'll be no Radcon 5.

715
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,760
We'll all be dead.

716
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,400
Maybe one of us will die in the eclipse or not.

717
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,860
I'm already thinking of Radcon 5, and like the artistry we use for it, we call it Radcon

718
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,440
5 the eclipse.

719
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,360
And it's five of us have been infected with the coronavirus, like the five godhand from

720
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,920
Berserk and one of us guts, me, I'll say, is still alive, while the five of you attempt

721
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,000
to murder me with your deadly disease.

722
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Excellent theming, Nate.

723
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Well done.

724
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm jotting this down.

725
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
All right, I'm ready.

726
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,160
A famous rape that goes down in the annals of history.

727
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
The annals of history.

728
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
The annals of history, yeah, yeah.

729
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Excellent.

730
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
On brand.

731
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
On brand.

732
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
It's perfect.

733
00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:00,200
Oh, that'll be the OVA, the rape scene that will go on Pornhub for that one.

734
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,760
I was just thinking earlier today, I was musing to myself and put it in the chat, that I was

735
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,480
just looking at the numbers, and obviously we couldn't have really predicted things 100%

736
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
the way they came out.

737
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,480
But now that we know how much interest that there is in a radcon, I was just thinking

738
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
of old plans.

739
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,280
I was thinking of a radcon five.

740
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,920
With 20,000 to 30,000 dollars, that's got to be in the realm of actually being able

741
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,960
to make an actual rad convention possible, as in renting out a location.

742
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,240
With 30,000 dollars, that has to be enough to rent a place for a few days, maybe two

743
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
maybe three years.

744
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,960
30,000 dollars, that's almost enough to pay off my student loans.

745
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,960
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice.

746
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
We just got to do a couple more dates.

747
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Oh, the pain.

748
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,480
The 30,000 is going somewhat to plane tickets and accommodation for us as well.

749
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Well, that's definitely true.

750
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,640
We wouldn't have an entire 30, I mean I don't expect, well maybe actually, I guess if there

751
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,600
was like radcon ticket, like you buy a ticket and then you can come to the thing, what the

752
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
hell would we do?

753
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
I have no idea.

754
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,960
I mean just stand there on the flip side.

755
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
Well, I mean obviously lots of plans would be there.

756
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,680
The number one thing would be live lectures.

757
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,240
I mean I feel like the lectures could just be at least experimented upon.

758
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,560
Live lectures in front of a crowd.

759
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
In front of an actual crowd.

760
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,040
We could do, I mean we could do people like the Game Grumps or like Chappo Trapp House

761
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
or whatever.

762
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,280
They do like a, or I think the Dick Show does this or whatever, they do live episodes, right?

763
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,480
Remember when we did the horse cast live at BronyCon and stuff?

764
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
It was good.

765
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,680
It's basically like a PCP live.

766
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
It'd be the same.

767
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,280
It's exactly, and it's just we just fucking chat on stage in front of a crowd.

768
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,520
See I think like with that stuff, some lectures, like I don't know, we could do, we've all

769
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
got shows.

770
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,040
Like we could do a fucking can tent episode live, a pod D cast live.

771
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,800
Like there's definitely stuff we could fill the roster out with.

772
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Absolutely.

773
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,320
So I mean, I think it's totally doable.

774
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,840
It's just a matter of organization, a little bit of funding.

775
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,920
We have the, I mean we have the, how much would renting like a theater cost?

776
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,000
It depends on the venue, right?

777
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,160
Maybe a couple thousand.

778
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,120
I bet we could get a decent place with an audience for like a couple thousand, or even

779
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,400
we could rent like the stage at like a bar or something and just like fill up the bar

780
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
with people.

781
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
That's true.

782
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I mean, I think realistically, based on our Radcon 3 or Radcon 4 earnings, like if we

783
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,400
just got a humble $20,000, I think that would be more than enough to cover like all of our

784
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,440
flights out and like renting a reasonably small space for like a day or two to do stuff

785
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
within.

786
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
That's my initial guess.

787
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
That seems fair.

788
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Yeah.

789
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Yeah.

790
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
The problem is...

791
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,160
And we could sell tickets, Ben.

792
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Think of the profits.

793
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Think of the profits.

794
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,400
Well, I mean, the only problem is I think our audience is small enough, but I don't know

795
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
if we have...

796
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,080
Like they fund it, but there wouldn't be tons of outside people maybe would buy tickets

797
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
after or something.

798
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah, like our audience is dispersed enough that I don't think we could go to like New

799
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,240
York and there's like a, there's like a sizable contingent of PCP fans specifically in New

800
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,800
York, for example, who would...

801
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,920
Well, the solution to that problem is we all need to blow up and then act like I don't

802
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,880
know nobody, but we don't do that.

803
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,120
We actually do act like we know each other, so we all get more famous and then we sell

804
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,520
this thing and we get everybody who even likes us a little bit to come to our rare public

805
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
appearances.

806
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I mean...

807
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
This is my thought.

808
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Yeah.

809
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Sounds pretty cool.

810
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
It's just...

811
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Yeah.

812
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Let me just go do that.

813
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
Let me just go do...

814
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Be famous.

815
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,400
Selling tickets in a specific area seems like it would be tough.

816
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
I mean, certainly possible.

817
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Let's go to the moon.

818
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,920
Let's go to the moon for Radcon 5.

819
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
I mean, we know.

820
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
I mean, one of the things...

821
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
How much is a fucking rocket?

822
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,960
Let me just pay one of the sets to stand out on the street and be and give out flyers like,

823
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,440
hey, you guys want to see a comedy show later tonight?

824
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,960
It's gonna be really funny.

825
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,800
I mean, I think there's tons of stuff we could do with it, but one of the things that got

826
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,840
me thinking was just, excuse me, the reality that like, whether we intended it or not,

827
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,200
many people or at least several people are straight up flying out to come just to hang

828
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,760
out at the one appearance that we're doing at fucking Radcon.

829
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Do we have an idea?

830
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,520
Oh, and by the way, we decided on a location to meet up.

831
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,600
If you haven't seen any updates, we're gonna meet at the Poseidon statue in Virginia Beach.

832
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,520
So if you're hearing this on the 14th, that's where it will be.

833
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,240
There will be updates out there, but in the link in the show notes, we'll put like the

834
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,280
actual Google coordinates so you know exactly how to get there.

835
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
So there you go.

836
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Update.

837
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,240
I would suggest if you are maybe not in the, if you're coming out to the meetup, but you're

838
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:43,280
not like a big backer in the, you know, the PTA server, I would say maybe just join the

839
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,800
regular PCP server, we'll probably be updating people there like where the meetup is and

840
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
what's going on.

841
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Right.

842
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
For sure.

843
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
For sure.

844
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,360
If you want to like follow along, like make sure you're abreast of like where we're moving

845
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
to.

846
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,480
Oh, and just for the times and whatnot, right.

847
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,600
So Poseidon statue link below to exactly where it is.

848
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
It's well known.

849
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
It's famous in Virginia Beach.

850
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
That's on.

851
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,640
And it's at 2pm on March 14th.

852
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,680
That's where we will be on that day.

853
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Poseidon.

854
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Okay.

855
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Sick.

856
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
Mm-hmm.

857
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
That's the real shit.

858
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,800
I don't know what we'll do, but it's on the beach, we're gonna go hang out and we'll

859
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
figure something out.

860
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,480
We'll probably stalk around on the beach, maybe go get food, maybe move to a bar or something.

861
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Yep.

862
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
I don't know.

863
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,000
Just hanging out with the, with my boys.

864
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,400
Just fucking around.

865
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Just fucking.

866
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
We're just gonna be.

867
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Straight fuck on the beach.

868
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Yeah.

869
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,560
Let's all bring our, our signs and say hashtag just fucking.

870
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Just fucking.

871
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Just fucking.

872
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Just fucking.

873
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
That's a new T-shirt.

874
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
I'm just fucking.

875
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm just fucking.

876
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Not bad.

877
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Okay.

878
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Not bad.

879
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
This could be good.

880
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
This could be good.

881
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Sick.

882
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Buy a PCP T-shirt and.

883
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Please, God.

884
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
And so we know who you are when you get there.

885
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
And so we know who you are when you get there.

886
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Oh, that, that would be true.

887
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Where your, where your market distinction.

888
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I saw some of our backers wearing like I am game.

889
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
I saw some of our backers wearing like I am game.

890
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I saw some of our backers wearing like I am game.

891
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Distinction.

892
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,600
I saw some of our backers wearing like I am games T-shirts.

893
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,920
I don't know if you got fucking the famous Gibbs shirts.

894
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
The, the BROP.

895
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
No.

896
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I don't know.

897
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Some BGE shirts.

898
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
I'm just being cool.

899
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Wear a Ben Saint shirt.

900
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Wear a Ben Saint heart shirt.

901
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Wear a, wear a Yang shirt.

902
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,280
Wear one of my Yang shirts or my Lisa 2020 shirts or my Feel the Burn shirts.

903
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,720
I've got to put out a call to anybody who's there.

904
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Any of the Nate heads.

905
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,080
We have to band together and defeat the Ben's once and for all.

906
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Ben heads?

907
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
I guess they're Ben heads.

908
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Uh, yeah.

909
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
Saint heads.

910
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
God heads.

911
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
We'll go over cop killer stuff.

912
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,160
If you choose to be a Ben head as well, that's fine, but we need to do glorious battle and

913
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,280
settle this once and for all.

914
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,320
I will kill all my supporters.

915
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Will Ben's cowardly tactics defeat the god like Adonises that are the Nate heads?

916
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,280
There's only one way to find out.

917
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
We'll settle it.

918
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
We're on the beach.

919
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,920
We'll, we'll settle it and smash.

920
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
That sounds good.

921
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,080
So any of you guys been doing any, I mean, I was saying before, oh, I don't think I finished

922
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
my point.

923
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
Oh no.

924
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm excited I am specifically for my lecture because I've been going over the details and

925
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
getting it all ready.

926
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm nervous.

927
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
I'm nervous.

928
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I'm a little nervous.

929
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm a little nervous.

930
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,320
I need to, um, not only do I need to finish my, um, the art work, I need to, I need to

931
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,840
reread all of, um, the JDRs comics.

932
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,560
I need to make notes.

933
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,360
I need to, um, I'm kind of fucked up about that.

934
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,040
I can't, like I can't bring my computer, like I can't bring my tablet or anything.

935
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,120
So I'm going to be, I guess I just have to save a bunch of like important info to my

936
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,360
phone and bring that with me or put it in a Google drive account or something.

937
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm going to be really limited in this stuff I can do at Radcon.

938
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,960
Like I'll barely be able to draw.

939
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,800
Maybe we should, I mean, about some of these things.

940
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,840
I mean, like I was thinking that like it'd be cool to have, I mean, not like a PowerPoint

941
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,640
thing, but I was thinking if I could have like visual aids with me, that might be cool.

942
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,200
So like, should I like maybe print things out ahead of time?

943
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,200
I don't know.

944
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,000
But maybe, maybe some discussion could be had about like, is there any kind of projector

945
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,320
technology we could use or I don't want to over complicate things.

946
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, I mean, you've done lectures before.

947
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,520
I'm nervous because I haven't, and I have no idea how it would come together.

948
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,800
But like, surely all you need is notes and maybe to have thought about how you would

949
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,040
structure it before you start speaking.

950
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,280
You know, when I, like my final fantasy one, I was a little scared for because I hadn't

951
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,640
been prepared as much for that.

952
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,520
Like the Kingdom Hearts one, I literally did no prep work and it was not an issue at all.

953
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,280
I just knew everything and it was great and that's probably why it was good.

954
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,920
But like for the one I'm doing now, I also know very well.

955
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,240
But like I was nervous this morning, but then I sat down for like half an hour and busted

956
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
out an outline.

957
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
And now that I just have that much, I feel way more confident.

958
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,360
And I'm like, okay, now I know what I'm doing.

959
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,720
That's all it took, just a few minutes.

960
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,360
I think, I think that'll be like, I should remember that like, it's actually really helpful

961
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,760
having you guys there, having the little crowd there to like ask questions and stuff.

962
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,480
It helps it all flow smoothly, helps you not forget anything, helps you like go off on

963
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,560
funny tangents and stuff makes it entertaining.

964
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,960
So it's probably, if I had to go up there and just kind of give and just give it like

965
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,000
off the cuff, it would probably come out like, okay, decent.

966
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,160
I do, I do want, no, I want like a set of notes in front of me that I can flip through

967
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
and be like, oh yes.

968
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,680
The underrated aspect of the lectures is how much the audience, us specifically, who know

969
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,280
each other so well and are pretty funny, contribute to it and enhance the experience.

970
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,920
We also generally know these things.

971
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
It's true.

972
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,840
So that's why you're Tom, Dick and Harry, pretender.

973
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,520
I know you people trying to do your lectures.

974
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,760
The problem is that your audience is full of shitters.

975
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,240
You got to get some red-pilled migtails in that audience, you know, some real elites

976
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,520
to bring the real shit.

977
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,800
When is the fucking RFCK lecture going to come out?

978
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
I don't know.

979
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Like a month and a half ago.

980
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,160
That was supposed to be out before the goddamn radcon starts.

981
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,520
You've got four fucking days or five days.

982
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
I hoped it would.

983
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
I didn't know.

984
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,520
I guess Ethan was working on the stealing your dads and I don't know if he's started

985
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,800
working on the RFCK lecture yet.

986
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,640
I want it so bad.

987
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
Don't even bother with over-editing it.

988
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,960
The whole point of a lecture is it's just, it's just simple and the commentary kind of

989
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
stuff.

990
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
You know what I'm going to do?

991
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Visual aids.

992
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Visual aids.

993
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,520
Like in the Tales of Guts 12 lecture, I threw up images of like the characters I was talking

994
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,520
about.

995
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
And I do think that is helpful.

996
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Yeah.

997
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
I mean, I just regretted not doing that.

998
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
But like, that's all in post.

999
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
That's all in post.

1000
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,400
I wish in Sanichu lecture if I had, like when I talk about the chaotic combo, like I showed

1001
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,080
like what they look like on the screen.

1002
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It would make it funnier.

1003
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,280
A little goes a long way and I regret not doing that for mine.

1004
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,520
And actually, some people like, especially for the Kingdom Hearts one, one dude like

1005
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,160
remade and re-edited it with visual aids to help.

1006
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,040
And we and I talked about like how I felt about him uploading it.

1007
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,540
We came to an agreement.

1008
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,980
Like this, for the next one I do, I will be adding visual aids, 100%.

1009
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
No doubt about it.

1010
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
It's going to make it better.

1011
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,180
Always got to add those visual aids.

1012
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,060
I'm glad, I'm glad somebody made, I'm glad somebody made for you a Kingdom Hearts lecture

1013
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
1.5.

1014
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,060
That's pretty great.

1015
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Indeed.

1016
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,060
That's true.

1017
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,940
Other thing, I was thinking I've got to do my lecture, you know, writing.

1018
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,780
But instead today, I did some of my lyrics for the diss track.

1019
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Right.

1020
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
That's what I made.

1021
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,620
Oh, God, I have to do those, you know.

1022
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,500
That is unironically the thing I'm most afraid of.

1023
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,900
Once some people start busting out their lyrics, I was thinking of mine a little bit today

1024
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,900
as well.

1025
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,260
Like, there's not too much any of us individually has to do to get that ready.

1026
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,940
But so I think it would be like less of each.

1027
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,620
Really the thing I was figuring out is like, how does this fit into bars?

1028
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,220
I don't have like a natural wrapping understanding.

1029
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,300
So I was like tapping my foot or like slapping my knee and be like, okay, so this is the

1030
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,540
first beat.

1031
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,620
And then I say like this.

1032
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,100
And then it's like, that's how many beats, how many bars is that?

1033
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,580
Oh, God, it's three.

1034
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
It's not enough.

1035
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,020
I need to add another line.

1036
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,660
So I was like figuring that out in the Google Doc by like having a line of lyrics and then

1037
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,620
a line underneath like one, two, three, four to find out where the beat lands on like what

1038
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:13,500
syllable and that helps me realize like, because like I've had problems before when

1039
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,340
I've tried to rap for anything.

1040
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:22,100
It's like I write lyrics and I don't know how many syllables in a lyric and goes into

1041
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
one bar or like four beats.

1042
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:30,060
It was like, yo, it's diamond tiara and she's here to say I love being rich if you're not

1043
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,100
you're gay or something like that.

1044
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,100
What a legendary line.

1045
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Yeah, I'm studying my career with that one.

1046
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,100
But yeah, the lyrics.

1047
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:49,100
Oh, remember how Ben drew the gangster give and take pony for that legendary moment?

1048
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Wait, did I do a rap?

1049
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Yeah, I bet you that.

1050
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
Remember drawing gangster give?

1051
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
What the fuck?

1052
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,340
Did I ever sing a rap at anyone?

1053
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
That's impossible.

1054
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
It can't be happened.

1055
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Once upon a time, I did draw gangster give and take.

1056
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
It's true.

1057
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
I think I still have that.

1058
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
He's a blast of history.

1059
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
God damn.

1060
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:17,340
Speaking of music briefly, did any of you see the track, the song I posted on Twitter

1061
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:22,340
that I was very embarrassed and scared about posting because I didn't feel like it was good enough

1062
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,340
and then people said it's fine?

1063
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,340
I have not seen it.

1064
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340
I'll get a link.

1065
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
It'll be in the show notes.

1066
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
How are we?

1067
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,340
How are you feeling about it?

1068
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I feel like it was pretty good.

1069
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I wanted to make music for years and years.

1070
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:45,340
I've made a few acoustic things before on a band camp and I've never been comfortable putting lyrics to them

1071
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,340
or thinking about song structure.

1072
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,340
All I know is guitar really well, so I just stick to that and I don't bother with anything else,

1073
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:00,340
which means that if I ever try to play with other instruments, it's like I can't record them.

1074
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:06,340
But now that I have an iPad and I've got garage band, it's a lot easier to just make a little beat that I can play along to.

1075
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,340
So I made a song and I was like, this is it.

1076
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,340
This is the time where I finally made an entire song that has more than just guitar in it.

1077
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:19,340
Now all I need to add is lyrics and I couldn't think of any, so I mumbled a bunch

1078
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,340
and I thought it was disgusting and disgraceful and the worst thing you could ever make

1079
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,340
and I was going to kill myself and so I posted it.

1080
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,340
You know what?

1081
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,340
I didn't even know this for the longest time.

1082
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,340
Apparently everybody knows this, but I'm a big fan of Elton John.

1083
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:40,340
I think he's fucking sick and I love all his shit, but I just found out when there was talk about his documentary,

1084
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:45,340
the movie based on it wasn't a real documentary, that he just doesn't write any of his own lyrics

1085
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,340
and he just has a guy he's worked with forever.

1086
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,340
I've always attributed everything good about Elton John's music, specifically to Elton John,

1087
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
even though that's incredibly naive.

1088
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,340
People work with tons of studio musicians and other collaborators, etc.

1089
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,340
But I was always like, oh, kooky, wacko lyrics for what the fuck is leave on even about.

1090
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,340
I don't know.

1091
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,340
But some dude just writes all the lyrics because Elton John just hates doing it

1092
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:18,340
and I'm just like, God, I need more people in my life who I can offload the things I don't specifically like doing to

1093
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,340
and everybody should.

1094
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
It's highly efficient.

1095
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,340
It's a very effective method to surround yourself by people who can do things.

1096
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,340
David Bowie was all about finding people who can do the things he can't

1097
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,340
and working with them to make so many great songs and albums,

1098
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,340
but it was always his thing because he was always organizing it.

1099
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,340
But how much of anything is like a David Bowie?

1100
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,340
It really just depends on who's doing the instrument part.

1101
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:55,340
It's not like to take away anything from what he's done because they wouldn't have done it if he didn't ask them to.

1102
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,340
By the way, that reminds me.

1103
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,340
Michelle was watching some of Jojo Part 2.

1104
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,340
He's the hussy for his own now.

1105
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,340
He's the executive producer.

1106
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,340
He's got the creative control.

1107
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340
He's the one making the final calls.

1108
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,340
In a word, producer is the right word, I suppose.

1109
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
But that reminds me.

1110
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,340
Michelle was watching Jojo Part 2 and it reminded me that one of the plot points of Jojo Part 2

1111
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,340
is there's the redstone of Aja, or Asia is it sometimes translated wrongly.

1112
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,340
Everything in Jojo is a musical reference.

1113
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,340
That one, the redstone of Aja, is a reference to the album Aja by Steely Dan.

1114
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,340
That got me listening to Steely Dan music or something.

1115
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:37,340
One of the YouTube recommended was just a documentary on the making of Aja featuring Steely Dan.

1116
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:43,340
Steely Dan is actually a weird band that emerged out of this weird New York bubble

1117
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,340
that these two guys, whose name I totally forget, merged into some other band.

1118
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
All these things start weirdly.

1119
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,340
They merged into this other band. They completely took it over from the inside.

1120
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,340
As they evolved as a band, they just dropped many of the original members

1121
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,340
and moved on to continually evolve the band.

1122
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,340
They stopped touring for 20 years or something because they hated it.

1123
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,340
They just wanted to make music.

1124
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:14,340
They got to this album, Aja, and it was entirely made with just these two guys who produced it.

1125
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,340
Every other person on the album was a set musician.

1126
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,340
Some of them were part of the old band or whatever, but just totally unrelated.

1127
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,340
It's just these two guys who just sat down.

1128
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,340
They were English majors from Bard University or something.

1129
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,340
They were big intellectual boys.

1130
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,340
They just banished many of their bandmates and just chose exactly the people they needed

1131
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:41,340
to get the exact bits and pieces of songs they wanted from these different musicians

1132
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,340
with different talents.

1133
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,340
On some of the albums, there's none of them even except the lead vocals

1134
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,340
from the one lead vocal guy or something.

1135
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,340
It was just fascinating and just such a radically different one.

1136
00:47:53,340 --> 00:48:01,340
When I make YouTube videos, I feel like such a weird urge to have everything be me.

1137
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:07,340
I need everything I upload to be 100% Nate or it feels wrong somehow.

1138
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,340
I'm currently getting over that working with an editor as I've done a couple of times in the past.

1139
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,340
It's always felt weird, but I'm improving on it.

1140
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:20,340
That's just obviously the right way to expand yourself and grow outward as an edit boy

1141
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,340
or a fucking creator of any kind.

1142
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:28,340
It was a very interesting watch and I'm learning a lot from these professional people out there.

1143
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:33,340
Also, it was fascinating just to see how an album is made in the fucking back room or whatever.

1144
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,340
So, a shout out to you, Davoo. Steely Dan. Pretty cool. Pretty cool band.

1145
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:50,340
Last night, I recorded my end of the month Patreon Q&A podcast thing.

1146
00:48:50,340 --> 00:49:00,340
I had to go on a long tangent because Bevan asked about Slime and Punishment

1147
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:07,340
and about what Christine Weston Chandler, creator of Sonichu,

1148
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,340
the electric hedgehog Pokemon, had said.

1149
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:15,340
So, I read out all of the things she had messaged me about like,

1150
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:20,340
hey, this is what happens in your story and it was exhausting.

1151
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:28,340
It was exhausting and frustrating and I got kind of fed up reading it.

1152
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:35,340
It's all secrets, but I talked about it there.

1153
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:43,340
Ben's hiding canon true Sonichu lore behind his paywall for people to go and discover.

1154
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,340
How calculating.

1155
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:53,340
I bring up Slime and Punishment because I've got a couple of people who are contributing to the finale.

1156
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,340
Sixthin's going to make some music, I think.

1157
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:02,340
Smyrg is going to make some cool visual things.

1158
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:07,340
Shaddock, you know Shaddock? I don't know if he's a guy.

1159
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,340
Names familiar.

1160
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,340
Homestuck. He did some Homestuck animation.

1161
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,340
He did arm retrieval animated way back.

1162
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,340
Yeah, that's right.

1163
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,340
Way back, I'd say, reminiscing on the good old days.

1164
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,340
Wait, did he actually contribute to real Homestuck as well?

1165
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,340
No, he does a lot of Homestuck fan stuff.

1166
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,340
But he's really good, as I recall.

1167
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,340
Yes.

1168
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,340
Also contributing some things.

1169
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,340
And now he's a big endless warhead.

1170
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,340
Yeah, nice.

1171
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:38,340
I'm going to be, I don't know, hopefully after Radcon, I'll be able to, I'll have all that and I'll be able to put it together.

1172
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:44,340
I've been putting together shots, I've been compositing shots, I've been making some nice, some really nice little images.

1173
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:49,340
Just putting it in Vegas and making things move around.

1174
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,340
How does this look? How does that look?

1175
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:57,340
Very, very excited to be working on that.

1176
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:04,340
Kind of mad, kind of frustrated that Radcon has to be now when I would like to be finishing Slime and Punishment.

1177
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,340
But it's okay.

1178
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
Fair, fair.

1179
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,340
It's fine, it's fine.

1180
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,340
I'll do it.

1181
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,340
I feel a little bit the same about the Lord of Ghost comic, because the day is leading up to it.

1182
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:19,340
I'm like, I've got things I need to figure out and sort out and make and it's anxious, anxiousifying.

1183
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:27,340
I can't really spend so many hours drawing, so I've just sort of stopped production on chapter four and I'll pick it up later.

1184
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:36,340
Yep, I feel, yeah, I've got it, right now I've got to drop everything and make notes for my lectures and I guess write this fucking rap verse.

1185
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,340
And I have to pack?

1186
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,340
Hey, should I bring the Oculus Rift?

1187
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
Oh God, I want to use it, but can we?

1188
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,340
Will we have the opportunity or like the equipment necessary?

1189
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,340
I mean, it needs to plug into a computer, right?

1190
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Yes.

1191
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,340
I don't think any, maybe Digi will have a computer.

1192
00:51:53,340 --> 00:52:00,340
Did you guys see my legendary fucking absolutely slaying at, like whatever it is, like Beat Saber that I posted on Twitter?

1193
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
I saw, yeah, no.

1194
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:07,340
That fucking crab song, I want to, like that was on easy mode, I want to do it on fucking extreme and kick the shit out of that song.

1195
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,340
I was fucking sick.

1196
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,340
I haven't used the Oculus in a pretty long time.

1197
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,340
I kind of, Econ was telling me I should get Beat Saber.

1198
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
It does look like maybe it's fun.

1199
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,340
Yes, it's fucking, I mean, I had a great time.

1200
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,340
If you play songs you actually like, then it's fine.

1201
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:28,340
Setting up, setting up, especially because my room is small, like setting up to use the Oculus is like an involved process every single time.

1202
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,340
For Radcon, I'm willing to commit to it, like if we have the ability.

1203
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,340
Oh no, I'm talking about just that in my house.

1204
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
Oh, okay, okay.

1205
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Oh, I mean, if anyone thinks we can use the Oculus, I'll bring it.

1206
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,340
Okay, let's just go for it.

1207
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,340
I don't know if we can, like I'm bringing my laptop, but that's that kind of problem with Oculus.

1208
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:51,340
If Digi is planning on bringing his like actual PC, then probably we could use it and I would bring it.

1209
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,340
I mean, his PC will be like an hour away.

1210
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,340
So even if he doesn't initially.

1211
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,340
But I mean, he's gonna be driving his car.

1212
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,340
It's like 20 minutes away, basically.

1213
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Yeah, I'm just saying like if he doesn't initially, we can say like, hey, we're gonna do a thing, bring your computer and he'll be like, okay.

1214
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
I would love to.

1215
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,340
I would love to stream some of that shit.

1216
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,340
That would be fantastic.

1217
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,340
And we could probably set up a green screen and I don't know, do all kinds of crazy stuff.

1218
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,340
Digi's got at least his little green screen we could use, I'm sure.

1219
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,340
Potential, good potential there.

1220
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,340
Would love to do it.

1221
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,340
Heck, heck yeah.

1222
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:23,340
You'll find out in an hour and change probably when our live stream starts if we actually follow through with any of these plans at all.

1223
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,340
We're gonna have 100% green screen us out of Radcon completely.

1224
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,340
That's right.

1225
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,340
When you're hearing this, we will be at, we will be in Virginia for Radcon.

1226
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,340
Not me.

1227
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,340
Oh my God, we've been recording roughly two hours.

1228
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,340
So like, yeah, oh no, wait, we've been recording one hour.

1229
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:43,340
So in one hour, give or take, if you started this the moment it released, that's when we'll be there.

1230
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,340
I'm just, I'm keeping an eye on the clock.

1231
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,340
This is amusing for me.

1232
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:53,340
I'll be like, in the middle of the Pacific Atlantic ocean.

1233
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:06,340
And I'll be, you know, I was thinking, if I can't think of anything, I have like, for the lecture, I have like 14 hours or whatever in the air that I could type away.

1234
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,340
So I got time to make stuff.

1235
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
That's true.

1236
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,340
It'll, it'll be possible for me.

1237
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:18,340
I wouldn't have, I wouldn't be able to like, look at anything on the internet because fucking airplanes suck.

1238
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,340
The Wi-Fi sucks.

1239
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,340
It does.

1240
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,340
Even when they have Wi-Fi, even when it's free, it sucks.

1241
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,340
And you guys know me, I've been very concerned about managing our time to make sure we get everything done.

1242
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,340
I'm pretty happy with like, how much stuff is set up for each day.

1243
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,340
It's given us plenty of room.

1244
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:42,340
And like, let's not forget that like, the raw creative energy when you're at Radcon is really, is really kicked up a serious fun memory.

1245
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,340
So good ideas may just fall out of the sky.

1246
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,340
When I think now about like, what am I even going to do at Radcon?

1247
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,340
It's like, I didn't have a plan last time.

1248
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:56,340
We just get there and we figure it out and we're all having a good time and it just, it takes care of itself.

1249
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,340
I mean, I was like hype for Radcon, but then I started watching some Radcon 3 content.

1250
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:10,340
Some of like the behind the scenes stuff because I never really looked through all that until it was linked in the Radcon 4 discord a few days ago.

1251
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,340
And I was like, oh, I'll take a gander at this.

1252
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,340
And I got super fucking hype.

1253
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,340
It all came rushing back and my dick was rock hard and I was ready.

1254
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,340
I was like, fucking, I gotta go.

1255
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,340
I gotta go right now.

1256
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,340
Right now.

1257
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,340
Here's a little, I mean, I don't know if people heard about this, but here's one of the things that you missed out.

1258
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:30,340
Although you can still technically buy it on Gumroad if you want to play $11.11.

1259
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,340
There's a link somewhere, I think, to the behind the scenes footage.

1260
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:37,340
There's like one of the videos, someone just posted as like, this was fucking hype.

1261
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:42,340
Like in the PJ thing was when Ben and I just busted out like the Judas song from Jesus Christ Superstar.

1262
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:48,340
And then like the camera pans up and Digi from the window up above starts singing out as well.

1263
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,340
And we all just fucking joined in.

1264
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,340
That was, I mean, that was just a little thing, not planned, but I mean, great backer footage for just backer people.

1265
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:02,340
That was right when we picked up Ben and we had to record the episode in like five minutes.

1266
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:08,340
And so you guys spent 10 minutes singing Jesus Christ Superstar and we were late.

1267
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,340
But it didn't matter because the internet was dead.

1268
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,340
So we had to be like hours late anyway.

1269
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,340
It took us like hours to get it working anyway, right?

1270
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,340
I relived the whole week in these playlists and it was glorious.

1271
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,340
Oh, that's a good shit.

1272
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,340
I can't wait for the internet to fuck up again.

1273
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
It's gonna be a good time.

1274
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,340
I'm gonna bring my shitty camcorder because it's just easy to open and record.

1275
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,340
Yeah, someone needs to.

1276
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:35,340
So we can have more Dansoft toilet seat as a misadventures about that.

1277
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,340
I gotta find my fucking GoPro.

1278
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:43,340
Just imagine the horror if we get to this place and there's all soft toilet seats again.

1279
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,340
Oh, no, it can't be.

1280
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,340
We didn't ask the question.

1281
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,340
That would have been a deal breaker.

1282
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,340
Red soft garlic seats.

1283
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,340
Oh, God, they'll team up.

1284
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,340
They'll do a DBZ fusion.

1285
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:01,340
It reminds me, I'm wondering, because I don't remember I checked this, how many bathrooms there are at this place.

1286
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,340
Because it's not like a huge house like last time.

1287
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,340
I hope there's at least three, but I guess we'll find out.

1288
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,340
There's always the ocean if you need to go pissed.

1289
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,340
So that's always there.

1290
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,340
Group piss round two in the ocean, what?

1291
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,340
Unironically, I mean, people suggested that and I think it's a fantastic idea.

1292
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,340
What if we do it during sunset?

1293
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,340
Oh, I was wondering, okay, with the group piss in the snow.

1294
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,340
Why not?

1295
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,340
Don't be a square?

1296
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,340
Yeah.

1297
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,340
Are you some sort of bitch?

1298
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,340
What the fuck?

1299
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,340
Because I wasn't getting piss coming from everyone else coalescing around us.

1300
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,340
That's gross.

1301
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,340
Oh, you're standing far enough apart.

1302
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,340
It's fine.

1303
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,340
Oh, my God.

1304
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,340
We're literally going to be coming off the Radcon for gang bang.

1305
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,340
So if you're going to get fucking uptight about this, I mean rethink your priorities, buddy.

1306
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Delicious.

1307
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,340
No, no, I mean, some people suggested that.

1308
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,340
I mean, I think there's, imagine it's sunset.

1309
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:56,340
We're all glowing, the six of us, the gods of the beach.

1310
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:04,340
I bought a little elastic, like black lace sort of like a mini skirt, like Tutu, I think.

1311
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,340
Oh, gross.

1312
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:09,340
To wear over whatever bathing suit I ended up getting.

1313
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:15,340
Me and Munchie and some people, after the Bernie rally yesterday, we went to the garment

1314
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,340
district to buy bathing suits.

1315
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,340
And it turns out they don't carry them this time of year.

1316
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,340
So I still have to find one.

1317
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,340
Makes sense.

1318
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,340
Makes sense.

1319
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
I'm going on Amazon.

1320
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,340
Yeah, I ordered mine last night.

1321
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,340
I'm really terrified.

1322
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,340
Are you ordering it like to go to your house or are you ordering it to go to the Radcon?

1323
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,340
I have Amazon Prime, so it'll get here like tomorrow.

1324
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,340
Shit.

1325
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,340
I ordered mine weeks ago.

1326
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,340
It was wise.

1327
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,340
That was wise.

1328
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,340
I'm not worried.

1329
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,340
I'll have plenty of stuff.

1330
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,340
If I need to, I'll just go out in the town and find something.

1331
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,340
If it does have some things in mind.

1332
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:51,340
I'll just get a different size and I'll ship it to Digi's house instead and it'll be there

1333
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,340
ready for my shame.

1334
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,340
See, that's the thing.

1335
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:03,340
I'm okay looking and completely terribly embarrassing, but I don't like having pee from other men

1336
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,340
around me.

1337
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,340
I don't like other men's pee, you know what I'm saying?

1338
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,340
You ever get that feeling when you don't like other men's pee?

1339
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,340
I can't relate, frankly.

1340
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,340
I cannot relate to that.

1341
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,340
I guess I'm in the minority here.

1342
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,340
That's fine.

1343
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,340
Indeed.

1344
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:23,340
You know that image of the small white lady with all the black guys behind her in the

1345
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,340
couch?

1346
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,340
It's Gib in front, but all of us are peeing.

1347
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,340
We are peeing facing the other direction.

1348
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,340
Yeah.

1349
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,340
There we go.

1350
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,340
Beautiful.

1351
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,340
That's the situation.

1352
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:39,340
One thing I can't wait to do is play video games all day.

1353
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,340
Yeah.

1354
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:46,340
Did I already mention this before that Jade Moreau and I think a bunch of other people

1355
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,340
were telling me that's...

1356
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:53,340
I think a lot of people's favorite PCP video ever is the monkey game?

1357
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,340
Ape Escape.

1358
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,340
Ape Escape.

1359
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
The Super Bowl.

1360
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,340
No, the five hour full let's play of Ape Escape.

1361
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,340
Right.

1362
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:05,340
What video game consoles are we going to have there?

1363
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
We know that.

1364
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,340
We were talking about that.

1365
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,340
We're obviously going to have a ton of switches.

1366
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,340
I'm going to bring my switch.

1367
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,340
I'm going to bring my switch.

1368
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,340
I mean, if somebody else is bringing theirs, that's fine, but we got to have Smash.

1369
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,340
You got to have Ultimate available.

1370
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,340
Oh, god.

1371
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,340
I don't...

1372
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,340
It's a fucking bad video game.

1373
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,340
I don't want to play them.

1374
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,340
You don't want to play 1v1 against Monty again?

1375
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,340
I'm going to have my PS3 with Scott Pilgrim versus The World The Game, the exclusive

1376
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,340
game that you can't buy anymore.

1377
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,340
That's so weird.

1378
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,340
Was that because of copyright shit?

1379
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,340
Yeah, because it was Universal or whatever.

1380
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,340
It was famous for ruining video games.

1381
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,340
They had their claws in Spyro and Crash.

1382
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:50,340
For the PlayStation 2, they said, uh, Naughty Dog, Insomniac, sorry, fuck you, we're going

1383
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,340
to get some real cheap pieces of shit to make the next bunch of games, which is why those

1384
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,340
franchises fell into disrepair.

1385
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,340
I had no idea.

1386
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,340
Fascinating.

1387
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:05,340
Universal Studios Productions, Crash Bandicoot 3, and then Crash Bandicoot 4 was okay.

1388
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:10,340
If those guys ever get into Smash, I will definitely work that piece of lore into the

1389
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,340
Crash-confirmed or Spyro-confirmed video.

1390
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:18,340
Yeah, Universal is Universal-e terrible.

1391
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,340
Universal bad.

1392
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,340
Right.

1393
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,340
Thanks for watching this Hippocrite review of Crash.

1394
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,340
That was my big comeback.

1395
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,340
Don and Don.

1396
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,340
I don't know whether I should bring Hippo himself.

1397
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,340
Do it.

1398
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,340
Of course you should bring Hippo.

1399
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,340
Of course you should bring him.

1400
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:40,340
I don't know because he's dealing with something in the old endless mud.

1401
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,340
Well, okay.

1402
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,340
I mean, if he's busy, fair enough.

1403
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,340
I certainly want to bring action to Giraffe.

1404
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,340
He's ready to travel.

1405
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,340
He's ready to go.

1406
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,340
Hippo could do like another animal cast together.

1407
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,340
Remember that?

1408
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,340
They should.

1409
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,340
Of course.

1410
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,340
Radcon 2 is such a long time ago.

1411
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,340
Radcon 1, I don't even remember.

1412
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,340
Radcon 2 three years ago, Radcon 1 about three and a half years ago.

1413
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,340
Three years ago and a few months.

1414
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,340
Yeah.

1415
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,340
Jesus Christ.

1416
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,340
We really cranked him out back then.

1417
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,340
We sure did.

1418
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:15,340
Wasn't Radcon 1 basically just like an accident?

1419
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,340
Like we didn't mean to do it.

1420
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,340
It just kind of turned out that way.

1421
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,340
No, no, no.

1422
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,340
We decided to meet up.

1423
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,340
Because we knew that we didn't want to go to Bronycon anymore.

1424
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,340
So we just decided to meet up.

1425
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,340
Like go to Digi's house.

1426
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:28,340
Was Radcon 1 like right when me and Davoo moved into Digi's house?

1427
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,340
I believe it was.

1428
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,340
That was like the impetus for it.

1429
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,340
Right.

1430
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,340
I wasn't at Radcon 1.

1431
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,340
You weren't?

1432
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,340
I was not at Radcon 1.

1433
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
What?

1434
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,340
God, I don't remember that at all.

1435
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,340
Okay.

1436
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,340
It was a long time ago.

1437
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,340
I know.

1438
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,340
It was not a full cast.

1439
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,340
Oh yeah, yeah.

1440
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,340
Radcon 2 introduced Tom, Jeff and Munchy.

1441
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,340
And Munchy.

1442
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,340
Munchy wasn't there.

1443
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,340
Yeah.

1444
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,340
And that was the second one was the year we did the lectures.

1445
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
So what even happened in the first one?

1446
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,340
Nothing.

1447
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,340
You weren't there either, Gid?

1448
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,340
I'm pretty sure.

1449
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,340
Yeah.

1450
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,340
Okay.

1451
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,340
You were there.

1452
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,340
Well, Ben's lecture was from Radcon 1.

1453
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,340
That's probably the biggest thing.

1454
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,340
Other than that, I don't remember anything.

1455
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:08,340
That was the only lecture at the time, right?

1456
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,340
Nobody else.

1457
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,340
Because like Digi had said like Ben, please do a lecture.

1458
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,340
And you were like, it will do.

1459
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,340
Yeah.

1460
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,340
Strange.

1461
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,340
Yeah.

1462
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,340
It was a good idea.

1463
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,340
It worked out.

1464
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,340
And then Radcon 2.

1465
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,340
What's the views that sit in that?

1466
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,340
Is it 1.1 million yet?

1467
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,340
1.2?

1468
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,340
How many views?

1469
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,340
Yeah.

1470
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,340
I'm just curious.

1471
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,340
It's just over a million.

1472
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,340
Okay.

1473
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,340
Okay.

1474
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:42,340
Well, hey, nonetheless, don't let your memes be dreams, kids.

1475
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,340
Definitely not.

1476
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,340
Bad views.

1477
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:50,340
Although, although if you count the ones on the 360 degree classroom, that's another

1478
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,340
100K.

1479
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,340
There you go.

1480
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,340
Yeah.

1481
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,340
There you go.

1482
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,340
Hey, by the way, what was the meme I said before?

1483
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,340
Was it hashtag just fucking?

1484
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,340
Was that the one?

1485
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,340
Yeah.

1486
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,340
Just fucking.

1487
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,340
Okay.

1488
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,340
Don't want to let that one slip away.

1489
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,340
Hey, should I bring all my like Copic markers and stuff?

1490
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,340
Should I bring like art supplies?

1491
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:10,340
That depends on what you and the draw boys want to do, which I am not a member of.

1492
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,340
That's cabal.

1493
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,340
So I have no, I don't know.

1494
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,340
I don't know.

1495
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,340
I'm bringing my iPad, obviously.

1496
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:20,340
I mean, yeah, I could bring, I have so many fucking Copics that I never use.

1497
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,340
I like having them.

1498
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,340
Bring them, dude.

1499
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:26,340
Additionally enough, maybe, maybe we could do something with, I don't know.

1500
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,340
I'll toss them in my duffel.

1501
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,340
I need a bag.

1502
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,340
I do not have a bag.

1503
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,340
I need to like borrow or steal a duffel bag from someone.

1504
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,340
Lol.

1505
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:41,340
I'm looking at the first video in the Radcon 2016 playlist, the arrival of Ben St.

1506
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
Top comment.

1507
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,340
This is like watching the Avengers.

1508
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,340
The Avengers assemble.

1509
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,340
It's exactly like that.

1510
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:54,340
Well, it's like watching like the Avengers of like, you know, like baby Avengers or

1511
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,340
like baby.

1512
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,340
Like muppet babies.

1513
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,340
Yeah, like muppet babies.

1514
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,340
Yeah.

1515
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,340
It's like the Muppet baby version.

1516
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,340
Like it's them, but they're babies at the time.

1517
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,340
And they got, I'm looking at the playlist.

1518
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:07,340
It's like, we've got the, the PCP live 360 camera.

1519
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,340
We've got Japanese.

1520
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,340
Right.

1521
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,340
We've got Japanese niggers, a bunch of vlogs.

1522
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,340
Disavow.

1523
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:18,340
A few Digi spin the crunchy roulette with people.

1524
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,340
And then the, the 20 man Royal Rumble.

1525
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:26,340
And yeah, the lecture body cast.

1526
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,340
That's it.

1527
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,340
Oh, and a bunch of Let's Plays.

1528
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,340
That was, yeah.

1529
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,340
Humble beginnings.

1530
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:35,340
I mean, nothing we do now is so much more complicated.

1531
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:40,340
We just do more and we like try to generate more footage, like cause it's a Kickstarter

1532
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,340
and stuff now.

1533
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
Yeah.

1534
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,340
So it's just like amped up, but it's pretty much the same shit.

1535
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,340
Oh, very exciting.

1536
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,340
Very high.

1537
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,340
My favorite comment is still, imagine paying these guys $34,000 to go on.

1538
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,340
I can't.

1539
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,340
Thanks buddy.

1540
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:01,340
I can't believe it.

1541
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:05,340
Everyone in real life I talked to about Radcon is thoroughly confused.

1542
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,340
Yeah.

1543
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,340
It's very funny.

1544
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:14,340
Everyone, everybody, everybody trying to be a badass until they say that you earned $34,000

1545
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,340
and then they start sucking your dick.

1546
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,340
Wait, you made how much money?

1547
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,340
On a, on a what?

1548
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,340
On a what exactly?

1549
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:25,340
I was talking to, I was, I was talking to our mom, Ben, about what a disappointment

1550
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,340
you are to the family.

1551
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,340
Yeah.

1552
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,340
And after we exhausted that topic over a few hours.

1553
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,340
Funny, I was doing the same thing about you.

1554
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,340
Fascinate.

1555
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,340
She's playing both sides against them.

1556
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,340
She's a, she's a warren.

1557
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,340
A tactician.

1558
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,340
She's pulling a warren.

1559
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,340
Damn, damn mom.

1560
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Really living up to the Karen ideal.

1561
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,340
I know.

1562
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,340
She's like, like, like she's not really repping her people very well.

1563
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,340
She's.

1564
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,340
No.

1565
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,340
The Native Americans that is.

1566
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:49,340
She's letting them down.

1567
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,340
What was I saying?

1568
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,340
Oh, right.

1569
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,340
I was just, I was talking to him.

1570
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,340
I was just like, hey mom, you know that Radcon thing we do?

1571
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:58,340
And she's like, oh yeah, that's a few of your friends are playing little games together.

1572
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,340
Yeah.

1573
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,340
I talked to mom and dad reason and I told them like, yeah, that Radcon thing raised like

1574
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,340
$34,000.

1575
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,340
Yeah.

1576
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,340
Dad just, dad was just like, mm, very good.

1577
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,340
Very good.

1578
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,340
Yeah.

1579
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,340
God damn it, dad.

1580
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,340
Be impressed.

1581
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,340
Be impressed.

1582
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,340
You piece of shit.

1583
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,340
He was impressed and I was fine with it.

1584
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,340
I was like, yes.

1585
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,340
It is very good.

1586
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,340
I don't know.

1587
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,340
I agree.

1588
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,340
I would talk to first.

1589
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,340
I mean, one of us talked to him first because maybe they had already heard because like,

1590
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,340
when I talked to mom, I just said like, hey mom, guess, guess how much we made.

1591
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:28,340
And I was like considering the fact that we got like $9,000 last time, guess how much.

1592
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,340
And she was like, mm, $12,000.

1593
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:35,340
And I was like $34,000 and she did her typical get out.

1594
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:36,340
Get out.

1595
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,340
Yeah.

1596
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,340
Yeah.

1597
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,340
Yeah.

1598
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,340
Yeah.

1599
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,340
It's a classic mom.

1600
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,340
Oh, we need, we need, we need a mom get out t-shirt now.

1601
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,340
Get out of here.

1602
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,340
Remember Grace's brief cameo?

1603
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:51,340
Remember Grace's brief cameo?

1604
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,340
We could get, we get more family cameos.

1605
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,340
The fam cam.

1606
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,340
Meos.

1607
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,340
Oh yeah.

1608
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,340
Good.

1609
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,340
You're a dog and I'm sick of it.

1610
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:04,340
What a strange, what a strange legacy.

1611
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,340
Yeah.

1612
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,340
That's true.

1613
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,340
Hey.

1614
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,340
Yeah.

1615
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
I've, right.

1616
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,340
Here's, here's a small like thing.

1617
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:19,340
I've been going back to, to listen to destiny lectures.

1618
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,340
Notable ones.

1619
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,340
Obviously the John Trum one, which was where I first heard of it.

1620
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,340
You mean the streams?

1621
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,340
The streams.

1622
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,340
Sorry.

1623
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,340
Loll lectures.

1624
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,340
He gives lectures every day.

1625
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,340
Big, big, big academic.

1626
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,340
That guy.

1627
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,340
Yeah.

1628
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:37,340
The first time I saw destiny, he was like a fucking stupid, annoying piece of shit.

1629
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,340
And I don't like him.

1630
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:45,340
But going back with my knowledge of like, huh, you know, some ideas are okay.

1631
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,340
Some ideas that are previously thought.

1632
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,340
Another good t-shirt.

1633
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,340
Yeah, some ideas are okay.

1634
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,340
Yeah.

1635
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,340
Oh man.

1636
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,340
I kind of want to make that one for real.

1637
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,340
Holy shit.

1638
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:02,340
So I go back and I'm like, maybe I had the wrong idea about destiny because I listened

1639
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,340
to this John Trum thing.

1640
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:07,340
And I was like, okay, John Trum is saying white nationalist talking points.

1641
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:13,340
I don't think he's an actual racist, but he is saying those things that is very silly.

1642
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,340
Don't listen to Sargon, John.

1643
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:18,340
You're not, don't do it.

1644
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,340
Stop doing it.

1645
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:22,340
Are you tacitly implying that just Sargon just is a white Nash?

1646
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,340
It means is that we try to sneak in there?

1647
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,340
Because I think you'll have a difficult time actually making that point.

1648
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,340
He's a little bit of a white.

1649
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:35,340
I saw another stream with destiny and Sargon and there's talking points there that like

1650
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,340
lead in a racist direction.

1651
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,340
Sargon denies it, of course, because it's like.

1652
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,340
No, I'm not letting you get away with this.

1653
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:45,340
You say one, like you make one point that has anything to do and you're just like, oh,

1654
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,340
they're like on the pipeline now.

1655
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,340
You just imply a little point.

1656
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:51,340
And you just imply a little bit that maybe we should keep America white and suddenly

1657
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,340
everyone's calling you a white nationalist.

1658
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,340
Now, see, you're twisting that the way you want to.

1659
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,340
I'm not saying that any different way.

1660
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:05,340
Like the pipeline isn't necessarily you are like rotten to the core and you're like an

1661
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,340
evil person.

1662
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:12,340
White nationalist is not a thing that is, you know, it's not like a slur in the same

1663
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,340
way.

1664
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,340
It's just a way of thinking, a framework of thinking.

1665
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:21,340
Like to say that Sargon might be a white nationalist is not to say, don't trust anything

1666
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,340
he says.

1667
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,340
Everything he says is stupid.

1668
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,340
That is not what I'm saying.

1669
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,340
And it's not what a lot of people are saying.

1670
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:33,340
But the thing that I came across, came away with with listening to these destiny lectures

1671
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:38,340
and, you know, there's one with Lauren Southern and he went on the kill stream and stuff.

1672
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:45,340
And I get the sense that, I mean, I think he said at one point that he doesn't do the

1673
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,340
arguing to make people understand.

1674
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,340
He just likes the arguing.

1675
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:55,340
The people on the left really are annoyed that he takes the leftist points, but he doesn't

1676
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:02,340
present it in a way that the right can reasonably like understand without getting really annoyed

1677
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,340
because he is annoying.

1678
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,340
He has an annoying personality and is an abrasive guy.

1679
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:12,340
So like he does all these things and he's not trying to be smarter than everyone else.

1680
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:18,340
But he is sort of an edgy lolster and he likes it when they get triggered and upset about

1681
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:23,340
talking points and he likes calling them an idiot in, you know, calling them idiots for

1682
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,340
the viewpoints they have.

1683
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:30,340
And they get really riled up because it's a natural reaction to being called an idiot.

1684
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:38,340
But it's, I think, it's like as well as the Digi lecture, Digi stream, what Digi was on.

1685
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,340
Like I could see where Digi was coming from, but the reason that there was a big divide

1686
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,340
in like understanding between Destiny and why Destiny thought Digi was a complete idiot

1687
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,340
was because Digi was using words wrong.

1688
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:56,340
As he is known to do, he has like an idea of what a word means.

1689
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,340
Destiny is like, what do you mean?

1690
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,340
I don't understand.

1691
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,340
Please explain.

1692
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,340
I'll reframe your argument and you'll tell me if it's right.

1693
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:06,340
And Digi is like, you're reframing my argument.

1694
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:12,340
There's lots of, it's a little infuriating when somebody doesn't listen to Destiny,

1695
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:16,340
but I can see why they don't because Destiny is hard to listen to if you're predisposed

1696
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:20,340
to dislike the things he says or the positions he holds.

1697
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:26,340
So it's like, it's very entertaining when you agree with him, but when you don't, it's

1698
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,340
so aggravating.

1699
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,340
I mean, it's kind of encapsulated in that meme of like, oh no, the worst guy you know

1700
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:34,340
just made a really good point, which I'm not saying anyone always makes a really good point.

1701
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:39,340
But it's real hard to just be like, can't, ooh, Destiny, you really have a concrete reason

1702
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:42,340
for why like 100% of children should be aborted.

1703
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,340
I can't refute it, but I just hate you.

1704
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,340
So I disagree.

1705
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:53,340
I lost a lot of respect in particular for Mr. Medeker and Dick Masterson hearing them

1706
01:12:53,340 --> 01:13:00,340
debate Destiny and just hearing their complete self-assurance that they are correct and that

1707
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:05,340
this guy they're talking to can't possibly be making any good points, even though he is

1708
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,340
the big, big Destiny on them.

1709
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:14,340
The thing that really rolls me up is like, a lot of time where, you know, Destiny will

1710
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,340
start making a rebuttal to their statement and they will cut him off and saying, you're

1711
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:24,340
just a piece of shit, like some sort of, like they get riled up by the way he starts his,

1712
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:29,340
like he brings up a hypothetical and they're like, yeah, but what about like an exception

1713
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:34,340
to that hypothetical and they don't accept the hypothetical scenario in order to start

1714
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,340
the discussion about it.

1715
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,340
So he just gets cut off over and over again.

1716
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,340
And they think that because he's trying so desperately to push forward this hypothetical

1717
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:47,340
so that they could start that he's being hysterical and he's, you know, he's a crazy

1718
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,340
leftist and he doesn't listen.

1719
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,340
And it's so obvious that they aren't listening to him.

1720
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,340
And it's just, there's so many points like that.

1721
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:01,340
It's like, you know, Destiny isn't definitely not like everyone's cup of tea to listen to,

1722
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:08,340
but I definitely feel like there's worth, it's worth like trying to listen to him unemotionally

1723
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,340
to see what he's actually saying.

1724
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:12,340
I fell down the Destiny hole.

1725
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,340
I listened to a bunch, for a while I was listening to all his shit.

1726
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,340
Lately, lately he's been really annoying.

1727
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:27,340
Hearing him make like a totally like non-emotional argument for various like progressive things

1728
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:32,340
that I had never really heard anyone make like an intellectual appeal to before in such like a

1729
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,340
straightforward way was really good.

1730
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,340
He does it for like immigration.

1731
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,340
He does it for like trans identities.

1732
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,340
He does it for, you know, stuff.

1733
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:48,340
He has an approach that I think a lot of people on the right don't expect some fucking SJW to use.

1734
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,340
It's great.

1735
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,340
I love it.

1736
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:54,340
I love him, even though he's a big fucking asshole and I hate him.

1737
01:14:54,340 --> 01:15:02,340
The debate he had with Sargon, they went over a lot of topics, but what I really came away with

1738
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:07,340
is not that Sargon is like, you know, obviously nobody thinks of themselves as evil or racist.

1739
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:13,340
And there are moments where Sargon is getting to a point where he's like almost agreeing with Destiny.

1740
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:20,340
Like the Destiny's talking point, Sargon is like, oh, that's a reasonable, like I can see you have a reasonable opinion there.

1741
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:26,340
You're just contradicting the other statements you're making, which are, you know, things that you say in your videos,

1742
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,340
but the things you're saying here when under scrutiny, they seem more reasonable.

1743
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:38,340
And Destiny's trying so hard to get him to understand that he has contradicted himself and this thing that he actually believes is more reasonable

1744
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:42,340
than the talking points he makes in his videos that are more right-leaning sounding.

1745
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:46,340
And it's like, please, please listen.

1746
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,340
Please listen, Sargon.

1747
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,340
You're not as bad as you make yourself out to be.

1748
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,340
You kind of make yourself out to be worse than you are because you're kind of stupid and you don't listen.

1749
01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:00,340
And it's like, I feel like that's such a common thing.

1750
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,340
Like nobody, like Dick Masterson isn't a fucking criminal or an evil person.

1751
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:09,340
Neither is Sargon, neither is Jontro, neither is anyone who's ever been considered on the far right.

1752
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:16,340
The people who attack people on the right for their opinions that they have,

1753
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:25,340
unless they're out and out racists who are like saying it or like, you know, heavily, heavily, heavily implied racists,

1754
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:34,340
if they're just a pundit, they're usually normal people who have like white people who feel like their whiteness is being attacked

1755
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,340
and they didn't do anything and this isn't fair.

1756
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,340
And so they just gravitate towards these talking points.

1757
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:45,340
They're not bad people, but it's just, it's so difficult to watch a Destiny stream and see them kind of be

1758
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:54,340
okay, but still double down on the thing that is like leading down, not exactly leading down always,

1759
01:16:54,340 --> 01:17:00,340
but like tends towards a path of getting rid of brown people sometimes.

1760
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:03,340
They double down on the bad part, yeah.

1761
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:08,340
Because like, I don't know, like with Jontro in particular, you could see it.

1762
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,340
It's like, this is just a thing he's assumed, he's just uncritically assumed.

1763
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:19,340
And like, he can't really articulate why he thinks it, but he doesn't like Ed question.

1764
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,340
Like nobody likes being called a racist.

1765
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,340
So he just kind of doubles down on it, yeah.

1766
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:31,340
It's nobody likes being called a racist or implied that they could be a racist or have like, you know, male privilege, white privilege or any of that stuff.

1767
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,340
And so they get very defensive and it's not the worst thing in the world.

1768
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:41,340
It's not the worst thing in the world to be like having, like you can change.

1769
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,340
It's just, I don't know.

1770
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:50,340
People on that mindset, it would be so easy to just be like, oh, did I say something that was kind of racist?

1771
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:55,340
Whoops, I guess I didn't think about it and realize that it's kind of a racist thing to say.

1772
01:17:55,340 --> 01:18:00,340
Thanks for pointing out to me the logical conclusions of this belief that I held so I can reevaluate it.

1773
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:06,340
The issue with this is just that I feel like you guys are going to call something like, you know what, I think we should have less immigration.

1774
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,340
Is that racist? I mean, you probably would say it is, but it's not.

1775
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,340
No, that's not in and of itself.

1776
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:15,340
Oh, there you go. Why do you straw man me like that, Nate?

1777
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,340
No, but like I could see why people...

1778
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,340
You know that you'd say that.

1779
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,340
You're wrong. You're literally wrong.

1780
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,340
Why is Sargon racist then? Why is Sargon racist?

1781
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,340
He's not racist.

1782
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:30,340
Is it because he like notices that like with Middle Eastern immigration, like rape rates have gone up, is that why he's racist?

1783
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:35,340
The thing with those conversations is that they haven't, like the data proof...

1784
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,340
He doesn't back up his statements with facts.

1785
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,340
That's, yeah.

1786
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,340
It's the thing that doesn't...

1787
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:43,340
I mean, that's not even my position, but that's where I understand his position to be.

1788
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:51,340
Exactly, like when it comes down to facts, like it's not that I have a latent racism and so I want to get rid of immigrants.

1789
01:18:51,340 --> 01:19:01,340
I would like it if they didn't commit crimes, but it turns out that generally it's not actually as bad as, you know, certain media outlets make you believe it is.

1790
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,340
And if you see...

1791
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:08,340
You know, the whole thing like Jon Trum thinking that rich blacks commit more crime than poor whites.

1792
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:14,340
That was some data that he got from somewhere and he believed it because he didn't...

1793
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:23,340
Because he was already thinking social justice and the left hate me because I'm worried about immigration.

1794
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,340
It's okay to be worried about immigration.

1795
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,340
You know, it's not like immigration is perfect.

1796
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:38,340
It's definitely a lot of problems with it, but like the issue is always about nuance and a lot of the time the nuance lies...

1797
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:47,340
You know, it's very obvious when somebody has not delved into the nuance to come away with like a real opinion on the matter.

1798
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:54,340
They just have heard a thing and they believe that and so they will go along with their life believing these things without really delving into it.

1799
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,340
And I can't say that I'm like a...

1800
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:10,340
I know about immigration in America any more than, you know, just a few videos I've seen, but like it's interesting in these debates and scenarios where destiny is so into the facts and the logic.

1801
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:17,340
And you know, it just makes me think like, damn, maybe I don't fucking know anything.

1802
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:20,340
Maybe I should really think before I speak.

1803
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:24,340
You know, not to discredit destiny or anybody else, he could be 100% right.

1804
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:30,340
The reason I get suspicious of people who, I mean to you, like destiny, oh he's so obviously right.

1805
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:37,340
There are such strong incentives to find the data point that works for you and then cease your investigation at that point.

1806
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:46,340
I feel like that operates in a lot of these circles and then they're just, you know, you find the convenient answer that justifies your belief and then you just...

1807
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,340
I mean, you could say that about anyone.

1808
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,340
Absolutely true.

1809
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:57,340
You could point to any person arguing anything and saying like, oh, they're only using the evidence that agrees with them.

1810
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:07,340
That is exactly why Ben, I feel so uncomfortable making any real world points ever and I'm only comfortable debating like philosophical things I think are kind of correct or stuff like that.

1811
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:11,340
Well, sure, but at the end of the day, you're going to argue about facts.

1812
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:18,340
You have to fall back on data and then it's become like, okay, who's got the better and more compelling data?

1813
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,340
Perfectly reasonable, perfectly reasonable when that is the debate.

1814
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:30,340
To say Saragon is the worst guy ever just because he's kind of stupid and like it's not fair on him.

1815
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:34,340
At the same time, it's fine to make fun of people.

1816
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:38,340
So like there's many ways to do this.

1817
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:44,340
It's not like destiny is right and everyone who he debates it is always like guaranteed destroyed.

1818
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,340
Like I don't agree that like Digi didn't have a point when he debated him.

1819
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,340
It was just that his point was a different type of thing.

1820
01:21:52,340 --> 01:22:02,340
Like he was talking about arguments as in the way human beings talk to one another and destiny was talking about debate as a form of like official recognized.

1821
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:11,340
This is how we come to consensus because conclusions are through debate and Digi was like, I mean, if you really listen to that, you can see Digi's point.

1822
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,340
And you can see Dick Masterson point that Digi was trying to explain.

1823
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:22,340
But you can also see the destiny is like arguing something else and he just doesn't care.

1824
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:24,340
That's my recollection.

1825
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:32,340
The thing that Digi was going for was like so unimportant to him that it just became a big like shouting match.

1826
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:42,340
I watched them. I saw the I saw destiny call into Vosh right to talk about I won't go into the whole like background of it.

1827
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:46,340
But they were they got into an argument and Vosh was like, dude, destiny.

1828
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:56,340
I thought you were supposed to be an SJW and destiny was like, dude, I'm the only SJW left because all you people all you lefties abandoned intersectionality for class consciousness.

1829
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:02,340
And it's like, damn, what what a thing to say. What a debate to be having.

1830
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:08,340
And I'm like, you know, even though I'm a more Vosh guy than a destiny guy now, I generally agree with Vosh more.

1831
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:14,340
But like, this is good. This is good that like these two guys, these are both one way.

1832
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:22,340
They're both probably left of center kind of and they're having a debate and the argument comes down to, you know, intersectionality versus class consciousness,

1833
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:28,340
which is the right approach, which is the right approach to righting the wrongs of the world and making things better.

1834
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:33,340
And I just reflected on someone a right leaning person would be in here trying to argue that no,

1835
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:37,340
both of these things are bad and making the world better in any way is wrong and foolish.

1836
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:43,340
And I thought, boy, I sure do hate the other side of the aisle with all my heart.

1837
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,340
The end. That's all I have to say.

1838
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,340
And that is why you will fail to convert them, Ben.

1839
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,340
They'll never be converted because they're bad on the inside.

1840
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:52,340
See, this is the difference between them and me.

1841
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:56,340
I'm trying so hard to be like the bridge builder.

1842
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,340
I want that more than anything.

1843
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:01,340
One method is more effective than the other.

1844
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,340
I mean, I don't know.

1845
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,340
I mean, Ben just enjoys sitting in his toolbox.

1846
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,340
They had a whole life.

1847
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:12,340
They have their whole life to figure out what was right and good and decide on it and they failed.

1848
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:15,340
And so now it's time to employ the guillotines.

1849
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,340
Their number is up.

1850
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,340
You know, they did not pass the test.

1851
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,340
We've decided to make a better society.

1852
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,340
Well, they should.

1853
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,340
I mean, you know, good ideas.

1854
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:26,340
I think I do think good ideas should win.

1855
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,340
Yeah, that's true.

1856
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,340
Okay.

1857
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,340
Hot take, I know.

1858
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:34,340
Indeed.

1859
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,340
All right.

1860
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,340
Nate, how many voicemails do we have?

1861
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:44,340
Because we're at an hour and a half right now and far be it from us to deny anyone listening to this as soon as it comes out.

1862
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:49,340
The live stream that's coming up in a in a mere half an hour their time.

1863
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,340
Well, okay, that's only when we can get in.

1864
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:56,340
It's going to take some amount of minutes, even if we rush to set up like streaming equipment.

1865
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,340
So I wouldn't say it's going to start exactly then.

1866
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,340
Mathematically, I think it can't be done.

1867
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:10,340
I mean, few of us could just like make sure that we start streaming as soon as the episode is like out for the amount of time that the length of the episode is.

1868
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,340
We probably shouldn't start immediately.

1869
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:19,340
Because like most people aren't going to click play and play it all the way through the moment it comes out.

1870
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:25,340
Well, I mean, I didn't even know until now if anyone was even interested in starting like immediately or not.

1871
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,340
I mean, it's on the schedule.

1872
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:32,340
I'm definitely going to be tweeting a storm with pictures of like us fucking around.

1873
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,340
Indeed.

1874
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,340
Well, of course, of course.

1875
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,340
The content will flow like wine.

1876
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,340
It'll be great.

1877
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,340
Although Gib will not be there until later that night.

1878
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,340
And Munchy not till the next morning due to their schedule and whatnot.

1879
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,340
But no matter.

1880
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,340
No matter.

1881
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:51,340
The answer to your question, Tom, is that there are exactly three voicemails.

1882
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,340
Oh, we're good.

1883
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,340
We're voicemails.

1884
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,340
So we'll not do much to delay things.

1885
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,340
We can keep talking forever.

1886
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,340
Or I mean, I have them right here.

1887
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,340
I'm ready to get to them.

1888
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,340
I don't know.

1889
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,340
Let's do it.

1890
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,340
Do we have anything else to go over?

1891
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,340
I feel like it's a clean time to transition.

1892
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,340
So let's just do it.

1893
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,340
All right.

1894
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,340
So here we go.

1895
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,340
All right.

1896
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,340
First voicemail.

1897
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,340
This one is from, let me see.

1898
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,340
Oh, and of course, speak pipe link down below.

1899
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,340
Leave your voicemails.

1900
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:19,340
Although I guess it's fair to say the next PCP you see will be a live stream.

1901
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,340
So we probably won't be doing voicemails for that one.

1902
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,340
That's true.

1903
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:28,340
Maybe we'll do some sort of live, you know, ask PCP thing on Twitter that we're scrolling

1904
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,340
and reading questions.

1905
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,340
We'll take Superchats.

1906
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,340
I don't know.

1907
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,340
Superchats are probably the right way to do it.

1908
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,340
Yeah.

1909
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,340
Maybe one of us can watch this.

1910
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:38,340
So I mean, if you do this next time there's a recorded PCP, we'll probably do it for that.

1911
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:40,340
And so, okay, now you're aware.

1912
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:43,340
But the link to the speak pipe, speak pipe is down below.

1913
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,340
Use it at your leisure.

1914
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:45,340
All right.

1915
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:52,340
The first voicemail here is from, I'll die, petitions to give the PCP more money.

1916
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:54,340
I'm excited to hear this one.

1917
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,340
Let's see what he has to say.

1918
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,340
Okay, go.

1919
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,340
Listen, guys, I'm going through a crisis.

1920
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:00,340
Vic and Hope is the only thing that keeps me sane.

1921
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:06,340
So I was ecstatic to see that we finally got a new episode after like months on like Sonic

1922
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,340
the Hedgehog around when the movie came out.

1923
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:11,340
And in that episode, Vic was saying that there has been a lot of content.

1924
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,340
It's just that he wants to edit footage of like they've tripped to Japan over it.

1925
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:19,340
So that way, you know, we can like see what's going on when they're talking about it, which

1926
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,340
sounds really cool.

1927
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,340
And I'd love it.

1928
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:24,340
But the problem is just that he's busy and he doesn't have the time to do that.

1929
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:29,340
So like, here's the new strategy that he's going to Rack Han For, but he's just going

1930
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,340
to be the cameraman.

1931
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,340
That's no good.

1932
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,340
He needs to edit.

1933
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,340
He needs to make a new Kickstarter to hire another cameraman to take Vic's job.

1934
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,340
He'll still get paid as the cameraman.

1935
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:43,340
It's just that he'll edit his show while this other fucking piece of shit does his job

1936
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,340
for him.

1937
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,340
So I don't have to go insane not listening to Vic and Hope.

1938
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,340
Thank you.

1939
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:52,340
I think we'll all be happy with the solution.

1940
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,340
Make sense.

1941
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:56,340
If the money comes, we can make it happen.

1942
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:03,340
This seems like less of us getting money and more of this camera guy getting money and

1943
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,340
I'm suddenly less interested.

1944
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:11,340
I thought the idea was that we do the Kickstarter and we then exempt Victor from the need to

1945
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,340
do that.

1946
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:17,740
And like, obviously we got to make his payback ourselves and then we give some lesser amount

1947
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:23,340
of money to whoever's doing the job in his place, I guess.

1948
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,340
Too complicated.

1949
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,340
Just go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

1950
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:32,340
That's the only place to send your money in a reliable and trustworthy way.

1951
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,940
Alright, enough of that bullshit.

1952
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:37,340
Vic and Hope, that's not even PCP affiliated technically.

1953
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:38,340
Well maybe it is.

1954
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,340
I guess technically it is.

1955
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,340
Second cousin to PCP.

1956
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:46,340
Remember the fucking Tony Hawk endless Jess Vic blue glow.

1957
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,340
Oh yeah.

1958
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,340
Okay.

1959
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,340
There you go.

1960
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:50,340
So Vic's officially, yeah.

1961
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:55,340
First extended universe content man, aside from being the brother of the Digi.

1962
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,340
Indeed.

1963
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,340
Indeed.

1964
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:01,340
Okay, here's a voicemail that's simply called, they killed me because I knew too much.

1965
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,340
Okay, go.

1966
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,340
PCP, I need you guys to wish me luck.

1967
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:11,340
The coronavirus has entered my state.

1968
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:19,340
Before I die, I just need to tell you guys, I have information that will indict Hillary

1969
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:23,340
Well, the coronavirus killed his microphone.

1970
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,340
Microphone started coughing and I couldn't record anymore.

1971
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,340
Or the odds you think.

1972
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:31,340
It's a really funny like instant death.

1973
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,340
He didn't even sound bad.

1974
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:35,340
It was like a Sopranos ending moment there.

1975
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,340
His whole state just like dissolved.

1976
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:42,340
It was like, he just got fucking Avenger Infinity Ward.

1977
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:48,340
What are the odds that Hillary Clinton personally, that was yes, that was infinity war.

1978
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:55,340
What are the odds that they arranged the coronavirus, the Clintons to Epstein, the decrepit old men

1979
01:29:55,340 --> 01:30:00,340
that are currently on top of the ticket to make room for a virile young up and coming

1980
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:03,340
Sprout like Hillary.

1981
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,340
A hundred percent?

1982
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,340
Two hundred percent?

1983
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:11,340
So like Hillary paid China to develop the coronavirus and spread it around the world

1984
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:15,340
just so that everyone else except her will be killed.

1985
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,340
This is my, yes.

1986
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,340
Correct.

1987
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:21,340
She killed off her competition because you know she's starting a podcast.

1988
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:24,340
Hillary Clinton is starting.

1989
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:32,340
She calls it an audio program and she says that her inspirations include Howard Stern.

1990
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:37,340
So she's going to run a Howard Stern style audio program.

1991
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:42,340
Oh my God, imagine Hillary working the sound board the way I do.

1992
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,340
Fart with reverb.

1993
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,340
Fart with reverb.

1994
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:49,340
26 will commence again.

1995
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:51,340
All the highlights, all the highlights.

1996
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:52,340
Very excited for that.

1997
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:54,340
Hillary will be tuning in.

1998
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:57,340
She's going to need promotion and I think the PCP is the place to get it.

1999
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,340
We should have coronavirus on the PCP and ask it.

2000
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:01,340
Corona Chan.

2001
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,340
Why?

2002
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,340
Give us a call.

2003
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:06,340
Corona Chan's definitely going to come to Raycon 4.

2004
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:07,340
I can't wait.

2005
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,340
I'm very excited for that.

2006
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:13,340
It's going to be a blast, a vomit and shit out of every orifice.

2007
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,340
Looking forward to that.

2008
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,340
All right, we've got one more.

2009
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:19,340
All right, so there's an image that goes along with this one.

2010
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,340
So check the description.

2011
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,340
I'm posting it in the thing down there.

2012
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,340
Behold this image.

2013
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:31,340
And while you're looking at that, listen to this PCP voicemail from our friendly editor,

2014
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,340
Eleazar.

2015
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,340
And let's hear what he has to say and go.

2016
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,340
Hey, Eleazar here.

2017
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:43,340
So the other day I was walking, wasting my PCP money on beaches and beaches.

2018
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,340
And suddenly I found this.

2019
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:47,340
And at first I was very confused.

2020
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,340
Like PCP, what, what.

2021
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,340
Then I read the text at the bottom.

2022
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:58,340
And I was really happy because if you translate it from Virgin Spanish to chat English,

2023
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:03,340
it says, integral attention to children and adolescent with disability.

2024
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,340
I didn't know PCP HQ was real.

2025
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,340
Anyways, congratulations, guys.

2026
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:10,340
In Argentina for presents.

2027
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,340
Like really great, really great.

2028
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,340
Thank you.

2029
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,340
So yeah, bye bye.

2030
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:16,340
Thanks Eleazar.

2031
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:19,340
Lovely to hear from you, my boy.

2032
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:24,340
We're cultivating our low IQ demographic.

2033
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:30,340
This is the main, we think we have most potential in the low IQ circles.

2034
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:32,340
We are a big, big fan base in South Carolina.

2035
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:37,340
Everybody there disagrees with our policies, hates us personally, but votes for us anyway.

2036
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:41,340
They just, they just, because you know, we're just, it's just the thing.

2037
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,340
They vote for us to be podcast of the year.

2038
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:44,340
Yeah.

2039
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:51,340
They're going to vote for us to defeat Hillary Clinton in the podcast elections.

2040
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,340
The podcast.

2041
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:57,340
The podcast, got to think of a word.

2042
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:00,340
PC, I don't, I can't think of it.

2043
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,340
Proletariat.

2044
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,340
PCPOTUS.

2045
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:03,340
Yeah.

2046
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,340
PC, put them up.

2047
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:09,340
PC, put them up and you raise your dukes and punch and there you go.

2048
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:10,340
That's what's going to be.

2049
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:11,340
That sucks.

2050
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:12,340
This sucks.

2051
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,340
Delete the next one.

2052
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,340
That was just shit, dude.

2053
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,340
Hashtag just fucking everybody.

2054
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,340
Let's skip back to that, because that was the last voicemail.

2055
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,340
Some ideas were okay.

2056
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:19,340
Thank you, Eleazar.

2057
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,340
Some ideas are okay.

2058
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:22,340
Some ideas were okay.

2059
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:26,340
Like leaving a voicemail with an image attached.

2060
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:27,340
Thanks, Eleazar, for that.

2061
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:32,340
Hey, hey, if you want to get your fucking voicemail played when we come back with a recorded episode

2062
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:38,060
episode that'll be edited and whatnot, click the speak pipe, speak pipe link down below.

2063
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:43,380
I'm expecting an influx of rad con shit when you hear this and all kinds of good stuff

2064
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,380
is happening.

2065
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,420
So I guess that'll be that.

2066
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:50,540
End of episode, scene, curtain falls, transition.

2067
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:55,780
Clear your schedule for the rest of the day because it's time for live content from rad

2068
01:33:55,780 --> 01:34:04,100
con 4 all night long.

2069
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,020
I am pretty stoked.

2070
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:09,300
You'll see us in the flesh very soon everybody.

2071
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,940
All our goddamn Twitter's, there's gonna be updates going on all of those.

2072
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:19,620
Follow Twitter, follow on Instagram, follow on Byte, follow on TikTok, follow on LinkedIn,

2073
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:21,540
get followed everywhere.

2074
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:29,100
We should make an epic TikTok at radcon that's the girl going, one of our anime girl OCs

2075
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:33,500
from the OVA that's going like, are you masturbating to porn?

2076
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,980
Oh no, are you masturbating alone?

2077
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:41,460
And then you turn the camera around and it's like, no, I'm with my boys.

2078
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,460
We should do that.

2079
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,540
That's a good TikTok.

2080
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:47,580
All right, radcon starting immediately.

2081
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:48,700
Thanks for everybody who donated.

2082
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,700
So we don't.

2083
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:52,180
Who's their shirt making it happen?

2084
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,060
And it's gonna be a great time.

2085
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:59,100
For the fucking, if you're the goddamn PTA, be active in that Discord because who knows

2086
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:04,060
when you'll be called upon to perform services to tell us what to do or vote on things.

2087
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:05,060
It could be any time.

2088
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,780
We make no promises for when things will happen.

2089
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:12,540
We'll just probably throw fucking vote tallies, fucking, what are those voting websites again?

2090
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:16,980
The Lincoln, whatever, you know what I'm talking about, voting for things and straw

2091
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:17,980
polls.

2092
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:18,980
That's what I'm thinking about.

2093
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:22,980
Any time who knows what's going to happen or voting or all the super chats, all kinds

2094
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,180
of things are happening.

2095
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:25,340
Fuck you.

2096
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:31,220
But if you want to hear, hey, if you missed the, if you missed the boat on the PCP radcon

2097
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:35,540
behind the scenes, radcon for behind the scenes stuff, not all is lost because me, Gib and

2098
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:40,940
Tom did a bonus episode that just came out a few days ago that covers a bunch of the

2099
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:44,540
behind the scenes stuff that you might not even hear anywhere else in our planning and

2100
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,340
the trials and tribulations of getting it stoked.

2101
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,340
Hey, I'm on it too.

2102
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:48,340
I have more content.

2103
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:49,340
Oh yeah, that's right.

2104
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:50,340
I'm on it too.

2105
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,340
With this cameo.

2106
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,340
That's true.

2107
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,340
I'm a big, I have a big, yeah, yeah.

2108
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:57,860
It's, I'm the, you know, my time on the episode is low, but I would say I'm the emotional

2109
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,460
core of the bonus episode.

2110
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:04,940
It's like the Jesus, you know?

2111
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:05,940
It's like Jesus.

2112
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,940
He doesn't show up often in your life, but when he does, notable.

2113
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:09,940
It's a big impact.

2114
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:10,940
Notable.

2115
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:11,940
Notable.

2116
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,940
All right.

2117
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:16,420
That being said, go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators, pledge five dollars to

2118
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:21,260
get 35 total bonus episodes, including that one.

2119
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,260
Monsters twos in there.

2120
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:24,260
Fuck in monsters.

2121
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,260
One.

2122
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,260
Wait, no, that was a normal episode.

2123
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:31,260
It's a bunch of ASMR, just a legendary batch of episodes there and $1 and you're in the

2124
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:34,740
main discord, which I would recommend you be because this is going to be an active fucking

2125
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:40,260
week of PCP stuff going on and you're going to want to be there for now is the time.

2126
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:43,820
If you feel guilty that you miss the Kickstarter, you're like, God, I really wish I could have

2127
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:47,420
contributed somehow to this epic level production.

2128
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,100
Get in the patron, just do it.

2129
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,100
Every dollar helps.

2130
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,100
That's right.

2131
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,100
That's right.

2132
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,100
And I guess that's it.

2133
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:59,180
We'll see you in paradise at radcon4 and follow the Twitter at TPCrastinators.

2134
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,740
That'll definitely be the central hub for like news and updates and like if things happen,

2135
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:06,580
like we have to move the venue of the, like of the meetup because it's like raining out

2136
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:07,580
or something.

2137
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:08,580
Follow that.

2138
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,580
Important stuff's all going to be there.

2139
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,580
All right.

2140
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,580
There you go.

2141
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,580
We'll see you soon, everybody.

2142
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:13,580
Fuck yeah.

2143
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:15,340
Here we go.

2144
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,860
See you in like a few minutes when we're streaming live, everybody.

2145
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:19,860
Bye.

2146
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:20,860
Goodbye.

2147
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:21,860
Yeah.

2148
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:24,860
All right.

2149
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:25,860
Resync.

2150
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:26,860
Resync.

2151
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:27,860
I'm going to count of three.

2152
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,860
Here we go.

2153
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:29,860
Count of three.

2154
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:30,860
One, two, three.

2155
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:31,860
Sink.

2156
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:32,860
One more time.

2157
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:33,860
One, two, three.

2158
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:34,860
Sink.

2159
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:35,860
Sink.

2160
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:36,860
All right.

2161
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:37,860
Done.

2162
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:38,860
Heck yeah, dudes.

2163
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:39,860
Oh God.

2164
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:40,860
I got a fucking pack and shit.

2165
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,860
I am skewed.

2166
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
I don't want to fly.

2167
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:44,140
I hate flying.

2168
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:50,140
Okay.

2169
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:51,140
Okay.

2170
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:58,580
We can fucking die together when the pilot catches coronavirus and I'm going to give myself

2171
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:04,460
the coronavirus and then I'm going to go to fucking Milwaukee for the national convention

2172
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:09,780
and then if they don't give Bernie the num, I'm going to detonate myself and splatter

2173
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:14,900
my guts inside the state house and give it to all of them.

2174
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:15,980
That's what's up.

2175
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:16,980
That's what's happening.

2176
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:17,980
Ellie is arped.

2177
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:23,940
Don't fucking let the viewers know that I said that I'm going to do political violence.
