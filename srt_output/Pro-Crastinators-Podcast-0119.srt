00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm your

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,960
host for today, Tom Oliver, and with us we have a bunch of scoundrels starting with the

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,440
digital boy himself. Staring deep into my favorite haunted photograph.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,640
Uh, hooray. Hippo is here.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,400
It's a bitch's shed one.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,680
Amazing. Uh, Lethal Laura Mage.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,800
Hello, Digi. Is that is that image you're staring at? Is it of a figurine of that cursed life sized doll thing?

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,680
No, it's a picture of me and Gigic drunk as shit with a representative from Bandai Namco in a sort of online

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,120
bordered image that we didn't know we were taking until we did.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,480
That's even worse. Nate is here.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:08,960
The amount of joy I get from staring at my Radcon 3 Arena pin sitting next to my workstation every day is immeasurable.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm wearing the Radcon 3 Arena shirt right now. It's a great shirt.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,200
It's right next to my Poobop.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I feel that way every time I see the Poobopin that's still in the little plastic little thing because I don't know what to do with

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
the pins, but it just it somehow it appears in different rooms throughout the house.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,720
Well, it's alive.

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,600
Nice. It's definitely traveling.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,120
We have we have we have the DeVoo with us to lightly paraphrase Frederick Nietzsche suicide is in my blood.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,560
It always was, but it doesn't evaporate in the light anymore.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,760
I know that feel and munchy.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:59,440
Hey guys, did you know that actual real Shakespearean actor Jason Alexander known for his role as George Alexander is now going to be typecasted in all of his roles now because he played one character in Seinfeld and and because of that in a Disney movie,

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:09,400
Hunter Beck of Notre Dame, he was cast as a completely gargoyle in a real ass horror drama movie and he says lines in the middle of Quasimodo singing about how he wants to be perceived as real human.

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,440
He says, cut the wine and pour the cheese and makes fart noises.

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,440
God, this is the worst part of that movie.

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,080
What a modern treasure.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,520
He played an insane murderer in an episode of CSI once.

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
He played shallow.

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:32,600
Just to clarify, we are talking about I think he played a straight man hotel clerk in Dunks and checks in.

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,280
So he's not always on the offensive of Goof.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,600
You know, these days I hear he's been like making 45 minute video game analysis videos on YouTube.

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,320
That's exciting.

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,640
What?

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
Yeah, Joseph Alexander, right?

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,400
Oh, hey, hey, this is a restaurant.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I didn't fuck it up.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
No, it's Joseph Anderson.

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, God, damn it.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,480
It's Jason Alexander.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
It's Alexander the Great.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,320
No, no, it's fucking Joseph Anderson.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,760
You fuck none of the words.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,880
It sounds similar enough that it made sense as a joke in my head.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,080
Well, never mind.

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,360
I've already told the terrible story about how I thought Jay Alexander's restaurant was made by Jason Alexander.

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
Turns out it's not.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
And my disappointment is made from Jay from Red Letter Media.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,920
This is what you do with pins is you got to get a good fucking satchel.

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,720
All right, here's the thing now.

49
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,800
I've talked about the show how I want a purse and I do want a purse, but I can't get a purse or else my mom will kill me.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,280
So what I have to do is I have to get a satchel and I've been searching.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,320
I've been searching and all satchels are shit.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,800
I love the idea of a satchel, but they fucking suck.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,960
You just got to go to Kendall and Hyde and get that real leather.

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
You know, in college.

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,880
Write that down.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,520
But I've only seen shitty trying too hard.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
This is what we call nutsack.

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
It's like, oh, this isn't a fucking purse.

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
This is a satchel.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,840
Trust me, I'm not gay.

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,880
Here's what you do with that.

62
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,600
You play up the girliness of it, but you also accentuate your arm hair.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,680
So your arm hair is always on display and you're clutching your purse.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
But it's like, oh, you're clutching your girly purse.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,360
But you're always clutching it like it's hard to put it in your hand.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,640
And to show you a male power, you're barely visible.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,800
Your finger power to crush it as hard as you can just to show you you're a strong man.

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,520
Oh, oh, but in fucking Italy, which we'll get into later, but this is a quick aside.

69
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,440
I met this fucking guy who was my tour guide for a thing.

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,800
And he had this fucking sick ass satchel that was like black and looked super gender

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,400
neutral, but wasn't trying too hard to be manly.

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,360
And it also just was really cool and small and looked convenient.

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,240
So any rocket, super fucking hard.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
And also his arm hair was a fun fact.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,480
All European men are gay, bisexual, at least.

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,200
So, you know, just keep that in mind.

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
You're using fashion tips after him.

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,160
I did, I did, I did.

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,040
And he said, oh, I did, and I looked and then I looked really hard.

80
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,360
Like I stopped him in place and I said, you can't leave yet.

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,840
And then I looked really hard and satchel and it had the words bond, bond on it.

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,000
I've tried to search bond, bond, satchel, like the little Italian leather work,

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,960
you know, like marketplace, like the be like, hey, look at the bags.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,920
See, that's not how they speak.

85
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, oh, oh, OK.

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,280
Well, I have a lot to say about that, but I don't want to get it myself.

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,320
Me and Hippo have both gone on trips.

88
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,080
We've both gone on a worldwide adventure.

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,200
But a summer of trips.

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,320
But say all the shit that no one cares about first.

91
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,480
Good idea.

92
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,600
We don't need to do that now.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,120
This is the formless version of the show.

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,800
We just do.

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
Yeah, I mean, you know, I've got it.

96
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Well, I don't want to immediately run over the show with a info dump

97
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,680
and also then head over to Hippo, who will also info dump.

98
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,840
And then the rest of you fucking pigeons.

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,120
I mean, last time we literally just let Ben talk about keto for like an hour and a half.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,200
So like, yeah, it was all good, great.

101
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,320
That this is the muchy.

102
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,800
This is the spirit of the formless cast.

103
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,320
This is the topic of the day.

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,120
We want to hear about your trip and this is like this is like I'm like a fucking liberal.

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm a liberal noble who was just overthrown.

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,560
And now the windows is expedient.

107
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,800
So far that now that now that even though I was on like the far end of the spectrum,

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,360
now, now I'm just a conservative and reactionary conservative, counter-revolutionary

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,800
and Nate and Nate Maximilliam.

110
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,240
Yeah, yeah, it's going to fucking shot my head off before I can even get a word in.

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,160
I was telling you to go on about it though.

112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
It's the opposite of what I was trying to say.

113
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
All right, whatever.

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,200
OK, OK, OK, OK, I assume that we don't want to go blow by blow because that's kind of

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,760
all you didn't know about the shit that you can get is the I've gone.

116
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,120
I've gone to the fucking I've gone to all the places where you got to go.

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,040
Gone to the Coliseum, gone to the Vatican, I spin the Pope's fucking face

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,120
and I saw him on some right then and then everyone watching cheered me on.

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
I went to all the places that you need to.

120
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,360
And here, OK, I'm about to like pull up the shit because this is no longer

121
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
the procrastiners podcast.

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,640
This is no longer longer in audio entertainment.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
This is a post on my personal tumbler.

124
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Call out post for the lead.

125
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,840
Your faith is problematic.

126
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,160
The Leaning Tower of Peace.

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,200
What a duty. OK, here's the real shit.

128
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,320
Here's the fucking shit that you need to fucking know about the Leaning Tower of

129
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,920
Peace and all its ilk, all the tourist traps and the fucking black people trying

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,840
to sell you purses, all the black people near the Coliseum, right up to like high

131
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,920
five me modern, you know, get away from me and then they grab on to you.

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,840
They're like, no, high five me.

133
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,040
And then you say, no, and you run away and they say, I'm happy for you, man.

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,200
And then, you know, they're trying to get some lonely other cock to fucking

135
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,680
high five them and then the end then you're trapped.

136
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,720
All right, here's the deal.

137
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
Here's the fucking deal.

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,880
You go to Italy, you go to Italy, you look up Italy on the map and you say,

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,920
oh, I'm going to go to fucking Italy.

140
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,200
And you know why you go there?

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,080
Number one reason, because it's authentic, because it's rustic and you go

142
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440
and you go and you go to Olive Garden and you think, what if Olive Garden was

143
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,160
really big and that's what you think it's going to be?

144
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,000
So you go there because you want handmade shit.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
You want handmade pasta.

146
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
You want to roll your own dough.

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,960
You want to cook your own dough, Jerry.

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,440
It's a make your own pizza pie restaurant.

149
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,600
We're thinking to make the fucking stove.

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,480
You have the make your own pizza pie concept from Italy.

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,920
This is some bullshit.

152
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,280
All right.

153
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,240
It's fucking crazy.

154
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,880
So you go there and you want to be a rustic and authentic and then you go

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,640
there and because you're a fucking sheep, because you're my mom, because you're

156
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,480
a fucking 40 year old and by 40 year old, I mean, 50 year old baby boomer who just

157
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,240
wants to be told what to do.

158
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,600
They don't want to experience the real shit, even though that's what you came

159
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,880
here, so you can be authentic.

160
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,240
You want to come here and you want to be like, oh, what do I have to do?

161
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,800
What do people say to do?

162
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
And now I have to do it because I'm a fucking sheep and like, oh,

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
you know, why do I want to go to the Coliseum?

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,120
It's not because I care about history.

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
It's because I have to do it.

166
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,120
It's because it's because what it's what you do.

167
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
The Lean Tower of Pisa.

168
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
Here's the thing about the Lean Tower of Pisa.

169
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
It's a tower that leans.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
You can't go inside the Lean Tower of Pisa.

171
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,120
I mean, I think you can, but you have to like a special pass and I was not

172
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,960
able to do that and most people do not do it.

173
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,080
So it's not really a main attraction of it.

174
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,600
So Lean Tower of Pisa is a tower that leans that you look at from the outside

175
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,560
kind of far away.

176
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,520
That's where the road is.

177
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,920
You know how else you could intake that information?

178
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,760
It's looking at a picture of Lean Tower of Pisa.

179
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,240
What has everyone done for fucking a million years?

180
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,760
As long as they've been alive, look at pictures of the Lean Tower of Pisa.

181
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,960
So you've intake and all the information that you possibly could.

182
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,920
Now, I liked going to the Coliseum.

183
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,720
I liked doing that kind of stuff because you could intake more information.

184
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,480
You know, I've not really seen a lot of pictures of the inside of the Coliseum.

185
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,280
It was nice to be able to see the be there and have a tour guide be like, oh,

186
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,520
this is where the people were son of I just don't know.

187
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Wow, I wish that would happen to me sometime soon, please.

188
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,520
And it was great.

189
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,440
It was new information, but the Lean Tower of Pisa, here's the fucking thing.

190
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
When you're around shit, you get shit.

191
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
So you go to Lean Tower of Pisa because it's what you have to do.

192
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
It's what, oh, you can type on Facebook, you know, checked in Lean Tower of Pisa

193
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,680
and you're fucking Aunt Sally can be like, oh, my God, the Lean Tower of Pisa

194
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
is like my fucking dead husband's dick.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
And then she can like it and retweet it.

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,520
And that's the shit that you want because that's what you care about.

197
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,480
It's fucking legs because you're 40 years old and your baby more.

198
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,040
You make Italy sound like the Anor Londo of Europe, where it's like

199
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,720
everywhere is supposed to go there is the coolest place and it is cool.

200
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
But I kind of wish you could wander around a lot more and you weren't

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
kind of strung through a little bit.

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Well, the problem there, I'll give you real quick.

203
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm just noticing I don't I don't need to rehash or anything.

204
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,920
But your description of what to do in Italy reminds me of my recent trip to

205
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
Hawaii and I think the reason I had such a wonderful magnificent time

206
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,880
the whole time was because I got to go wherever I wanted to go

207
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,760
because I am an adult unlike you and I paid for it myself unlike you.

208
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,440
So I think this is the distinction here.

209
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
Yeah, I was empowered to do whatever I wanted.

210
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,320
That's like what she said.

211
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,760
And for what it's worth, 50 year olds are Gen Xers.

212
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,040
But for that generation, they very much are like they go to the place

213
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,640
to go see the thing they've already heard of.

214
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,680
And to me, like what she said, yeah, it's like if I'm going there,

215
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,160
show me the part of Italy that I will not get in a brochure, you know,

216
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
show me the part that looks like crazy and real.

217
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,640
This story perfectly encapsulates what I'm talking about.

218
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,400
It's just one day we were driving and we saw a little beach.

219
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
It was a crazy cliffside.

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,800
I took videos of it.

221
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,520
They're on my Instagram and stuff.

222
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,760
But like that day, we couldn't go there because we were rushing off somewhere else.

223
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm like, I don't care about anything else on this island.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,280
I want to go there.

225
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,760
And then the day we were leaving when we had spare time, I'm like, fuck everything else.

226
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,480
We're going to that one place and we went there and it was the best time there.

227
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,240
I got to go there.

228
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,400
I fulfilled my personal little, whatever, self determination dreams.

229
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,280
It was awesome.

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
And I felt great about it.

231
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,160
And I didn't have to miss that on anything.

232
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah, you know, that's the good.

233
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,880
I went to a county fair just yesterday and after having an.

234
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,960
Oh, my God, DeVu County fairs are like a glimpse into like, like, like all the

235
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,000
media from other countries talking about how Americans are retarded, easily

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,920
dissuaded and how commercials brainwash you.

237
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
You don't believe it.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,440
And then you go to a county fair and you recognize that your culture is fucking

239
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,800
funny poison.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,160
American culture is poison.

241
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,320
I can.

242
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,120
I've only been.

243
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,880
I've only noticed that.

244
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,960
What is a county fair?

245
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,160
It's just a bunch of fucking country shit.

246
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,480
Right.

247
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,640
So this one had, you know, food.

248
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,120
Nothing wrong with.

249
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,280
Like, like, like really on like, like it's that kind of like really greasy

250
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,600
food where you can, you can taste the flavor of all the unhygienic cooking

251
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,560
conditions, which really give it that flavor similar to catching.

252
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,680
No, like, what?

253
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,320
So like, what?

254
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,080
Similar to how you catch a fish that was that was that swam around

255
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
deep in the dirtiest parts of the ocean.

256
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,320
You can just taste every single microfiber of that six pack plastic container

257
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,040
that it ate in its lifetime.

258
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,840
It's the same kind of thing.

259
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,680
It's like, wow, this corn dog, you know, this corn dog was like like a dollar

260
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,760
fifty or two dollars, but it was cooked on a fryer that has like more

261
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
crufty gunk than it has meat.

262
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
So clearly that's personality.

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Clearly that's where all the flavors coming from, right?

264
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,120
So it's also got a bunch of animals.

265
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,160
You mostly just look at their butts because all the cows are turned away from

266
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,880
you, but the animals are mostly they are not to be gawked at by the passersby,

267
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,120
but mostly to be evaluated for which cow is the best, like professionals

268
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
come in and give it a ranking and shit, that kind of thing.

269
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,880
Like who grew the best fucking cow, who grew the best goat?

270
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,440
But the regular civilians can check it out, too, and be like, oh, cool.

271
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,480
Oh, so it's like that those things in cartoons, where it's always like the

272
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
biggest comequat contest or whatever.

273
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,880
Like, yeah, I kind of like that.

274
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
But, you know, not not come.

275
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,080
It's a lot less engaged.

276
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,160
And then they have some rides, some real shitty rickety, you know,

277
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,400
fairgrounds type rides that they installed in like three hours.

278
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,840
It's stuff like Disneyland or like Nautsbury Farm

279
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,560
and you have that your pussy fur that's like, I don't want to ride the roller coaster.

280
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
It's always easy to be like, listen,

281
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,200
it's way more expensive for these people to have you live.

282
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,560
That's how I convince people to go on roller coaster.

283
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,920
It's because they're going to have to do a ton of paperwork if you die.

284
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,440
So they're going to make this ride way safe.

285
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,120
They're going to make this ride as safe as possible so that you don't die.

286
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,840
But it fares, I really don't feel like that.

287
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,920
I feel like they don't care and they just feel like they die.

288
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,760
He was laying down on part of the steel of the ferris wheel with I shit,

289
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,480
you know, like all the mechanisms and gears and like bending and like

290
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,120
prolapsing steel that was like moving in a circle for fucking inches away

291
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,840
from his head and his shoulder.

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,400
He found the exact leaning position with which to not be immediately

293
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,280
instantly mutilated by the machine so that he could be as depression as possible.

294
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,840
I OK, I need to fully illustrate.

295
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,040
Davoo, Davoo, does your county fair look like this?

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,120
This picture that I'm up on right now and I'm up in the show notes.

297
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,480
It's it's fucking upland right now because my my pretty similar.

298
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Although this one is way more populated and yeah.

299
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,560
OK, although yours is a little bit less white is.

300
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,280
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of Asians in the Diego.

301
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
Anyway, my country fair is shit food,

302
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,120
like unbelievably terrible food for 10 or $11 each.

303
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
You should get a little corn dog over there.

304
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,520
That corn dog probably costs like six.

305
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,320
That's why I never go to these things.

306
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
It's like like vomit.

307
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,040
There's everything is so expensive and none of it's worth anything.

308
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,640
Exactly.

309
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,720
Look at the graphic design.

310
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,560
Wall to fucking wall.

311
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
You have the most fucking disgusting,

312
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,560
horrible, unappetizing nightmare fucking Photoshop

313
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
of nightmares on either fucking side of you.

314
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
And they all cost a thousand dollars.

315
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
You there's terrible rights.

316
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,800
But here's the thing.

317
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,000
If it was just that, I would think, haha, like, you know, like shit food.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,600
This is really entertaining.

319
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,320
But here's the thing.

320
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,960
Here's the most insidious thing about the county fairs is like,

321
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,920
I guess I'm going to call them the exhibition halls.

322
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,200
You guys have been like, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

323
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,040
We had one of those, too.

324
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,680
Imagine if that.

325
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,080
But instead of like, you know, like, like, like grassroots fucking,

326
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,280
you know, furry porn artists who you want to commission, you want to support going on.

327
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,960
It's like weird, bum, fucking conspiracy theory.

328
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,760
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, get this sleeve for your wallet.

329
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,800
So when you go through the airports, you know, your soul.

330
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,200
That's the kind of shit.

331
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
It's stuff like that.

332
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,120
And like hot tubs and just a bunch of scammy, old fucking white people.

333
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,920
Shit that they all have greeters for and they're all they're all like, you walk by.

334
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
OK, here's a real fucking thing that was literally said to me in real life.

335
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Not not fucking VR chat, not second life.

336
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,040
This is in real life.

337
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,480
I got dipping dots because I'm fat and I wanted to be better because I wanted to be brainwashed.

338
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,400
And so I got dipping dots and I walked by a greeter who who who was like,

339
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,840
just like he had just some fucking broom and he wanted to pedal it like it was the super broom.

340
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,080
And he and he and he and I walked by and he said, all right, you got the dipping dots.

341
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,840
Oh, you got to get the broom.

342
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,640
What's the segue there?

343
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,320
What are you trying to accomplish?

344
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm not going to get your room.

345
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,040
I have no reason to what was called a commercial center or whatever.

346
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,680
It was in a chilled out building.

347
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
It was in a building with air conditioning.

348
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,360
So went there and it's just a bunch of booths of people peddling their their their city wide wares.

349
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,400
So there was like the there was like a little booth for like the hearing center

350
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,160
where you can go in and get a test for how good your hearing is to see if you need hearing aids.

351
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,920
There was a someone running for some Democrat office in the city,

352
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,360
someone running for some Republican office in the city.

353
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,600
There was a gaming booth for like magic and shit.

354
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,400
It seems like they're opening up a gaming booth, but didn't look like it would be that good.

355
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,120
And there was there was like a power and light building or just booth.

356
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,640
But then there was also a pro life booth.

357
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,920
So we checked that one out, right?

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,800
It has a little CG like movie playing on the screen of like of a fetus growing over time.

359
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,440
No.

360
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,320
And it had three like like other models of fetuses at different stages of development.

361
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,040
Like here's the 12 weeks, here's the 15 weeks, right?

362
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,600
It had pamphlets being like abortion, a lifetime of regret, that kind of thing.

363
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
And that's cool.

364
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,840
Show me a fully grown baby that I can slam dunk into the trash can.

365
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,080
There was there was also we actually took this little flyer showing the number of sexual

366
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
partners you have in a 10 year span.

367
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,400
And then it's like it has a little algorithm to calculate the number of people all with

368
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,960
potential STDs on their junks that you have now exposed yourself to.

369
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,440
And based on its own algorithm, if you have had 10 distinct sexual partners in the last

370
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,880
decade, then you have exposed yourself to 65,143 people or something like that.

371
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
I don't know how the fucking numbers work.

372
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,240
They did some math there for like, I don't know, number of sex people have probably.

373
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,200
I mean, we all have to assume that everyone who you fucked has fucked as many people as

374
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,080
you have before you fucked them.

375
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480
I don't I don't get it.

376
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
It there might be some logic to it.

377
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,520
We also took a pencil.

378
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,240
It said life is precious.

379
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,600
So I figure any time I'm going to like tell someone to not get an abortion, I'll write

380
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
it in that pencil.

381
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,240
And of course, and so my fiance, she she does a very smart thing of like making her point

382
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,440
but getting an abortion, she says.

383
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,880
So how what kind of efforts are you guys taking to like, you know, support women who

384
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,520
like don't get the abortion and now don't have any like safety networks and like old

385
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,000
ass motherfucking woman, right, who probably who who presumably based on those algorithms

386
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,320
must have like joined the fucking faith after being in an orgy of 20 people and is now how

387
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,360
she forever perceives all sexual activity to be, you know, like 40 years ago or something.

388
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,040
Anyway, she's like, oh, well, you know, a little bit helping helping some women with

389
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,840
with single moms, you know, but we do it a bit depends on the town.

390
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,640
Why do they why do they act so cowardly?

391
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Why don't they say we don't fuck them?

392
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,640
But that's what I would say if I were them.

393
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,040
I mean, stick to your principles.

394
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,560
Just take every CG artist you are fucking hiring to animate all the fallopian tubes and then

395
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,520
spend that money on some fucking like, you know, like driving them to the booth.

396
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,040
Fuck that.

397
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,600
I need work.

398
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,080
I really want to know.

399
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,680
I want to know who ever is going to stand in front of that fucking movie and be like,

400
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,480
oh, my God, you're right.

401
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,360
You know, it was like really like retro style 3D animation.

402
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,640
It reminded me of 3D pipes, like watching the fallopian tubes like grow and shit.

403
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,280
It was just like 3D pipes on Windows 95.

404
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,760
Whoa, that one convinced me.

405
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,240
OK, guys, here's a question for you.

406
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,600
Is it abortion or go a lifetime of eternal damnation?

407
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,920
If you crush a fruit before it's right, oh, shit.

408
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,960
Is it? I mean, it's at that point, it wouldn't be just killing a child.

409
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,560
Well, if you if you eat a seed, you're aborting of a potential fruit.

410
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,960
In this metaphor, the tree would be like the child.

411
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
A fruit is like an an egg or like a seed or whatever.

412
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, yeah, fruits are not a lot.

413
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,720
Fruits are not like the actual product.

414
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,640
They're they're the containers.

415
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,760
They don't have fruit.

416
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,120
We deliver the seeds.

417
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,160
Are they not plants?

418
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,960
Fruits are there to like provide nutrients for the seed when they go in the

419
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,680
satisfaction to humans.

420
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,760
Yeah, or like when animals eat.

421
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,240
It's the same reason why semen taste so good.

422
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,600
It's so that they'll spread it around and, you know, try it out, ladies.

423
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,840
Hey, man, that's sigh of defeat.

424
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,360
There's there's semen cookbooks out there and shit.

425
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
There sure are. There sure are.

426
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,920
I did not want to know that.

427
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,480
Oh, oh, shit.

428
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,040
I didn't I didn't finish my fucking call that post.

429
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,760
I saw that the first part of it is don't go to shit.

430
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,960
And yeah, I have an actual reason to go like another thing just to quickly

431
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,160
illustrate that again, there's a building.

432
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,600
There's a cathedral in Florence called the Duomo.

433
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,080
And I have no fucking clue what's inside this building.

434
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,200
It looks pretty from the outside.

435
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,360
I sketched my sketchbook.

436
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,600
It was nice.

437
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,840
But my mom for a while was like, we got to go inside the Duomo.

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,120
And then I finally just asked her like five or six times

439
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
like of her saying that we got to.

440
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
I said, what's inside that you want to see?

441
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,200
And she was like, uh, it's called the Duomo, dude.

442
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,000
I really think and I know I've said this a couple of years.

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,400
Building it's it's you want to go inside the Duomo

444
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,040
to relive Assassin's Creed, too, because it's the same building

445
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,480
that you can go inside and is like, oh, I remember jumping up that painting.

446
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,440
Yeah, dude, no, I really anyway,

447
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,040
that the second the second part of of why your favorite

448
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,120
problematic lean tower of pizza is because around all the shit around

449
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,600
the fucking Duomo around, well, actually, the Duomo was pretty good,

450
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,240
but around like the Colosseum around the Vatican, all that kind of shit.

451
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,320
They know that if you're coming here, you're obviously brain dead.

452
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,840
You obviously have no fucking wits about you

453
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,520
and you can easily be persuaded to do whatever these people want you to do.

454
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,320
So around around the fucking lean tower of pizza,

455
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,400
there's not that authentic Italian food that you came to fucking Italy for.

456
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,840
There's none of that shit.

457
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,600
There's fucking menus in English.

458
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,920
That's how you fucking know.

459
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Here's how you know if a fucking restaurant would be bad in Italy,

460
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,040
is if it's one in English or if it has like pictures of it

461
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,440
or any stuff like that, like you can just tell.

462
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,720
You can tell something's going to be if it has like pictures

463
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,880
of the food that it has, because they know people have time to read.

464
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,680
So they say, oh, he's just spaghetti looks like this.

465
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,680
As soon as you were going to Italy, it reminded me of an NPR story.

466
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,840
I heard there's this guy who just he's like the food reporter for NPR.

467
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,080
And he said on Italy specifically, he said, the way you know

468
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,680
that you're going to a good, real, real Nibba place in Italy is to

469
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,120
you only want to go to places that use catch of the day,

470
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,760
that have like a catch of the day and have a handwritten menu on the door.

471
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
It's like a family place, because that's the fresh shit.

472
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,840
And that's the real shit.

473
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,240
And our stereo.

474
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Oh, yeah, that's like family restaurant.

475
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,080
So you got terrible fucking Disneyland to your food.

476
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,200
Side note, by the way, Disneyland has the worst food imaginable.

477
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
I've been there recently.

478
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,840
All of their food is it's like country fair food.

479
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,520
It's like terrible and like ten dollars.

480
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,920
Anyway, it has like Disneyland to your food.

481
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,320
Absolutely terrible.

482
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,880
And it's not like, you know, oh, just the food's bad.

483
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,040
Everything around is so fucking fake and sterile.

484
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,320
None of it is authentic Italian shit.

485
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,840
It's all fucking tourist trap bullshit.

486
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,400
You go to lean tower pizza because you want to experience, you know,

487
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,280
assumably, you want to experience Italian architecture.

488
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,240
You want to experience romantic architecture.

489
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,440
And then you look to the sideline tower pizza and you see a fucking guy

490
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,040
wrangling a horse and a guy in a fucking sandwich.

491
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,360
Penini outfit next to him.

492
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,040
You see them fucking dance like they're in some very

493
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,960
weird, you hear them screaming Italian words to try and get to donut.

494
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,600
Got it. Look at this.

495
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,200
This is like a lean tower pizza with the sandwich man.

496
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,200
Oh, God, I see this.

497
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,440
It's like that at pretty much all of the like major tourist attractions around the world.

498
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,880
Like if you go to Egypt or something, you know, right next to the right outside

499
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,560
the the like range of the photograph of the like if you literally turned your

500
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,760
camera like 30 degrees to the side and just be like bam stalls, you know, right.

501
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
I remember there was a whole cracked article about that.

502
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,160
They like showed you all the famous landmarks that people go to.

503
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,000
And they showed you, you know, the typical tourist attraction

504
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,840
pamphlet photographs, and then they showed you the photos like right next to it.

505
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,400
And it's just it's crowded with fucking people, you know, what's really funny

506
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,840
about that to me is that like people then go there and they take their own

507
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,880
pictures of the thing and they try to they try to excise all the extra shit.

508
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,240
And I'm like, to me, that's the most interesting and funny part.

509
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,480
Like if I was going to take a picture of the pyramid, I would want to capture

510
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,680
all of that in it because that is fucking hilarious.

511
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,720
I remember first becoming really cognizant of how repulsive

512
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,920
smartphone culture has turned the human genome into when there was this

513
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,840
like light news story going around about this flight attendant lady

514
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,880
who lost her shit mid-flight and like probably had like only like two hours

515
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,120
of sleep over the course of two days and she just like started screaming

516
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,520
fucking 9000 feet up in the air, right?

517
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,960
And the news, you know, the news broadcasts this phone recording

518
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,080
that someone took and it's just her screaming, right?

519
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,000
But what was more interesting to me about the true nature of the human condition

520
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,960
is that this wasn't the only person filming in between the like the frame

521
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,280
of this camera and the woman in the middle screaming.

522
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,200
There are at least 12, probably 20 other fucking stupid

523
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,320
cockney hands jutting out, holding their phone and also recording.

524
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,280
So everyone has decided to elect this poor woman, a fucking paparazzi

525
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,080
rape in the eyes of human society to turn her into a celebrity,

526
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,200
but only with the negative gossipy elements without any of the fame or respect.

527
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,800
That is what and then every single person thought fame or respect

528
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,440
does she deserve as a flight attendant freaking out on a plane?

529
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,240
Like having a mental breakdown, maybe she needs help wrong here.

530
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,320
Exactly. Maybe she doesn't need to be filmed by 20 fucking people

531
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,000
and every single person who decided to put up their fucking camera.

532
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,920
You only saw one person's phones.

533
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
Like, what's the difference?

534
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,000
Like only one is all it took, right?

535
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,840
But like everyone now knows, well, everyone else here is recording it.

536
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,920
I would my own recording that way.

537
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,080
Sometimes when I'm looking back to me about it, like I'll go to a concert

538
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,960
and there'll be like 30 people with their phones out recording the concert.

539
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,360
And I'm like, you're at the concert.

540
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,080
Like, what are you going to do with this recording with shitty audio and shitty visuals?

541
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,200
Like, are you going to post this on social media?

542
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,880
You see that 30 other people are recording it.

543
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,360
So like let the guy with the good angle do the recording

544
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
and let him post it on YouTube and the rest of you fucking enjoy the show.

545
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,920
I want to prove that you went there.

546
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,840
I want to prove to my friends on Facebook that I'm cool.

547
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,800
If you were to pull out your camera and take one little picture

548
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,280
and be like, there you go. I was at the show. Fine.

549
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,520
I see people who will sit there and be recording the whole fucking time.

550
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,920
Like, or like whichever song they like, they have to record that song.

551
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,600
And it's like, it's going to sound like dick and you know it.

552
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,840
Just just experience it.

553
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,920
You're here at the show watching every time I've done it myself.

554
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,400
I look back and think, well, I'm never going to go back and watch it.

555
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,640
And, you know, and but it's not even just that you won't go back and watch it.

556
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,520
It's that if you spend the whole time that you could be watching it, filming it.

557
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,160
That means at no point did you watch the show.

558
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,960
You have watched your camera and then you've watched your camera again in the future.

559
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,480
So the only version you've ever taken in is a shit version

560
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,800
and as opposed to the actual real show.

561
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,520
And this is what I was getting to with talking about the fare that I went to

562
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,840
yesterday, because every once in a while, when I get out of the house to do a thing,

563
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,400
you know, to do an activity, I'm reminded of how not so different it is on the internet.

564
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,920
You know, right now I'm looking at my screen and I see a thumbnail and a title.

565
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,240
107 facts about Nintendo's Princess Peach by the super coin crew.

566
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,720
1.3 million views and the re and it's not actually all that weird

567
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,760
that people waste their lives on YouTube so much because all you can do is go

568
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,320
outside and waste your life while also spending money.

569
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,560
It's the only other alternative.

570
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,240
All the fucking non millennials who go places and quote unquote do things

571
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,960
don't have fucking anything to do.

572
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,360
No one on this goddamn earth has a sense of purpose in life and we're all faking it.

573
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,160
90 percent of all economic transactions are bullshit in which the consumer is

574
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,280
trying to kid themselves into there being a point at the fucking fair.

575
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,480
There was a stall.

576
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,560
My fiance says, oh, we got to buy at least one thing at the fair.

577
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,280
So there's a stall that I used to have that.

578
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,400
Oh, that's a fucking economic equivalent.

579
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,280
If we got to go, yeah, I used to I used to have that.

580
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,160
Like every time we would go to like a zoo or like anything that had a gift shop.

581
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,120
I was like, well, I got to have a souvenir.

582
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,720
I got to have like something and I look around and I or even though I don't buy

583
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,160
anything from any gift shop anymore, I still look around to see just just in

584
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,640
case that there is something cool.

585
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,160
The stall.

586
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,440
They never.

587
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,040
I learned my lesson.

588
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,680
I personally just would want to find that this stall consisted.

589
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,640
50 percent of this stall was like a bunch of like $15 like pocket watches

590
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,080
that they probably like whoever ran this stall probably like has some sort of

591
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,760
warehouse or something.

592
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,960
They're just trying to get rid of some shit.

593
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,320
Right.

594
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,240
And then the other 50 percent is stuff that you would literally trade in at a

595
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,880
Chuck E cheese for 10 tickets that you've won like socks or two stint rings

596
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,040
made of plastic.

597
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,120
And I looked at this and I thought this is the biggest.

598
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,240
We have Amazon.com, you know, we can buy random things.

599
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,440
We don't need like this.

600
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,200
All this shitty tat has no bearing on the actual fare.

601
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,360
It doesn't have the dignity of being homemade and full of fucking bacteria like

602
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,680
the corn dogs do, where it at least makes sense.

603
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,680
You're not going to be able to get that at fucking at Sonic, right?

604
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,400
But but this is just shit that you got out of a fucking box.

605
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,800
Well, my family, I want to say what my family does, they buy like little

606
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,960
magnets of pictures of the place they went to as it's like, oh yeah, I went there

607
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,920
sort of thing.

608
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,360
Well, you know what, guys, I like I just brought up how much I love my

609
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,200
Radcon three pin at the beginning of this.

610
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,200
It's not that the pin is valuable.

611
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,320
It's the memories and what like if I didn't have this pin, I would think

612
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,480
about how much I loved Radcon three a lot less.

613
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
This is actually a very beneficial thing in my life.

614
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,480
That's that's one thing.

615
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,280
But like, I think that the difference is with Radcon three, you only got one

616
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,360
of those pins, if you actually helped to make it even fucking possible.

617
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,000
True, like so when you go to random, random place A and you just buy

618
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,400
some insanely overpriced thing that is just, you know, that's that literally

619
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,360
anyone who's been there could have had.

620
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,320
It's like, I understand that maybe looking at it will make you remember

621
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,920
that experience, but I feel like instead of doing that, you should just go

622
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,560
have another experience.

623
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,480
It's not it's not that you don't need to buy anything.

624
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,080
Like I for the last, I think like eight years or something, I've had this

625
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,360
journal that I bring to every holiday event and radcons.

626
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,320
And I write down like at the end of every day, something that happened.

627
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,280
And the purpose of that is to jog my memory when I read it back like, oh,

628
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,840
yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, I love Redcon.

629
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,840
And like that is my version of like whatever like souvenir I may have had

630
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,400
from from any holiday.

631
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,240
It's so much more effective as well, because it's my own handwriting.

632
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,040
It's my own thing.

633
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,680
Sure. But some people just want to save time by just buying some of it.

634
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,480
It'll do that.

635
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,720
I know. But like, I think it's it's worse.

636
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,200
I think it's not as effective.

637
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,160
Here's the thing.

638
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,360
The difference between the Redcon pin and some shitty fucking little

639
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,000
figurine that you could get some shitty, Florence and pink.

640
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,440
Michelangelo's David, you could buy at the lean to her piece, even though

641
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,560
it's not even the same fucking city.

642
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,360
The difference between that is that with the Redcon three pin,

643
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,640
it's that you were given that you were given that because again, like

644
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,840
did you said you're a part of it, but you were given that and that symbolizes

645
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,920
a thing that just happened naturally in the sense that like you are at Redcon

646
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,920
three, you have this pin to signify it when you go in and specifically buy

647
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,840
something for the purpose of remembering, you're not going to remember

648
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,560
the entirety of the trip that you've just been on.

649
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,200
You're going to remember the memory of you buying that pin.

650
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,280
The best souvenir of you having like a memory, like a memory jogging item is

651
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,680
the stuff that just will naturally have like, for instance, I want this legendary

652
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,080
food tour that I will explain in great detail later that changed my life.

653
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,120
And the souvenir I have to remember that is not some little fucking, you know,

654
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
a little figurine that I got along the way.

655
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,800
It's the business card of the of the of the guy of my food tour guide.

656
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,560
That's not something that I bought.

657
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,480
It's just something that naturally occurred and that's far more impactful

658
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,800
to me than making a conscious decision.

659
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,040
Oh, I will remember this.

660
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,440
I feel like that's not something that you can actually you can actually

661
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
hear. I hear your point.

662
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,040
I hear your point. But like, for example, there is this photograph that's

663
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,200
I think it's sitting in my bedroom right now of of me and Michelle.

664
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,240
When we did, we went to just a Korean restaurant and it was and we just had

665
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,760
like delayed. She had a Polaroid camera and just like offered to take a picture

666
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
of us and she did. And so we just got that picture and like, that's great.

667
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,080
If she'd given us like, I don't know, just like a little knickknack to remember

668
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,640
it, that'd be fine. But like, it's the same kind of thing.

669
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,360
It's like the same. I think I think there's I feel like that still fits into

670
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,160
what I'm saying. I don't understand the distinction.

671
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,040
Like you're talking about how like your your experience of going to Leading

672
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,560
Tower of Pisa is like inauthentic.

673
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,840
But you really did go and you really did have some experience.

674
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,240
No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

675
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
What's your point? That's not even trying to say that if you buy,

676
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,800
if you go out of your way to purchase a trinket,

677
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
then that is it's it's like you force that into the memory.

678
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
You feel like going there.

679
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,680
Exactly. Exactly. Oh, that's perfect.

680
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,680
I got to go on about my parents because my parents travel all the time

681
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,400
and they always show something.

682
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,160
They they do they do like all of it.

683
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,200
They do every possible thing because not only do they go and they get a tattoo

684
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,960
everywhere they go, so they'll get matching tattoos that sort of in some way

685
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,520
represent where they've been. How much available skin do they have?

686
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,440
Then they also buy a bunch of like bullshit.

687
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,000
But the weirdest part is that they buy a bunch of shit for us.

688
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,120
Like they'll buy they'll go to a souvenir shop and they'll buy things for me

689
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,160
and Victor and Shade and then they'll give them to us and I'll be like,

690
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,280
this means literally nothing to me because I did not go to this place.

691
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,480
And this thing you bought like what does this commemorate that you went somewhere?

692
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Like, yeah, I'll be sure to look at this and remember that you went to Mexico,

693
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,480
you know, and all of those things go straight into my closet

694
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,280
because they're all fucking useless and they mean nothing to me.

695
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,880
Well, they buy those for themselves to give as a gift because the people like giving

696
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,480
right. And I was just like, I don't know why you do this because they spend a lot

697
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,960
of money buying like random fucking trinkets that are again mean nothing.

698
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,520
I want to check. They want to be there is like it's in the thing,

699
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
at least with my family.

700
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,160
There is a custom to sort of like bring back gifts or souvenirs from wherever

701
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,720
you go and travel, even if like, you know, all you did was travel to like,

702
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,400
I don't know, a different town, not necessarily for any sort of leisurely

703
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
reason, just, you know, for business or whatever.

704
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,080
It's sort of like a bit of a custom and it's just kind of like tradition.

705
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,000
It's to be nice and like not doing it.

706
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
I hate the tradition. I think that tradition is evil and propagated by this business.

707
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
But it doesn't do it. You'll be considered rude.

708
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,960
That's a problem. That is a huge problem because like they brought me home one time,

709
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,880
like like a hard rock cafe, like like wooden miniature guitar that like sits on a little

710
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,680
stand. And I'm like, you paid $20 for this thing that must have costed them 30 cents to produce.

711
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,920
And it means nothing to me. So like, why have you done this?

712
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,160
In Italy, there are hard rock cafe stores and no restaurant. There are just the,

713
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,520
there are just hard rock cafe is the worst thing that exists because it's literally,

714
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,680
it is just its own hype. There is nothing it symbolizes or represents except for itself.

715
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,400
It is a place that you go to buy things that say hard rock cafe on them and then say,

716
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,880
I went to a hard rock cafe in wherever and it's like, who cares? They're literally everywhere.

717
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,360
It's not special. We've all been to one.

718
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,800
What's a hard rock cafe? It's a it's a cafe that's like

719
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,440
in most major cities have one and it'll be like a place. It's just a fucking restaurant that like

720
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,480
because it exists everywhere, they play rock and roll music and I guess at some point in the 50s,

721
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,760
rock and roll bands had eaten at them and therefore they like have posters of everyone

722
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,160
who's ever been famous and eaten there. So yeah, famous for being famous is essentially what it is

723
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,120
at this point. Yeah, like, yeah. Well, like Munchie said, there's they have stores for it without even

724
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,320
the cafe. So like at that point, it's just a it's just a fucking it's just like this weird

725
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,680
meta meme that just hacks people's brains about what is a famous. I know there's people in my

726
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,760
family who will be like, oh, I've gone to the hard rock in every city and I've got like a thing from

727
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,840
every hard rock cafe. And I'm just like, why? Like why have if you went to a if I went to a foreign

728
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:22,640
country, why would I go to an American store and their installation within that foreign country?

729
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,440
Oh, oh my god, that's such a big thing. There are so many people that go to like, oh, you know, I

730
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,840
asked one of you like a McDonald's, you know, because it's familiar when I'm in Italy. Are you

731
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:38,160
fucking literally like, is there a note? Yeah, are you not alive? This is yeah, like, like, how could

732
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,080
you be that stupid as to want to get something that's familiar when you're specifically in a

733
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,560
place for the purpose of being in. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, I mean, I assume American tourists are

734
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,640
worse than than other places. I guess I guess English tourists are also bad. But like, like,

735
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,800
no, but like, um, yeah, I don't the the the idea of like going to a place, just to say that you

736
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,720
went there to your friends, like, you know, your baby boomer friends, your Gen X, your friends,

737
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,000
you know, everyone has kids. And finally, the kids are grown up enough so that you can go on

738
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,280
holidays or you drag your kids on holidays that they don't want to go on to really, you know,

739
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,440
just just to see the sights and to do all these things. And they do them because they're advertised

740
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,880
as a thing to do. And they don't have the time in their lives to really think about whether or

741
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,600
not it's a good idea. They're just like, ah, I'm getting old, I've got kids, I haven't had a chance

742
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,320
to live my life. I want to go to all these places that I've known so much about lack of proper

743
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,760
reflection on what actually makes you enjoy your life better. You know, when I realize the more

744
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,320
adult I get and the more prices I observe, like the actual like things that will actually make

745
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:54,160
your life significantly better are often a lot cheaper than very expensive things that have

746
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,600
nothing but hype behind them. I've observed that like people going on trips is like such a huge

747
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,240
time and money sink. And it's like you have to take time away from work. So that's already a

748
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,320
bunch of money that you're potentially losing unless you're on vacation. Then you've got to spend

749
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,520
all the money for the trip, like just getting there, staying there, everything around wherever

750
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,040
you're staying is more expensive than it would be normally. Every like just everything is so much

751
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,120
money. But then also nobody thinks about the fact that, hey, you're going to a foreign country.

752
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,760
Guess what? You don't have immunities to all the viruses that are naturally in the air there. So

753
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,680
you always get sick and then like someone gets pissed off because they're just not in a good mood.

754
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,360
Maybe the weather is not exactly what you expected it to be there. So like your family ends up fighting

755
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,440
about where they're going to go while they're in the town. Oh yeah. Oh my god. It's just nobody like

756
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,040
I don't understand how people can experience that and then be like now we're going to go to the next

757
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:01,920
one. None of these were a problem on my recent vacation because I am an adult and I kind of learned

758
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,480
that from when I went to the Philippines because it was funny. When I went there, I stayed for a

759
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,320
month with ghost lighting in the middle of Manila, which is the capital city and it's not where white

760
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,040
people go. There were no white people. Generally people don't speak English. There is not tourist

761
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,440
attractions. There's nothing there for that type of person and people kept asking him like why the

762
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,640
hell are you showing him around Manila? Like why don't you take him to like the beaches and stuff

763
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,680
where people go and it's like because I come from Virginia Beach. The whole city is a tourist trap.

764
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,800
I already know. I already know what the game is. If you go to the beach in Virginia Beach,

765
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,280
it's just an endless series of super expensive hotels. The price at every restaurant, even though

766
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,520
it's the same restaurants that they have all throughout the city, everything's jacked up $1.50

767
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,080
there. You have to pay for parking. The Atlantic Ocean is a disgusting cesspool that there's no

768
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,680
reason to go see it. The only people who come to Virginia Beach are people from the Midwest or New

769
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,960
York who just want warm weather and the ocean and they don't realize that if you went to Miami or if

770
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:14,880
you went to Hawaii, it would be like a zillion times nicer. It's just a shit tourist trap,

771
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,840
but people come there constantly and the city's whole fucking economy is based on that. It's like

772
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,240
I have nothing but cynicism for tourist places, but going to Manila, nothing there was like

773
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,160
anything I'd seen before. First of all, there is no green anywhere in the fucking city. It was like,

774
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,720
whoa, this is a fucking concrete jungle. There's billboards everywhere, every square inch of

775
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,400
cities. It's literally a fucking cyberpunk dystopia. All the food is something I've never had before.

776
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,120
There's all these weird little stalls all over the place of people just selling shit they made in

777
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:57,680
their fucking backyard that makes you sick and it costs $0.50 and you're like, hell yeah, this is

778
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:05,440
the life you're supposed to be living. Yeah, Italy is famous not because they built giant

779
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,480
shit out of marble, but because they killed everyone in the world, stole all of their marble,

780
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,800
and turned it into cool ass buildings. In other words, it's not the opulence or the fancieness,

781
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,200
it's the fucking violence and the death. It's the fucking, it's the goddamn plagues that make some

782
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,480
of these European landmarks interesting. You gotta go to that statue of the rape of the

783
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,480
Savian woman or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw it in Gunslinger Girl.

784
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,760
Oh God. It's the same way that you would get. We probably got more.

785
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,800
Ostensibly to experience an event, but then they just block it with their phone because they

786
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,080
only ever understand how to experience an event by proxy. You can only go to an ancient town that

787
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:58,160
was famous for a big war a thousand years ago by proxy, but you can right now experience the

788
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,280
mythology being crafted right now, which is to say, go to McDonald's and watch all the depressed

789
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,000
fat people. This is the culture as it is. There's like these, there's like this group of like 40

790
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,640
something super autist guys who go to this McDonald's and like, like, you know, they're like

791
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,280
upper, mid functioning and like that's, this is the American mythology being crafted right now.

792
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,320
I'm really glad you brought up McDonald's because I, you might have heard me talk about this way

793
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,640
back in the day on like Digibro never shuts up or something that I used to, this thing Munchy's

794
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,400
describing, I used to rant about all the time as the experience of going behind a McDonald's,

795
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,360
because when I was like 16, one time I was just like hanging out behind a McDonald's and I realized

796
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,160
that I was in this weird parking lot that is in the middle of town, like where I always am,

797
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,720
but I just never like stopped and looked at it and thought about it and I did and I was like,

798
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,160
this is super interesting that like this spot exists and no one thinks about it and it's just

799
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,280
here. What's really cool is that me and, me and Nikki, me and Cole are the only people in this

800
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,800
town who don't have a car, uh, fucking people at the checkout ladies are starting to comment on the

801
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,360
fact that we walk around everywhere. See, my mentality was, well, we're within walking distance

802
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,080
of like two different grocery stores and two different restaurants so, and a general department

803
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,360
store, so we're basically fine, we don't need a car, but then as you notice the distinct lack of

804
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,480
anyone else on the sidewalk, it's like, oh right, everyone else either has friends or has to drive

805
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,480
to their job, right? So we're like the only fucking people who are like walking around with fucking

806
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,920
grocery bags, right? So we're being urbanized in a suburban town. The point is, we've gotten a really

807
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,760
close-up look at every single like fragment of dilapidated concrete, right? Uh, and like, like

808
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,720
all cool, right? Yeah, so like, they're like, I just don't understand people's priorities that,

809
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,800
sorry for cutting you off, but I don't understand the priority of like, oh, the leaning tower of

810
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,400
pizza, we got to see that, and I'm like, why is that building more interesting than this building

811
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,440
down the block, you know, that is also cool. Okay, one path we can take to get to a certain

812
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,320
coffee shop is, you know, I've seen a lot of leading buildings that weren't famous, they were just

813
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,800
concerning, and people live in those ones, so they're way more exciting. So like,

814
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,600
they're about to topple over, but they never do. Maybe because it's all so big.

815
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,400
Yeah, that's pretty big. You know, I've seen some big buildings. One cool path that we have is,

816
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,480
we go out to McDonald's, out the back door, and there's a little parking lot there, but then

817
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,760
you sort of go to the left, and then you walk, you cut through the drive-thru lane, you get on a

818
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,640
little platform of concrete, and you jump into this little space between two bushes, and now you're

819
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,600
in the drive-thru area of a bank, and so you just sort of keep sneaking on through, assuming it's a

820
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,880
slow day, no one's there to like, gawk at you, and then boom, you've like taken a weird shortcut,

821
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,080
like through two different establishments, right? Pretty cool. If not for the fact that being mugged

822
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,640
was a possibility and a health risk, I would just go out in the middle of the night fucking behind

823
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,680
strip malls all the time. Like me, you, Nino, and Econ did that one time in Atlanta.

824
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,720
We did that because that's something I do. I tend to, if I'm near a big building, I always want

825
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,560
to see the back of it. And that time I felt safe, because as we said at the time, we have two white

826
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,040
people, one black guy, and one Asian guy, so I think we're pretty much safe from any discrimination.

827
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,600
No one will know what to do with this. You've got all the classes. You've got all the classes that

828
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,800
you can possibly have. Oh, properly structured like RPG party, yeah. Random interjection quickly.

829
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,880
I just, I want to say one of my favorite things I never get to do is take walks during the night

830
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,200
time, especially here where I'm in Lafayette, and it's just so quiet and empty, and I love it,

831
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,960
but I'm scared of walking alone. There's a reason why your fucking story inspired highly

832
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,440
background oriented fan art, because that's the real mythology that fucking Bethesda makes

833
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,400
a million dollars from a day. By the way, I want, I want to give you a red pill to the quick,

834
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,080
if you'll have me, brainwashed sheep. The long entire piece, I don't have to know this. It's

835
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:02,880
not just a tower, it's a bell tower. You know what it's a bell tower for? This right next to it

836
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,480
immediately way more interesting, detailed, and beautiful building that I'm seeing you right now.

837
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,520
This is right next to the entire piece, and no one gives a shit about it, even though it looks

838
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,440
really fucking pretty. Why, why does no one care about that? Everybody has to do the picture,

839
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,600
they have to do the thing with like, yeah, yeah, you can see them in this. I've seen like, I've seen

840
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,200
so many pictures of people doing like, like in large groups, like all over that bit of grass,

841
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,640
doing the, oh, I'm pushing it over, oh, I'm leaning on the leaning, oh, please take a picture of me.

842
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,560
Oh, I laugh every time. Dude, I, I, okay, one more thing about like random details are everywhere

843
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,000
in this fucking world, and I think I may have actually talked about this in the previous episode,

844
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,480
I don't know. Wait, before you say this, I just want to say we should start up a meme where we

845
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,360
all just go and take pictures of us doing the leaning tower thing next to random fucking buildings

846
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,280
and just like, flood the internet with it. Dogs all over locations. Oh, oh, dude, dude, my friend,

847
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,080
my friend Kyle, a notorious furry, and I've talked about multiple times on this show,

848
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,480
he does that, he went to Lincoln Monument and did that, and he wasn't even like,

849
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Did he do the famous pose of freeing the slaves at the Lincoln Monument?

850
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,680
I remember he did that. So he, it looked like he was just like at Lincoln's foot and pushing

851
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,800
at the middle of the wall. Dude, for some reason that reminded me, one of the things that happened

852
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,680
at the fair is that there was a rodeo going on, probably should have mentioned that, that would

853
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,920
really help set the tone for what kind of place it was. We didn't go to the rodeo, none of us wanted

854
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,800
to go, we didn't even see it, it was way off in the stadium, but you get one of those women singing

855
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,680
the fucking national anthem, and one of those renditions of it where you add three times as

856
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:52,640
many notes as are actually in the composition. They make it like eight fucking minutes. Anyway,

857
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,760
I sort of snickered at that, I just like politely, I just like jitly like muttered to, you know,

858
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,440
to Colvin, like, oh man, one of those versions where they add in like way more fucking notes,

859
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,240
right? And she's like, she doesn't want to like offend all the fucking conservative fags hanging

860
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,760
out there, right? When it's like, I'm not like shouting, I'm just minding my own business,

861
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,480
right? What's really funny is that even though we're way far away from the stadium, you can only

862
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,840
just hear it in the distance, all the fucking conservative fags are like, oh, oh, I guess we're

863
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,400
supposed to stand right here and hold our hand to our hearts because it's within earshot, right?

864
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,360
So they're all standing and they're all facing towards the fucking stadium. Like, yeah, this is

865
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,160
just how it works. I guess it's like, yeah. And I'm just like, whatever, I wanted to back away

866
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,040
from this area. So I just start walking away like the opposite direction, right? Intimidate.

867
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,440
She she's not putting her fucking hand to her heart, but she's like standing still because she

868
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,480
feels like she doesn't want to like stand out too much, even though it's like, you know, it's like

869
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,400
four different people here, like I'm up against the side. I'm not like walking right through them,

870
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,640
like pushing them aside. I'm just like walking over to the side. And she's like all upset at me.

871
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,520
She's like, no, don't don't draw attention to yourself. I'm like freaking out about it's causing

872
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,400
drawing more attention. Just fuck, let me fucking not respect America in peace. God damn it. So

873
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,080
anyway, okay, last thing about the Lapitation, right? So there is this park that I used to live near

874
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:21,440
and had like a river. This is like a real small park, probably only an average of 15 people go

875
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,760
here a day. It's not very big. But if you go out into like the distance, you kind of go off the

876
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:32,160
beaten path a bit. There was like a river, a small little small little stream. And on the stream,

877
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,520
there is one part where there used to be some sort of concrete sidewalk bridge to get you from

878
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,720
one side to the other. This sidewalk has now crumbled apart. It's now in several pieces. And

879
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,720
the pieces are just sort of sitting there at various slightly tilted angles, as the water rushes like

880
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,880
beside them and on top of them. And it is the most aesthetic thing ever. There was one piece of

881
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,280
concrete in particular that you could just sit down and lean against and you're sort of leaning

882
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,240
at this 15 degree angle. And it's just big enough for you to sort of just sit there and be perfectly

883
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,640
dry as a stream surrounds and engulfs you and then you can whip out a book and be literally the

884
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:17,840
greatest intellectual in America. And it's like this was free. This was not planned. This was all

885
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:25,760
this is emergent gameplay and vastly better. You know, something that's always a huge pleasant

886
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:32,080
surprise. Wait, am I still there? Yeah. Okay. Sorry. The way everyone just went quiet at once and I

887
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:40,080
wasn't ready for it. Oh yeah. Like sometimes you walk into a KFC and they'll just have like a bench

888
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,560
with a fucking Colonel Sanders statue arm going across it. And that is just as important as Rome.

889
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,880
Every time I see one of those, I'm just like how are there not like 70 people lined up to

890
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,960
sit on this bench because this is the most exciting thing I've ever seen. It's redefining the meaning

891
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,320
of the word seduction every time I see one. I mean, there's there's lots of there's lots of just

892
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,920
crazy interesting weird shit that's just around cities that because it doesn't have the longevity

893
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,560
or the like the history behind it isn't paid attention to. But like when we used to go to

894
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:18,160
Baltimore for Brony Khan and Otacon like that the whole strip the there's there's like a sort of

895
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,520
touristy road that's just like the one road of Baltimore that's nice becomes a total shit fuck

896
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,200
you can walk down from the convention to this little like Harbor area you can walk down there

897
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:36,160
and you turn like left and immediately you are raped. It's like a TSA line. Guys.

898
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,760
And yeah, do you remember that black guy who came up to us?

899
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,120
I can remember like 70 black guys who've come up to be in Baltimore.

900
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,040
The one who was like upset that someone called them the n-word. Is that what you're referring to?

901
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Yeah. Yeah. And then we all stood in a group around him and I think I filmed some of it where I

902
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,480
met up with you guys before we were friends and then and then and then you'd be part ways after

903
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,920
like 10 minutes and Ben was like oh well we should like drop him off at his hotel guys and you guys

904
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,400
were like okay and then I got it and I forgot to make a wrong turn so I had to do a U turn and

905
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,600
everyone was like a munchie get out of the car. Yeah, I remember that. Did you? I really like

906
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,240
when you brought up the Colonel Sanders thing. I don't think they have those around where I've

907
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,520
seen KFCs for a while. They're not common but I've seen a couple. They're probably fucking germ

908
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,480
magnets and considering it's KFC they're probably grease magnets but like think about this. Hold on

909
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,520
let me finish about Baltimore. Just that like right by the convention center there's this area

910
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,160
where there's like this this this very bizarre structure that's just got like a couple of water

911
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:46,000
falls and a bunch of just like walkways. Yeah. And because it's it's not quite on the sidewalk

912
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,280
and so it's just like no one even looks at it. Like it's a cool ass thing that you're meant to

913
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,960
walk through and like I because I found out about it I told all you guys about it and we checked it

914
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,480
out but like I you know you go there and you'll just see like hundreds of congoers passing by

915
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,880
and like no one's even checking this thing out and I'm like this thing is super cool and interesting

916
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,840
it's right here in the past. There's a there's footage of that thing in a t-bap takes brony

917
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:19,120
car as I recall yeah. I do think that video games that Dark Souls and other video games as the medium

918
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:24,800
is now called uh is it teaching people to do this or at least it's giving us the opportunity to learn.

919
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,680
It was in fact Fallout 3 playing that at 14 and made me realize oh yeah the lap dated

920
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:35,280
concrete actually looks just as cool as like a painting on average all things being equal right.

921
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:41,920
Every time that's wrong but to go back to McDonald's being uh like our culture and we we we we

922
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,280
fret so much about Rome right and every single painting that's been burned every single McDonald's

923
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:54,400
play a place all unique in the eyes of the Lord that gets demolished for health and safety reasons

924
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,200
is the fucking rape of our culture. It is a it is a destruction of the memories of what

925
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,880
the sort of Gen X to millennial transition represented and they're most they're largely

926
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:13,440
gone now and that is a travesty. Did I ever tell you people speaking of weird restaurants

927
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,480
of this one catfish restaurant I had an Obama room?

928
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,560
What was it?

929
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,160
Sounds good. Yeah please please tell us.

930
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,080
Happy birthday by the way for Obama. He turned 57 yesterday. Yeah.

931
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,400
Hashtag Obama day. Uh so when you say catfish restaurant.

932
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,120
By the time this comes out it I will have just turned 27 so happy birthday to you.

933
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,920
Oh yes. Happy birthday. It's my birthday.

934
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:46,080
I'm an old fuck. It's on Wednesday. Yeah so so okay so it's a catfish restaurant family owned

935
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,120
black family they have a fucking Obama room so one of their room one of the rooms in this building

936
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,600
it's just it's got a bunch of placards of things Obama did like a photo of him at his

937
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,320
like election. Remember when Obama freed the slaves? I heard about that. That was good.

938
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:08,080
And then like some other placard or you know like I don't I want to say oh yeah proof of

939
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,440
his birth certificate but I think I'm just making that up. They've got the birth certificate room

940
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:19,680
and the best part is they have a life-size cardboard cutout of him like standing in the middle

941
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,000
next to like a little tree. I can relate to that. So it's a 6 foot 2 Obama there and so I went up

942
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,320
and like my dad took a picture of me like with my hand over his shoulder and it is to this day

943
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:37,040
the best photo of me with the most sincere smile I've ever had on camera. It was my Facebook

944
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,400
profile for years I'll see if I could find it at some point. That's just what Obama does

945
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:47,200
he just inspires us. Even in death. Even in death, yeah.

946
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,040
All right I want to dredge up old topics because I didn't get to say my piece about them and I've

947
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:03,760
written them down. If I can souvenirs right the whole we're talking about like souvenirs for

948
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,360
getting it for the point of like you buy something because you think you're supposed to have a

949
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,800
souvenir of a thing and a lot of the time I mean my mom does do that sometimes. She went to

950
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:20,880
Barcelona or some other place with some of her girlfriends or whatever she asked me do you want

951
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,280
anything from there and I'm like I don't know anything about Barcelona. I don't know what you

952
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,240
can even get there. Bring me a pirate sword please. Bring me the people's election declaring

953
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,680
independence from Spain that was overturned by the federal government. Yeah bring me the original

954
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:44,720
document of that. Bring me back something from the point of Gibraltar. Oh wait. Wait what happened

955
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,080
there? It's not Spanish it's British. Oh right. We stole it it's English forever.

956
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,360
Anyway yeah she does that and you know I don't really care but you know sometimes she does come

957
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,880
back for something nice because she's got like she's got an eye for trinkets but my dad likes

958
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,680
souvenirs mostly I mean both of them do mostly just to be house decorations like they don't buy

959
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,520
things as souvenirs to like say oh look we went we got a keychain on a fridge magnet from this place

960
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:21,200
no they go and they go into the tiny little shops that are off the beaten path and and you know my

961
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:28,080
dad likes quiet places and those tiny streets you know away from the main like big like hey look at

962
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:35,920
all this stuff we all as like a family agree that it's much nicer to snake away to like a smaller

963
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,120
alleyway where there's less people and more locals and if you see enough locals at a bar you're like

964
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,920
okay that's a good place so we go there when we go to the markets there and we get like souvenirs

965
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,200
that just are good just like are like artistic nice little decorations for the house because they

966
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,960
have a house slash anime you know they are slash anime and they are like because they have a house

967
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,320
they are house they are homeowners they have a reason to buy things like that I don't I would

968
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,760
but now this is coming into another point I had which I was really interested in the way

969
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,920
DeVu was talking about like people go to all these places and there's no reason to do it they just

970
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,240
there's they don't have a purpose in life yeah I want to I want to take that opportunity to take

971
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,440
that info at that that idea that point and turn this podcast back into a Pokemon go

972
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,360
I got a ton of Mr. Mime in Italy and I'm gonna give it to you before Hippo can give it to you so

973
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:41,360
I know yeah I've got I've got authentic French Mr. Mime I've got a couple of those

974
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,720
how do you bust a Mime?

975
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:53,840
all right um Pokemon go is the way to have a souvenir um well it's it's a way to have a souvenir for

976
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,600
like a gamer that you know doesn't need things from actual real places you can take a picture

977
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:07,680
yes gamer yeah the only proper way to say it and it's like it's not just going to get a Pokemon

978
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,840
from a country because you know there's like the the region exclusive there's a few of those

979
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:20,640
and yeah this is the thing I had this idea the gym badges they've like I don't know when they

980
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,120
implemented them but there's this map that you can look uh that has a map of the world

981
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:33,440
like really low resolution but like you can see every gym you've like been to uh on the map

982
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,840
find that is that in the app yeah you go yeah you go to you you click on yourself you go to

983
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,920
your uh you scroll down to see all your um like medals and stuff and then there's your gyms and you

984
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,080
go to the the list of gyms and then there's like a thing on the bottom left and that's the map of

985
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,160
the world and all the gyms you've been to and I have like there's a there's a site called Pokemon

986
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,800
go map or something that just lists every poker stop and every gym in the world you go it's like

987
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:06,400
uses google maps and you just go scroll around you find where everything is and I had this idea

988
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,840
there it is I just found it that's fucking sick that I want I really want to like conquer the world

989
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:19,520
and be like the ideal world traveled well traveled man but because of Pokemon go because I

990
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,920
wouldn't actually actually I wouldn't actually go for any other reason so I want to I want to max

991
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,600
out like my gym badges I want to have every gym badge in the world which will take like a long time

992
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,360
but like it's it's just actually a reason for me to go to a real place other than to say oh I've

993
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:40,800
seen the lean tower pizza no I've seen I've seen all the the gym the poker gyms in that city actually

994
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:46,960
are you saying this whole thing all I can think is dude if you go to Italy and and use your EV

995
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:55,120
with authentic pizza it revolves into a Sicilian very nice by the way I can tell you right now I

996
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:00,160
didn't give a fuck about taking pictures lean tower pizza but you know what I did care about

997
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:05,760
yeah that's right I was getting the gym badge lean tower pizza check out this shit motherfucker

998
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,680
oh he did it it's great in this picture for some reason that's way cool and seen it in real life

999
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,640
oh yeah and it's in Italian it's in Italian that's that's authentic

1000
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:22,240
the bees oh you know in you know why it's because it was something that took some

1001
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,400
marginal amount of effort beyond the strength required to lift your phone and hit picture photo

1002
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,920
button right I remember you know there there was actually one like hallmark level idea of a thing

1003
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,360
you're supposed to do to be a real person that I think is pretty genuine it's a very specific one

1004
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,480
it's climbing up a fucking hill or a mountain and then being up it and then looking out at the sky

1005
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:51,760
right that is a real thing if you climb up a thing you actually actually did something if someone

1006
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,640
took a picture of them having just climbed the leaning tower of pizza I would be far more impressed

1007
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,360
why do you keep calling it pizza is it not the leaning tower of pizza it's pizza

1008
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,240
for the next pisa are you kidding me right now no no this is a joke in like a wasn't there like a

1009
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,360
whole cartoon about this probably it feels like a dexter's lab episode the leaning tower of a

1010
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,200
spaghetti I just want to make sure we're all clear by the way going back to what we were saying

1011
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:23,040
before about souvenirs I don't want to imply at all by by my railing against and and you know

1012
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,960
agreeing with everyone else that I am against the idea of souvenirs I in fact love mementos and I

1013
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,200
love having little trinkets and knickknacks that I can look at and and I have like a

1014
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,360
gym and neutron brain blast and it's it's always earned as opposed to like just gain it for the

1015
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,080
sake of gain it when it's an obligation actually jogs my memory there's something that I have

1016
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:48,320
just come across like like that business card or something else like that to that effect

1017
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,200
then it's far more impactful than actually I feel the memory more so than I would if I were

1018
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,880
yeah by it's not a matter of me not wanting to have it's just a matter of me having the experience

1019
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,640
and memory better from having something like I actually just yeah when it when it when it becomes

1020
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:11,280
an obligation that's when it's it it feels inauthentic it feels like you remember thinking you had

1021
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,840
to get something and you forgot what you were doing there and forgot the fun times you know what

1022
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,800
what I like doing is I like yeah when I have like a receipt from a thing I put it in my pocket

1023
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:25,360
sometimes I throw it away but sometimes I keep it I have a couple from radcon one and two and

1024
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,880
three and I just I keep them in a drawer and eventually I might like make a scrapbook of

1025
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,080
like all these receipts and like airplane tickets and stuff and concert things and be like oh yeah I

1026
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,560
went to that at that date like is all the information I need yeah and I'll be like oh yeah you know what I

1027
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:47,600
have I hold on the plane tickets no my turn damn it I haven't got to talk here's what I have to say

1028
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:54,080
small point uh what I went to Hawaii I had no plans to buy anyone anything as I never do

1029
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,440
but then Michelle was like hey why don't you buy your family gifts and I'm like

1030
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,080
bitch what the fuck did you just say to me uh and then I was like that seems like a reason

1031
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:10,320
so so I did uh and I have not yet to send I'm glad Ben's not here he's not getting spoiled

1032
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,360
but uh I gotta send those bad boys out oh and while I was there the most important thing of all

1033
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:21,600
is I bought myself a hoodie uh from the Polynesian Culture Center that says it on the thing it is

1034
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:27,040
the most comfortable hoodie of all time that Polynesian Culture Center is run by the Mormons uh

1035
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,600
and uh there's your fact of the day Mormons make good hood money back into the Dr. Wolf community

1036
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,240
going back hard making a hard left turn that's right I want to quickly say it's it's not very like

1037
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,280
super related that I I've been trying to tell us to say this that I haven't found a place to

1038
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,080
interject necessarily like uh you're all talking about like urban stuff and and towns and cities

1039
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:55,040
and whatnot but my my personal favorite place to go like vacation if I never do I never do but

1040
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:01,680
if I were to go it would be like a forest and probably like a picnic in a forest or a field

1041
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:08,800
and something I really really want to do before I leave this planet is like go stargazing like at

1042
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,560
night be burn a forest in a forest or so like somewhere where there's not no any buildings

1043
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:19,440
and no pollution there so you can see the stars bright because I keep seeing all these pictures

1044
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,840
of so many stars in the sky and then I look up at the sky at night I was like where the hell are

1045
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,760
I want to see them yeah you got city lights yeah yeah I don't know where you live in Lithuania but

1046
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:36,400
I'm I'm I'm certain that there are places nearby that like you could get to relatively easily I guess

1047
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:41,440
if you had a car like countryside but the thing is I'm alone and I'm scared to go dude get an

1048
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:48,960
electric skateboard and Casey Neistat out there hell yeah that's the way I don't mind I don't mind

1049
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,240
the idea of being alone and doing something like that I was on like again Pokemon go like haha but

1050
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,880
like uh I was looking on Pokemon go map and I was looking at poker stops in London and following

1051
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,440
the river Thames out towards the sea and then I was like curious like what does it look like when

1052
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,360
you walk there how how when is the threshold of like because if you look at a map of of England

1053
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:15,920
and you see the Thames go out to the ocean it it very slowly funnels out into the sea but there's

1054
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,800
a lot of land left and right for a very long time so I'm like what what would it look like to go

1055
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,520
there so I did the little google maps thing you drop the guy down you you walk along you know

1056
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:31,680
move along with the on the path and I was just like what if I just walked all the way from London

1057
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:37,760
down the river until I found us town and then I you know got a bus it could be a while it could be

1058
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:43,200
like a day or two or like um or something but like it was just I just like the idea of doing

1059
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:50,880
doing like like walking in one direction for a very long time and dying but like but without the

1060
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,480
dying part you know hopefully yeah I'm too big of a we need to go alone I would like to go with

1061
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,720
someone that is my boyfriend it's I mean going out at night and stuff is scary sometimes but like

1062
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:09,600
I don't know you got a torch you just got to be strong I mean what the hell is one time like I

1063
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,240
was I was in the countryside I was in the countryside and it was dark and it was like the

1064
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,400
kind of countryside where you could see the stars a lot and I didn't bring a torch and I went for a

1065
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:23,040
walk outside and I heard a horse in a nearby field I thought the gate was open and it was going to

1066
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:29,600
kill me I couldn't see anything and I I peed my pants and ran home but like um yeah it is scary

1067
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:35,840
to to go into places alone I guess but it's it's doable I also like about night time and walking

1068
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,880
around in night time the air just smells different at night and I really like that sort of night

1069
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,480
time smell of the night time because there's less cars night time is oh absolutely 110

1070
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,880
percent better than the day you can't convince me otherwise it's perfect I'm a day boy and you

1071
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:57,280
night fags need to check your shitty oh you think you're so special I'm a night owl it's not about

1072
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,960
being special it's just about admitting get a nine to five you sacks of shit and it is about being

1073
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,080
special because I'm special needs and I need that moonlight I need I need that isolation I can't

1074
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:13,440
deal with all you fucking extroverted fucks with your jobs and your confidence and your money and

1075
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,880
your success trajectory I can't deal with that the absolute best thing is when it's been like a

1076
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,000
really hot day like it has been recently and like the the ground is like fucking scorching hot has

1077
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,800
been boiled by the sun so like when night time comes around and it starts to cool off there's

1078
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,360
like a lot of wind breezing around like the the temperature is changing rapidly and things are

1079
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,960
like swooshing around you just walk in as a warm cool breeze it just it's just the perfect you can

1080
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,680
go outside and shorts in the middle of the night I gotta say being up during the day for the last

1081
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:51,680
month has been a huge problem because like yeah uh we we got onto a a great lifestyle regiment here

1082
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:57,760
at the at the gecko estate where we've been waking up and every other day going straight to the gym

1083
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:03,920
right after waking up and it's a great way to do things because we both have like problems with

1084
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:09,040
insomnia and this cures that because if you just start the day like hitting the ground running and

1085
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:15,920
you work all day you're fucking exhausted by night time the problem is yeah that when we started this

1086
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,680
we were waking up at like six in the morning and neither of us wants to be up like neither of us likes

1087
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,920
the day because first of all it's the middle of summer and it's a fucking 90 degrees out every day

1088
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:32,480
and it's super fucking humid so it's it's too hot and when you wake up that early nothing's even

1089
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,920
open that early like except for the gym so it's like you know you go to the gym and you're like

1090
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,680
all right let's go get some food oh nowhere's open yet you know and just generally yeah going out at

1091
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,800
night is way nicer because you can just walk and it's nice and cool and you don't even care if you

1092
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:54,000
have to walk like an extra mile to get somewhere open because it's nice to walk a mile at night

1093
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,080
during the day you're like let's go to the closest fucking place so i'm not sweating

1094
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,760
you know 10 pounds by the time i haven't really been having to deal with this

1095
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,560
fucking whole temperature thing ever since i moved to a desert where there is no fucking humidity

1096
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,000
i know i've talked about this with all of you have i talked about it in an episode yet

1097
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,560
i think you might okay well fucking humidity it's where all the actual discomfort from heat comes

1098
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:21,840
from yes place where it's not it's like 98 degrees don't feel like shit yeah today's like the first

1099
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,960
day that it's been hot and not that humid and it was pretty okay but like for the most part it's

1100
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,440
been shit especially in veneziaans this was a fucking oh my god the weather in veneziaans was

1101
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:37,040
terrible i mean the i mean that makes sense because it's a fucking waterlogged city yeah i've

1102
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,120
literally not yet this whole time i've been living here had a single day where i walk out and i'm like

1103
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,600
i don't want to go out it hasn't been yet and i went i just bared the entire brunt of july so

1104
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,240
i think it's pretty cool i've been suffering for the last month i guess now i know why because

1105
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:59,040
the humidity because like this the first month when i got here like um what's after me the month

1106
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,600
june yeah june there you go yeah sorry i was thanking lefina for a moment okay so yeah june

1107
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,360
was was fine and then like i guess the humidity hit and like i've been suffering and if it wasn't

1108
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,480
for this little fan i have in my room right now i'd be suffocating right now and it's just like

1109
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,360
i couldn't even sleep for a few days until i realized i have the fan and it was like terrible

1110
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,480
awful and like for the last few days i haven't even turned on my pc because it was just so bad

1111
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,400
and the pc added to the sheets i just i just i just couldn't do anything

1112
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,200
you know i think i think i'm quite a tough little cookie because because because we don't have ac in

1113
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:40,320
this house and it is humid and it is like really hot and well it's not just it's just not a thing

1114
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,600
it's not a san diego or anything in london no no no it's it's like uh some sort of degrees

1115
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:51,440
you can look it up yeah um but like it's humid and it's high heat wavy and it's like you don't

1116
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:57,120
want to be on a train in with a crowded people you don't want to go to that london 79 degrees right

1117
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:03,360
now he's that's pretty warm that's pretty warm yeah so but like um i i'm right now i'm in my room

1118
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,240
i close the window obviously because to stop uh sound coming in and it's a sweltering in here

1119
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:13,280
it's gonna be like sweaty i'm sweating up a storm but i feel okay because i'm used to this because

1120
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:20,720
i'm i'm you know i'm uh i i don't complain a lot a lot of times pain happens to me and i'm like

1121
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:30,480
okay all right i'll do it i'll i'll i'll i'll settle for this and if and later i'll i'll be like

1122
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
i'll i'll be like i'm now i'm stronger for having dealt with it instead of

1123
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,440
doing anything about it which is stupid really the warmth and i prefer heat over coldness like if

1124
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,800
i had to choose between this weather and freezing cold i would choose this weather anytime of the day

1125
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:54,240
but sure i mean i would do the same uh my car uh does not have ac and just yesterday i got the

1126
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,600
oil change and attempted to get them to like repair the ac stuff uh they said it could not be done

1127
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,840
without like major like it was the thing of like they refill the antifreeze or whatever

1128
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,280
they they can't do it requires like a serious upgrade my car is very old um so i'm just not

1129
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:14,000
going to do it and that's fine uh but i just i've been able to drive for years now with this car

1130
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,400
with no ac and that's been fine uh but and so like in that way yes i i'm over caring about being

1131
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,360
comfortable while driving but and i just roll the windows down whatever but in my house so i i just

1132
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:31,840
moved into my new place has central air and it is incredible it is unbelievable it is a huge

1133
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:37,360
massive life upgrade uh it's also like sunnier it's just such a quality of life improvement and

1134
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,920
all these new rooms and stuff the eight months i spent the eight months i spent living in digi's

1135
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,800
house was the only eight months since childhood i had adequate central air conditioning for both

1136
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:55,440
heat and cold um i i'm just over here like so suddenly fuming with rage thinking about the

1137
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:02,320
fact that like all of the best built cities are in places with shit weather and the only place in

1138
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,640
the whole world that i've ever heard of having consistently good weather is the west coast of

1139
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:14,800
the united states not and i i mean hawaii is quite nice but you know hawaii as well and like

1140
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:21,440
certain places like near the equator i guess but like sure the west coast like la is like known for

1141
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,280
its good weather and and i'm just sitting here wondering like why is it that la has to be the

1142
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,840
shittiest fucking city imaginable i believe i've heard some people theorize that nice weather

1143
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,720
the good one went there right well yeah i've heard i think i've heard some theories talk about how

1144
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:43,120
the lack of bad weather means that like that the human innovation and hard work gumption gene

1145
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:48,080
like deactivates and then everyone becomes shitty because it's so easy to live that's what hawaii is

1146
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:53,680
100% like that everyone's just like hey man it's the island time relax man we're also jamaica don't

1147
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,720
worry about it i don't know who's fucking deceive you do they don't they don't care about anything

1148
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:03,760
so much they don't even care that they also just are jamaica that's how little they say yeah as a

1149
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:09,360
local who who goes to la very regularly and has been to la very recently in an expo i can

1150
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,520
guarantee you that the weather there is fucking terrible and it's absolutely a bit that's like

1151
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:18,320
what they're what what they're known for is having good weather i've never heard that before in my life

1152
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:25,040
it's always so hot it might be a little more as a local when i was in anime expo it was a hundred

1153
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:31,840
and like seventeen on ironically it was way too hot like when we were at an expo it was insanely hot

1154
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,760
yeah all right defined good defined good weather because when something is like

1155
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:44,640
rather hot i don't like it i prefer cloudy weather i prefer uh you know a potential rain

1156
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:54,000
good weather in no humidity and 70 to 75 degrees like yeah like the literal ideal for humans like

1157
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,880
nice breeze rolling in clear blue skies it's about 70 or so degrees there's no

1158
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:08,080
like bad to be oh i'm grumpy i don't know right now here's here's no no clear blue skies are nice

1159
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:15,120
but that they that to me as an english man they feel like a holiday thing when i see a clear blue

1160
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,000
sky i'm like i don't need to work it's really funny you say that like when i was watching doctor who

1161
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,920
i like every time they show london i was like god that is the most depressing city in the

1162
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:31,280
fucking world it's all right i agree sometimes like overcast skies can feel depressing and a

1163
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,760
lot of americans who come to to england they see all the the clouds and they're like oh

1164
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:42,480
fuck but like there's so much it's so it's it's hard to explain i think it's like you think of like

1165
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:48,880
the sky is like a canvas it's like a clear canvas it's blue it's nice um clouds are like the the

1166
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:55,440
painting stuff like you see like old paintings of clouds and they're always like puffy and cool

1167
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,440
and the lights bouncing off them in interesting ways and then i look up sometimes and i'm like

1168
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:03,920
that's a painting i'm looking at the most beautiful thing i've ever seen and the only reason i can see

1169
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:10,240
that is because clouds are there to like um to make interesting shapes i'm like i would

1170
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,840
always prefer clouds over clear blue 75 percent pictures of cool looking clouds so i do understand

1171
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,120
that but uh i'm telling you i think you're i think you're a little bit of uh of um what's it called

1172
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:27,120
when someone kidnaps you and like and you like it Stockholm syndrome yeah Stockholm syndrome like

1173
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:33,120
because it seems to still i don't i don't believe that that can even happen i'm just used to it it's

1174
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:39,040
not it's not that i like bad weather i just don't think it is bad weather when the when the sky is

1175
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:44,960
completely white when you know no but you just have a different definition of bad weather i live in

1176
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,520
in this that's what i'm saying you know what i'm trying to say is that as a human being there is a

1177
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,720
type of climate that should be like like that should be just optimal for everybody don't we all

1178
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:59,360
have stockholders syndrome then not quite i mean the reason why for example white people are white

1179
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,120
is because they exist in europe where there was more cloud cover so they didn't need the kind of

1180
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:09,920
people are a mistake okay like well aren't whiteness whiteness is Stockholm syndrome via evolution

1181
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,840
like evolution via Stockholm syndrome it's like we we went okay white people made the

1182
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:21,680
leaning tower of pizza you motherfucker yeah that should lead to that it's fucking leaning

1183
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,800
is it me or is the leaning tower of pizza like us just literally a gist a big celebration of failure

1184
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,360
like i mean maybe i mean let's look at the i think it's just very funny those egyptian

1185
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,720
kangs those pyramids are not deviating one millimeter they are dead centers straight

1186
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,680
up except i need to i need to say my piece about like the weather don't talk about the pyramids we

1187
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:52,720
didn't make them that's all aliens i refuse to believe otherwise and i saw from all right the

1188
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,200
islands are super white they're like the whitest possible yeah the ultimate the ultimate ubermensch

1189
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:04,400
is fucking the ultimate uber driver the aliens the great ones they can drive for thousands of

1190
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,200
monchi what's the big what is the uh the big disc called that's supposed to make the pyramid

1191
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,440
turn into the spaceship oh it's just the love battleship it's just the love battleship it's

1192
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:19,840
the love battleship that's what it is all right fucking i i i have to say my piece because you

1193
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:28,400
can't like i don't right cloudy weather is not always like good obviously i'm not saying that i

1194
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:34,000
like it when it's fucking wet and cold and miserable i'm saying that clouds are good and when

1195
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,440
the cloud is when the sky is like completely white it sort of feels like a blanket and i like it

1196
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:44,800
because there's no harsh rays there's no burning but it's not cold either it's just sort of i agree

1197
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,160
it's peaceful you can just sort of you can just sort of live and it's just nice i hate cloudy weather

1198
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,000
i don't think it's stockholm syndrome that's all i'm saying i don't like rain either okay the reason i

1199
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,400
was calling it that and it's not about you specifically but i wanted i was going to breach

1200
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,960
that out to the english attitude in general like the way that englishmen sort of major cox the way

1201
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,120
the englishmen sort of portray themselves in the way that they're perceived stereotypically

1202
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:13,840
is something that seems like people from a place where it's overcast all the time all right that

1203
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,760
would explain the classic english phrase she caught a gun i which can't be helped well i mean

1204
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:26,080
and granted a lot of my english stereotypes come from yatsi and how he portrays england and himself

1205
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,800
and the cloudy weather as all kind of the it's a maelstrom of this attitude and and i and i love

1206
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:38,240
england i think it's great yeah stockholm syndrome i mean yatsi is the guy who left england i don't

1207
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:43,360
i don't get what you're oh yeah what's gonna do i'm saying that the human race here's what i'm

1208
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:49,680
trying to say is that when we when we left africa and expanded outwards we had to play a lot of

1209
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,760
mental gymnastics we had to play a lot of mental gymnastics as we went around the world to try to

1210
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:01,440
convince ourselves that it was okay to live in shitty places like america we came here and almost

1211
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:08,560
everyone died instantly like the diseases were so fucked this the the land was just not good for

1212
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:14,240
living on in the way we wanted to so basically everyone died why are you trying to say that the

1213
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,560
united states is not full of bountiful fertile land is that what you're trying to say to me right

1214
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,240
i i think what did he's trying to say is that he wishes he was black well that's there are some

1215
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:29,120
scientists they're starting to die like but specifically in african tribesmen and and have

1216
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:33,920
never left africa and everyone who isn't african has stockholm syndrome since everyone's talking

1217
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,640
about uh since everyone's talking about fucking going on vacations to famous places we went to

1218
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,760
the most hilarious tourist attraction in the world recently because we live in boston which is near

1219
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,560
plymouth rock have any of you been to plymouth rock nate you've been there sure have it's

1220
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,880
fucking hilarious isn't it because there's nothing there i mean it's just the first of all it's just

1221
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:59,520
a rock it's just like a regular sized boulder with a with a big stamp on it that says like uh 1687

1222
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,840
or whatever um but the funniest part is that the like plaques and stuff next to it all say that it

1223
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:12,160
is supposedly the rock they don't know that the pilgrims landed at so like no one even knows what

1224
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:16,160
the fuck it is and there's all these like stupid souvenir shops and you're by it it's it's it's

1225
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:21,520
very transparently corny and dumb out in the uh since it's out in the elements wouldn't have

1226
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,000
been decayed by now no they've got it up on well they've got it up on a platform like it's elevated

1227
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,720
above the water like they've got it like they still be rained on and winded on and no it's

1228
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,320
it's in a it's in a building it's only been like 400 years that's not that long there's like a

1229
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:38,800
gazebo over it it's like i'm looking at pictures and it just it still seems like it'd be still too

1230
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,080
exposed to not be corroded eventually but okay well they've got it under a gazebo and like on a

1231
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:49,440
lifted platform and like there's a guy there who every 15 minutes gives like a little speech about

1232
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:54,720
the rock and he talks about how apparently it once was like a huge tourist attraction and like

1233
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,120
presidential candidates would like take pictures of themselves next to the rock and shit and like

1234
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:04,320
yeah but like it actually has because of the fact that it is so lame it has totally lost that

1235
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:09,120
reputation and now nobody cares about it anymore that's a tiny baby rock i thought there was like

1236
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,040
a massive monument like there's just a regular ass rock that has a fucking number on it but um

1237
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,120
they the guy was telling us a story about how like when when they got there that first winter

1238
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:30,560
they dwindled down to like yeah like 10 women were left alive so like they had to repopulate

1239
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,640
everything from like 10 women that they had maybe it was less than that it was something like eight

1240
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:39,840
eight or eight to 10 women that were still alive like they came to america and everyone fucking

1241
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:45,200
died instantly and they like barely hung on like half of them died this is an unironically

1242
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,720
problematic worldview that you're disposing right now i feel unironically twigger it's not well

1243
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:57,920
here's the thing here way before that no virginia was colonized long before the pilgrims got here

1244
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:04,640
okay it was colonized or was it just people lived here well they those are kind of the same thing

1245
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:09,520
but i mean they had set up you know camps and villages and in virginia which was the first like

1246
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,080
massachusetts not like i know this name i'm from virginia i had to learn virginia history eight

1247
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:19,360
different times but those people did not all die i mean i'm sure some of them came over on a

1248
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:24,880
land bridge from fucking from russia it went back when it was connected way back in ancient times

1249
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,480
they adapted to live here over time and they slowly expanded because the only reason we expanded

1250
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:35,440
across the earth was either because there were too many people for the amount of resources or

1251
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:40,640
ideological differences like the reason we came to america like the pilgrims the uh the the ones

1252
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:46,080
who came to plimoth they were running from religious persecution like they were okay with

1253
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,720
putting up with living in a shit place that they were not meant to live because it meant that they

1254
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:55,440
got to have a different type of lifestyle but and they were just brave enough to fucking deal

1255
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:01,840
with the amount of death i just have i just have an issue with like the idea that i'm like the people

1256
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:07,600
who live here have stockholm syndrome when we have lived here for so long that we have acclimatized to

1257
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,560
this thing and every time i go to a hot country i am sick and i feel terrible all the time yeah

1258
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:18,240
adaptations just evolutionary stockholm syndrome that's what i'm trying to say that's literally

1259
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:24,480
okay it just the stockholm syndrome has a very like like persecuti connotation like you have a

1260
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,040
fucking mental disability i don't think of it that way i don't think you can get a stockholm syndrome

1261
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:34,240
by just being home like are you being that's so silly that's a silly thing i mean they're just

1262
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:37,760
being a larger point okay you're just trashing english in general first of all let's define

1263
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:44,080
stockholm syndrome is just when you are when you convince yourself that something is good so that

1264
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:49,120
you can deal with it no it's like when you're being held against your will in a thing let's say

1265
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:54,880
yeah a situation against your will but then like to make it okay in your head to be born on earth

1266
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,520
is to be in a situation that was against your will nobody decided to be born that's changing that's

1267
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:08,880
change it that's that's i wish i was trying to just be born that's where you want to live in the

1268
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:16,480
world so that is a very high cost to like move i move yes i understand that you grow up in the

1269
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:22,080
culture you're born into and you will immediately develop a deep saw stockholm syndrome for the

1270
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,200
entire culture you live in like people are constantly reinforcing the values of the system you were born

1271
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:32,560
into i think the only problem i have with what you're saying is that there's there's this implication

1272
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:40,080
there's this implication that um the grass like quantifiably like absolutely is always greener

1273
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,840
and you will never actually have like any good like you will never live in a good place ever

1274
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,560
it's only stockholm syndrome the reason that you like the place i gotta say between this always

1275
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,640
should be a better place which i kind of agree with it's just a weird way of saying it that's

1276
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:02,880
what makes it funny in what made why i said it yeah that's okay let's see i'm remembering the last

1277
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,720
like month or so like things you've been on about you've had finding the code of the universe

1278
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,280
you have like all arts about finding the expression and now it's like every like the optimal human

1279
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:18,480
condition i feel like you're sort of at step one of becoming a hitler because you're like defining

1280
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,240
human experience right anti hitler and then i'm trying one step two i thought well step two would

1281
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:30,640
be writing a book all about your worldview oh shit all right hold on we have to understand here

1282
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:36,240
i'm not saying stockholm syndrome is a bad thing or a problem i have stockholm syndrome for america

1283
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:43,520
like i'm just saying that to be raised in a society is to be programmed you are not making a conscious

1284
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,640
decision to be the person you are you were created to be this person you were developed to be this

1285
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:53,280
person you you learned all the pure thing you've ever brought onto the show as far as i've heard

1286
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:58,000
yeah which is why i agree with it yeah it's pretty obvious i think i think i'm just saying like

1287
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,320
obvious normal shit about how psychology works but you you just said it in an abrasive way that may

1288
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:12,560
give uh you know not on board i mean i i don't i there's no way i can disagree with the idea that

1289
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:19,600
we the only reason we do anything is because of outside influence and there is no real self kind

1290
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,200
of sort of but like i just don't see the point of ever bringing that up because it doesn't have any

1291
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:29,520
bearing on anything the idea is what are you supposed to do about it essentially is that let's

1292
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:36,080
say like people came to london and they went oh the weather here is kind of shit but we can build

1293
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:41,920
our own city here and it's good enough and then eventually people adapted to where they're like

1294
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:48,560
like okay with that but like that's that just means that that is like a it's a new breed of human

1295
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:54,000
this this human that's adapted to live in london and their personalities kind of reflect that

1296
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,840
it's like the english attitude is a product of having moved to england like having moved humanity

1297
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:04,960
there and like so it's a sort of it's a sort of several generations there's way more to it than

1298
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,160
just like where we decided to settle down because there was like hundreds of years of war and like

1299
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:16,080
people took over england and yeah and i'm just i'm oversimplifying this for the sake of explaining

1300
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:21,280
why i would use the phrase stockholm syndrome just simply that like tom said earlier i'm just saying

1301
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:29,840
adaptation to an environment is like when human race came to be in the fertile crescent it was

1302
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:35,680
because this is a place that would spawn humans like this is a place that hey you know like this

1303
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:41,360
is this is the natural result of being in this area and then we went oh let's go other places

1304
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:46,720
and those places were shit but we got used to it you know and why do you think that it's not

1305
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:52,880
so inconvenient or shit that it is cloudy a lot like i don't think that i don't think that's so

1306
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:59,360
i'm just saying it's it's it's not that it's super unnatural it's just slightly different but like i

1307
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:05,920
don't like that you're mixing people adapting to stuff with stockholm syndrome it's just why i don't

1308
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,920
know it doesn't sound right it sounds right to me it feels like there's a different word that you

1309
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:18,960
could be using yes sort of makes sense but you can't it's really funny yeah i'm surprised it's got

1310
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,400
everybody's laugh and i'm human i'm raging here it's funny especially because i use the phrase

1311
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,720
stockholm syndrome all the time it's just like one of my favorite phrases to accuse things it's my

1312
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:33,760
favorite new song i didn't know that was a new song i take offense because i'm fat and i hate hot

1313
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,480
weather and i want to be in england because it's really cold all the time it's not cold i thought

1314
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:43,520
you're about to say i'm fat and i hate hot women no it's not it could be raining here according to

1315
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,640
my boyfriend but can we get back to traveling traveling's way more funny i want to say i want

1316
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:54,640
to say that i hate cloudy weather because i'm very uh i'm very affected by the weather for some reason

1317
01:33:54,640 --> 01:34:02,480
cloudiness makes me moody you're an evolutionary stockholm syndrome it all makes sense indigo

1318
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:07,520
and also child and wait she's not in the same way mage does actually i i get headaches when it rains

1319
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,240
and when the when there's like i don't have pressure from i do think of cloudiness and raininess as

1320
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:19,520
just a thing like the atmospheric climatologic kick uh embodiment of depression and the more

1321
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,520
depression you have the more rain uh matches your mood and even when you're not depressed you have

1322
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:29,280
depressive moments you know moments where things feel low and down and if that happens to synchronize

1323
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:35,120
with uh some some overcast i think that actually fits pretty nicely i remember just it just makes

1324
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:41,120
sense it makes sense to me because pink floyd told me that living on in quiet desperation was the

1325
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:46,800
english way and that's all i know about them but no i distinctly remember there was actually a day

1326
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:53,280
the the very specific day i kicked depression and like became like marginally functional on that

1327
01:34:53,280 --> 01:35:00,160
particular axis which was a day in which it had been overcast and i was like um yeah overcast i

1328
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:05,440
always feel better when it's overcast and then i just sort of like had a moment at like two o'clock

1329
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:11,520
where i my depression was broken and then the sun came out and i'm like the sun's out i feel good

1330
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:18,720
about this wait hold on guns out my divu says i've never i've never been happy that the sun

1331
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:28,480
came out before i'm free i'm cured i don't get it but cool yeah teach me teach me how it's uh all

1332
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,480
you gotta do is you gotta go into the clouds you gotta you gotta you gotta look at the clouds

1333
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:36,320
right you gotta see a cloud that looks like a mountain and you gotta get your hiking gear and

1334
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,760
you gotta climb that mountain and then when you get to the top of the cloud you realize that it's

1335
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,840
not physical and you gotta fall and die and that's what actually what happened with me was that i

1336
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:50,080
listened to i for like the 79th time that week the fucking version of you're gonna go far kid

1337
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:57,040
that sped up to sound like rainbow dash and that gave me oh my god forever what whoa that sounds

1338
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:02,640
like an experience uh all right i gotta go dig up that youtube video and put it on repeat for

1339
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:07,840
like a week hashtag join yeah i may be cured and so for the last six years now i've been cured and

1340
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:13,440
i have now only 12 other metaphysical fucking disorders i can see now divu how did you cure

1341
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:19,680
depression rainbow dash um all right that's a true story for a lot of people we're the only person

1342
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:24,160
would not i was gonna say i know true story for me i didn't fucking make that shit up story for

1343
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:31,680
amazing yep ten out of ten i have i have a thing to say regarding to weather but also travel

1344
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:39,200
and that i have also gone uh on a on a week long thing um i won't get into what i was doing we

1345
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,360
could save that for another episode because this one how long has this been going on it got a bit

1346
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:50,960
well i'll get we'll get into that next time maybe um but um it was a camp and it was rainy like

1347
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:56,160
extremely rainy like i got off the coach i was like okay it looks a bit cloudy looks like it might

1348
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:00,960
rain i'd better set up my tent immediately and as soon as i got like the tent poles out

1349
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:06,640
fucking torrent of rain wind almost blew everything away i just had to lie on my tent to stop it from

1350
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:11,360
blow you know blowing away i got drenched all my clothes got drenched i'm like okay i'm fucking

1351
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:19,360
you your favorite fiddler cunt weather cunt of a weather and i was like and i was like okay i'm

1352
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,200
putting it up and it's like fine oh shit this week's gonna suck it's so fucking rainy and windy and

1353
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:32,080
cold and bad and i don't like it and then uh day two less rainy uh like uh it was like a mist of rain

1354
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:36,000
constantly falling throughout the day but it was just all like you walk out and there's not you can't

1355
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,240
really feel the raindrops unless you hold your hand at your palm up and it's like oh yeah there is

1356
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:45,280
rain but it's just sort of a mist and that was okay but it's still cold and i don't like it but then

1357
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:51,680
third day it comes back like the the sunny weather comes back that was like heat waving london the

1358
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:58,320
whole time uh and and was like okay yeah it's now now we've had the rain and we got the sun

1359
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:05,200
the the camp feels way better than if it had been sunny the entire time because the sun was like quite

1360
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:10,320
powerful throughout the last few weeks before leading up to this and i was like if this is gonna

1361
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:17,360
be like a scorching hot camp i'm gonna die there's only so much you can do you could put the sunscreen

1362
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:23,040
maybe have an umbrella with you to to block the sun rays but like it's just you're gonna die but

1363
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,520
the the fact that we had like terrible weather the first couple days and then like kind of great

1364
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,920
weather for the for the rest it was just sort of everyone's spirit was lifted and it was just it

1365
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,840
was just really nice and i i just i love variety in weather i love changing weather and i love england

1366
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:44,080
for having fucking wild mood swings in weather variety it always has like either you know we

1367
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:49,840
have snow here we have heat waves here we have torrents and hurricanes and and but like really

1368
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:56,000
lovely summers sometimes it's just like and sometimes winter is hot it's like it doesn't make any sense

1369
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,160
but i enjoy i enjoy the variety that it provides that's what virginia is like as well who's side

1370
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:08,240
right now by the way on on the very small subject of sunscreen did you know you fucking white pigs

1371
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:14,800
that ethnics are immune to sunburn i didn't know where i've never even like realized that like oh

1372
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,480
that's a real thing that can happen it's not just in cartoons uh until someone was like why aren't

1373
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,840
you putting on sunscreen i'm like you have to put on sunscreen like that's a real thing that's not

1374
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,080
just a joke that people say you have to do because you can just walk outside when you're an ethnic

1375
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,600
like me and it doesn't even matter you just don't it doesn't even like the sun does not affect you

1376
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:38,880
whatsoever all i have to say about that is case in point law case in i have a oh oh by the way

1377
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,280
hippo i want to visit england really bad we should have like a like a like a jimmy you try like jimmy

1378
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:49,360
timmy power hour all right if i was thinking this if there's like ever a london pokemon go event

1379
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:54,160
uh that's a very easy excuse for me to go and excuse for you to go to have like a thing i want

1380
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:58,560
to i want there to be a jimmy we could we could explore specifically event a jimmy balka con

1381
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:05,120
oh there are anime cons in london that would be nice i i've always wanted the three

1382
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,720
funnily enough idly is not is not one of the european countries that i really wanted to visit

1383
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:13,280
the most i've wanted to visit germany paris and england a lot but i'm really afraid that if i go

1384
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:19,840
to england everyone will aggressively hate me why why okay okay because people aggressively hated me

1385
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:25,600
and in italy i can only imagine it'll be more significant in england because i will be american

1386
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:31,040
and they'll fucking like want to jeer at me like no like no matter what i do i don't think that that

1387
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:37,280
is some validity to the idea that english people are cucks um like like we're just downtrodden

1388
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:42,480
we're down and we're like uh everything sucks no no i'm just saying like like it's not it's not

1389
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:48,400
completely unfounded i don't mind it because it doesn't really matter um because we just you know

1390
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:53,120
you do what you do and you don't have to be the life of the product you know you just you just dab

1391
01:40:53,120 --> 01:41:04,320
on the head keep calm and dab on the head and like like seeing a big big funny fluffy mexican man

1392
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:10,480
like you coming in and being low like ooh like like ooh uh they're gonna be like they're gonna

1393
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:15,600
give you some funny looks but they're not gonna do anything especially in london people in london

1394
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,960
are like the most anti-social people of all time they're always doing anything but looking at anyone

1395
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,000
when they see me in orange color coming to their world of gray colors they'll be like oh who's this

1396
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,880
and then it'll be like a disney movie they'll have a lot of good color design yeah yeah you'll you'll

1397
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,440
touch the the river tens and it'll turn into sand it'll be like ratty fucking scorpi blue and i'll

1398
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:39,920
like breathe i'll be bringing the color back to england and i'll have to touch everyone like that

1399
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,760
like that fern golly movie yeah exactly with the green thumb makes everything green yeah it's

1400
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,000
actually a perfect segue into something a big speech i want to say so give me the room get the

1401
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,160
get off the stage i'm pushing you off the stage right now hippo you're in a wheelchair and i've

1402
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:57,360
dumped you out you're now fucking gonna be there oh no i've fallen and i'm i'm okay with it i've been

1403
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:02,640
such immense satisfaction from coming off as the one tourist who cares whenever i have the

1404
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:07,840
opportunity to like speak italian like like broken italian that i've rehearsed from google translate

1405
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:13,040
or like frequently peacock my cursory understanding of italian history to my tour guys i feel like

1406
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:19,920
it's something akin to like the god orgasm like lsd like you know 12 pounds something like that uh

1407
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:23,920
like like people okay okay people say you should learn history because like oh those who don't

1408
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,280
learn from history are doomed to repeat it or a lot of your reason like that that's pussy shit

1409
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:31,840
that doesn't even matter it's not even true here's what i think you should learn about history when

1410
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:37,840
you're in venice and you're on some fucking fish or price baby's first guided tour and which has

1411
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:43,600
some desensitized native venetian fuck who clearly hates you and all of your cultural

1412
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,720
colonizing ilk is going through these state mandated motions as quickly as possible because the

1413
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:53,040
tourist population outnumbers the native population 60 to one that's not a joke that's actually real

1414
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,280
60 to one that's the actual uh uh tourist population to name a population of venice it's

1415
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,440
fucked up uh and he's just trying to pump out these walking tours like a fucking brood mare

1416
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:05,040
and well and and you know offhandly while going through the motions you know saying history like

1417
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,280
oh here's where someone died oh here's where a prostitute had sex you know stuff like that

1418
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:13,840
and you know you offhandedly mentions italian unification and all of your fat disgusting

1419
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:19,440
slob american pigs slightly think uh uh what do you mean it says at idly wasn't always idly there

1420
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:27,760
were other things before idly and you can swoop in and go ah yes good sir you mean the process of

1421
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:39,920
resurgimento and then his fucking jaw his fucking jaw his jaw dropped so far that smashes into a

1422
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:45,520
rocketing skyward erection with such awesome power precision that surfaces a miniature parkour

1423
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:51,040
collider and right then and there the atom is split the entire city is enveloped in a radiative

1424
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,960
and you'll remember this one and say thanks munchie people like me now and i'm also dead

1425
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:05,200
all you gotta do is mention that dude seriously aren't i fucking wrongly after that tour the guy

1426
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:08,720
i went to him was like hey where's the good restaurant around here and for fucking kid

1427
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:16,320
men it's straight unironically not in second life not new pets not webkins in real life this guy

1428
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:20,560
for ten minutes was like no one knows what a surgeon meant to us no every italian knows i

1429
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:24,000
you know walk up to them and say what's a surgeon meant to and they say oh yes it's like this but

1430
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,680
no american this is the first time in 10 years everyone's ever said that word to me you are an

1431
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:32,160
american you know the the fucking school you know the sky is blue the grass is green you understand

1432
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:36,080
i will suck out the great now two dollars two dollars three dollars once at the north for free for

1433
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:44,960
free for free yes i come to london it's just a relation but i don't get on youtube but now i have

1434
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:51,440
all the knowledge power exactly right it's that simple it's it's actually true it's real it's

1435
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:55,360
fucking and also you get like a better like especially in idly like if you know shit about

1436
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:00,560
time history like you can understand what the monuments are there's a giant fucking like like

1437
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:06,080
unbelievably big mine like like like it's i mean i guess it's the same size as like the

1438
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:10,240
link in mind or something but instead of like having like the outside building just be like

1439
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:14,080
columns and stuff that just is you know you can go inside and see the actual monument the entire

1440
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:18,720
building is one big statue would have to like the centerpiece of like the link in mind but for like

1441
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:23,600
the first uh king of idly but on the outside there's just a ton of like you know marble statues

1442
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:28,720
engraved into it if you like know what that is it's way more impressive like like you know you

1443
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:32,160
can just be like you just walk by it's just oh it's just some big fucking marble but if you

1444
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,320
know the history the guy victor amen well and you and you know what the fuck you did you know about

1445
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,640
the process of resurgimento then you can fuck you have more appreciation for things around you

1446
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:44,800
and it's impressive and you were you were tapping into what i what i was thinking of when we were

1447
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:51,520
going on and on about this this stupid like slap dash get the cred that you went to x y and z

1448
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,880
important monuments and then just get the fuck back yeah yeah you yeah you just you just touched

1449
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:05,120
all your bases is that to take in to really appreciate the advanced fucking detailed architecture

1450
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:11,520
you don't just you shouldn't just go there be there take a selfie eat some fucking dip in dots

1451
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:18,560
ice cream of the future and then go back to americaville like what you should do is just stay

1452
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:25,520
there for a month and then just sit on a bench looking at all the architecture and then pull out

1453
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:33,200
a book and learn all the context behind these buildings and when they were built and actually

1454
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:38,480
do something productive and and like have a fun time that way and then just spend like a total of

1455
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:44,960
like 35 man hours staring at that building off in the distance as you read your book and and really

1456
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:50,320
soaking it in and feeling the dark souls within you you know what was the best thing i could have

1457
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:55,840
feasibly done at well in idly and it improved my trip tremendously it was not only good for

1458
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,040
like just like memory jogging and like being able to appreciate the details but it was so good for

1459
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:04,000
my art is i sketched all of the monuments are things that i liked a lot so i so when i thought

1460
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,560
something you know i want to get a picture of this i didn't take a picture of it i pulled out my

1461
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:10,880
sketchbook and i started to draw as well as i could and then that way i get a more like it like

1462
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:14,800
intimate understanding of the details of it because you know i gotta draw oh yeah you know i'm practicing

1463
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:21,360
dry yeah the the last time well the the only time i went to Florence was on like an art trip thing

1464
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:26,480
it was like a college thing it was like uh part of the tuition fee was uh we'll take you to Florence

1465
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,680
and you can see the art galleries and all that cool shit and i was like uh fucking sick cool so i

1466
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:37,760
went there and it was like i it you know i brought my journal with me i think it was the first time

1467
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:44,960
i used it and i had like a lot of time to sketch buildings and and architecture and

1468
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:52,080
paintings in galleries and i'm like i i drawing stuff from life i know people say if you want

1469
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:58,320
to get better drawing you need to draw from life you need to do it but like people don't say that

1470
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:03,680
it is really cool and makes you appreciate things like people never say that they say if you want

1471
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:09,120
to be able to draw anime boobies you have to draw from life that's what is that's the end goal anime

1472
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:14,960
boobies all the time like it i would rather learn how to draw buildings really well yeah there's just

1473
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:20,240
so much better i drew so many fucking buildings it was it absolute blast it was incredible i loved it

1474
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:26,480
yeah dude like and for the two of you listening to this podcast who aren't wannabe artists you

1475
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:31,600
can take any profession by taking inspiration from life you can bring an artistic mindset into

1476
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:37,680
anything i remember watching the fucking vox video about uh like the newer generation of japanese

1477
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:44,080
bullet trains which like take their aerodynamic design inspiration from like the wingspan of

1478
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:49,840
owls and like the smooth floppy belly of penguins and like there's a certain kind of bird that's

1479
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:55,040
really good at diving into the into the water and they like they took inspiration from its beak

1480
01:48:55,040 --> 01:49:01,440
to like design their bullet train to sift through the air faster that's fucking engineering oh yeah

1481
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:07,600
i love i love robots based on the classic scene in any action like sci-fi movie where like the

1482
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,760
character is like thinking how do i solve the mystery and then like something happens in his

1483
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:17,440
house or like he sees a thing outside that makes him think exactly that's what i need to do to

1484
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:25,200
solve the problem in an abstract way in which i creatively thought of that's codes uh you ever

1485
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:31,600
seen those like those those robots uh that are like um like centipedes like each segment can move

1486
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:37,280
on its own but when you connect them they can move like a centipede yeah once or twice i think i i

1487
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:43,280
love and then there's like um uh like dragonfly robots that like they just they take things from

1488
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:47,200
nature and they try to turn them into robots so that basically you can just have a pet dragonfly

1489
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:51,360
and you can have it drop out in bombs if only if you want if you want to do that remember in uh

1490
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:56,960
laputa how like the the weird flyers that they use flew like dragonflies as opposed to like uh

1491
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:03,520
you know guys i've got an idea for radcon six and it will call it whoa is that what we're doing

1492
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:12,480
we'll call it well i mean you know when we get to number six uh it'll be radcon 60 it'll be radcon

1493
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:19,520
666 and the joke will be that we were gonna call it radcon 66 because the premise is that we would

1494
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:26,880
be driving down route 66 except we won't do it on route 66 instead we'll follow a random train

1495
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:35,520
a random a random abandoned uh railroad through all of uh some part of western america because

1496
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,720
all along the railroad tracks we're so sick like that all along the railroad tracks in in the west

1497
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:46,480
are ghost towns everywhere because back back when they built the railroads they built all these

1498
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:51,520
towns around the railroads like thinking oh railroads are fucking the center of commerce

1499
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,360
and then as soon as we invented cars railroads were completely fucking worthless and a lot of

1500
01:50:55,360 --> 01:51:00,240
those towns were abandoned and so there is no tourist shit there it's just super fucking

1501
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:04,320
interesting history everywhere of crazy ass abandoned towns where you can go and just do

1502
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:08,480
anything are you saying that that we should get one of those like like you push one side you pull

1503
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:13,200
the other like one of those like squeaky things get the whole crew on that now that's a good idea

1504
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:18,080
but i just want to point out if we skip out on the calling it radcon 66 we can't do an epic joke

1505
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:28,160
where you put uh execute radcon 66 you know when you enunciate that you made the audio sound different

1506
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:32,160
because you knew that yeah because it would be my voice dubbing over it is what it would be

1507
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:40,080
like that's the only joke you could do with 66 whereas you could do a million jokes with 666

1508
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:45,200
like it's an enormous wellspring of digi i thought that joke you were going to do was yeah radcon

1509
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:54,560
6 known as radcon 3 in america that's a good dude i totally think that would be the one where we

1510
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:59,200
go to japan where we don't stay anywhere it's just a travel log and that's how we get all of the

1511
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:03,520
content and that's sort of what i was that's what i was imagining with that it would be like a it

1512
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:08,080
would be a big road trip through the american heartland because the main the main reason why i

1513
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:15,680
would have uh like trepidations about go of doing the true american dream fallout irl is that it is

1514
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:21,280
kind of dangerous and i can't respawn in real life and so the only reason that i'd be trepidation i

1515
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:26,080
have trepidation about nuking america and starting a post apocalyptic world because you know i mean

1516
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:32,080
there's some downsides but if it's in a group and there's nine strong severely autistic men

1517
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:37,600
binding their powers no and they'll be afraid of us we got that season strength that's true

1518
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:44,000
we would be the gang of super mutants wandering the land i just want to if we do if we do get one

1519
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,320
of those train things where you push and pull will be jacked by the end that's true i think we're

1520
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:53,040
probably about to wrap up right now before or really you know the the talking about this section

1521
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:59,440
i just want to mention that it i don't want to hear fucking a single word out of any of you

1522
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:06,320
foreigner pieces and shit being like oh americans are so fucking patriotic i can't stand it and then

1523
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:11,120
you have a nervous breakdown when you go to fucking idly and there's this in the center of town it's

1524
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:16,320
called the altar of patriotism and no matter where you fucking stand there's always a tricolor within

1525
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:21,840
your fucking prayer for you vision tongues are so fucking like like it's just that building is bad

1526
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,520
i know it's that what a tourist try do you want to hear about being patriotic but not that much

1527
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,400
you want to hear about being patriotic though what's that again i want to hear about being patriotic

1528
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,640
and the thing that you can literally get fined if you don't raise your flag during special holidays

1529
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:40,880
well it's not a problem by the way i don't have a problem with people i i don't have a problem

1530
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,240
seeing the italian tricolor because it's fucking history and it's important and i like it but i don't

1531
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:49,600
want to hear anyone be like oh america and then fucking shitting themselves that the reason the

1532
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:54,960
reason well i think the reason american patriotism is made fun of is because it feels tacky like look

1533
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:00,720
at that building that is fucking sick look america doesn't have buildings like that if you go to dc

1534
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:06,560
no it's fake it's just a it's just cardboard cutouts it's a bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro

1535
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:11,760
bonas all the way down to a lady gaga concert in washington dc we were just ran like literally

1536
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:18,080
wandering random sidewalks and it looked like anor londo like what the fuck is going on everything

1537
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:24,080
is taller than life and bigger than god it's it's just it's a it's an underdog mentality 100% like

1538
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:28,960
the reason why americans being proud of america isn't like it's because we're too good it's because

1539
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,360
we're too powerful and the same reason why nobody wants to hear white people going on about being

1540
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:37,520
proud about being white it's because like all right guys we get it uh please stop you know this

1541
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:42,320
is embarrassing uh you know it would not a good look no i'm not making anybody real comfortable

1542
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:46,880
here with with this talk here uh even though it is in fact fine to be white and to think that it's

1543
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:52,640
yeah 75 years from now when we're living neck deep in the china apocalypse uh everyone every

1544
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:57,680
fucking person around the world is going to be able to go uh yeah remember the american era you know

1545
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:04,480
and shit like everyone eventually probably yeah you know in in that sense um thinking that black

1546
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:09,600
pride is okay is kind of racist because you're belittling the people who you know in a way it is

1547
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:14,000
in a way black people are lesser so they can have their pride dude i recently watched it's sort of

1548
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,840
that bigotry of low expectations it's that it's in that ballpark it's not ballpark i recently

1549
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:22,800
watched a video called how africa is becoming china's china which is that now that china is

1550
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,600
becoming less poor it's now more difficult for them to be the sweatshop zone so they're turning

1551
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:32,720
africa into the sweatshop zone in exchange for votes and that sounds like that sounds like progress

1552
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:37,360
to me i know right the whole world's leveling up we're all going one i know right so that's

1553
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:42,080
capitalism for you baby there it goes there it goes and then eventually every country will be rich

1554
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:47,360
enough and now who's going to make our fucking like plastic toys and things that like you press

1555
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,000
these little pimples and you put them on the floor and they pop back up the mole man those inferior

1556
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:56,080
mole man below the surface of the earth oh i was thinking child labor but before i well i mean

1557
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:02,720
ideally we'll get to a point where the people at the top have enough money that they don't need to

1558
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:09,120
rely on this as the only way to make money you know something like that but who knows but i

1559
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:14,000
want to talk about still i think we should probably i mean i mean what else are we gonna

1560
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,080
say here do you want to say you want to save a bunch of the shit like hippo you want to save

1561
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:24,880
your camping trip stories for next time um i mean i do because i feel like it will spiral into a

1562
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:29,680
long conversation about stuff okay next time did you hear we gotta fucking talk about city playing

1563
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:35,680
because i have a lot of thoughts about going to roam i'm gladly hey i have a quick aside uh i just

1564
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:40,000
wanted to give everybody an update from something that we talked about in the last episode this is

1565
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:47,840
technically the post main topic review period i did canonically uh uh there this so i let me

1566
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:54,160
huel everybody i did in fact get huel i've been drinking it for like a week now one meal a day

1567
01:56:54,160 --> 01:56:58,640
as as is recommended and then after a week you can go up to two meals a day uh so this morning

1568
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:04,960
i just went for a run uh did some pokemon going came home got my huel on and it was a lovely

1569
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,560
experience isn't it fucking dope it's it is it's great i really like it it doesn't even taste bad

1570
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:17,440
right i read a bit about huel and they yeah to put it in nicer words you can't have your regular

1571
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:23,680
bowel movements oh what that is mage is when you make a hard turn and you you massively adjust your

1572
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:28,720
diet to start doing huel immediately yeah like you're because your gut bacteria has adjusted the

1573
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:33,040
kind of diet you've been eating up to that point it can cause an issue just like you're a vegetarian

1574
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:37,520
for a long time and then you eat me to follow up on uh since the whole reason we pushed the show

1575
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:43,520
back was to address comments and we've like never done it uh someone from canada was saying that

1576
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:50,560
they really want to be a post food boy and drink huel but apparently because of the fact that canada

1577
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:55,920
considers it a meal replacement in their laws and and and not as a supplement or whatever

1578
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:01,920
there's like it needs to have a certain minimum amount of vitamin d that it doesn't reach and so

1579
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,800
it's it's to tariffs are too high or something so they don't send it to can i remember one

1580
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:12,480
advertise itself as a meal replacement right that's the problem i mean it absolutely does but i mean

1581
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:16,960
these are just legal technicalities as to what it's classified as i want to put out a hit list

1582
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:23,520
for anyone who drinks huel they are anti-culture anti-american anti-human what is it i am i am

1583
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:30,000
across the board anti-culture 100% i want to be closer to huel is a drink that is a meal like

1584
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,680
it's like just a meal and a drink basically and it's like everything you need

1585
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,880
yep yeah and it's great it's literally living off of it for most of his meals

1586
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,080
ever since ever since i first i know i mentioned this a long time ago but ever since i first saw

1587
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:51,120
the matrix and there was that that clip in the matrix where they have their food and the the

1588
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:56,880
like the the the the handsome black fellow just squirts out a little bit of juice for neo and

1589
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:01,600
he's just like there you go everything your body needs and they were all like ew gross i don't

1590
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:06,800
want that and i was like everything my body needs yes please sign me up that's all i want

1591
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:12,160
fuck food fuck cooking i hate it here's the one thing i do have stock home syndrome okay

1592
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:20,960
is food right yeah you all do you all do release i find that disgusting mostly because i i i have

1593
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,080
like lived my life thinking man i really better get good at good at cooking i see people who make

1594
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:32,800
good food my dad makes good food i like good food i like fools i watch cooking shows i want to do

1595
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,200
that and then to suddenly be you know there's an option like now you don't need food i'm like

1596
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:43,680
you're the same people who like who you know as soon as like i learned how to do a skill it's now

1597
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:49,200
like defunct like now i have to have have done a computer science degree and now my other degrees

1598
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,200
are useless like fuck off i'll just keep doing it i don't care there was another comment on the

1599
01:59:53,200 --> 02:00:00,000
last video that uh that that was funny where he was basically criticizing everyone for just like

1600
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:04,640
so out of hand being like fuck cooking because he was like cooking's fun and it's cool and it's a

1601
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:10,880
thing to do and i like it and uh and i but i thought he was specifically talking about

1602
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:15,600
Nate and how like Nate just seems to like want to replace everything and i responded to him

1603
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:21,280
with Nate everything is such a process that i'm not surprised he would want to cut some of them out

1604
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:26,320
like right i feel like it would take you longer to do cooking than it would normally take someone

1605
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:31,200
to do cooking i've noticed it it's about getting in the right headspace it like takes me longer to

1606
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:36,800
like edit a random thing for like gib can edit a potty cast episode way faster than me for some

1607
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:41,520
reason that i just don't understand everything you do just has more steps i think like i think

1608
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:46,880
see it now i can see i am an autistic young man i can see me getting all the ingredients putting

1609
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,880
them all together getting everything like in the oven and then taking the oven and put it in sony

1610
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,520
vegas and have all these fucking transitions yeah whatever i'm whatever i'm doing anything

1611
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,080
i have to break it down into the component steps so that i know exactly what i'm doing if i'm like

1612
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:04,720
making progress etc i'm sure people who are just like better at getting things done right out of

1613
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:09,920
the box true yeah like here's i say the cooking is fun here's my cooking process first i think

1614
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:15,280
yeah do i want it to be something that's fried i say yes what pans are not currently dirty well

1615
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:19,920
here's a pan that is kind of dirty but like you know if it's if it gets to boiling then all the

1616
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:25,120
germs are cleaned right so okay i'll just use the oil that's already on it some actual restaurants

1617
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:29,360
just keep using the same grease for like decades i've had donuts that were cooked that way so i'll

1618
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,000
just use that nice i turned it on and as it's heating up i then look in the freezer to see

1619
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,880
which meats i want to cook and then i just put them on there and i just keep putting ingredients

1620
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:44,080
until it's done yeah for me it's like i open the freezer and there's like five different varieties

1621
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:50,080
of asian steamed buns and i decide if i want the okay i can confirm this is true do i want the

1622
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:57,440
octopus uh shumai or do i want the crab rangoon thing or do i want the pork steamed bun or do i

1623
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:03,760
want the you know i've just got like one of each meat one being octopus which is the best one

1624
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:08,720
and then i just steam that shit for 10 minutes and it's done and i eat it and it's delicious

1625
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:17,280
it's like hill but it has flavor it's it is not to be overstated how good the food in idly is

1626
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:22,240
aside from obviously all the tourist traps that are shit and try and be like hamburger you'll get

1627
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:26,320
your hamburger with the spaghetti on it and they try and trick you into hamburgers when you're idly

1628
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:32,800
aside from all that shit food in idly is unbelievable uh there is a fucking it the reason

1629
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:37,760
wait wait the reason pro food the reason pro food no munchie i need i need to clarify this

1630
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:46,960
uh because because we have history idly versus idly go okay ironically the best taggateli i've

1631
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:55,280
had has been at idly because whoa because because okay because everything in okay okay here's the

1632
02:02:55,280 --> 02:03:02,080
difference between the the ragu in idly versus uh the ragu in idly uh because the idly is almost

1633
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:07,840
like a shred beef sort of like beef stew-esque uh uh what do you call it meat and it goes really well

1634
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,960
with the sauce because it's really hot and stuff and you know it's almost like a like a soupy little

1635
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:19,280
mess of pasta but the ragu the beef ragu in idly is more like a ground beef and i don't i really

1636
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:24,880
dislike the the texture having the the ground beef-esque uh uh in the sauce and i just like it

1637
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:29,760
but aside from all that here's a fucking here's a new dish i haven't even heard of before that

1638
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:34,080
is fucking delicious what what is it Nate what do you want i i've got okay can i take a huge

1639
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:38,400
tangent here no i just remembered a great story is what you're talking about interesting at all

1640
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:42,880
because this is better yeah no i yeah it is okay i was gonna say it real quick okay there's a new

1641
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:48,320
fucking dish and it's fucking delicious it's what i've always wanted you may you may call me queer

1642
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:53,200
you may call me fucking insane but i've always wanted this a condiment yeah i want to add something

1643
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:58,000
to the pantheon of condiments you got your Zeus ketchup you've got your fucking Poseidon ketchup

1644
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,240
i want to add pantheon of gods right there you may call me queer and insane i want to add

1645
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:07,280
egg yolk to that i want egg yolk to be a common condiment that you did before your french fries

1646
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:12,000
or you know steak and whenever you have steak and eggs we have steak and eggs you fucking cut open

1647
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,680
the the yolk and you dip your steak in it and it's fucking delicious and what they have in idly

1648
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:22,400
they have a pasta that's instead of sauce it's egg yolk they have egg yolk pasta and it's okay it's

1649
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:27,840
egg yolks it's a little bit of cheese it's a lot of pasta and then it's bacon and black pepper

1650
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:33,520
and it's called carbonara and it's delicious and it's fucking good it's so good it's so good

1651
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:38,080
there's a lot of times where i make a hamburger i make a hamburger and i fry an egg to put on the

1652
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:43,600
hamburger right that's the way and and if i cook the egg just ever so perfectly the first bite will

1653
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:48,960
release the yolk and it will soak the meat and it'll get down to the bun which if it the if the

1654
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:53,840
bun has been sufficiently mayonnaiseed which creates a seal it will not soak through the bun

1655
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:59,360
entirely and you have created a fucking immaculate orgasmic food product i never even considered

1656
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:03,840
that you could seal the fucking bun with mayonnaise that's what out in brown on good eats said that's

1657
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:09,040
why you put the mayonnaise on the bun oh man i'm so fucking hungry i gotta get some food after this

1658
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:13,920
all right strap in for the story of a fucking lifetime everybody all right here it comes here

1659
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:19,600
it comes okay so so uh my girlfriend was just at her job the other day this is the story through

1660
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:25,200
her but you'll you'll trust me this is worth it it relates to me so it's still good uh so she's

1661
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,560
she's just she's at work or whatever doing her thing and then like because she's an attractive

1662
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,560
young lady uh like a guy just comes up to her it's like hey what's up starts chatting her up

1663
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:38,000
um uh eventually uh he asked like oh so like oh you moved here from hawaii that's crazy why'd you

1664
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,360
move here and she says well i moved here like for a guy uh and and he's just like oh wow pretty

1665
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:46,880
that's pretty cool and then that just like passes for a while eventually because this guy

1666
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,280
obviously is way into her he brings it up a few more times just like what is this guy like how

1667
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:55,760
did he how do you pull this off like what exactly is the deal here and uh she's just like well you

1668
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:02,720
know like whatever i like how did he win you object what do i have to win you now basically

1669
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:08,000
basically and so uh it culminates with um she's just like well you know i moved for a guy like

1670
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,720
he's a youtuber i like him a lot he's really cool and he's like uh he's a youtuber but uh

1671
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:22,240

1672
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:29,920
and struts off and struts off disgusting this actually happened this actually happened wow you

1674
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:43,120

1675
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:48,240
you at you like come on i'm like what's what night like is that what you're not even a real

1676

1677
02:06:52,560 --> 02:07:00,400
play fortnite when you look at me anyway that was it i thought you'd all enjoy that is it fortnite

1678
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:06,000
is it fortnite like the like the shitty free version of another even more it's actually

1679
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:12,000
it's the better free version uh you could call it it's it's legitimately a good game but it is very

1680
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,680
like kitty i could not everybody love we have interested it it's it's the natural progression

1681
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:26,240
of minecraft x overwatch no i i know that because i saw my uh my um maize like autistic cousin who's

1682
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:31,360
like 12 playing it and everyone has an autistic cousin because our families are

1683
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:40,480
i don't know if you've noticed but we are a cabal of autists on the internet and everyone in our

1684
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:46,640
family is probably closer on the spectrum to that side you know i have a plan to think about

1685
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:52,240
everyone in your family and slowly realize oh shit all autistic oh fuck it all makes sense i'm from a

1686
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:58,960
i'm from a family of mega normies and uh me and ben stand out like gigantic sore thumbs from like

1687
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:05,440
the rest of our family wait hold on nate your dad studies psychology and hippo your dad is like a

1688
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:10,480
multi instrumentalist who's like like a musical expert like these are both like highly autistic

1689
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:16,960
hobbies you know what my dad my dad is by far the most educated of like our family so he does

1690
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:21,760
stand out as like i you know i'm not to be mean to them but like the smartest one of the bunch

1691
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:28,640
so i guess that trickled down into like into me who is the smartest of this bunch the intellectual

1692
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:36,560
guys that are me and ben if autistic if autistic just means like good then yes i mean by our standards

1693
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:42,240
it probably does like i would think that what we value is things that are more on the like i mean

1694
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:48,240
look at einstein like if einstein's work was helped by having autism as opposed to not having autism

1695
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:52,160
it was a good isn't the way that autism works is that like a lot of parts of your brain don't

1696
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:56,400
work right or don't get enough like fucking attention and therefore you over develop other

1697
02:08:56,400 --> 02:09:01,280
parts it's sort of like being blind will make you hear better and vice versa yeah that's how it works

1698
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:07,200
right i don't know i feel like this is another this is another situation where digi is just using

1699
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:12,000
a word in a way that it doesn't actually mean you know what it is it's um language is all broken

1700
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,600
and wrong and i'm the only one yeah i agree digi i just want to say i am so sad digi that you were

1701
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:22,560
not here for the episode on language where these fucking bullies were just laying into me for for

1702
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:27,120
having objections with the concept of language and you come in here later arguing the exact same

1703
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:32,880
point sorry i wanted to be on that one i wish i had been i hate language it's an authoritative

1704
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:39,280
practice of bullshit and and lies and it all it does is cause problems for humanity it also

1705
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:45,680
causes all the solutions but it also causes all the problems there are right now right now like

1706
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:50,320
another like like right now uh another two hours i don't know the podcast language to

1707
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:57,680
all right let's let's make language to oh oh italyans are really funny because of language

1708
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:04,160
because a lot of their food is just foreign words but spoken in italyan so so you have a

1709
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:09,760
spaghetti you you you have a florist is called bestaica and you know what it is it's beef steak

1710
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:15,040
but it's bestaica that's like a high that's how japanese is too with all the like yeah

1711
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:22,800
young tea steaky um beautiful that's all we need to fucking oh yeah we gotta move along here

1712
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,040
whatever let's go let's go let's go all right all right because i have a lot of fucking shit to

1713
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:32,560
say still yeah are we on questions now or do we still have like songs to do or now there that's

1714
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:37,360
a good good question there is so there was one final opportunity for people because the deadline was

1715
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:43,280
the 31st of july which we are now past so the contest entries are over there's no more but

1716
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:49,760
we gave people a small window now i hate to say it but one person submitted their entry on august

1717
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:55,600
first after the deadline there was one final entry here's what i thought we could do we can't

1718
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:59,760
accept it as the winner but i thought we might just play it on the show just because he made it

1719
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:03,280
i don't have a problem with that it won't be formally in the running to win but i thought that

1720
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:09,360
might be nice let's go for it okay uh what if it's the best one now let me see this is by i know i

1721
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:15,680
hope it's not literally the best one it's by at moss spheres moss spheres yeah whatever and it's

1722
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:22,640
called um pc it's like a pc ph e me so something about that name you should write me that i'm slave

1723
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:25,760
to the knight's government and there's nothing i can do something about i don't i don't know what

1724
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:31,920
but i just remember uh sounds good all right here we go uh listen to pc theme here we go

1725
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:44,880
this will have to be the menu screen music for the pc prpg it's a good one oh oh it's building

1726
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:48,960
no this is the kingdom house trailer for pc basically oh this is three minutes long

1727
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:58,800
it's got the slow start i don't know how this in any way reflects the pcp not to be rude but i think

1728
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:04,000
this might be a repurposed song it sounds like it was made for a video game it sounds like it's

1729
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:13,360
like steven universe sort of it does actually uh pc and pirachu it would be like an actual piano

1730
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:18,720
though why is there not a political compass for the pcp instead of like like you know left right

1731
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:24,160
it's gay and dead and then you can have the there oh my god what would well you have to have four

1732
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:30,480
things right gay dead what what's the other axis well i mean brony and gay and dead would have been

1733
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:35,600
we but gay and dead couldn't be on two opposite ends of the axis because just because like the idea is

1734
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:43,680
that you're both at once so like yeah so you know edgy that could be alive and they would be alive

1735
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:50,240
and straight did you yeah didn't i i literally made a four-quadrant alignment of us of edginess and oh

1736
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:56,160
yeah i remember when you put me as way more edgy and like right wing than monkey which is yes i did

1737
02:12:56,160 --> 02:13:03,440
you know fair enough fair enough um i thought this was gonna like ramp up but it's just yeah

1738
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:10,160
it's changing it's just a fucking regular ass song man it's it's like it's just it's okay you know

1739
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:16,240
what it's like a hollow night background yeah yeah i hate to cut you off a first heron a k whatever

1740
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:23,440
but i think we've heard enough and it will be killed you and you will be destroyed you know uh i'm

1741
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:27,680
kind of glad that it wasn't something that would really want to seriously consider as oh you have

1742
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:33,680
to say that you don't have to say it like that no well all right all right let's get to some cool

1743
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:38,400
ass questions all right chip wise men who asked if kirby sucked you up and devoured your soul

1744
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:42,560
what a thousand times before i don't know why people upload that would you say that a thousand

1745
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,040
well i that's that's that's like the what what is your favorite anime question paradox

1746
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:53,440
crocs ask what's the next big thing you're saving up for uh like that's what you're saying or like

1747
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:57,440
artistically like what you're what you're going to be making i think that's really funny that's

1748
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:05,600
what yeah uh a computer i already bought a laptop uh and i'm gonna buy a desktop soon good nice uh

1749
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:12,080
probably having money and then after that uh going to the dentist because i'm getting a lot of i'm

1750
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:17,200
getting a lot of dark spots and it's starting to look it's probably still not cavity it's probably

1751
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:22,080
just standing because i drink fucking coffee constantly but don't get braces if you get braces

1752
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:27,680
you're literally cuck and it will destroy you no braces i already had braces for years i already

1753
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:32,000
had braces for years and then i stopped wearing the retainer and they're getting a little bit

1754
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,160
crowded again i still haven't had my fucking wisdom teeth taken out so my mouth is still kind of a

1755
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:40,880
fucking mess yeah i should probably go to the dentist or not right now having some gum pain

1756
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:46,960
it's a it's a scam well it's well did you unlike you i actually brushed my teeth and floss and

1757
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:53,040
mouthwash i don't know why so that's good that's good the next thing i'm saving up for is uh tom

1758
02:14:53,040 --> 02:15:00,720
taught me that there are now like 16 core processors that you can get for 800 bucks and uh so i mean

1759
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:06,960
that's not the next big thing is the next big thing is my taxes but after that 16 core processors

1760
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:11,440
all that's on my mind yeah i remember you telling me it's like i'll do you can like fucking render

1761
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:16,160
three times as fast if you use these and it's like yeah or you could have like just use adobe

1762
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:20,400
premiere which renders three times faster than vegas the cpu that you recognize that even true was

1763
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:26,480
that a 16 core was yeah it kind of is like anytime ben used i initially recommended you a 16 core

1764
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:30,880
date and you were like that's too expensive i don't need that oh yeah i think i took like the one

1765
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,480
below that because that was like i mean the one you pointed was like 1500 bucks or something i think

1766
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:39,680
like whatever time that was like this the super intro one there's there's an amd one that's like

1767
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:47,680
a little bit less expensive but still yeah so yeah yeah there's things there's things i mean i know

1768
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:53,040
what i'm the i the main thing i'm saving up for is i have already decided a certain threshold of money

1769
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:58,080
that i need to save before i'm comfortable going full-time youtubeing uh so once i reach that that

1770
02:15:58,080 --> 02:16:04,000
'll be pretty good did you read even that read from your speeds uh it will it can render like

1771
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:10,800
one and a half minutes of pretty advanced video per minute which vegas is a lot slower than but

1772
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:15,520
did you see is really invested in this idea of vegas being the really the really easy and convenient

1773
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:19,840
editing program i know it's really the same as premiere don't frame it that i am actually invested

1774
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:25,440
in that that is just a thing i tell people so that they will start making videos like i don't

1775
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:30,480
actually believe that vegas is in any way superior to premiere it's just the one i know i think it's

1776
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:34,880
a little easier to use um that's something it's just it's just so immediate like you can literally

1777
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:39,920
look at vegas and understand how to edit like in my opinion yeah but maybe it's just the way my brain

1778
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:46,960
works but like i agree i i do think that i would encourage people to if you you know want to make

1779
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:52,480
the next step to level up to the more advanced programs but like when people are on twitter

1780
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:56,720
being like uh i don't know how to edit i'm like download vegas and look at it and you'll know

1781
02:16:56,720 --> 02:17:01,920
how to edit it i just don't respond to that i'm like i'm like the old uh uh uh the the ancient

1782
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,360
martial arts master living on the top of the mountain if you're not willing to climb the

1783
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:10,400
mountain to get to me to you know prove that you're really committed to it already uh you know

1784
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:16,960
fuck it just give literally google it you know figure it out so sony vegas is it it can do most

1785
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:21,920
things pretty well and it is like pretty understandable to use like to move a thing

1786
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:27,040
across the screen you'd go into i hate you and you can drag it around it sucks they're in another

1787
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:35,760
yeah it's oh it's terrible okay it's i'm speaking i'm speaking right now um but so uh uh at some

1788
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:41,200
point in sony vegas you will come up to a wall uh if you you know if you get used to it and you're

1789
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:46,720
like okay i want to do this sort of effect i've seen it done before how does it get done and it

1790
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:53,200
doesn't exist and that is when you have to make the program to premiere and after that you'll think

1791
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:59,280
oh i want to do this a thing uh but it doesn't happen in there so how do i do that you go to

1792
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:03,280
after effects and that's just like those the two pretty much figured that out because of

1793
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:09,680
nate doing that effect where he makes the screen like balloon open and then pop like oh yeah and

1794
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:14,800
when i first saw him do that i was just like sasuga premiere like this must be what the next stage is

1795
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:19,920
you know everyone just needs to use hitfilm express it's like it's like after effects and premiere

1796
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:23,760
but free arm achieve the entirety of arm and she was made into fucking hitfilm besides the last

1797
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:28,800
few episodes which ethan made in vegas but like the majority okay what what what what was the question

1798
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:32,640
i don't think it was what are you saving up money for i don't think tom answered yet oh yeah or an

1799
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:40,480
apartment that's a good one that's a good one uh i'm i'm not really saving up for any like

1800
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:46,400
money thing like of course it would be nice to have money so that i could get an apartment but

1801
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:53,840
i'm not like i don't see like more than you know getting the money i'm i'm worrying about like

1802
02:18:53,840 --> 02:19:01,920
having a way to get the money like creatively like doing the thing i'm i'm i'm in a creative like uh

1803
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:08,080
you know not a rut but like i'm i'm figuring things out and i'm getting getting going on that

1804
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:13,840
real stuff creatively go to like monster dot com and just search for like jobs i can do with them

1805
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:20,320
i have all right i'm kidding dude i'm kidding i have all right i have a right is about monster

1806
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:29,040
dot com eat shit and suck a penis i have a job it's just um i'm not really thinking about

1807
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:35,120
like saving up i'm just i'm just thinking about like day taking one day at a time like figuring

1808
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:41,440
freaking out things but i guess i guess what the like a thing i kind of want recently i i had this

1809
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:48,400
idea that you know fruity loops uh makes me cry um so i i want uh well i fell studio as it's now

1810
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:55,120
called i mean that's what it's like yeah and um i wanted to get one of those like

1811
02:19:55,120 --> 02:20:00,640
musician keyboards the ones that they have on their desk instead of on a keyboard stand that is

1812
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,800
that doesn't have weighted keys and it you plug it into the computer you can make midi songs with

1813
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:10,320
it or you can just use it in programs like that instead of having to click you definitely do that

1814
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:15,200
you you play it on something i wanted for a really long time and tom had one and was gonna

1815
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:21,520
sell it to me but i didn't end up buying it this was like five years ago though uh they're cool i want

1816
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:28,800
if any music men are in the audience and i know there are um please give me your your your your

1817
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:33,600
your recommendations of like how how to get into that sort of thing because i have no idea what

1818
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:39,280
here's a super fucking circle jerky question by me manifest what is a character trait you wish

1819
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:44,000
you could inherit from the other members oh character trait

1820
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:52,640
hmm i wish i had sighs good news i think we all get it what was the question

1821
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:55,680
what is a character trait you wish you could inherit from the other members

1822
02:20:56,800 --> 02:21:04,720
um nates diligence i want jeff's height oh yeah you know what i think i probably the most would

1823
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:12,480
be nates relentlessness yes relentlessness that's it what what to do things and doing them

1824
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:19,360
it's it's the best yeah i guess if you could if you could take a piece from a person but not their

1825
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:23,840
entire personality then it's great you just take all the best bits and leave all the bad bits

1826
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:30,560
oh it's a lot oh yeah i would love that i would love i would love instead of me if if you were to

1827
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:34,240
like try and take my mind like lay would be like lost in translation like if you tried to like

1828
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:39,040
reach inside my mind take it out by force like the moment you like relinquish it from the inner

1829
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:43,920
like like from me in my skull it will like instantly deteriorate and like turn to dust

1830
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:52,560
i believe that i i would really like digi's lack of inhibitions uh like to do the sort of like

1831
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:57,520
videos where you're you're you're being like yeah i'm a cringy who cares i'm doing all this stuff

1832
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:03,440
and it's and it's like it the confidence is the funny thing about that is that i i feel as though i

1833
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:11,120
have only very recently like actually had no inhibitions like like i've started being shirtless

1834
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:17,680
in videos and i was terrified to ever be shirtless in a video until recently and but it was it it

1835
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:21,920
always fucked with me because tons of people are shirtless in videos all the time like lots of

1836
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:27,440
youtubers i follow they do it for comedy or just because like no one gives a fuck like victor's

1837
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:32,720
shirtless in every video he's in so i like it's just that i have body image problems so i didn't

1838
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:37,120
want to be shirtless you know and then at some point i just went out fuck it like i don't give a

1839
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:47,040
shit anymore um so i'd like a lot of tom's uh just like savviness mustache of like just a lot of

1840
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:52,800
information that tom has uh would be very useful and i always find myself going to tom to ask like

1841
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:56,720
business or technical questions same i feel like that would be very very useful i don't want that

1842
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:02,240
stuff though because i like having a guy who knows that stuff like i just like to be able to consult

1843
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:06,960
the guy so that i because to me that's that stuff becomes very time consuming if you actually

1844
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:11,920
keep track of it like tech is replaced so often that it's like i just don't want to have to know

1845
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:16,800
any of it until the moment that it's like i need to start charging all of you for this because

1846
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:21,040
i'm wasting my time i need to take your money did you i see that you're stuck in the same like

1847
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:26,000
paradox that i am i keep running through every attractive attribute of each of these members

1848
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:34,560
and then i i can't decouple the attribute from the life path required to obtain it and so then i

1849
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:39,440
have to keep rewriting my own life and i'm like well i don't want to be that different of a person

1850
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:46,320
and so i'm kind of stuck i can't make any decisions yeah i would i i would also like davoo's um ability

1851
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:52,480
to use language effectively in small videos where he explains points because i i stumble across i

1852
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:58,560
stumble upon words oh i do and i don't make points i just i start them like 12 times until

1853
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:02,720
eventually it comes out right yeah so every vlog you've ever seen at short it's like the 20th take

1854
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:08,320
not even exaggerating yeah and also you edit the shit out of the audio like i know when you do just

1855
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:14,320
audio there's like hours cut from them sometimes this might lead to some uncertain unforeseen

1856
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:19,120
consequences but i would like ben's pacifism to the like like he can just be in any scenario and

1857
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:25,920
not care like actually yeah happen to him pacifism isn't the word i would use but like his his

1858
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:37,760
his apathy apathy i just wish i had his ability to um like live on the lowest like he legit doesn't

1859
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:44,160
care about if he yeah the edge i guess it's the word i'm looking looking for like he he's just not

1860
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:48,480
afraid of having no safety net under him because he's like well what's the worst that can happen

1861
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:54,400
and it's like pretty much and the answer is always like the the answer is yeah the worst

1862
02:24:54,400 --> 02:25:01,120
like it happens not that bad like it's it's not hard to climb back up from a low point if you know

1863
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:07,120
how and i guess just because he is he just has that intellect that he could like i mean he's

1864
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:13,600
worked as a fucking scientist before so it's like i know i can go back there if i really want to but

1865
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:18,720
like that's so what's the worst that could ever happen you know it other than losing a limb or

1866
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:24,080
something like that but it's hard to like convince yourself that you know to actually like make

1867
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:31,200
decisions on that basis oh Nate Nate's uh i want Nate's um meme library in that he has in his

1868
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:35,680
brain that is a very helpful thing it helps a lot because because whenever i want to like have like

1869
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:40,880
a funny image on screen i i never know what to do i i don't i don't go to 4chan i don't i don't

1870
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:45,920
i save i even like when i was young i did it even more but i still possibly even more than ever

1871
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:51,120
now i make an effort to save every funny meme images image that i think might even be useful

1872
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:54,880
potentially it's a real habit that i'm glad i did you know what i want to note Nate how do you

1873
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:57,920
organize your computer files because right now i'm getting your computer so i want to transfer

1874
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:02,000
all my files and i and i want to make these my computer to mess right now how do you organize

1875
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:09,120
you know images uh well specifically with the so i some people go are are really meticulous about

1876
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:13,920
like grouping like okay pepe images go in the pepe reaction image folder okay my my transparent

1877
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:19,280
pngs that i can use for the particulars like effect on 4chan those go in like this folder

1878
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:25,520
i gave up on that and instead i gave myself the freedom just i literally put them all in one

1879
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:30,400
folder and what i do is i go there i scroll to a random section and i just look for something

1880
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:35,280
so i get a lot of spontaneity with like the stuff that i end up using or like i had a feeling that

1881
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:39,840
was how you did it from the way that you tend to send images because there's no like consistent

1882
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:44,640
formula it's like it's all over the place it's all over the place i'm not like those like some

1883
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:48,960
people are like currently is i just have a 4chan folder and the inside that there's a different

1884
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:52,240
folder for each board and then i separate by board and then i just put all the images that i

1885
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,960
get that makes sense that one folder that makes sense i just i pretty much everything is like

1886
02:26:56,960 --> 02:27:02,240
from v i'm on v way more than like every other board all right i wish i had everything i have

1887
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:07,440
from like a decade ago back when i actually i've made never to say i can be bothered to make me

1888
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:12,880
folder i tried i really tried but then just like i can be bothered oh hey i just wanted to say on

1889
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:18,320
the 71 ben was relevant i did want to say one thing about ben um well i am a very i consider

1890
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:24,880
myself a very diplomatic person and i really don't try to burn bridges uh just like just

1891
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:31,840
paradoxically i very much admire ben's willingness to burn bridges and his brutal honesty i like those

1892
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:35,840
a lot yeah i like their admirable quality i i've i've like whatever whenever there's something

1893
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:40,640
going on here or elsewhere i just wait for ben to roll up and say the thing that i don't want to

1894
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:47,360
have to be the guy right it's pretty great ben he he is not willing to make any concessions whatsoever

1895
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:53,920
on being himself and like granted he's a reasonable person with like he will he will listen to you

1896
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:59,120
and try to like say okay well if i agree with what you're saying i will acquiesce but if he

1897
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:05,680
doesn't agree he will in no way budge on anything and that's it's definitely something to be

1898
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:09,920
admired in that way all right i would rather just run away from conflict and just stop talking

1899
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:16,800
i decided how i would answer the question uh i want jesse's video game catalog and playing

1900
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:22,720
experiences and probably if i have to have it packaged his taste in video games as well

1901
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:29,840
so yeah because he's got he's got at least in the top three best taste in video games of people

1902
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:36,800
who i know who are the other two uh i think jim sterling's taste in video games is fascinating

1903
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:42,400
because of how much he likes convenience and doesn't like hard things convenience he's he worships curbie

1904
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:50,560
i know that and uh oh i don't know i kind of rank good taste based on interesting taste so maybe

1905
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:55,360
some sort of like amalgamation of razor fist and examined life of gaming as like the ultimate

1906
02:28:55,360 --> 02:29:00,960
gray brown boredom simulator oh i'm just gonna use the word amalgamation now i'll seem like a copy

1907
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:10,960
what were you gonna use it for mage i said i was i wanted to say that my personality is just

1908
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:18,400
amalgamation of bad choices so no one wants anything from me you know what i want i want

1909
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:28,400
hippo's dad give me your dad

1910
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:35,200
myself you can try maybe you can try but it's not gonna be easy for sure that'd be good you know

1911
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:44,720
what i want i want munchies youth i want i want 12 oh yeah you know i will say about mage though i

1912
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:50,880
do like mage's air of mystique i do that is pretty sick that is cool that is cool who is i don't

1913
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:58,720
know i don't even do it i would love well it's just natural i would love mage's past of being like

1914
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:06,320
a rough and rough and tumble knife wielding freak i want that i wish i wish i had like a weird

1915
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:11,680
past i want mage's super hero persona i just want to modify what you said like i do think that it would

1916
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:18,240
be nice to have mage's lack of having completely fucking docked myself on the internet and and

1917
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:24,640
everyone like knows what i look like and uh yeah that comes with costs it comes with costs

1918
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:31,760
i like hippo's like ability to make like these odd jokes but they're funny it's just it's the way

1919
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:38,480
they come come out of your mouth it's just the zingers yeah hippo's zingers are like the best

1920
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:45,120
in the world and his mind for puns is i love puns i love puns so much is so good i wish i was a

1921
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:51,280
circle jerk now uh yeah i like it we're two and a half hours in we want to have any other good

1922
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:56,640
questions let me just real quick find a pity question here uh what do we got what do we got um

1923
02:30:58,320 --> 02:31:05,040
i like a shitty question at sis white scum 69 asks uh evo is going on as you speak y'all

1924
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:09,440
gonna tune in does anyone care about evo no guys i don't uh i i care about fighting games

1925
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:14,960
i'm not gonna fuck cares about video games what a what a joke electronic it's it's fucking

1926
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:21,680
bodily that you nate can like play kingdom hearts and like play rpgs and then say leave

1927
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:27,920
legends a waste of time when like these super fucking long single player rpgs where you have no

1928
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:33,760
outside connection to the world is like a useful wasted time okay saying that like a long rpg is a

1929
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:39,040
waste of time is is in my mind is the same as saying and this might be true but it's like

1930
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:44,800
saying reading a long fantasy novel is a waste of time like you know it kind of is it kind of is

1931
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:52,160
well i i don't think either i mean there's there is no rpg that lasts nearly as long as what league

1932
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:58,000
of legends will take of your life like that's a reasonable point the absolute most time you ever

1933
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:03,840
when people talk about like super in-depth super long rpg so like dude 300 hours like that's the

1934
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:08,960
standard like i did absolutely everything i hundred percent of dysgaea i hundred percent of skyrim

1935
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:14,960
like 300 hours league of legends you can play 300 hours in like two weeks and then be playing it

1936
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:21,120
for 10 fucking years and something like that yeah i mean i played three years i played a whole

1937
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:26,400
disclosure i do speak as a person who's played team fortress two for 2700 hours

1938
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:32,800
shit on my ass and that's how it is for all those any of those games that people play as a

1939
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:37,760
lifestyle like that's the difference is like kingdom hearts you consume as a work of art with

1940
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:43,360
the message that that is just like watching an anime or or watching a movie you know it's just

1941
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:49,200
and like i went back i went back to esport and it's gay i went back to kingdom hearts like no

1942
02:32:49,200 --> 02:33:02,560
they're just i've been i've been i've been trying not to speak much this whole plot has but i want

1943
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:07,360
to say before i forget the point yeah go for it uh with the with the needs comparison with with uh

1944
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:14,160
with uh you know the whole long novel book thing like it's like you make a choice and like i think

1945
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:18,160
you don't really regret it's not a waste of time if you make a choice and you do it because you

1946
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:25,440
really want to but with like mmo's and stuff like that there's this sort of like a psychological

1947
02:33:25,440 --> 02:33:29,600
need to sort of log in every day and do a thing because you kind of need to you have to you

1948
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:35,280
you already invested so much why can't you why can't you you know you just kind of kind of have to

1949
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:39,600
keep going and that's like that's why i hate multiplayer games because i feel like i have

1950
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:43,680
to keep playing all the time to stay competitive so i can actually enjoy playing the game if i

1951
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:47,520
take a break from a multiplayer game and i get shitty then i'm just gonna get tooled on and then

1952
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:52,320
it's not fun anymore incidentally that's why i've never gotten into a multiplayer game because

1953
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:58,000
like i will the way i play video games is in one go like if it's a single player game i'm gonna

1954
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:02,480
play it in a day or two and be done with it and never look at it again so like with a with a game

1955
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:07,520
like say splatoon everyone loves it and everything and like i played it for like an hour one night

1956
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:12,080
and like an hour the next night and i went all right well i feel like i've played splatoon so

1957
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:17,520
that's done i play video games is the social aspect and specifically right that's the difference

1958
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:24,080
the appeal of dominating another human being to make another sure sure i just do that in my wraps

1959
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:32,080
dog i play video games i play video games yeah i was thinking you know i i used to play a lot of

1960
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:38,800
mmo rpgs like a lot of mmo rpgs i used to hop from mmo rpgs to another one like within months

1961
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:44,480
sometimes we could depending on how interesting it was the thing of i managed to sort of like

1962
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:50,400
train myself like um to ask myself am i still having fun with this game or am i doing this

1963
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:54,800
because it feels like a chore and i have to do it as soon as the game starts feeling like a chore

1964
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:59,680
and like i'm logging in just for the sake of logging in i stop playing the game and i move on

1965
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:05,360
and i i still get caught up in this stupid psychological need to log in into some games

1966
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:11,280
but i really try to like i recently cut out a game out of my life and i still have like this

1967
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:16,640
sort of itching needs to go back to but it was an app on my phone and i i uninstall it and i

1968
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:21,680
don't want to look back at it ever again because it lured money out of me and i read read deeply

1969
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:28,720
ever spending money on it the multiplayer time crunch time sink singularity has has just reached

1970
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:34,560
closer and closer to a singularity over the last like 20 goddamn years and this is part of why

1971
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:39,680
i'm entering into game design with such confidence because i know even if it takes a couple of games

1972
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:45,680
a couple of years but they're part of a decade anyone who has their head firmly attached to their

1973
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:50,000
fucking neck is going to be able to figure out how to make a game that people are going to actually

1974
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:56,000
play because most development resources are constantly being diverted to the newest variation

1975
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,320
of multiplayer mmo hybrid cash grab trend right now it's fucking battle royale before that was

1976
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:07,360
mobs before that was mmo's and like everyone's wasting their time trying to run for all the

1977
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:11,600
money there's no way games would be so multiplayer centric if not for the fact that they have the

1978
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:16,880
most open monetization strategies when what most people really want is like a certain amount of

1979
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:22,320
gameplay with a certain experience to be felt and it's just a giant shit show farce that it's so

1980
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:29,760
multiplayer centric out there i okay i don't think okay there's a distinction here i don't think you

1981
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:34,480
have to play multiplayer games the way that i or the people play them there's nothing like set in

1982
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:39,920
stone like you have to play them for thousands of hours well they are designed to psychologically

1983
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:46,880
manipulate you to do much i did not play no one's fault but your own if you get much i agree i agree

1984
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:52,480
but like as soon as i feel like the game stops being fun and i just do it just because it's a chore

1985
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:57,600
then i stop playing it but that i have spent yeah i have spent a lot of time playing those games

1986
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:02,800
because i did generally enjoy playing those games it's just and then you gotta appreciate

1987
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:08,640
munchie that like you can say it's just you can say it's your own fault but i mean you get into

1988
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:15,120
these games young for the most part or when you're in a time of social unrest or you don't have enough

1989
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:20,880
in your life and they they prey on you you know just the same way advertising does like it's and

1990
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:24,960
whenever you ever bought something that was advertised to you you don't because you know

1991
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:29,760
better you do two weeks later when you're thinking about what to buy you know i will

1992
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:35,520
literally like see a commercial for a tasty like burger king burger and go buy it immediately

1993
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:41,120
i can relate like in me a biter just watch something and like we're watching anime or

1994
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:46,800
something and they like in the anime they like eat some sort of food like let's see a burger or a

1995
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:52,240
creep crepe and and i was like i want that now and later laughs with me because i always do it

1996
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:59,040
all the time see the food i want because usually when i when i'm hungry and i want to go get food

1997
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:02,800
it's a 10 minute conversation of well what do you want to eat well i don't know what do you want

1998
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:07,520
to eat well i don't know and like if a commercial just comes on right then it's like bam done like

1999
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:12,400
let's fucking go to hardy's like but hey to respond to munchie's point munchie i totally

2000
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:19,440
sympathize with your love of the social aspect and of dominating noobs in in mmo or tf2 whatever

2001
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:24,800
because like i played league of legends like all my friends who i played with for years for many

2002
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:30,400
years were much better than me because they worked much harder and like researched meta changes and

2003
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:35,040
like researched like the best guys i'm not even saying they were like yeah of course it's fine of

2004
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:39,360
course it's fine but like but here's the thing but oh fun you're right it absolutely is fun but

2005
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:44,640
here's the thing right now some of my friends are going through a period of like oh well we don't

2006
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:51,600
we don't play those anymore uh you know uh has that time really like i there the reason i started

2007
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:57,520
youtube was the time i stopped playing league of legends my entire youtube career could have just

2008
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:03,120
been me playing leg of legends instead i it was basically a one for one trade of one for the other

2009
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:09,600
and i could not be more glad that i made that trade but some of my friends didn't and looking back i

2010
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:15,040
think they regret it and and that is what i want to enhance people for people from if people want

2011
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:20,000
to play a game with their friends as i did socially just like to connect with them to talk to to get

2012
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:25,280
together and have fun i could not be more okay with that but what i fear is that later on they'll

2013
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:29,520
get they'll get kind of sucked into the world and they'll end up wasting something of their lives

2014
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:33,760
that i don't care if people waste their lives they're okay with it but they will regret it later

2015
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:38,160
that's what i don't want yeah the thing is that's why i'm saying that multiplayer games are an

2016
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:43,520
unmitigated like blessing upon the world but i feel like they get an unfair rap for things

2017
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:49,280
which is just our human nature to want to sink at our human nature is extremely flawed and we have

2018
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:53,920
to engineer around it because it is a problem we have to be smarter than human nature so that's

2019
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:59,760
why i object to things like like like i don't like the ban on like gigantic soft drinks in like

2020
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:04,800
new york city but like i really understand why they would do something like that because humans

2021
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:10,320
are not smart enough to know not to drink stuff like that so i do not have a huge amount of faith

2022
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:14,800
in just human intuition human decision making any of those things you mean all those mobas are like

2023
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:22,800
the 32 ounce coke of video games and the thing is the thing with those mega uh ips those things

2024
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:27,920
that like it's this one entity that can suck out all your time is that pretty much the same amount

2025
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:34,960
of time and the same type of effort the same like variety of skills and focuses can you can

2026
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:41,200
instead just engage in the hobby of an entire medium like the 2000 hours you can spend playing

2027
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:47,280
league of legends can be spent on all the different kind of games that you hear about and i know

2028
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:53,280
you're all interested in playing i know everyone has a giant list of video games all those like

2029
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:58,560
10 to 20 hour ps2 single player games that everyone's heard of and no one gets around to playing

2030
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:04,640
and you spend the same amount of time you could spend playing those playing one game and it's

2031
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:10,320
almost always going to be more fulfilling getting into a medium actually feels like a kind of an

2032
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:15,360
actual accomplishment it's just as useless but it is genuinely more fulfilling to the soul

2033
