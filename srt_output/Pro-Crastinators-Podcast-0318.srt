1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Uh, are you recording?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I am. I'm just trying to remember what I just had for lunch so I can put it in my calorie thing.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It was a steak and kidney pie, which was lovely.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is great content. Don't waste this.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't waste this.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wait. Okay. Let's sync.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Eleazar, keep this all in.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Three, two, one, sync.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sync.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay. Now, tell us about the steak and kidney pie, which I've never eaten one of those.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've never had one of those.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You've never eaten a steak and kidney pie.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just beef chunks, kidney chunks in a beef gravy as a pie.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Kidney chunks sound so disgusting.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, it's a kidney. It's sort of a weird meat.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, it sounds really good actually.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's a weird meat that's not normal.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's like eating beef heart, cow heart, or whatever. It's like, ah, that's odd.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But kidney's all right. It's sort of like mushrooms, but if they were more beefy.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, well, that sounds all right. I've heard that beef heart is like disgusting.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've never actually eaten it, but I can imagine it's like very, very tough because it's a muscle.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So lean.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's, you know, I haven't watched it in a little while, but there was that channel I was watching for a while

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
called Tasting History with Max Miller.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I think one episode he did like a themed one where he I think he might have been like doing a Game of Thrones

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
with Racky thing where he cooked a beef heart instead of a horse heart like Daenerys ate to become Khaleesi.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And he cooked it. He found a recipe and he cooked it according to the recipe and he ate it.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And his reaction was just like, oh, oh, God, it's so tough. It's disgusting.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Makes me respect Daenerys even more.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They probably had a really maybe they like stewed that heart for like a week.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Maybe they marinated it for like months to get it like nice and chewy.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was wondering about I think I remember looking at like Blu-ray extras and I think the heart was a heart or

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
like they had a heart and it was a fake thing that looked like a heart.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In any case, one or the other.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It was either real or fake and that's what I remember.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It either was or was not. I see. Yes, excellent.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Spectacular. Anyway, yeah, I never had never had kidney.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, it's it's not everyone likes it. I didn't like it when I was younger, but in a in a steak and kidney pie,

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
it's very nice with the gravy.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think I remember my dad telling me that like he went to, I don't know if it was England or maybe it was somewhere else in Europe,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
but I think I remember him saying that he was a vegetarian at the time and but like some he was staying with some family

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and they offered him maybe it was steak and kidney pie or maybe it was some other kind of meat pie that contained organs.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But he like found he didn't want to refuse out of like politeness.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But it like he like he like threw up at the table because he was like so it was so bizarre.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I feel like that wouldn't have been a steak and kidney pie. That's this. It's not that odd.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's too normal. Yeah, it's like the gravy and the beef mask, the taste of the kidney.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can have kidney and other things.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My dad's a little bit of a picky eater. He like won't eat like chicken on the bone.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I know.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Chicken drumstick like grilled like from a barbecue is great. Just hold the bone.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You just know on it.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, like wings like come on.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's easy.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It is easy. He won't eat he won't eat like most shellfish.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He won't eat chicken on the bone and he won't eat most shellfish and that's I just I just I just don't.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I mean, I don't like oysters, but I think oysters are a bit weird because you're supposed to like slurp them up

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
in the most disgusting way you could possibly do anything.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can pick them up with a fork and muscle you can eat.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes, I like doing that.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've tried oysters like twice.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've eaten them the way they've told me to eat them and I'm just like, I don't get it. Why?

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like I feel like Gollum trying to eat Noister.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I feel like I am like Goblin right then.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am going Goblin mode as they say.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Anyway, speaking of baby potatoes and broccoli, I was that's it.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think I've been actually quite a few.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I've still been tracking my calories.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A lot of my calories have been coming from pure sugar lately because I've been cooking more.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I've been cooking more gummies with my new recipe.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Actually, I put more sugar in and less fiber to see if that would make it easier to gel.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because I made one batch that was like low sugar and it came out kind of soft.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I was like, hmm, that didn't work out so well.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I definitely cooked it with the really low sugar and it definitely worked out a few times.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So I don't know, I would like to work out like what's the least.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I think the most expensive ingredient that I have is fiber.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So, you know, least fiber would be good.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think the gelatin is the second most expensive.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So less gelatin would be good.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Sugar is cheaper than dirt.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, you know, bulking it up with as much of that as I can is good.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then water is free.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's the best.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Try to make it almost entirely water.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You've got like a perfect product.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Imagine.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Imagine the returns.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I bought some new flavors.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was really excited to get green apple.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But this brand of green apple that I got, it doesn't taste like a jolly rancher green apple.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It doesn't really taste like a candy green apple.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I kind of can taste like the peel.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can kind of taste like a sort of cooked like apple pie flavor in it.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And I don't like it.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's disappointing.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's not what I want from a green apple flavor.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's a bit of a bust.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But that's okay.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They can't all be winners.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Apple flavor things are usually quite sour, aren't they?

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like tangy almost.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I make all my gummies pretty sour just because I like them that way.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I made the batch that I gave to my friend for his birthday.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Everyone that tried it was like, oh, they're sour.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was like, yep.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's how I feel about you.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It would be a waste.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Actually, oh, I made a batch of peach and I forgot to add the acid and they came out not sour at all.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And they were terrible.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It was so bad.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I popped them out of the molds and I put them in a cup and I added the acid.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And then I like melted them down in the microwave.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I reforged them into a new blade.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I did though.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And then I remolded them and they actually came out better.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Like they came out firmer.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Like I had evaporated some of the moisture off of them.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Maybe I should do that all the time.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe I should always put them in the microwave and try to cook off excess moisture just to see what happens.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I really like the idea of tiny little gummy swords being forged.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like every scene in a medieval or a fancy thing where they pour the mold,

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
pour the molten metal into an open thing in a way that they would never do in real life.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But with gum.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You hear the blacksmith.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Man there was a...

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I saw a really funny video on Twitter.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It was a video of two Japanese guys working in like...

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think they were working in like a mochi stand or something.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And they had these...

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They just stood at this table and there was like a big like wad of...

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think it was mochi.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It was some squishy green stuff.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Some kind of confection.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And the two of them just had these big wooden hammers.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
These big wooden mallets.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And they just took turn like...

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Beating this wad of some green shit.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Like one after the other.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like taking turns.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I've seen references to that technique in the rabbit on the moon.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You know how Japan sees a different side of the moon than America?

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They don't see a different side.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They just interpret the...

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, I guess.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's slightly different because it's a different...

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But they see a rabbit with a hammer.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The moon is in a locked orbit.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Everyone sees the same side of the moon.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, why do I see a penis on the moon?

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't because you're gay.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But like the rabbit has a mallet and the mallet is for squishing things.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So I've seen like in...

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's like more than one like video game or anime that like references a rabbit using a mallet to squish a squishy thing.

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, another rabbit pushes it around.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I've never known what they're building.

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
They're creating but that's the...

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can picture it.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's interesting.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I hadn't heard that before.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's like that bit at the beginning of Dragon Ball where Goku...

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm trying to think of rabbits with hammers.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There's like when Goku...

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Kid Goku, he...

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
As a...

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My headphones fell out.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't hear you.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, you fuck.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, now tell me.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like in the beginning of Dragon Ball, there's a bit where Goku...

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There's these thugs and they've got like bunny ears on and they're like,

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ha, we're so evil.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We're gonna...

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We're gonna beat you up.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Beating with hammers?

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We're gonna beat you up.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They just have like bunny ears on and that's their thing.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And then Goku easily beats them and he...

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
As a punishment, he gets his Nyobo, his extending stick.

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And he goes all the way up, pulls them up to...

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Puts them on the moon as punishment.

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And that's like...

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's just like that old fairy tale.

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's just like the rabbit on the moon thing.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's me, Akira Toriyama, editor's note.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then Goku comes back down to Earth.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That is so fucking adorable.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They never...

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh my God, and then they died because Master Roshi blew up the moon at the tournament.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh my God.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I never thought of that.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They definitely be killed.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They definitely be killed.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They definitely be killed.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Think about that one.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, they blew up the moon a bunch of times.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So...

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oops.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Dragon Ball Z is so annoyed by the end of Dragon Ball Z.

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They have to wish it back with the Dragon Balls a few times, right?

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean, I've never watched all of...

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've only watched bits and pieces of old Dragon Ball.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean, Dragon Ball Z is like that too.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I remember, yeah, Piccolo destroys the moon that one time where he notices Gohan going insane.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And he's like, wait a minute, it's the moon.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right, that's...

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He goes back to normal.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Right, that's why, because of the...

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What do you call the monkey form?

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Big monkey.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Super Saiyan 3.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Whatever.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
True Saiyan.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
When they turn into big monkey, they have to blow up the moon sometimes.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's right.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, doesn't Master Roshi just do it for no reason in the tournament?

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Master Roshi does it in the tournament when his kid Goku.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, he does it because Goku is going big.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, okay.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I forgot about that then.

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think it's because his tail is cut off at the very beginning when he goes monkey for the first time.

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You understand that he's a were monkey.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah.

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He sees the full moon.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They can't destroy the moon because it's like...

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What's it?

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Like that little brat guy and his two henchmen, the dog and the lady.

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Pilaf, that guy?

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, Pilaf.

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Pilaf.

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Little goblin man or whatever.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Little goblin man.

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then Goku goes big monkey.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And then I think it's Oolong or Yamcha or someone who cuts off the tail with a sword to save the day.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And then randomly during the tournament, Goku's tail comes back during a full moon and then he goes big monkey.

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And so Master Roshi destroys the moon instead, which is a bit of a different way to solve that problem.

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Wait, so why was he doing that?

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Kami-sama puts the moon back together.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Kami-sama is Piccolo?

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's the good half of the great demon king Piccolo, yeah.

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right, right.

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I think that's how it goes.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why was Goku going beast mode if he had his tail cut off?

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because it grew back.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They didn't know that that happened.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's like, oh, my tail's back.

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is great.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And then, uh-oh, he does the rest of the tournament and he's like, my tail now, this is epic.

265
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And he uses that to his advantage.

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But then later the moon comes out.

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I guess that makes sense.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, okay.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That sounds familiar.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I have seen that part.

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I would just catch Dragon Ball occasionally here and there.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:41,000
By the time it was like airing regularly, I think by the time I got Cable as a kid and Dragon Ball was airing regularly, it was already like in the...

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It was Kid Buu.

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was the Kid Buu saga.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Not Kid Buu, just Majin Buu, yeah.

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So like really late, I mean pretty late, yeah.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But I watched it with my friends.

278
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm remembering all the Red Ribbon Army stuff.

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Dragon Ball is such a good manga.

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah.

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So nice and so perfect and they did it.

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They did it and they did it.

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Is it better than One Piece though?

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is anything better than One Piece?

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You know, for where Dragon Ball ends up going, as a kid, I liked it more than One Piece just because of it having more fun, even more than One Piece and being like more badass more quickly.

287
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't know how to describe it.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I think they're kind of equivalent.

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's just that One Piece has like a longer lasting sort of sense of adventure and Dragon Ball is like a fun adventure story that it's just like great to go on.

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And then Dragon Ball Z comes around and it becomes a little more serious, a little more edgy and a little less goofy and like adventure-y.

291
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
People just teleport and appear at the next battle arena and it's just like one after the other.

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's still good.

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is that like an aging up with the audience kind of thing?

294
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I guess so.

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The style definitely changes.

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It becomes much more about like personal drama between characters who want to fight and less about a kid exploring the world with his magical stuff and flying cloud.

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I wonder if it's like, you know, what do you call it?

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Shonen Jump Executive smokes his big cigar.

299
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Toriyama, the kids was reading Dragon Ball.

300
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well now they've grown up into edgy teenagers.

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They want to read Sinon now.

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You gotta make your guys big buff guys.

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It can't be no little kids running around.

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You gotta have them be aliens, Toriyama.

305
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You gotta have alien genocide now.

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's the only way.

307
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And he said yes, sir.

308
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, sir, Mr Jump, sir.

309
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Right away.

310
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It never feels like it's betraying the Toriyama style.

311
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It still feels like him the whole way through.

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's just sort of like he's going like, well, they were kids and now they're adults and now the stakes have to be higher each time.

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How high do you go when the guy is trying to destroy the earth?

314
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's like you can't joke around if that has to be taken seriously.

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It has to be kind of a scary guy and he has to be kind of scary.

316
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And so it's like it just sort of naturally goes in that direction, I guess.

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah.

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I mean, when it starts, I mean, I remember seeing the beginning of Dragon Ball Z and like it does still feel like the same characters.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Like Goku still feels like Goku and he's a goofy man.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, it's not like a bad like sequel or anything.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I definitely like Dragon Ball Z.

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There's something about the adventure feeling of Dragon Ball that I only really get from one piece and then like the Dragon Quest games and other things like that.

324
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's just sort of like a cute, funny, wholesome, epic quest.

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I like it.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Maybe I should read Dragon Ball at some point.

327
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not that long, I say, looking at 15, 16, 21, 22 volumes, lol.

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, but I mean like how many chapters is that?

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because I've read a thousand chapters of one piece now.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, it's not as long as that for sure.

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't actually know how many chapters.

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I own like the physical volumes, so I think of them in terms of that.

333
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Speaking of infinite games, I played, I didn't stream it.

334
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I played, I beat Mega Man 8 two days ago.

335
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I've played Mega Man's 1 through 8 now and there's actually a lot more to go.

336
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I've only played like half, I've at this point played like half the series.

337
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I've played Mega Man 1 through 8 and I've played X through X5.

338
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And what do I have a list here? I've got...

339
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh wait, Dragon Ball is only 194 chapters.

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's like child's play.

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's like maybe a couple days of constant reading.

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, that's not even, it's not even anything. It's trash.

343
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's like, man.

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Man, that's...

345
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know how that makes me feel to think that something so influential and important is like...

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So, I mean, not small, but like...

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's definitely not small.

348
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I mean, if you think about how difficult it is to make a single chapter of any comic and then doing 194 of them.

349
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

350
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's a big ask, that's a big task.

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But also, I mean, yeah, like you said, you can read it in a couple days.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It would probably take you 20...

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I mean, how long does it take to read a chapter of manga? Like half an hour, less? So...

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah, less than half an hour.

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So, it's maybe like 20 hours of reading, which I guess is a lot.

356
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I get 20, 30, I mean, what am I talking about?

357
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean, I think it's just one of those things, like, if you draw a picture, people can look at the picture for like five minutes,

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and it took you a lot longer than five minutes to make it.

359
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's like, well, dang, why would I ever draw anything?

360
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, because it looks cool. Idiot.

361
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

362
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It reminds me of...

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What was it? Some show just came out on Netflix or something,

364
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and I heard people saying, like, yeah, the fact that they dropped it all at once

365
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
in a big, like, bingeable block, like, killed it.

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like, if it had come out weekly, it would have been like a part of the conversation,

367
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and people would have been talking about it.

368
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But because it came out all at once, everyone just watched it and was like,

369
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
okay, it's done, and nobody talked about it.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's definitely a thing.

371
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah. That probably has happened with many shows.

372
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There was a recent example, but whatever.

373
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
People, like, moving on to the next thing, and...

374
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know how, like, weird it is?

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The Elden Ring is the biggest game ever, and I see nothing anymore.

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It had its heyday, and that was like, wow, it's done?

377
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
People don't talk about Elden Ring anymore?

378
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I still haven't finished it.

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I haven't even started it. It's all gone.

380
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The hype is dead. It's so crazy.

382
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I can't believe that art can exist outside of the public current hype culture.

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Like, what?

384
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

385
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, yeah, I don't...

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I mean, it's been out for about a couple months now,

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and that's long enough that everyone has played it.

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Everyone who's played it, that was gonna mostly.

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Although, Noah Caldwell-Gervais did just drop an Elden Ring.

390
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, it's an Elden Ring, Bloodborne.

391
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah, I just finished watching that.

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I watched it yesterday. That's good.

393
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He's so true. He's so correct.

394
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He's pretty right.

395
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Man, I don't even... Okay, I shouldn't even say that.

396
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I shouldn't even have an opinion, because I haven't played any of those games.

397
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So, I shouldn't just be like, oh, man, this guy knows what he's talking about,

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because I don't fucking know.

399
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I just like...

400
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
As he's coming from the Souls series as a casual player,

401
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
who isn't perfect and doesn't like the whole get-good thing, like me,

402
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
he resonates very perfectly with the way I feel about the games.

403
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But you are good.

404
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Only because they're fun, and they are not as...

405
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, that's the thing he explained in the first video he did on Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3,

406
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
where he was hesitant to get into the games because of the reputation of them being so difficult,

407
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and you have to get really good.

408
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He's like, well, I don't want to do that. That sounds hard.

409
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But then when he actually started playing them, he realized that the game doesn't want you to lose.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It wants you to win, and it is actually very forgiving if you use the tools at your disposal to win the game.

411
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's the atmosphere of you have to do it single-player, otherwise you're a loser,

412
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
you're a scrub that pushes people away.

413
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It is nice to hear him push back against that and be like,

414
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
he's not the only person who said it, but it really is like,

415
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
guys, they put summoning in the game so that you'd fucking use it if you want to.

416
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It really is like the people that say no summoning.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
If you summon to win, you've cheated the game and you cheated yourself.

418
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Those people really are just going against what the game says.

419
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They're just denying the text of the fucking game.

420
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The reason I'm quote-unquote good at Dark Souls is because it's not difficult,

421
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
because if I use the tools that are in the game, I can do it.

422
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's fair. I might have told this story, I'm sure I have, but I'm very stupid.

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I did beat Dark Souls 1.

424
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I found it fairly difficult, but I worked through it because I have a lot of patience for trial and error stuff.

425
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But I did it in a very stupid way. I did not experiment that much.

426
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I tried to stick really rigidly to one way of playing.

427
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I used the fucking stupid Drake Sword for the whole game, just because I thought it was cool.

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, I got a special drop from a dragon. It has a super wave attack.

429
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That sucks. Yeah, I'll use that. It's a cool sword.

430
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's cool than any of these other normal swords.

431
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That really gimped me.

432
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
When it comes to player comfort, Dark Souls is a little more difficult just because

433
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
if you don't know where you're putting your stats or if you don't know what you're doing,

434
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
then you can't respect at any point during the game. You have to make a new character.

435
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I knew that I got a special dragon sword and I knew that the only way that I wanted to use it because it was neat

436
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and I knew that the only thing that could upgrade it is Drake Scales.

437
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I was like, well, I guess I better try to get some Drake Scales and I upgraded it twice.

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I was like, that's pretty good.

439
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean, I did win.

440
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The game is not punishing. It's a little punishing in a few areas where if you are very strict with what type of damage you're putting out,

441
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
the boss that you're fighting may be strong against that and it'll just take longer.

442
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But there's no hard cap on what is required of you because people have completed the game with no weapons just by punching.

443
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And it's like anything is possible because of that.

444
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's great.

445
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Just like in real life, anything is possible. Actually, if you try hard enough, you can punch any problem away.

446
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah. Dark Souls is more forgiving than real life because you just can't do that in real life.

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's true without the shadow.

448
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You can't dodge roll through bad things happening.

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Gib, you can't just dodge roll all your problems away.

450
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Here's another bout of depression. Wait, frame perfect dodge roll coming up.

451
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, I missed.

452
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Uh-oh. Taxes are due. Better take all my armor off and put on my Havels ring.

453
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, video games. In real life, that would be silly.

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Sure would.

455
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You ever think you've seen Mario in real life?

456
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,000
How does Zelda keep so many items in his little bag?

457
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay.

458
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That would have been an interesting game mechanic where things physically make your pack larger if you pick them up.

459
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And then it's like a physics-based thing.

460
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Like in Breath of the Wild, you have a satchel on your back and it gets huge and weighs you down.

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It gets huge and makes you slow. What's the Hideo Kojima game where you're walking around?

462
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Death Stranding.

463
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Death Stranding. You get Death Stranding wobbling mechanics like, ah, shit, my pack's so full.

464
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I shouldn't have picked up 100,000 mushrooms that I'm never going to eat.

465
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's a game that looks cool and I kind of wish I had played it. I guess I still could.

466
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is it on Steam? I feel like everything's on Steam these days.

467
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I think it must be. I know it's a console non-exclusive, so...

468
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Game just looks neat, but I gotta play Mega Man and Bass.

469
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I gotta play Mega Man and Bass, so my schedule's booked for the foreseeable future.

470
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Man, I tried playing Mega Man Soccer. That game sucks.

471
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Mega Man Soccer?

472
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Mega Man Soccer. It's a real game on the Super Nintendo.

473
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Is there lore in it?

474
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The lore is... I think the lore is just in the manual and it's just like, hey, Wily's back and he's got his robots back

475
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and he's trying to win a soccer tournament this time and you gotta stop him because that's not fair.

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So you, Mega Man, also a robot, must join the soccer league and beat Wily's team for the sake of sportsmanship?

477
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's great. It might be that I kind of don't really know how to play soccer.

478
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I know the rules of soccer. I don't know anything about the strategy of it, so maybe that's why I was failing.

479
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I couldn't score a single goal.

480
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Soccer in video games is so impossible.

481
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's just because you need a sense of...

482
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Because when you're playing football, normal, you get the ball and then you have to think strategically about where you're going to go with the ball

483
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and you need your teammates to be on the same page as to where you're expected to kick it to them or when.

484
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And if you get tackled, it's hard to play the game when you're just one person.

485
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Playing the game is everybody. It's usually just like, I press the button, I pass to this guy.

486
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh, he got tackled instantly. It's gone. Ah, fuck it.

487
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's really disorienting. I don't know if all soccer games are like this, but I think the way it works is that at the start of the game,

488
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you pick your team set up where your players are going to be on the field and there's a couple different default configurations.

489
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then the ball enters play and when a player is on screen, you gain control of them and suddenly you're controlling that character.

490
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But if the ball moves, then the screen moves with it and suddenly whatever character is on screen, that's who you're controlling.

491
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And you don't choose. It's automatically switching which character you control in the middle of play.

492
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And any character that isn't on screen, I think any character that is on screen is automatically running towards the ball

493
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
and any character that isn't on screen is standing at their default position, waiting for the ball to come near them.

494
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And having characters switch between characters is really disorienting.

495
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I had to keep trying to look at the minimap to figure out where on the field am I? Where are my teammates at?

496
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Where should I be kicking the ball? Just very hard and I couldn't do it.

497
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I scored one goal in the two hours. Maybe an hour and a half or something.

498
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It was too hard and I didn't like it. And apparently there is no ending. So whatever.

499
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Football is a lot more strategic because the idea is the people, you put them in a formation, they are in charge of that little pocket of the pitch.

500
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And if there's a striker, their job is to try to get close to the goal and to do the shooting.

501
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And the rest of the team is there to back them up, to defend against attacks, to weave the ball through the defense of the enemy.

502
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's like a strategy game. But when you're a kid and you're playing football, you get the ball.

503
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You know it goes in the goal and no matter where you are on the pitch, you just try to get the ball to the goal.

504
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And if you're quicker than the other kids, you do it.

505
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And so most football games don't have that feeling to it. They have more strategy to it.

506
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's like, I just want to kick it. I just want to kick it as hard as I fucking can.

507
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Which is why the Ape Escape 2 mini game, Monkey Football, is the best football game they ever made in the world.

508
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Because you catch monkeys in Ape Escape and you use those monkeys on your team.

509
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And if you get a rare monkey, if you get a rare monkey like a cool ninja that's hard to catch, they have high stats in the football game.

510
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
They have high kick power, high speed.

511
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Wait, who do you play against?

512
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You play against a various set of computer AIs or a friend. You could have multiplayer matches.

513
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

514
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But there's a league and you go through the shitty teams and get into the harder teams.

515
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But your monkeys that you catch in the game, if you get some good ones that have really good kick power, you put them on the middle of the pitch.

516
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
If you get the ball, you hold down the kick button so it's like maximum power.

517
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And you just go all the way, it hits the monkeys in the head, knocks them out, knocks out the goalie.

518
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And I just would do that. I would just get really strong kick power monkeys.

519
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And I would kick the ball into all of the enemy team, knocking them out, making their fatigue go down.

520
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So they would be really slow.

521
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I would just goal score for the next entire match.

522
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It would be like 72 to 0.

523
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I would just keep scoring.

524
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And the monkeys would dance about it after every goal.

525
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That's the best football game they ever made.

526
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Well, Mega Man Soccer does let you do trick shots.

527
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
If you're a heat man, you can do the trick shot that sets your enemies on fire.

528
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You can set your own teammates on fire by accident too, if you want.

529
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But you can only do it like twice per game, which is like not very many.

530
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And the game just goes on and on because nobody's fucking scoring.

531
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Is it on a timer?

532
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
No, no, it was just, I think it was like game two, like a certain number of goals,

533
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
which I never reached because I couldn't score it that many.

534
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:05,000
There's a YouTuber who's not too big, but big, maybe 100k, called Kim Justice.

535
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And she makes videos about, a lot of her videos are about older computers,

536
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
specifically British computers and the British game scene in the pre-NES era.

537
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And she talks about shit like the ZX Spectrum that didn't exist outside of the UK.

538
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I've heard of that. I don't know what it does, but I've heard of that name.

539
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Well, there's, oh fuck, I don't know, I've watched a bunch of videos about, like, hang on.

540
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You know what, I gotta find this and recommend this because it's really funny.

541
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Kim Justice, there was one, she made one, like, going over the career of some guy

542
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
who made a, like, huge hit on the ZX Spectrum.

543
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And apparently he was like a, he was like a rock star.

544
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He was like this famous rock star who, like, went into drugs and had like a rock star downward spiral

545
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
because he was like such a big celebrity, because he made this stupid little fucking platformer

546
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
like pre-Atari, like, console.

547
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Hang on.

548
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
A rock star?

549
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That, I mean, that's how she describes it.

550
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The Commodore Amiga is another one.

551
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What was this fucking guy's name?

552
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah, and like, now he's like a burnout.

553
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay, yeah, oh my god, here's, here's, the video is called

554
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
From Manic Minor to Jet Set Willy, the story and games of Matthew Smith.

555
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, and Matthew Smith was this like 17 year old savant who made fucking Jet Set Willy,

556
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
which was like the, like, a cultural revolution on the ZX Spectrum.

557
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I love this video, I've watched it like three times.

558
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
78k subscribers, so medium, pre-medium.

559
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Anyway.

560
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Did you link it?

561
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, I should link it.

562
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There are other, there's other good stuff.

563
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
She has a big like history of Peter Molyneux, which is pretty interesting.

564
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Look at this guy.

565
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Jet Set Willy.

566
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Jet Set Willy.

567
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And there he is, this little fucking, this little fucking top hat man.

568
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Shout outs to Kim Justice.

569
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I would never have known about the Commodore Amiga.

570
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But anyway, I just remember she, I think it was on one of those consoles.

571
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't remember exactly which one, but there's a game called like, called Sensible Soccer.

572
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And it was like, it was like a huge hit.

573
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I'm like, that's like the most, the most British thing I've ever, it's just called, it's, it was like,

574
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
it was like kind of revolutionary, I guess, in that it like more, it was like so much more like realistically portrayed

575
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
like the rule, translated the rules of soccer into like a game.

576
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It was like the first soccer game that actually felt like soccer.

577
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But it's just called Sensible Soccer.

578
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's like, hmm, hmm, yes.

579
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
A very like, a very sober, a very sober and reasonable, reasonable gaming experience that I'm having.

580
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I love reasonable gaming experience.

581
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Love to, I would love to just have a, I'd like to play soccer, but like unlike all these other, you know,

582
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
unlike all these other like fly-by-night, you know, party boy developers,

583
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I would like my soccer game to be sensible, please.

584
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Just keep me grounded.

585
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And they did.

586
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And apparently it was a big hit.

587
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So I don't know.

588
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I don't even get on this.

589
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh right, Soccer games, Sensible Soccer, Mega Man.

590
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That's it.

591
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I have no like notes this week.

592
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I have nothing happened to me this week.

593
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I just, I have to, I'm just rambling.

594
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I can't believe a whole week.

595
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I can't believe a whole week has passed since, since last Sunday.

596
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, I don't really feel like anything happened.

597
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No, nothing at all.

598
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's one, it's one of those weeks that I feel like I just blinked and it was gone.

599
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yep.

600
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Same.

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

602
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Tomorrow is.

603
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I have been, oh yeah.

604
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I was just gonna say tomorrow is America Day.

605
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's July 24th.

606
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You mean the fourth?

607
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah.

608
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Why did I say the 24th?

609
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

610
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's July 4th.

611
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I don't know.

612
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's July 4th.

613
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't super feel like celebrating America at the moment.

614
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
No.

615
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But like, I mean, whatever I guess.

616
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Not boo America.

617
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Boo.

618
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Boo.

619
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yep.

620
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Exactly.

621
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
May the 4th is funnier because of the Star Wars.

622
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Star Wars.

623
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Jokes that every dad makes.

624
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah.

625
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Peter.

626
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's Star Wars, Peter.

627
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Love Star Wars.

628
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's exactly what she says.

629
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
She says that that's her line.

630
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That's what I know Lois for.

631
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Anyway.

632
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

633
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I was gonna say.

634
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I have nothing else to say about the fact that it's July 4th tomorrow.

635
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't care.

636
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Go on.

637
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Maybe I'll do something.

638
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Probably not.

639
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Make a little upside down American flag.

640
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Post saying July 4th.

641
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
More like die 4th.

642
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And then it wouldn't make that much sense.

643
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Absolutely.

644
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I have the past few days had like a weird itch.

645
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
A mental itch.

646
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Not a physical itch.

647
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
This is a world building itch.

648
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I've been playing Oblivion.

649
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The Elder Scrolls.

650
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And you know.

651
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Just for the no real reason playing it without first travel.

652
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So if I need to go from one side of the map to the other I need to buy a horse or get a horse.

653
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And just travel along the roads or you know whatever.

654
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah.

655
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And it's been a it's a longer journey.

656
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's feels more like I get a sense of like a real sense of like a gratefulness that these settlements exist.

657
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Because like on the road there's like bandits all the time.

658
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
There's like trolls and imps shooting things at me.

659
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And I'm like fuck my horse is going to die.

660
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't want that.

661
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I got to get to a refuge.

662
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I got to get to an inn and stay inside and be protected.

663
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And so it's sort of just nice.

664
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And I'm just sort of looking at all these quests and these names and these like places and I'm like fuck.

665
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
The Elder Scrolls is such a rich world with all these things that they made up and came up with.

666
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The Daedra and the fucking books that you can read.

667
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I want to do that.

668
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's my time to do that.

669
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's what I want to do.

670
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And now I'm thinking about world building all the time.

671
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I just want to why I want to world build.

672
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And I don't really know how to do it because it's.

673
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Hmm.

674
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's so such a big task.

675
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, I every time I come up to something like this is like, oh, that's so cool.

676
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I want to be the one who have done that.

677
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I know.

678
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah.

679
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah.

680
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's like right now I'm thinking how do I make the fucking Cyrodiil?

681
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
How do I make oblivion?

682
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But I did it.

683
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Isn't it?

684
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Isn't it sort of tempting when you see something like that and it's something that you like?

685
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Isn't it sort of tempting to think like, well, I could have thought of that.

686
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Like if only I hadn't like seen them do it first.

687
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Like I probably would have thought of that myself actually.

688
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's it's kind of like my idea.

689
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Give her that.

690
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I for some things, I guess so.

691
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's it's really just that I can see how people would come to.

692
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
To come up with these things like where the inspiration came from.

693
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:12,000
If I looked into history and like ancient theology and like things that have been like words, etymologies of words and like stuff like that stories from the past.

694
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I use that as a base for stories of the future.

695
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And that's basically what all these things do is they take like tropes and and ways of naming things that real people did but use funny elf words instead that they made up.

696
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it's like, yeah, I could have come up with that.

697
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I mean, oblivion gates.

698
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I mean, that's cool.

699
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's like a land of fire and they've got like a different kingdom.

700
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's like the kingdom on the other side of the portal.

701
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Like that's not so strange.

702
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Everybody's made a story like that.

703
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That sounds pretty reasonable.

704
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

705
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That's what I would expect to be on the other side of an oblivion portal.

706
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah.

707
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah.

708
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Sometimes I do feel like that a lot of what I would make is just completely copied from something else.

709
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm like, oh wait, no, I'm making a homestuck thing here.

710
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
This is a homestuck thing and this is an oblivion thing.

711
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh, and this is a fucking, this is a Princess Mononoke thing.

712
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm just copying.

713
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Ah, fuck.

714
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Ah, shit.

715
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I don't have a single good idea.

716
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean.

717
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So it's hard to do.

718
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah.

719
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I guess you kind of got a, you kind of got a, you know, great artist steel and all that.

720
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah.

721
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

722
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I gotta not worry about that too much.

723
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
There definitely is some point at which it's like, okay, now you're just taking everything from such and such.

724
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But like, you're probably not actually there.

725
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You probably feel like you're there way earlier than you're actually there, you know?

726
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah.

727
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I mean, I felt that a little bit about Belle Jape because it was like.

728
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh yeah.

729
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Belle Jape is exactly like everything.

730
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I don't know.

731
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
No, no.

732
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I mean, what happens in it is, you know, unique enough, but the method by which I was doing Belle Jape was like, I just want to have Microsoft Paint Adventures.

733
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But I did instead.

734
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So I had a website called APSA as Adobe Photoshop Adventures.

735
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And I made a comic reminiscent of jailbreak and homestuck and problem sleuth and stuff.

736
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And I'm like, haha, I did it though.

737
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And it did turn into something that was a little different, but still having the S like flash, but and all that, the gifts.

738
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's, it's so obviously like a homestuck fan thing that it sort of felt like, ah, shit, I got to start being different.

739
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I got to start being more unique.

740
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And I guess that's why I started drawing the Lord of Ghost comic.

741
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I wanted to have, I want to have like a real comic that you could print on a piece of paper.

742
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I want to have stuff that I can do that's not exactly the same as something else.

743
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Ben?

744
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You there?

745
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Hey, I'm back.

746
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Oh, you're back.

747
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't know why that just happened.

748
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
My internet just went out for like a minute and now it's back, I guess.

749
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Well, I said my bit.

750
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The viewers at home know exactly what I said.

751
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'll just have to wonder.

752
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'll never know.

753
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You know, one thing about world building that I was wondering.

754
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I was looking into like the world, like Tamriel is the world of the Elder Scrolls.

755
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah.

756
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And like the people, I just sort of thought, what are, why do people know what the planet is?

757
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Like, did people in medieval times have a concept of the world being like a singular place that could have a name?

758
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Or would they only think of their immediate area, their own name, their country, the kingdom that they're being like lorded over with?

759
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Like, do they have a name for like the Earth?

760
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And I guess they did.

761
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But it was like Earth, like soil, like land mass.

762
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I mean, people, I mean, what do they, the Greeks knew that the Earth was a sphere?

763
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Did they?

764
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah.

765
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I mean, maybe not all of them did, but some Greek.

766
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
They had gods that were like, I was looking into it a little bit.

767
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I didn't get very far in my, because I literally thought of this just before we started recording.

768
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's like, what are they, what do they, like, would they have a name for the world?

769
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Like people in medieval England.

770
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I think.

771
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Would they have a concept of like, oh, the Earth, the planet or the world or something like that?

772
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Would they have a name for it?

773
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If they just lived on the British Isle and they didn't know that there was anything like across, is it, is it the Caspian?

774
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
No, what's the, what's the channel?

775
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Is it the English Channel that goes between English Channel and the North Sea?

776
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:23,000
If they didn't know there was anything beyond the sea, they would probably just think that, you know, that island is the world and they would be one in the same.

777
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But then as soon as they figured out there's an even bigger land mass across the channel, they'd be like, okay,

778
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
there's actually like a, this is a world and our little island is just part of it.

779
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And who knows what the fuck else is out there?

780
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I mean, you can see France from the coast of England.

781
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh, can you?

782
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, lol.

783
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Okay.

784
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But I feel like people would know countries.

785
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They would know, they would hear tales of people going on treks and coming back and telling the stories and stuff.

786
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
People wouldn't know literally what the Earth looks like.

787
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But like.

788
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah.

789
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
A name for like a, like, divorced from country, from kingdom, a name for the land.

790
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It seems like an odd thing that only exists in fantasy novels.

791
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm going to say, I'm going to say they probably would because like they would know that like, oh yeah, the land just kind of extends, you know, East, like, for who knows how long.

792
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So you can't, you can't really talk about just like a landmass because like it doesn't really have like an end that you even know of.

793
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So I guess, but like, I mean, you would say the land, you would say the sea, you know, the ocean.

794
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And then you would say the land, which is like rocks and soil and dirt that you can stand on.

795
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And those are like the two things that make up most of what you understand.

796
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And you wouldn't say like, you wouldn't call the sea a name other than the sea.

797
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's just like a descriptive word.

798
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah.

799
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And so you wouldn't call the Earth.

800
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, like you don't call it.

801
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You don't call it.

802
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It doesn't have a proper name.

803
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I understand.

804
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
This is the world of Tamriel.

805
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
This is the world of Azeroth.

806
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Like, why, why are these names?

807
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
They would have countries, they would have factions and they would have like landmarks.

808
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,000
They would just call it the world because like, what's what's the point of giving it a name to distinguish it from some other?

809
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Like we call we call Earth the Earth because we know that there are nine planets.

810
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

811
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And Earth is like derived from words that mean soil and dirt and like ground as opposed to the ocean, which is the other thing.

812
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

813
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, you're probably.

814
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And they're like, they're like gods of terror.

815
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The Romans had terror and the Greeks had Gaia and they were like gods and goddesses of like the Earth.

816
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But the Earth meaning land and like very explicitly just land, not like a metaphorical sense of like the world that we understand.

817
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Like a human world right now is like the observable universe.

818
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I think it's like our world that we understand.

819
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

820
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Calling it calling it something like Tamriel or Azeroth is like a little bit might be a little bit like, you know, for the player to just to distinguish it from the real world.

821
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I don't know.

822
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I wonder if maybe some cultures did have like, oh yeah, our world is called such and such.

823
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And maybe if they believed in, I mean, maybe if they believed in an afterlife or like a spirit world or something, they would call the real world one name and they'd have another name for that other world that they believed in, perhaps.

824
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I could see that.

825
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
All right.

826
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I may have misread this.

827
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I was quickly Googling on Wikipedia.

828
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But I did read some Middengard was like an old English term for the concept of world in that same way where like, this is what we understand as like a place that we know the edges of.

829
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah.

830
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Middengard or Gehrd was that and that was like what Tolkien used to create Middle Earth as the term for that.

831
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah.

832
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And also Midgar.

833
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Is that like the Norse Norse mythology?

834
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Is that like to distinguish it from like, you know, Asgard and Jotunheim and Hell and stuff?

835
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah, I guess so.

836
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah.

837
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's what I'm, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

838
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Like, if you believe there are, if you believe there are other worlds, then it might benefit you to give this one a name to distinguish it.

839
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
So I guess, you know, now I think about it, we call Earth Earth.

840
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It is a proper noun because it's like us earth and hell and heaven and everything.

841
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah.

842
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And we use it to describe the world.

843
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And I guess for these fantasy worlds, Azeroth and Tamriel are like equivalent words that mean dirt.

844
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Maybe.

845
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But sounds like more names than we would be used to because we're used to Earth and that doesn't seem like a proper noun, even though it functionally is the same thing.

846
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
All that to say is that I don't know what to call my world.

847
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I don't know what to call it and I don't know what to do.

848
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Just call it, have you considered calling it space?

849
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But what if there's space?

850
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Just call it, I'm just trying to think of something.

851
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What can we rip off?

852
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Like a hot dog Leo.

853
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Sure.

854
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

855
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Uh, barrel of laughs.

856
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Just some stupid phrase.

857
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
How about call it, how about you call it?

858
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Popstar.

859
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I've got it.

860
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Call it the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

861
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah.

862
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Yeah.

863
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Popstar.

864
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Wait, Popstar is just one.

865
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Popstar is a little planet.

866
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yeah, just set your world in the Kirby universe.

867
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah.

868
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And then Kirby has all these different planets.

869
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And then one day for no particular reason, fucking,

870
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
what's the giant like machine that grants wishes?

871
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Marvin the Martian.

872
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I know what you mean.

873
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It's the giant clockwork cat face.

874
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yes.

875
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Then one day just for no particular reason,

876
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
totally divorced from whatever else is happening in your stories.

877
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Just fucking giant clockwork cat face just like swoops by

878
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and like smashes the planet into smithereens and like that's the end.

879
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah.

880
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I have my whole story.

881
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
There's like the countries of pop pop star and like all the like

882
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Game of Thrones, but on pop star with all my characters and then

883
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
it gets destroyed and then Kirby's there at the end.

884
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's like, it leads into the Kirby number one.

885
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It was all a prequel to Kirby is, is pop star the one that's

886
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
like frozen and it's like post apocalyptic earth?

887
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I thought pop star was literally a star shaped planet.

888
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yellow five pointed star that Kirby lives on or goes to.

889
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah.

890
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I think that might.

891
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Quick.

892
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Yes, it is.

893
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's the first level in Kirby 64.

894
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Crystal shards distinguished by forest and grasslands.

895
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah.

896
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Pop star into Google and it gives me pop stars as in music.

897
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I didn't even think of that.

898
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I typed in Kirby.

899
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So I was safe from that.

900
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yes.

901
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's the star with the two rings.

902
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What's the one that's just earth?

903
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
What's the one that's just post apocalyptic frozen earth though?

904
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
How would Kirby say earth?

905
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
He would say he would call it Azeroth because he's a big game.

906
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm shiver star shiver star.

907
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Oh, because it's frozen.

908
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah.

909
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You know the one like you can see.

910
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You can see like North America and the and the continents and stuff.

911
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Is that a new ish?

912
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
No, it's a.

913
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
No, that's from that's from 64.

914
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

915
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah.

916
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I remember this level.

917
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I didn't think but yeah, I can see the.

918
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It's very intentional.

919
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah.

920
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And I think they I think they elaborate on it in forgotten land.

921
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I think they I think you go to shiver star in forgotten land.

922
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So in the in the Nintendo cinematic universe, Kirby 64 happens after any game that takes

923
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
place on earth.

924
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I guess so.

925
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah.

926
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't know.

927
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't know.

928
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Is there even a single actual Nintendo game franchise that has earth as a as a place?

929
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Or they all fantastical.

930
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Splatoon of things.

931
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Splatoon.

932
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Splatoon.

933
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So Splatoon is like a prequel to Kirby.

934
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I want to think that that's true because I hope that the inklings come become real.

935
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I hope that the inklings take over because I love them.

936
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And then they get frozen and die.

937
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Sure.

938
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
But you know, for a for a shining moment in history, they would they would they would

939
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
burn brightly and revel in their murder frenzy.

940
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
World building is bad.

941
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Don't do it.

942
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You know what?

943
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I want to build.

944
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I want to world build because you know what?

945
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Any world you build is just going to freeze over and die one day.

946
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
No, but you can build over that too.

947
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You can build over everything.

948
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I can have, you know, Steven Universe has that giant hole cut out of the earth.

949
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
That's world building.

950
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So does so does Adventure Time.

951
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah.

952
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Maybe that was the adventure time I was thinking of.

953
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Maybe they're like a bit in Steven Universe, whether they go on the moon or there's a map

954
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
of earth or you can see.

955
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And there's just like a huge part of like the top of Russia is just missing.

956
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yes.

957
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yes.

958
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Epic.

959
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It's fucking third impact.

960
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Third impact happened.

961
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Dude, what if Shinji met Steven Universe?

962
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Oh, they both cry.

963
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
They're both big pussies that cry all the time.

964
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They'd be best friends.

965
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
They probably would be best friends, honestly.

966
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And then Steven would go up and kiss the Avers.

967
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Oh, no, not the Avers.

968
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
The Angels, what are they called?

969
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I mean, they genuinely...

970
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, the Crystal Gems.

971
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
No, Steven would kiss the enemies from Aver.

972
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah, the Angels.

973
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Yeah.

974
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
They genuinely both have the same problem.

975
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They both like...

976
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Wait a minute.

977
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
They both have like, use their mom's power to like fight against like aliens.

978
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And they both are like really fucked up about it.

979
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So, yeah, I mean, I see no...

980
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I see no problems here.

981
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah, maybe it's like a direct inspiration.

982
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Honestly?

983
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Honestly?

984
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah, seems like it.

985
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It's actually...

986
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Instead of big robots.

987
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It's actually quite analogous now that I think about it.

988
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's a pink shield and a lion.

989
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah, instead of him being in a giant robot that has his mom's brain in it,

990
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
he is a giant robot that has his mom's soul jewel in him.

991
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So, it's kind of like...

992
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It's kind of like reverse.

993
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Like she is piloting him.

994
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yes.

995
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And he has to grapple with that.

996
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's like, I don't want to be the robot.

997
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I don't want to be the robot anymore.

998
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I didn't ask to be the robot.

999
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Be the robot, Shinji.

1000
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Get your mom in you, Shinji.

1001
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Ah, geez.

1002
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't know about this.

1003
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I think this joke has happened.

1004
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's a deja vu.

1005
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
This is a joke from PCP Episode 3 or something.

1006
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
There's no way.

1007
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:33,000
There's no way we would have ever made a joke before on any of our 700 fucking episodes.

1008
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
When one day, one day there will be more episodes of the PCP than there are chapters of One Piece,

1009
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and then who will have the last laugh?

1010
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
How the hell would that happen?

1011
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
One Piece chapters come out weekly and so do the PCP episodes.

1012
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Not forever.

1013
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Not forever.

1014
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Oda won't live forever.

1015
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And we will.

1016
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Oh, no.

1017
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
There's more than a thousand chapters.

1018
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And One Piece has gone past its 25th anniversary.

1019
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I don't want to have the 25th anniversary, the Procrest News Podcast.

1020
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
That would be terrible.

1021
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That would be life-ending.

1022
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Well, I'm sorry.

1023
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
There's no other way.

1024
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
No.

1025
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

1026
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You're just going to have to do it.

1027
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You're going to have to do it.

1028
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Shit.

1029
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Or, I mean, what's the alternative?

1030
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You just die?

1031
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I guess not.

1032
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah.

1033
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I guess I'll live.

1034
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

1035
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
You're stuck.

1036
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
This is the only thing.

1037
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
As long as you live, there must always be.

1038
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
A podcast.

1039
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It's like the World of Warcraft when the Lich King got killed.

1040
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And the Bolvar Four Dragon put on the helmet.

1041
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And he's like, there must always be a Lich King for some reason.

1042
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Really, there's no reason.

1043
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We just wanted to say that was very badass.

1044
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
In the writer's room, we thought that was very badass.

1045
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It doesn't make any sense.

1046
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But I am the Lich King now.

1047
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It doesn't make any sense.

1048
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Was there a previous Lich King that passed on the crown?

1049
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The Lich King, the crown, I think it's the sword, Frostmourne, how's the undead ghost

1050
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
of Ner'zhul, a warlock orc from another planet.

1051
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And he's like evil.

1052
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:32,000
He corrupted Arthas into doing the bidding of the Burning Legion by doing undead magic

1053
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and raising the dead and all that.

1054
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So initially, they were Burning Legion associates.

1055
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And then I can't remember really what happened.

1056
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I think they broke off and they became their own thing.

1057
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Arthas was like, fuck you, Burning Legion.

1058
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I'm in control.

1059
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm evil.

1060
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And I'm going to kill everyone my way.

1061
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And then they kill the Lich King in the game.

1062
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Damn.

1063
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And then...

1064
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Didn't work out.

1065
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I don't know.

1066
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I guess they just defeated the Lich King and there's no Lich King.

1067
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Well, they defeated him.

1068
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Except there has to be.

1069
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And then he couldn't do those things.

1070
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Yeah, I feel like when they beat the Lich King, there just wasn't any more Lich King.

1071
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But some guy put on the hat and now he's the Lich King.

1072
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And he doesn't do anything until one cutscene later in another expansion

1073
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
where Sylvanas Windrunner goes evil and she breaks open the Lich King's helmet

1074
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and it tears open the afterlife.

1075
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And then everyone goes into the afterlife and everyone's dead and alive at the same time.

1076
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Wasn't Sylvanas already evil?

1077
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's so strange.

1078
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Wasn't Sylvanas already evil in Burning Crusade?

1079
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Sylvanas was evil from the very beginning.

1080
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I mean, not really.

1081
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
She was an elf, right?

1082
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah, but like as long as she's...

1083
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Arthas was taking over the Night Elf place.

1084
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Sylvanas was like one of the sisters.

1085
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Like, you will not take my land.

1086
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Arthas says, yes, I will.

1087
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And then you play the level and you kill her.

1088
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You turn her into a Banshee and she's like a slaved Arthas.

1089
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And she's like, fuck.

1090
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Okay, I'll do your bidding.

1091
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
God.

1092
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And then she's like doing his bidding.

1093
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And then at some point she manages or is helped by someone to rest control away from Arthas

1094
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and she becomes her own person and she is so angry at Arthas that she uses her powers

1095
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,000
of the undead to raise or to corral her own faction of the undead as the Forsaken

1096
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:49,000
who then joined the Horde in an alliance of strengths so that they can kill the Lich King.

1097
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And that's her whole goal.

1098
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And she helps with that.

1099
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And they go in the wrath of the Lich King expansion, they kill him.

1100
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And then she is just sort of a faction in the Horde and she's always seemed kind of sus.

1101
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
But it's mostly other people in her faction who are sus and they want to extinguish life.

1102
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And she's like, I don't want this.

1103
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm not evil.

1104
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I'm not like Arthas.

1105
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
And so she becomes more trustworthy.

1106
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
At some point she becomes the War Chief because Vol'jin dies and he trusts her based on all the adventures they've had together.

1107
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And then she becomes the War Chief and it was the most hyped moment ever because it's like, whoa.

1108
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Finally, Sylvanas is getting recognition.

1109
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
She's not evil.

1110
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Her undeath does not define her.

1111
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
She's not exactly as everyone thought.

1112
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And then one expansion later, oh, she is evil actually.

1113
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
She's just, they changed her and now she's like a one note, I'm evil and I just hate everybody.

1114
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Relatable though.

1115
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And it sucks.

1116
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It sucks so bad.

1117
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I hated it.

1118
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You know, it's a classic story for a reason.

1119
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
We can get behind it.

1120
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It's not classic.

1121
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It's stupid.

1122
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
World of Warcraft is a stupid story and I can't stop playing it.

1123
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Man, I hate video games.

1124
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Man, I hate fiction.

1125
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Man, I hate, is this world not enough for you?

1126
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
You have to go and invent some new ones, pathetic.

1127
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Why would I want to learn about things that already exist?

1128
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Why would I want to do that?

1129
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Listen, I just want, I just want to play soccer, but I just want it to be sensible, right?

1130
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
None of this fancy, fantasy nonsense.

1131
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:42,000
No, stop putting robot masters that can shoot flaming, like paralyzing kicks down the pitch in my games.

1132
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I just want to, I just want to, I just want to shoot the goal in the hoop.

1133
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'll just, I'll make my world called sensible world and it will not have magic in it.

1134
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It'll have science only.

1135
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yes.

1136
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Thank you.

1137
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That's a very, that's a great relief, a great relief to me.

1138
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You see, Pumpk is, she's, she's animated, she's, she comes back to life because that's just how it works, okay?

1139
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
This is the physics of the world.

1140
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Are you telling-

1141
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Pumpkins can live and have fire in their brain and that's just how it is.

1142
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's not weird.

1143
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's sensible.

1144
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Are you telling me that if you put a string, if you put a candle inside a pumpkin,

1145
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
you can illuminate it from the inside?

1146
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Like, what is, what were they smoking when they came up with that one?

1147
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
They were smoking wax candles, Ben.

1148
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
True.

1149
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
It wasn't very tasty.

1150
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
True, though.

1151
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I realized something.

1152
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I had a, I think, okay, I was struggling with the decision about whether I wanted to invest in a new camera.

1153
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And it would be like, to get it, to get it, I was like, okay, do I buy a new camera or do I try to make do with my smartphone camera?

1154
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Smartphone camera, you know, it's not amazing, but it does record in high, you know, high enough definition that it's, it's okay.

1155
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,000
But the problem was that with the autofocus, like if you try to film something, I did not find any way to turn off the autofocus.

1156
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So if you're filming something that's moving, the thing is like autofocusing over and over again and it's bad.

1157
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:44,000
But I guess you can use third-party camera apps, like you don't have to use the native camera app.

1158
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You can download third-party apps that give you more manual control over your camera.

1159
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So I might be able to record video without the autofocus ruining everything with my smartphone.

1160
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And if so, it's probably going to tip the scales and I'm probably just going to use my smartphone.

1161
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I have a stand for, I have a stand for it now. It's a cheap stand.

1162
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I might try to get like a, like a, more of like a slightly fancy like stabilizer stand.

1163
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I don't know how those work, but I could probably find a better one than just like a stick that holds it.

1164
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It's odd that your app just doesn't let you not like the autofocus.

1165
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I mean, maybe I missed something, but I could not, I could not find any way to do it.

1166
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And I looked up reviews of the phone because some people make like reviews of every camera and every phone.

1167
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I could find no, ah, moth, fuck.

1168
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I could find no mention of anyone like adjusting the autofocus.

1169
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I like specifically Googled for like turn off autofocus.

1170
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And I found, and I found people like saying where the option is, but not for my phone.

1171
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Like I found people saying how to do it on like certain iPhones and certain other Android phones, but not this one.

1172
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And so I'm like, I don't know.

1173
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I think maybe the app just doesn't have the option.

1174
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So, but it's okay because I think I can probably get some other apps that presumably will let me do that, which would be nice.

1175
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Because like if I was going to invest in a real camera, it wouldn't be worth doing unless I spent like probably at least like 250 bucks, which is like, I don't want to do that.

1176
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I don't want to spend 250 bucks if I don't have to.

1177
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So maybe I don't have.

1178
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So maybe I don't have to.

1179
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And that's nice.

1180
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And that's it.

1181
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That's it.

1182
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That's all I have.

1183
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I don't think I have anything else.

1184
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Oh, wait.

1185
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Maybe, maybe someone in the audience knows a bit about plants.

1186
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
But I have a houseplant.

1187
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I got it for my birthday.

1188
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It's a, it's a Guzmania, G-U-Z, mania, bromeliad.

1190
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And it's like a, it's a cool looking sort of jungly plant, houseplant.

1191
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Oh, I'm looking at it.

1192
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah.

1193
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And I've never had a houseplant.

1194
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I want to do it right.

1195
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I looked up a lot of like videos on how to treat for a Guzmania bromeliad and they had

1196
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
advice and I've tried to follow it.

1197
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I don't think I'm doing it right.

1198
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And I feel like I am going to kill it accidentally.

1199
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Help.

1200
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Help.

1201
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I can't help you with that one.

1202
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It's just, it's just a, it's a little scary, almost not scary.

1203
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It's just sort of, I don't really have like instant feedback like you do with a dog or

1204
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
a cat about how they're feeling.

1205
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I just wake up one day and I notice the leaves are looking at a little something or other,

1206
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
like they're a little curled up.

1207
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
So like, does that mean it's lacking water?

1208
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
The, the, the tutorials, tutorials, the advice guides and things, they're all saying like,

1209
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
don't water it too much, but make sure to water it.

1210
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yeah.

1211
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And like every two days during summer, keep it in bright light, but not direct sunlight.

1212
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
So keep it outside of the like range of the sun coming through the window, but make sure

1213
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
it gets plenty of light.

1214
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And I'm like, ah, it's enough light.

1215
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I put it sort of far enough away, but it never gets hit.

1216
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
How do you know, how do you know how much is too much?

1217
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And so I'm just sort of looking at it and slowly it's sort of looking worse.

1218
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And I don't know exactly what the problem is.

1219
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I don't know if it's too wet or, or what.

1220
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
So I am just sort of hoping that I didn't kill it already.

1221
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So it's, it's inside, right?

1222
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
It's an inside.

1223
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It's in my room.

1224
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It's in your room.

1225
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
To make a, make the room greener with greenery.

1226
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
True.

1227
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So it's, I mean, I don't know.

1228
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Maybe is it, is it like near a window?

1229
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It's, it's, um, it's narrow-ish.

1230
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I mean, the window's big.

1231
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Um, and I just have it out of range for weather or when the sun is like coming straight in.

1232
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Um, it doesn't get blasted by it.

1233
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
But it's, I mean, the walls are white and it's good.

1234
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And I feel like it's getting enough light.

1235
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Like if you, if you were to put it outside, you would put it in a shaded area because

1236
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
it sort of lives in like a jungle.

1237
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So it's like used to like bigger trees being covering it, uh, from, from the majority of

1238
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
light.

1239
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So I feel like the light level is all right.

1240
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I'm just worried about like the water amount, whether the soil is shit.

1241
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And, uh, that's, uh, that's my story.

1242
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You might have to like, I don't know, give it some like, some like fertilizer or something.

1243
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But honestly, I have no, I have no idea.

1244
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I have no idea.

1245
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I've never had a houseplant.

1246
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yeah.

1247
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Uh, like I wanted to, I didn't specify, like I asked for one, I didn't specify what kind.

1248
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
This seems like it, that keep people keep saying, oh, it's a very easy houseplant.

1249
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You don't need to, you know, worry too much about it.

1250
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But I'm worrying it's a life.

1251
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I don't want to, I don't want to be responsible for a death on the property.

1252
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Uh, think of the neighbors.

1253
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Oh, think of my reputation.

1254
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:36,000
There reminds me, you know, uh, I've mentioned at my old house, my root, one of my roommates

1255
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
had a plant.

1256
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Oh God, what was it called?

1257
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm blanking on what the name was.

1258
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It was like a sort of variant of it, like a citrus tree.

1259
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And, um, yeah, it was in a pot and it stayed inside most.

1260
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I mean, he kept it on the porch in like the summer and he would take it inside during the winter

1261
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
and it was a nice tree and it, it fruited a little bit.

1262
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
They didn't, they didn't become like edible or anything.

1263
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
But, uh, one year it bloomed, it had flowers.

1264
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It was like, you know, a kind of high tree.

1265
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It was maybe like six, six feet tall.

1266
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It had like a nice foliage on top.

1267
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
It flowered, it smelled incredible.

1268
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
It smelled great.

1269
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And then the next year he, I think he accidentally left it out on the porch a little too late

1270
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and then like it got cold, like before he expected, and that like cold snap, like it didn't kill the tree,

1271
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
but it like devastated it.

1272
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Like all its, like it didn't, like all its leaves fell off.

1273
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Uh, he pretty much had to like cut, he pretty much had to cut the entire tree off

1274
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
and leave just a little like stick, sticking out of the pot,

1275
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
from which like one little branch kind of started to grow eventually and like it grew a couple of leaves,

1276
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:00,000
so it's like technically still alive and maybe it could recover, although seems like it would take a while.

1277
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Uh, so I don't, I wonder, I wonder how that plant's doing.

1278
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I wonder, I wonder if you still got it.

1279
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Hmm.

1280
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Citron just like, I don't remember.

1281
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I don't remember. What was the big fucking fruit called?

1282
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I don't know.

1283
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
A lime.

1284
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
A pomegranate.

1285
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
No, it had a nickname.

1286
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It was called like something limes or it was called like blood limes or like like scarlet limes.

1287
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Scarlet limes, yes.

1288
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Scarlet limes.

1289
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Okay, I'm not finding anything.

1290
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It doesn't matter.

1291
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Some kind of cumquat or whatever.

1292
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Anyway, if I, if I have like a devastating update or a good news update,

1293
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I will update people on the bromeliad situation.

1294
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Bro.

1295
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
That's my new corner.

1296
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
That's my new like ongoing arc.

1297
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You've got to keep tuning into the Procrastinators podcast to get the latest scoop on the bromeliad situation.

1298
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I've got, I've got gummies and you've got the bro, the bromeliad.

1299
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Hmm.

1300
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Delightful.

1301
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I'll mention again, I have, I'm waiting on Nate to do this for me.

1302
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I need Nate to log in to the Kickstarter because I have, I think I have a couple of packages here

1303
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
that need to go out to Kickstarter backers.

1304
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I found them in my P.O. box, uh, wrote to Radcon books, for instance.

1305
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And I think I, I just need, I didn't, it won't let me do it because Nate is the one that made the Kickstarter account.

1306
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
So like they asked me to show ID, but I can't do it.

1307
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:02,000
They need Nate to show his like driver's license before they'll let me access the old document,

1308
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
the old records and look at people's addresses.

1309
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And like, I think I want to message some people and to ask them like, hey, is this still your address?

1310
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Because it has been like two years and it may have.

1311
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Yeah.

1312
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Oh, it's, yeah.

1313
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
A couple of them are people who were living or living in like New Zealand.

1314
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And so their address, so they, and like COVID meant that I couldn't mail anything to like Australia and New Zealand for some reason.

1315
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So I don't know.

1316
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I could just send them, but I sort of want to ask these people, like, I just want, like, I just want to double check, like, is this still your address?

1317
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
It's been a long time.

1318
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I feel like there's a pretty high chance that if I just sent them, they wouldn't arrive at the people.

1319
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So I just want to like check on that before I send those out.

1320
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
So I'm waiting to do that.

1321
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
That might be messaging on Nate though.

1322
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Hmm.

1323
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah.

1324
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Well, he mess it.

1325
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
He, I know.

1326
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
He told me again today like, oh yeah, I'll get right to that.

1327
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Like message me later.

1328
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I'll do it.

1329
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's like, yeah, you always, you always say that.

1330
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You always say that.

1331
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And then maybe like after like five times, you actually do it.

1332
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But I'm working on it.

1333
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
You know, Kaiju had started, Kaiju was drawing the dojin.

1334
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Did I mention that?

1335
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Like he actually showed me some progress that he was making on it.

1336
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
That's good.

1337
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Yeah.

1338
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I don't know how much of it he did, but I haven't heard from him in maybe like two weeks.

1339
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But he definitely was working on it.

1340
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Uh, I, I don't know.

1341
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I think I would, you know, when that gets done, my hope was that we could release the dojin at the same time as the OVA.

1342
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And then it would be all come out at once.

1343
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And then that would be the last thing.

1344
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And then the, and then the radcon curse would be lifted.

1345
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Um, but, but, uh,

1346
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I mean, whatever comes out just immediately.

1347
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I feel like there's no reason to like wait if something is finished.

1348
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah.

1349
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
At this point.

1350
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

1351
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I mean, I, I mean, yeah, sure.

1352
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But, you know, I had hoped that Nate would, uh, because the plan was for Nate to, you know, edit the OVA together.

1353
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And he, he did edit the music video together.

1354
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Although, you know, uh, Victor was in the comments being like, why did this take so long?

1355
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Like I fit, I basically did all of this, like at the place.

1356
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
So I don't know.

1357
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
So I don't know about that.

1358
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Uh, I think, I don't know.

1359
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I haven't really talked to him about it, but I think I'm going to ask him like, Nate, I know.

1360
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It took me like months of asking you, like, like, like, how is the music video going for you to get it done?

1361
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Like the OVA will be that, but worse, like maybe we should just hire someone.

1362
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Maybe maybe, you know, some editors, maybe we should just hire one of your editors to do it and pay them to do it.

1363
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Because like, I don't think you're actually going to do it.

1364
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You're going to tell, you're going to tell me you're going to do it for months.

1365
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And maybe event, yeah.

1366
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Yeah.

1367
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So I'm going to, I'm going to suggest that to him.

1368
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Uh, and, uh, that will be better.

1369
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I don't know why Nate, I don't know why Nate insists on pretending that he's going to do things.

1370
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
If you're not going to do it, just tell me you're not going to do it.

1371
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I guess, I guess that's not fair.

1372
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
He did eventually, he did eventually make the music video.

1373
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
He did eventually finish that and release it.

1374
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
So it's not that he's never going to do it.

1375
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Don't understand why he'll be like, oh yeah, yeah.

1376
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
This Wednesday, I'll have it done this Wednesday.

1377
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Oh, Wednesday's over.

1378
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Okay.

1379
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Okay.

1380
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Definitely next Wednesday.

1381
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I will, it's not even me.

1382
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's not even me that suggests it.

1383
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It's just him of his own volition is like, I'm going to set a deadline for myself next Wednesday for sure.

1384
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yeah.

1385
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Oh, it's over.

1386
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It seems like he does that.

1387
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Yeah.

1388
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
He likes doing that.

1389
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But then he just ignored it.

1390
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
But then he just ignores it.

1391
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
He just ignores it.

1392
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And like, what's the point?

1393
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I understand that like a deadline can be motivating to get things done.

1394
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah.

1395
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
If you don't just ignore it.

1396
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah.

1397
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah.

1398
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I truly do not understand.

1399
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But whatever, I'm going to try and work around.

1400
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I'm going to try and work around that.

1401
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Let's just fucking hire someone.

1402
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Let's just hire someone.

1403
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Maybe get it done in a week.

1404
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I think maybe Kaiju would do it.

1405
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Kaiju is an editor.

1406
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Oh my God.

1407
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I mean, if he wants to work.

1408
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
No, no, yeah, I mean, I'm sure he would be okay to do it.

1409
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It's just sort of, you know, he's already doing the dojin and he's got his own job.

1410
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's like, I feel like it would just continually conflict with his own like work that he's got.

1411
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Yeah.

1412
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Well, I mean, he said he was starting to draw the dojin because he had some downtime from the other editing work he had to do.

1413
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
That's what he told me anyway.

1414
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
You know, the thing is that I've, Kaiju's told me that editing is like a real pain.

1415
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Sure.

1416
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's good money, but like he hates it.

1417
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I don't really want to put an OVA on him.

1418
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Oh, well, I mean, I mean, it wouldn't have to be him.

1419
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I mean.

1420
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
No, no.

1421
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
As a, you know, spitball suggestions, fine.

1422
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I mean, maybe, I mean, maybe I'd ask him if he wanted to.

1423
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Unless Nate had someone else that he thought would be like a better fit for like the project.

1424
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I don't know.

1425
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Nate would probably know.

1426
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Nate knows more about editing than I do.

1427
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And he knows like what would be required for that.

1428
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I think he's got like a plan.

1429
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,000
He has a plan for like how he wanted to assemble it.

1430
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Maybe he would have someone in mind who would like do it the way he was intending it to be done.

1431
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Fucking Radcon.

1432
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Yeah, fucking, fucking Radcon.

1433
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I'm going to beat it.

1434
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I'm going to defeat Radcon.

1435
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I'm committed now to just being able to say it all got done.

1436
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
This is something I would love to be able to say as well, even though I'm not really doing anything to help.

1437
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yeah.

1438
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Well, I mean, you did, you did all the things you were obligated to do.

1439
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yeah.

1440
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
But then you've picked up the slack of every other thing that people were, did not do.

1441
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Yeah.

1442
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
There were, there were things left.

1443
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:07,000
All the things that were left is like, well, I mean, well, who's going to do the, I mean, I've basically been the guy who's been like, okay, well, how are we going to do.

1444
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
The dogen.

1445
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Okay.

1446
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Well, I guess I'll reach out to these people and get that done.

1447
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah.

1448
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I've been doing like all this stuff that like nobody else kind of knew how it was going to get done.

1449
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It's fine.

1450
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You know, it's a little, it's, I mean, it's mostly just a lot of waiting.

1451
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Like I've talked to, like I've had to talk to people, like I had to get Mishi to draw the cover.

1452
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I had to finish writing the road to Radcon.

1453
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I had to, I guess it actually was a bit of a project to like go to the printer and get like, and like, collude with the printer and get that whole thing set up to get the books printed, etc, etc.

1454
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
But it wasn't that bad.

1455
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's mostly waiting has been the majority of it.

1456
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's been some work, but I don't mind.

1457
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Yeah.

1458
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I mean, originally I was going to edit the OVA, but like,

1459
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Oh, were you?

1460
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yeah, very, like very originally, but like Nate offered, like to do it because he wanted, I don't know, he had like a vision.

1461
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And I was like, thank God, because I don't want to have this hanging over my head.

1462
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Yeah, over to him.

1463
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1464
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
By this point, I feel like I would have been able to do it.

1465
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
It would have annoyed me a lot having that hanging over my head.

1466
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Yeah, it wouldn't.

1467
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I mean, there's no, there's no reason, there's no reason for it to have taken two years other than you just didn't want to do it.

1468
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Yeah.

1469
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So let's just, let's just look that in the face and be like, okay, we have all this Radcon money left over.

1470
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It still has not been spent.

1471
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Let's just spend some of it to get it done.

1472
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Like who cares?

1473
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Although I mean, I guess TBAP, I guess TBAP Resurrection did take a year to come out after Radcon 3, Lamal.

1474
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Which is, I mean, it's also stupid.

1475
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It is just the way of things.

1476
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
We are the procrastinators.

1477
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
We don't do things in a timely fashion.

1478
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
That's true.

1479
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
That's true.

1480
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I mean.

1481
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I had this dream, well, it's not a dream, but just sort of a funny thought that like later when we, you know, when we grow up a bit and we get better at our crafts and we, you know, we speed up, we get stronger.

1482
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Yeah.

1483
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
We can make, we can make these videos and comics and things faster.

1484
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
We'd stop being the procrastinators.

1485
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
We become the professionals.

1486
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
We'd be raking it in.

1487
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Now we're called the professional podcast.

1488
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It never happened.

1489
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Yeah.

1490
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I'll never get stronger.

1491
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'm as good as I'll ever be.

1492
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
There's no more.

1493
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
There's nothing more to aspire to.

1494
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
No, Ben.

1495
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Think about gummies and lifting.

1496
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
What if you could lift gummies?

1497
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I could.

1498
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
What?

1499
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Wait a minute.

1500
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Protein gummies.

1501
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Oh, the proteins.

1502
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
We could be the proteins.

1503
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Protein gummies would be, that'd be gross.

1504
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That'd be disgusting.

1505
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
You'd have to eat so many of them.

1506
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Jesus Christ.

1507
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Now, you know what would be funny?

1508
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Caffeinated gummies.

1509
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I could make caffeinated gummies,

1510
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
and that wouldn't even be hard.

1511
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It'd be easy, in fact.

1512
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yeah.

1513
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
That would be cool.

1514
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Instead of having a drink to start the day, you have a gummy.

1515
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yeah.

1516
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Why not?

1517
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I could.

1518
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I think I would be.

1519
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I think I have become,

1520
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
since starting Slime and Punishment,

1521
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I think I am a faster artist than I was before.

1522
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I think I am faster, more efficient, better.

1523
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Now, however,

1524
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I have nothing that I want to do with it.

1525
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I have nothing that I want to draw.

1526
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I have no comics that I'm working on,

1527
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
so it's just a waste.

1528
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Just a waste of a skill that I've gained.

1529
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I must say,

1530
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
thank you very much for that birthday image you drew for me.

1531
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yes, my pleasure.

1532
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
That was really cool.

1533
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Thanks.

1534
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I really liked it.

1535
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I thought it came out pretty well.

1536
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I was pretty happy with it.

1537
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I'm glad you liked it.

1538
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Yeah.

1539
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
It's got everybody.

1540
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I mean,

1541
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
yeah, it's got flower head.

1542
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
My boy.

1543
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
The flower head.

1544
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Nobody draws flower head.

1545
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Nobody draws flower head.

1546
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Nobody draws Katie.

1547
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Forgot.

1548
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
That's true.

1549
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Another dark member of the Gibbonverse.

1550
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
And the Lord of Ghosts with the little sparklers.

1551
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Yeah.

1552
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Very cute.

1553
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Thanks.

1554
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I had to go and look at some Lord of Ghost pages

1555
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
to figure out exactly how big Lord of Ghosts is.

1556
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
And I decided he is about as big as a person's torso,

1557
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
more or less.

1558
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Yeah, I would say that.

1559
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You got the proportions quite well.

1560
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah, I think so.

1561
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I had kind of imagined that he was about the size of the plush,

1562
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
like less than a foot tall.

1563
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
But no, he's a little bigger than that.

1564
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Like when he's sitting on the couch or on the sofa seat

1565
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
in Flower Head's house,

1566
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
he does take up like most of the cushion.

1567
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Yeah, he could fill a beanbag chair.

1568
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1569
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
So that was interesting.

1570
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I was a little unsure,

1571
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I was a little unsure how big to make Red Man

1572
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
because he seems to vary in size quite a bit.

1573
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I know that you drew,

1574
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I know that the big is like nine feet tall.

1575
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Yes.

1576
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Okay, big is nine feet tall.

1577
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Katie seems like she's fairly tall

1578
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
and Flower Head seems somewhat tall as well.

1579
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
So I made Katie and Flower Head about the same size.

1580
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I think I made Red Man about there.

1581
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I think I should have made him maybe a little bigger than them.

1582
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And then, I don't know,

1583
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I assume that they were maybe like six feet.

1584
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And then I made Katie.

1585
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Yeah, Gun Girl is like a five foot something.

1586
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Five foot five or something like that.

1587
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Flower Head, Katie are taller,

1588
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
but they're not like absurdly tall

1589
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and Red Man is kind of, he's a big boy.

1590
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Okay, well if they're,

1591
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I mean in compared to them,

1592
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I mean then she's maybe like half,

1593
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
maybe I made her a bit small, I don't know.

1594
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Well, wait.

1595
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Now I'm curious.

1596
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
How big did I make them relative to each other?

1597
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
She comes up to about,

1598
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
she comes up to about chest height.

1599
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah.

1600
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1601
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
That's great.

1602
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
That's good.

1603
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I'm trying to scroll to where it was.

1604
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Oh, here it is.

1605
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah, she's a, I mean she's,

1606
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
her legs are like out.

1607
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Yeah, she wouldn't be a little taller

1608
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
if she was standing straight up.

1609
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That's about right.

1610
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Yeah, she comes up to about like,

1611
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Flower Heads like arm pits or so.

1612
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
That would, Red Man would be a bit bigger,

1613
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
but like there's no like true size for him.

1614
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I never really thought, it's just sort of like,

1615
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
he's like, what's his name from kill a kill?

1616
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
The guy who's like big?

1617
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Is it Katakuri?

1618
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
No, from kill a kill.

1619
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
That guy's from One Piece.

1620
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1621
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
He's like the big guy with the blonde hair

1622
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
and he's like one of the captains of this thing.

1623
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I know who you're talking about.

1624
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
He fills the screen.

1625
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
See, I was close.

1626
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
He fills the screen based on like the scene he's in

1627
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
and he doesn't really have like a fixed size.

1628
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

1629
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
He's just as big as he needs to be

1630
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
to fill the entire shot.

1631
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
As big as he needs to be to like,

1632
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
for intimidation purposes if he's supposed to be doing that.

1633
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
And like Red Man is the same.

1634
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Whatever is the funniest size for him to be,

1635
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and it airs big.

1636
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And he's like, whoa, whoa.

1637
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm a big guy full of blood.

1638
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
He's this big.

1639
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Yeah.

1640
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Red Man can be that big.

1641
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Yeah.

1642
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yes, I started drawing that in like the morning.

1643
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And then I had to do the RFCK art stream

1644
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
for the Death Furnaces contest,

1645
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
which was a great contest.

1646
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
There was some very impressive entries in that.

1647
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
But then it got late.

1648
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And so I didn't finish it until your birthday was over.

1649
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Go men.

1650
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
That's fine.

1651
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
No, it's not fun.

1652
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
No, I'm so stupid.

1653
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
No, because it's like I go to bed and it's like us.

1654
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
A nice birthday.

1655
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Got some nice art.

1656
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
It was cute, fun.

1657
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And then I wake up and there's more.

1658
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
But guess what?

1659
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
It's not over.

1660
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's not even over.

1661
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I'm going to be this age for an entire year.

1662
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It's my birth year.

1663
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
The party's just getting started.

1664
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It was fun.

1665
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I spent a while on it because I wanted to include everyone.

1666
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
There's probably more I could have included.

1667
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I could have included dog.

1668
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Yeah, dog.

1669
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Dog would have been nice, but he's not invited to human parties, I guess.

1670
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I mean, it's nice you drew so many of them.

1671
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Most people, it's like on commission sheets.

1672
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It's like, oh, you can cost this much to do this thing.

1673
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But if there's an extra character, it multiplicatively increases as the number of characters goes up.

1674
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Seven characters?

1675
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Oh, that's a thousand.

1676
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That's a million.

1677
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And so you drew a bunch of them.

1678
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I wanted to get them all in there.

1679
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Dammit, I'm trying to post it in the chat and I can't...

1680
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Oh, there it is.

1681
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
They saved it over on the other side of my stupid desktop.

1682
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I'll just put this in here for Ellie as our fan.

1683
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Okay.

1684
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Yeah, I wanted to get them all in there.

1685
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I wanted to have Flowerhead because he's my boy.

1686
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I wanted to have Katie because she's got lore.

1687
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yeah.

1688
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
She's got lore that I'm invested in.

1689
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I had to have the pony.

1690
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I had to have the pony.

1691
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I had to have the little hippo.

1692
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I almost forgot about hippo.

1693
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I almost forgot that hippo is his own character.

1694
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I think when I was looking up the reference to figure out how big Lord of Ghosts is, I remember...

1695
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh, yeah, hippo's actually in comics.

1696
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Okay, well, I guess he gets the spot.

1697
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And you got the pumpkin alley doing the pose from the game that you could play right now.

1698
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Yeah, they're really doing it.

1699
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Instead of holding a party favor or a piece of cake or a drink, she's just got alley over the head.

1700
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
That's the party favor she's taken home.

1701
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And you got my giraffe right at the top.

1702
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
What's her name?

1703
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
You know, I was thinking about it.

1704
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I was calling her my giraffe OC for a long time.

1705
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
She's sort of like, oh, what if I was a furry?

1706
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
What if I was a giraffe?

1707
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I never really thought of a name.

1708
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I think her name is Lizzie, though.

1709
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I think I'm going to go with Lizzie.

1710
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I feel like I saw you say that somewhere.

1711
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I couldn't remember what it was.

1712
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I feel like I remember you saying, like, what if her name is this, haha, or something?

1713
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I think I was like going with like, if I like Lizzie's a cool name and people sort of assumed that I was changing my name to Lizzie.

1714
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
And they started referring to me as that.

1715
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And I was like, you know, maybe actually, no, I don't want to be.

1716
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I like it, but I don't think that's me.

1717
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I don't think Lizzie is me.

1718
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But it is a good name.

1719
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Yeah, giraffe is Lizzie.

1720
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
That's my final offer.

1721
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
My foot's coming down, hoof down.

1722
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Now, now I know.

1723
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I'm putting my hoof down just like that one pony episode.

1724
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Do you think red man could kill iron will?

1725
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
How much slime does iron will have?

1726
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Oh, I don't think he has any.

1727
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah, so that's that's rough.

1728
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:09,000
With that, I think if he had no slime, I feel like iron will would win because he would just like, if like, all you have to do is get like one good hidden and red man would just be like,

1729
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
a balloon and red man would just pop like a balloon.

1730
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:21,000
If he, if he, if he, with his horns, I think he would just like deflate like a, like a, like a punctured water balloon.

1731
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Yeah.

1732
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And all the blood would come out.

1733
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Yeah, all the blood comes flooding out.

1734
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Yeah.

1735
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Red man is.

1736
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:38,000
When you, when you, when you fight red man, when you win, it's like that scene in the shining where the elevator doors open and all the blood just comes like rushing out.

1737
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Like you do, like you do not, you do not want to get in a situation where you have to kill red man.

1738
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Oh, all right.

1739
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
All right.

1740
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So we got gun girl.

1741
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I could draw this, but I just wanted to explain it.

1742
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Red man and gun girl in the elevator in that Asuka Ray pose.

1743
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Shinji.

1744
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah.

1745
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Like an Evangelion pose.

1746
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Then the shining scene and then gun girls in there.

1747
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
You can see what happened.

1748
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
It's just her.

1749
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
It's just her.

1750
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
She's covered in blood.

1751
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And the blood comes out and it's like, oh, we know what happened.

1752
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Yeah.

1753
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Well, I drew, I drew that in slime and punishment.

1754
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:28,000
There's that scene of red man is singing on the, that tower on that one bridge in Boston.

1755
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:35,000
He gets gun, gun girl shoots him in the back of the head from behind and he falls down and he hits the ground with a big like plop.

1756
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And there's just a big like wave of blood just covers phantom and strawberry.

1757
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Delightful.

1758
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
What else can I say?

1759
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Love red man.

1760
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Yeah.

1761
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Uh, what do you, well, I've, as I said, like an hour ago, I got nothing to say.

1762
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:11,000
What do you, I mean, do you think it's time for, for voicemails or can we, or can we pad this out?

1763
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
No, we can pad, we can pad.

1764
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
We can pad.

1765
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
We can, we can, we can, we can, uh, we can talk about, we can talk about every character you didn't draw.

1766
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Starting with Clarissa Gunsmoke.

1767
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I forgot Clarissa.

1768
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I sketch, you know what, I sketched Clarissa.

1769
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
How did you?

1770
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Yeah.

1771
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
No shit.

1772
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Now I remember I was, I drew the heads in and I remember I drew, I remember I drew like the hat.

1773
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I drew a little sketch of the hat on a head and then I like, I hid the layer.

1774
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Oh fuck.

1775
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yeah.

1776
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I hid the layer and I was like, I'll come back to this and then I forgot that that layer was there.

1777
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And I told, I guess I could, I guess I completely spaced on Clarissa Gunsmoke.

1778
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Damn, I forgot until you told me just now.

1779
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Oops.

1780
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Ah, it's okay.

1781
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I don't want to like, like, like show you for a drawing that you gave me before.

1782
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
No, no, you're right.

1783
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
No, you're right.

1784
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It's garbage.

1785
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
It's trash.

1786
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Throw it away.

1787
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Uh, delete.

1788
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Uh, that's true though.

1789
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I totally, I did, I meant, I forgot.

1790
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I meant to, but it just didn't, it just didn't happen.

1791
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
If, if Clarissa was on this, she's like seven feet tall.

1792
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So she'd be taller than Flowerhead.

1793
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
She's taller than Flowerhead.

1794
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Is she taller than Redman?

1795
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Like, canonically?

1796
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
In this image?

1797
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Uh, not canonically.

1798
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
No, no, no.

1799
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Not, not in this image.

1800
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I mean like, in your mind, Zye.

1801
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
In my mind.

1802
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I think he's a little taller than her, but mostly he's like a wide figure.

1803
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:55,000
You wouldn't think of him as like a tall character more so as like a large circle.

1804
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Ah, I see.

1805
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So how tall, how tall is Clarissa?

1806
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Is she like seven feet tall?

1807
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Yeah, she's seven feet tall.

1808
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
She's a tall girl.

1809
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Yeah.

1810
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Okay.

1811
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Sounds about right.

1812
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
It was very helpful.

1813
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I was scrolling through you.

1814
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I scrolled back through your feed to see your height chart for Lizzie.

1815
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh yeah.

1816
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Which very clearly was like she is about, she's 18 feet tall.

1817
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
So I'm like, okay.

1818
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah.

1819
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,000
So I'll have, I'll have Big come up to you about her like her rib cage or something like that.

1820
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Very clear, concise, easy to understand.

1821
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Yes.

1822
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Portions on that.

1823
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:45,000
One third for the legs, one third for the body and then one third for the neck and the head.

1824
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Yeah.

1825
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I think I looked at like giraffe, like average heights.

1826
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And I think like for female giraffes, 18 feet is kind of normal.

1827
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
So I just changed it.

1828
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Like if she was a real giraffe, her legs would just be like another pair of legs and she wouldn't have arms.

1829
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
And that was just be how tall she is.

1830
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Yeah.

1831
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:20,000
It looks like giraffe's height, 16 to 19 for a male adult, 14 to 17 for a, for a female adult.

1832
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
So big.

1833
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
So big and long.

1834
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Big and long.

1835
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Big and strong.

1836
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
So ripped.

1837
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Does Lizzie lift?

1838
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I don't know if she lifts.

1839
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Giraffes normally lift.

1840
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I guess they lift their big head.

1841
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Sure.

1842
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
They're big men.

1843
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
All members of the animal kingdom get under the bar and pump iron.

1844
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Yeah.

1845
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Imagine someone that big getting under the bar.

1846
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
They'd have to like lie across the road.

1847
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I've heard it said that like if a gorilla could like understand the, like the activity of like lifting weights for strength gain, they could bench like thousands of pounds.

1848
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Like they're so much stronger than humans are.

1849
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,000
But you just, but you can't get them to do it because they're just not, they don't, they don't understand.

1850
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
They don't want to.

1851
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
They just want to sit in that big fat ass.

1852
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Believe me, they've tried.

1853
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Believe me, they've tried.

1854
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
They want to like do gorilla warfare.

1855
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
They need to train the gorillas for combat.

1856
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Yeah.

1857
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But like these gorillas are so like fat and lazy.

1858
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
They're like, I feel only we could whip these gorillas into shape.

1859
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Get them out there in the field.

1860
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Give them a gun.

1861
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Give them a little helmet, a little med pack and send them out with a mission.

1862
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I had a.

1863
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
But they just, they don't, they don't have, they're not patriotic enough.

1864
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I'd love to play like a team fortress too, but with different types of monkeys, different apes.

1865
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Would they just play exactly like the classes already play?

1866
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Yeah, no, they would be like team fortress too just means like being like different classes for different roles.

1867
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
So the gorilla would be the one that charges and smashes things.

1868
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And then the Gibbon would be the climbing one and swinging around.

1869
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So you mean like a class, a class based?

1870
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Class based first person shooter or first person puncher.

1871
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Based on different eight varieties.

1872
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Yeah.

1873
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Yeah, they would.

1874
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And the baboons and they would bite, I guess.

1875
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I guess they might throw, they might throw rocks or something.

1876
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

1877
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
The gorillas would like throw tires at each other.

1878
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And then there'd be the orangutans and they'd like, they dazzle the others with their flanges.

1879
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
It'd be a flange dazzle button.

1880
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yeah, they'd be like a bard.

1881
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
They'd like give passive buffs.

1882
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
They'd dazzle the opponents.

1883
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Yeah, blind them.

1884
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
They're just there to be a pretty face.

1885
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Apes, apes are, I gotta say it, apes are horrifying.

1886
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Apes, just generally.

1887
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Yeah, I find apes like quite disgusting.

1888
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I don't know if I've ever made that clear.

1889
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I do not like looking at them.

1890
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Huh.

1891
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I thought, I always thought they were like, I don't know, lumpy and funny looking and like relatable because you can see they have like a sort of expressions that are almost similar to humans.

1892
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I find them, I find them off-putting.

1893
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I find them off-putting and weird because of like, yeah, they're kind of like a human, but they're like dumb and like ugly and like dirty and like lumpy and gross and then like, ugh.

1894
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:55,000
But like a silverback gorilla is like a peak, like peak masculinity.

1895
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I guess.

1896
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Like this is what a real man looks like with that stance.

1897
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It's actually not true.

1898
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It's actually false.

1899
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
With those huge shoulders and that like arched back.

1900
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Yeah, I mean.

1901
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
They got the puppy arms.

1902
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
It's so fucking funny.

1903
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Sure.

1904
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I mean, listen, there's lots, there's lots to praise about apekine.

1905
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Don't get me wrong.

1906
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
They're just, they're just not for me.

1907
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
They're just not my cup of tea.

1908
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I don't like chimpanzees.

1909
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I think chimpanzees have too big of ears.

1910
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
They're, they're listening, they're listening to me and they're listening to too much.

1911
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
They got too much info.

1912
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Are, are like, um, are like lemur, are lemurs apes?

1913
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
They're not.

1914
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
No, they're monkeys.

1915
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I think smaller varieties are classed as monkeys.

1916
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
They are monkeys.

1917
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Okay.

1918
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
I mean, I like lemurs.

1919
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
They're, they're, they're, they're far enough from human that they don't like.

1920
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Yeah.

1921
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
They're more like squirrels.

1922
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Yeah.

1923
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:59,000
They don't like creep me out in the way that like an ape, like an ape does.

1924
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Yeah.

1925
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
They look, they do look more like a squirrel.

1926
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I guess they are sort of simian.

1927
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Yeah.

1928
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:12,000
They are wet nose mammals of the super family limeroidia.

1929
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Are they monkeys?

1930
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I think the difference is the monkeys have tails and apes do not, but maybe there's more to

1931
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
it.

1932
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Okay.

1933
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Okay.

1934
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Lemurs share, okay.

1935
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
They are primates.

1936
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Hmm.

1937
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,560
They are not, they are neither monkeys nor apes.

1938
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:33,000
They are, they evolved independently from monkeys and apes.

1939
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
So like, they're kind of their own thing, you know.

1940
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
This is another primate wikipedia moment.

1941
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,120
They just looked up the Barbary macaque and the bonnet, the bonnet macaque and the Barbary

1942
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,120
macaque.

1943
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,120
Now they're too human.

1944
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,120
I don't like looking at them.

1945
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,240
I don't want to see that.

1946
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,240
Gibbons are apes.

1947
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,240
Oh yeah.

1948
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:56,240
They don't have tails.

1949
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:57,240
Right.

1950
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:01,240
It's like on ape.

1951
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:06,480
Do apes have tails?

1952
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,560
Is that the defining feature of ape kind?

1953
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,840
That's always how I've always understood it is like, you see all these primates, they

1954
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,040
don't have tails and you think of them as apes and then the little funny ones that have

1955
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:25,080
tails, they're monkeys, but I don't actually know if that's true at all.

1956
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,320
I'm going to google that exact question.

1957
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:30,440
Ape tail question mark?

1958
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,560
Nope.

1959
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,560
First result.

1960
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:36,520
The quickest way to tell the difference between a monkey and an ape is the presence or absence

1961
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,240
of a tail.

1962
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:39,960
Almost all monkeys have tails.

1963
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:40,960
Apes do not.

1964
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,120
Well, there you go.

1965
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:45,720
So I guess there are some tailless monkeys.

1966
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:49,280
That's interesting.

1967
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,120
Well, now we know.

1968
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:58,560
We've learned a lot here today.

1969
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:06,560
And then all of those apes, they play monkey football and apes take two and then they use

1970
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,440
their ape strength to smash that ball.

1971
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,440
Let's smash that like button.

1972
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:19,680
Now a sensible, sober, reasonable and not too fantastical game of soccer or football

1973
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:24,320
as you like between between different kinds of apes.

1974
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:27,920
Now that would be something.

1975
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:33,360
You know, you got your, I don't know, I think at a rangutan would make a good goalie because

1976
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,480
he's got really long arms.

1977
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:36,480
Yeah.

1978
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:42,520
And do they ever do funny things with the planets of the apes movies?

1979
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:46,200
Was it always like, we hate being in a cage and now we're going to fucking kill you and

1980
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:47,720
beat the shit out of you?

1981
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,640
Do they ever play like monkey football?

1982
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,360
I don't know.

1983
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:54,280
They made like three of those movies.

1984
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:57,560
Wait, wait, do you mean the old ones or like the newer ones?

1985
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:58,560
Any of them.

1986
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,040
I feel like the newer ones did have like wacky stuff happen in them.

1987
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,040
I don't know.

1988
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,040
I only saw the first one.

1989
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,040
I remember the first one.

1990
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,000
I remember Draco Malfoy said the line.

1991
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,720
He said, you damn dirty ape.

1992
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:16,920
And the ape remembered and he beat the shit out of him.

1993
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:23,480
And then they smashed like the, the, the, the rotine like gate fence and they used the,

1994
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:28,680
the spikes on the top of the fence as like spears and they threw them as like, oh fuck.

1995
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:30,080
I guess an ape could do that.

1996
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,080
I guess they could.

1997
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:36,280
Oh, they, they could do a lot of things.

1998
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,920
You'd be, you'd be, you'd be shocked.

1999
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:41,560
They could bench press a thousand pounds.

2000
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:42,560
Easily.

2001
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,560
Easily.

2002
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,560
Rip you in half.

2003
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,560
Rip you in fucking.

2004
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:50,440
The apes rose up, but just to win all the sports competitions, they didn't kill anyone.

2005
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:56,280
That's the difference between other apes and humans is that apes are like, humans are,

2006
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,440
humans are efficient.

2007
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,880
Humans are weaker, but we're way more efficient.

2008
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:05,280
Like we, like for our body mass, we have to eat a lot less than apes do, which gives

2009
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,480
us like free time, like, because we don't have to spend like all of our time hunting.

2010
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,480
Yeah.

2011
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:18,080
It's like the, it's like the, you know, the fastest land mammal is a cheetah unless you

2012
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:22,480
account for humans inventing the bicycle and then we're faster.

2013
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:28,480
Well, actually a human, a human could hunt, could catch a cheetah because a cheetah can't

2014
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,000
maintain that speed for a long time.

2015
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:38,880
A human can maintain like a base speed for like hours, days, a cheetah like can run really

2016
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,360
fast really quickly, but it gets tired and like over a long period, the human will catch

2017
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,760
up to it because it just, it just can't, it doesn't have the stamina.

2018
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,400
Yeah, but also a human could have like a fighter jet and like zoom and like bomb it.

2019
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,400
Oh yeah.

2020
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,400
Yeah.

2021
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,400
True.

2022
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,400
Also true.

2023
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,400
Yeah.

2024
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,400
Fair.

2025
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,200
And if it's, and if it's just about, I mean, if you don't care about like catching it and

2026
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:05,800
like cooking it, if you, if you're okay, like blowing it to smithereens and like, yeah,

2027
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,000
we have a lots of tools at our disposal for that sort of thing.

2028
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,080
Did you see that image?

2029
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,680
I don't know if I posted it anywhere.

2030
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:20,800
It was something I saw on Twitter that was like nine images, you have to pick two of

2031
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:32,040
these groups of animals, there's like five gorillas, seven oxen, 10,000 rats, 50 vultures,

2032
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:43,400
one guy with a rifle, five alligators, three bears, and two lions or four lions.

2033
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:47,080
And you had to pick two and make them fight each other.

2034
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,080
No, pick two.

2035
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:54,720
And those are the guys that are defending you and you have to fight the rest.

2036
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:59,600
Let me find the image so you can, you can, you can think about it.

2037
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:00,600
Mike.

2038
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:06,120
I want to know, I want to know your, your, your reasoning.

2039
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:11,960
I think I have an answer, although I guess I'll take a look at the image to be sure.

2040
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,280
All right, there it is.

2041
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,280
Hmm.

2042
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:21,480
So it's not as, it's not as simple as you may think, because as soon as you pick two,

2043
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:26,440
you have to think about all the other ones and how they're going to catch you.

2044
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,440
Hmm.

2045
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,440
My, yeah.

2046
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:29,440
Okay.

2047
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:39,880
My first thought, and I'm not sure if I believe it, my first thought was, um, to go as, like

2048
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:44,880
as diverse as possible, like the two opposite ends of the spectrum.

2049
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:50,880
So one guy with a rifle and the 10,000 rats, and the 10,000 rats can swarm anything that

2050
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:56,200
might be coming at me and basically distract them for long enough for the guy with the

2051
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,440
rifle to pick them off.

2052
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:04,280
Uh, I mean, I'm not, would that work?

2053
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:11,360
Like would the 10,000 rats, would three bears coming at me even notice 10,000 rats like crawling

2054
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,360
on them?

2055
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,360
Yeah.

2056
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,360
It's hard to imagine 10,000 rats.

2057
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,360
Yeah.

2058
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,240
That's a lot of rats.

2059
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,560
It's a lot of rats.

2060
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:27,440
I feel like there would be enough rats to at least swarm all of the big things, like

2061
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:34,320
the gorillas, the lions, the wolves, the bears, and the gators, and the ox or the bulls.

2062
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,240
Rats can't do shit about the falcon or the 50 falcons.

2063
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:44,520
And I always thought like, if there's 50 falcons or eagles or whatever, um, the only

2064
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:50,040
guy that can take care of them is the guy with the gun, but he needs to hit 50 shots

2065
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:56,200
and get all of them before they swarm him because if he's under attack by 50 eagles,

2066
01:55:56,200 --> 01:56:00,120
he's not going to be able to focus and shoot anything.

2067
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,680
Like he's going to be swatting them away or running.

2068
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:07,400
Do you, do you think you have to pick the falcons just because nothing can effectively

2069
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,800
defend against them?

2070
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:14,000
I would always pick the gorillas because I imagine the falcon coming down and then the

2071
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,520
gorilla just slapping it out of the air.

2072
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,480
I just, I just like that because they have opposable thumbs.

2073
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:26,200
They have the ability to like slap things and grab the rest of them, like the bears,

2074
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:29,400
the wolves, the lions, they, they don't have hands.

2075
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:34,120
They have to bite that stuff and that's harder.

2076
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:39,880
The 50, 50 falcons, I mean, I don't know how effective they are.

2077
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:45,640
I know from the animorphs that such birds can like rake eyes and like pluck eyes out.

2078
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:49,880
So they might be able to like blind the gorillas at which point they could no longer defend

2079
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:53,680
you effectively at all.

2080
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:57,640
I don't, I don't know if they would could do that.

2081
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:02,200
I'm not sure if like, if they'd be able to do that before the gorillas like swatted

2082
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:03,520
them all out of the air.

2083
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:08,840
Okay, I'm actually going, I'm circling back to the rats though because I'm looking it

2084
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:15,040
up and a rat weighs like, it kind of depends on the, on the variety of rats.

2085
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:17,920
Some rats can weigh up to a pound.

2086
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:24,480
And so, and like a bear, well, a, well a black bear weighs 600 pounds.

2087
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,840
These are brown bears.

2088
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:30,080
How much does a grizzly bear weigh?

2089
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:35,800
A grizzly bear weighs 600 pounds.

2090
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:40,720
Wait, wait, a black bear and a grizzly bear weigh the same amount?

2091
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,480
No, that's, that can't be right.

2092
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:47,760
Black bears are small, comparatively.

2093
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:52,280
I thought so too, but I mean, that's, it's telling me that they both weigh about 600.

2094
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:55,880
Okay, grizzly bears can weigh upward of 700.

2095
01:57:55,880 --> 01:58:03,680
Either way though, even if they weighed a thousand pounds, 10,000 rats is way more biomass

2096
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:07,480
than, you know, three, three grizzly bears.

2097
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:11,640
Like, that's by far the most animal.

2098
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:16,480
So like, if they, if they're aggressive, I feel like 10,000 rats is enough that they

2099
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:24,280
could swarm over a bear and like, yeah, I think the 10,000 rat, well, they could beat

2100
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:28,720
one bear, they could maybe even beat three bears, but then would there be anything left

2101
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,320
of them afterwards to deal with everything else?

2102
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:35,320
Yeah, it's, it's, I feel like the question is impossible.

2103
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,320
Like you, you're gonna die.

2104
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:41,240
I don't think, I don't think any two, yeah, I don't think any two of these guys could,

2105
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,080
could beat all the rest.

2106
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:50,240
Like the, I think logically 10,000 rats and the 50 Falcons would be good to like pick

2107
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,240
off.

2108
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,240
Wait a minute.

2109
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,240
The smaller numbers of more dangerous things.

2110
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:57,840
Wait a minute, but then, but then there's a guy with a gun who can just shoot you.

2111
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,520
That's true, but we don't know how close he is.

2112
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:06,400
So if, if we're like in a, in a separate field, separate sides of a field and I send the Falcons

2113
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:10,880
out to get the guy, he needs to shoot all of them and then the rest of the, like he'll

2114
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,760
get a few, then the rest of them will get his eyes out and then he can't do shit.

2115
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,840
And it's sort of, I guess the same with everything else.

2116
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:24,120
If they, if the Falcons can get to their eyes and like blind them, the rats can like swarm

2117
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:26,720
them, do the rest.

2118
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,240
Probably maybe.

2119
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,240
Yeah.

2120
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:32,040
I think that's, yeah.

2121
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:36,920
If the guy, I mean, if the guy with the gun has a clear shot, like you're just fucked.

2122
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:41,280
Like, like nothing can, can defend you from that.

2123
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,280
You got to pick defensively.

2124
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:49,880
You got to pick on the basis of like, I'll take whatever thing I least want coming after

2125
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:50,880
me.

2126
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:55,440
Gun guy is a strong contender for that one, for that role.

2127
01:59:56,040 --> 02:00:02,320
Like lions are pretty fast, wolves are pretty fast, gorillas and bears, gorillas are pretty

2128
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,120
fast actually when they get going.

2129
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,040
I guess everything is pretty fast.

2130
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:13,920
If it turns out to like, if I'm, if I have agency and I can do fighting, I probably would

2131
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:24,120
be more able to like, agilely get away from like a bull than I would a lion or a gorilla.

2132
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:29,880
But I feel like my, my abilities, I would need them to be killed in order for me to

2133
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,760
actually survive.

2134
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:38,160
So the rats would just at least over, like a war of attrition, the rats would win just

2135
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:44,080
because of the sheer numbers and then they, they, they, the, the rats would pile on top

2136
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,720
of each other and they become like a rat mech.

2137
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,720
The rat king.

2138
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,720
Yeah.

2139
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:53,360
And then of course there would be a giant rat that makes all the rules.

2140
02:00:53,360 --> 02:01:01,000
So yeah, does the 10,000 include one giant one that makes the rules that might tip it

2141
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
in their favor?

2142
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,640
Ah, that's too much.

2143
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:09,000
No, there's no, no two of these can stop the other seven.

2144
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,520
It's just, it's just, it just can't, it can't be done.

2145
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,800
The rest is coming to kill you.

2146
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,800
Why?

2147
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,880
Why do they want to kill me?

2148
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:20,880
Why is this happening?

2149
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:25,800
Yeah, there's a point when you read this and you're like, why do they defend me and

2150
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,920
why are they trying to kill me?

2151
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,400
Animals don't act like this.

2152
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:34,840
What do I have, what do I have that two of these animals want to like get on my good

2153
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,960
side that I'll give them and that the others want to like kill me and get?

2154
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:41,000
Like what's, what's, what's so special about me?

2155
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,320
A little dog treats.

2156
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,960
I got Scooby Snacks.

2157
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:47,240
You got, your pockets are just full of snacks.

2158
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:53,920
The snacks are so good that the guy wants them as well.

2159
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:58,600
Yeah, he's like, it's his favorite.

2160
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:05,640
They just smell, the bears have their noses in the air like sniffing like, what's that?

2161
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:10,480
Then they come across like a pack of walls, it's like, oh, you smell it too?

2162
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,400
Let's go, let's go see what it is.

2163
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:13,920
Let's team up.

2164
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:19,880
Like we got to, we got to work, if we work together, you know, like all 15 of you wolves

2165
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:22,360
and all three of us bears, we can each get a little morsel.

2166
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,360
We can each get a little snack roll of whatever.

2167
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:27,240
It's only a, it's only a pocket full of snacks.

2168
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:30,840
But it's so good though.

2169
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,280
It's exactly what you want.

2170
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:37,920
Oh, hit the spot perfectly.

2171
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,560
Simsie says 50 hawks and five gorillas.

2172
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,560
I mean, yeah.

2173
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:52,240
I just feel like if you don't pick the rats, how, yeah, 50 hawks could not, they could

2174
02:02:52,240 --> 02:03:00,560
feel like 50 rats, I don't know, every 10 seconds maybe.

2175
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:07,920
Yeah, most of the swarm would get to you and like 5,000 rats, the 5,000 rats that

2176
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:11,200
manage to get to you, like they're going to kill you.

2177
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:13,240
You're going to get nod to death.

2178
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:18,840
Maybe I choose the guy and then, I don't know, the, the, whatever, the gorilla.

2179
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:23,280
And then I give the guy the snacks and I run away.

2180
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,400
So they're coming after him.

2181
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:28,320
So it's just one guy with a gun and it's 5,000 against everything else.

2182
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:30,000
Yeah, that's actually, that's it.

2183
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,400
You just disguise him and I pick the guy, disguise him as me and then I leave him and

2184
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:40,640
I take his shoes so that I'm faster than him and then I run away and leave him behind

2185
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,000
to receive the brunt of it.

2186
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,560
Genius.

2187
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,160
Are those, are those bulls?

2188
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,320
Is that what those are?

2189
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,120
Yeah, I think so.

2190
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:52,720
Is it oxen or?

2191
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:53,280
Yeah.

2192
02:03:53,280 --> 02:04:00,320
They're, they're, they're male cows and they're charging that you in a, in a, what do you call it?

2193
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:02,720
Matador sort of style.

2194
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,640
If you had a piece of red cloth, you'd be golden.

2195
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:18,880
I talked, I talked, I talked last week about my favorite animal, the oryx from the bible

2196
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:25,600
and, or not, no, the ream and how it might be an oryx or an ox or a bull or something.

2197
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:30,320
But I don't actually, I don't really know that if, okay, I'm looking, oxen are like big fat

2198
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:31,120
things.

2199
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,720
Yeah, they're, they're lumbary bumbers.

2200
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,040
Oxen are big lumbary bumbers.

2201
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:38,240
Bulls are a little more, I guess, normal looking.

2202
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:41,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2203
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:52,080
Oxen are bred for pulling the, the plow and, and bulls are just there to fuck the cows.

2204
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,200
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2205
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,600
And I guess you can eat them.

2206
02:04:58,720 --> 02:04:59,760
I guess you can eat them.

2207
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,040
You can eat the bull at some point.

2208
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,560
You eat them.

2209
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,080
Oh yeah.

2210
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:04,560
Oh yeah.

2211
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:07,520
And you make a steak and kidney pie out of them.

2212
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,280
You can only make two of them though.

2213
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:12,720
They only got two kidneys.

2214
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,560
They got a lot of steak, but only two kidneys.

2215
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:15,840
It's a, it's a rare treat.

2216
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:27,920
I will make a gummy kidney and carve it up and make a pie out of it.

2217
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:29,840
Gummy pies.

2218
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,040
Yeah, sure.

2219
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:31,600
Yeah, sure.

2220
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:32,080
Why not?

2221
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:41,360
Meat, meat substitute, little cubes of chopped up meat, little steaks, but gummy and they

2222
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:44,640
flavored with beef powder or whatever the fuck.

2223
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,360
Okay, I'll show up to my neck.

2224
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:52,720
I'll show up to a fourth of July barbecue and be like, Hey guys, you know, I have a nice,

2225
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:57,520
you know, vet meat substitute for you and I'll take out like chicken drumsticks and

2226
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,000
like steaks and stuff that I just made out of gummy.

2227
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:05,520
Now let's throw, I'll throw it on the grill and it will just immediately melt and just drip through.

2228
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,040
And everyone will say then.

2229
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:12,800
I'm imagining that they're like the small, like, like tiny little pellet-sized chicken wings.

2230
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:15,920
Oh, like, like a tiny little, like a tiny little, you know, like.

2231
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:18,240
And they just fall in between the cracks of the grill.

2232
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,480
Like, like stay on there.

2233
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:23,440
Like the SpongeBob gummy Krabby Patty, like it's tiny.

2234
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:24,640
Just, just tiny, just tiny.

2235
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,840
I'll just grab a handful.

2236
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:28,000
It's like a little handful of like gummy chicken.

2237
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,760
Just scatter them on the fire.

2238
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:35,520
And everyone will say, Ben, why are you like vegetarian now or something?

2239
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,240
And I'll say, no, no, it's made with pork gelatin.

2240
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,840
No, no, it's an animal product.

2241
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,200
There's no, there's no reason.

2242
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:45,360
And the fire goes blue.

2243
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,680
And gaze into it and see your future.

2244
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,200
And it's an image of you eating.

2245
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,800
At the barbecue.

2246
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:08,480
What if you could see your future, but it was only the most uninteresting moment?

2247
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:11,360
Like, like, oh, tomorrow you'll be on the toilet.

2248
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:13,120
Here's what that looks like.

2249
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,080
Nice.

2250
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,760
Tomorrow you'll eat.

2251
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:19,920
Oh, oh, what's that?

2252
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,840
Oh, it looks like tomorrow I'm going to eat.

2253
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,480
Oh, a ham and cheese wrap.

2254
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:25,520
Oh, just like today.

2255
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:26,400
Oh, cool.

2256
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:26,720
Nice.

2257
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,120
Sounds can't, I can't wait.

2258
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:30,000
It's going to be delicious.

2259
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:34,560
I can't wait.

2260
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,080
This is getting me excited.

2261
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,920
As soon as this podcast is over, I'm going to go,

2262
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:39,200
I'm going to make another gummy batch.

2263
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:43,120
I'm going to see, I'm going to try it again with less gelatin.

2264
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:48,320
I discovered that I can reduce the gelatin and be fine.

2265
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:48,960
And that's good.

2266
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:52,400
I'm going to try and I'm going to try and increase the fiber

2267
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:55,200
and see if the less gelatin still works.

2268
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:56,880
With the increased fiber.

2269
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:00,560
And if it does, I'll be like, perfect, beautiful.

2270
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,960
Do you have like exact measurements for like grams and stuff

2271
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,080
of how much you're putting in?

2272
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:12,640
No, I don't have, I don't have like gram measurements.

2273
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:13,920
I use like tablespoons.

2274
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,720
Well, I mean, those are exact measurements

2275
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:18,720
if they're like consistent.

2276
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:23,600
Yeah, I mean, I do have a, I do have a specific recipe.

2277
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:28,160
That is like sort of my baseline now

2278
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,480
that I was like taking that baseline

2279
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,640
and like making slight changes too.

2280
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:36,400
And it's like seeing how it, I took that and I was like,

2281
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,480
okay, will it work with less gelatin?

2282
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:39,680
And I tried it with less gelatin.

2283
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,800
I was like, yeah, it's still worked.

2284
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:41,680
Okay, cool.

2285
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:49,760
Because I would like to have, I'd like to have the,

2286
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:52,480
basically the gelatin is just there to give it consistency.

2287
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:55,600
So the less, the least gelatin I can get away with

2288
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:58,400
while still keeping that consistency, it's like, okay, good.

2289
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:01,200
Any more gelatin than that would be a waste.

2290
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,520
And I would like to have as little water as possible

2291
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,360
because the water doesn't taste like anything.

2292
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,520
And you get the best consistency with the least water.

2293
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,920
It becomes like the chewiest and I like it chewy.

2294
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:14,400
So, and then the least sugar is possible

2295
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,240
because that's calories and calories are bad.

2296
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:21,680
So my goal is less gelatin, less water, less sugar, more fiber

2297
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:24,880
and try and find the optimal mixture there

2298
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:28,480
that gives the best consistency, the best flavor.

2299
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,800
And it doesn't like become like, if you use too much fiber,

2300
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:34,960
it kind of becomes kind of soft, sort of falls apart,

2301
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,160
sort of becomes kind of mushy.

2302
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,640
Like, well, that's, you know, that's not what you want.

2303
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:42,640
I guess you just have to keep doing like,

2304
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,560
all things in harmony.

2305
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:48,560
I guess you have to just keep doing the scientific method

2306
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:51,280
and like changing one thing at a time

2307
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:54,640
to see if that makes a difference, negative or positive

2308
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:57,200
and trial and error your way to the perfect gum.

2309
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,120
Nobody told me,

2310
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:02,800
ugh, nobody told me that the scientific method,

2311
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,480
they had to do it over and over again.

2312
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:08,880
Nobody, nobody told me I would have to do more than one experiment.

2313
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:13,840
I thought I could just read my book and then do it immediately.

2314
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:18,240
I thought, I was just like, wait, I thought, you know,

2315
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,440
it's like rabbit said in Poo's grand adventure, you know,

2316
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,880
if it says so, so it is.

2317
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:28,000
I thought I could just, just write it down and be like, okay, I'm done.

2318
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,520
And there would be nothing left to learn.

2319
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:32,160
You're telling me I have to like gather information

2320
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:35,360
and like form a hypothesis and then test the hypothesis?

2321
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:37,680
Yes.

2322
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:38,000
No.

2323
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:43,200
Well, I will do that then.

2324
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:46,480
Because I care.

2325
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,920
Because I care about my work.

2326
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:53,040
I am, I am, I'm very, I'm very happy.

2327
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:55,680
You become a gummy wizard when you get the right recipe.

2328
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:57,280
Until then, you're a gummy apprentice.

2329
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,120
I have a recipe and I would consider it a success.

2330
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:03,360
And now it's just like, okay, but is there other,

2331
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:06,240
what marginal improvements can I make to like perfect it?

2332
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,240
That's, that's the goal.

2333
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:12,240
The frustrating thing, the frustrating thing is when I try to do it,

2334
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,440
I always try to do like, okay, add more sugar,

2335
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:18,960
add more sugar to make it like more candy-like.

2336
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,040
But every time I do that, it becomes goo.

2337
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:24,080
Like if you put too much sugar in it, it doesn't work at all.

2338
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,200
It just comes out as goo.

2339
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:28,560
It's like, there's, there's a line.

2340
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:31,200
There's a, there's a threshold that I'm crossing.

2341
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:35,040
I want to find like the perfect just enough

2342
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:38,240
so I can get the maximum like candy nests to it without like

2343
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:41,040
going over that threshold and it just becomes goo.

2344
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:44,000
It's so, it's so delicate.

2345
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:50,400
Such a fine, fine line, such a fine process of refinement.

2346
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,040
It's beautiful.

2347
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,960
Anyway, that's what I'm going to do as soon as this podcast is over.

2348
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:59,920
Do you want to start voicemails?

2349
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:01,280
Uh, yeah.

2350
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:07,600
Yeah, we have a modest amount this week.

2351
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,160
I'm on Speakpipe.

2352
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:10,800
Do you see them?

2353
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:11,680
Yep.

2354
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:12,880
All right.

2355
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:16,320
Looks like our first one is called My Deepest Gratitude.

2356
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,800
Three, two, one, go.

2357
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,760
Ben, I don't know how I didn't know about DigiBro's opinion of Netflix's cuties before,

2358
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,160
but thank you so much for bringing up on the podcast.

2359
02:12:26,160 --> 02:12:30,400
I'm so fucking glad that now I know for real, I have confirmation

2360
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:33,600
that DigiBro is in fact not into black little girls.

2361
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:37,600
And I, I don't know how I lived without having this information before.

2362
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:39,840
It's amazing.

2363
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:40,480
It's perfect.

2364
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:41,200
Thank you so much.

2365
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:46,720
I forget what that was from, but I remember the clip of maybe saying-

2366
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,320
It's not, it's not from anything.

2367
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,000
It just, it just is its own thing.

2368
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,600
Was it just in like a Twitter video?

2369
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,360
I, maybe it was on Twitter.

2370
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:59,280
Yeah, I guess it wasn't on YouTube.

2371
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:04,800
I remember it was during the MayisDigibro arc, which technically never ended and continues.

2372
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:07,680
It's just the way she says that line.

2373
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,920
It's the way she says it and the way that like-

2374
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:13,040
I mean, there's the line itself.

2375
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:17,760
I mean, there's every, there's everything that she's saying in the video,

2376
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,640
which is, which is like vile.

2377
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:24,480
I don't even remember what she says, but I can imagine.

2378
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,080
There's, there's everything that she says.

2379
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,480
There's the, that's bad enough.

2380
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:36,560
There's the context that she lays out for it, which is like, she's, she's talking to the IBS

2381
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:41,680
crowd, which I don't exactly know who that is, but I think it's like a killstream group of people.

2382
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:46,560
So she's talking to the killstream people, which is also bad that she's like having this

2383
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,560
conversation with these, with these demons.

2384
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:54,960
And then on top of that, I think kind of like the thing that sticks out to me the most about it is like

2385
02:13:56,240 --> 02:14:05,440
the confident way that she thinks she is mimicking the mannerisms of the quote-unquote

2386
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:12,000
character of DigiBro and she thinks she's nailing it, but like not even close.

2387
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:17,280
She's just yelling, like she's just yelling and she thinks she's doing something with it.

2388
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:20,000
And it's so amazing.

2389
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:20,800
It's beautiful.

2390
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,000
It really is just a classic that can never be topped.

2391
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,440
And you're welcome, voicemailer.

2392
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,280
Next one is called Did You Know?

2393
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,040
Three, two, one, go.

2394
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,480
Did you know that?

2395
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:39,920
Did you, did you know?

2396
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:44,000
I did, thanks.

2397
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,880
I didn't thank you for the knowledge.

2398
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,440
Next one is called Grading.

2399
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,880
Three, two, one, go.

2400
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,120
I give Ben St's grading system a five out of ten.

2401
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:56,960
What's my grading system?

2402
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:58,560
I don't know.

2403
02:14:59,120 --> 02:14:59,600
I remember.

2404
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,240
Shit.

2405
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:04,160
I don't remember what this is in regards to.

2406
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,280
Sorry.

2407
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,360
Next one is called Getting the Timelines Straight, but it's straight with an eight like Briska.

2408
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,560
Three, two, one, go.

2409
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:18,240
Also, what's the first procrastinator's forecast?

2410
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:19,200
What do you mean also?

2411
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:28,320
The second reticon, because you'll never mention it until one reticon until the third.

2412
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:29,520
What?

2413
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:35,040
Maybe this guy left a voicemail that we did last week, and then this is another one.

2414
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:37,360
I'm sorry.

2415
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:40,480
That's following on from it, but I can't remember what they said.

2416
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:46,640
Is he asking if the first procrastinator's was after the second reticon?

2417
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:52,000
You know, I'm not even sure.

2418
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,920
If I'm not even sure at all.

2419
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:56,400
We did that.

2420
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:57,120
We had the horse cast.

2421
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,240
The answer is no.

2422
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:07,040
And the procrastinators had existed for a while before any such thing as radcon occurred.

2423
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:10,720
Yeah.

2424
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:13,360
I honestly forget the order of events.

2425
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:15,600
We were the horseshoe crew.

2426
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:16,800
We had the horse cast.

2427
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:22,640
We went to Bronycon, or you went to Bronycon, but then I went to Bronycon at some point.

2428
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:24,960
And then after that, we decided to do radcons.

2429
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:26,560
That's all well.

2430
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,520
That's all well before radcon happened.

2431
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:38,560
No, I'm very confident the PCP was a thing before the first radcon, which, you know,

2432
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:42,960
the first radcon, we didn't even call it radcon at the time, right?

2433
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:49,600
Like, we just all went to Trixie's house for some reason, I think.

2434
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:53,920
I think, no, I think we came up with the name like the rad conference.

2435
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:56,400
It was a conference rather than a convention.

2436
02:16:57,680 --> 02:16:58,560
We kept saying that.

2437
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:02,560
Were you that you were there at the first one?

2438
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:04,080
Yeah, that was the first one.

2439
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:09,360
Second one was when Davoo and Munchie came, and Jeff, Loll.

2440
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,240
And Tom.

2441
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,240
Tom was not at the first one, was he?

2442
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:18,720
I don't think so.

2443
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:23,440
Wait, so the second one was the one where Davoo made the shirts?

2444
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,640
Yes.

2445
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:28,400
No.

2446
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:30,160
I don't remember Davoo.

2447
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:32,640
No, radcon one.

2448
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:40,880
I recorded Sonichu 101 was at radcon one because I didn't do a lecture at radcon two,

2449
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:42,080
and I always regretted it.

2450
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:48,480
Right, that was the plebe and the weeb radcon.

2451
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:51,280
Yes, radcon two was the plebe and the weeb radcon.

2452
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:57,440
Radcon one, but I had the shirt, but I had the shirt in the Sonichu video.

2453
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,400
I guess Davoo was there.

2454
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,000
So Davoo was there.

2455
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,760
Was Davoo living there at the time?

2456
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:04,400
Yes, she must have.

2457
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:05,040
That's right.

2458
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:05,680
Yes, that's right.

2459
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:06,400
We had moved in.

2460
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:10,720
We had just moved in, and so me and Davoo and Trixie were there and...

2461
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,200
Everyone else came.

2462
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,360
Everyone else just came just because?

2463
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,800
Was there no like...

2464
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:23,920
Well, there was no like overarching like let's do a specific thing.

2465
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,240
It's just like we like hanging out at Bronycon,

2466
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:28,880
but Bronycon only happens once a year or whatever.

2467
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:30,640
Let's just do it whenever.

2468
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:31,520
Let's meet up whenever.

2469
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:37,200
Was it like maybe the same year after the Bronycon, in fact?

2470
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,760
Was it just like basically the same time as the Bronycon?

2471
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:45,840
Like Bronycon ended, so we all went back to that house and just hung out?

2472
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:50,160
Bronycon was in the summer of that year, and I think at the winter,

2473
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:52,960
like November or something, we came together.

2474
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:57,760
And then January or February, the next year, was Radcon 2 or like March.

2475
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:00,400
It was close to the first one.

2476
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:04,640
I feel like we've rehashed this a few times,

2477
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:08,160
and like this is not the first time I've like struggled to remember,

2478
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,960
like why did Radcon even happen?

2479
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:12,160
I think you're right, yeah.

2480
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:14,000
Bronycon was in the summer.

2481
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,280
Bronycon was in the summer.

2482
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,360
Radcon was in the like winter,

2483
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:22,320
or Radcon was like a little like a couple months later.

2484
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:25,200
And then Radcon 2 was only like six months after that,

2485
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:29,200
because they had made the plans for the plebeant.

2486
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,440
At Radcon 1, they conceived of and planned out the plebeant and the weeb,

2487
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:34,880
and then a few months later they did it,

2488
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:39,040
and that was the excuse for Radcon 2, etc., etc.

2489
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:46,320
And Radcon 3, I remember coming in at some point to you and Munchy

2490
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:49,680
sitting in a closet conceiving endless war.

2491
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,560
And the butt and everything.

2492
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:53,520
F3? F3?

2493
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:54,080
I think so.

2494
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,360
Like before that, there was arm retrieval.

2495
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:58,640
That was the thing Munchy was doing.

2496
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:00,560
Yeah.

2497
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:04,800
And arm retrieval con happened at the end of Radcon 3.

2498
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,920
Yes. Yes, you're right.

2499
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:13,760
Because Radcon 3 was in winter in 2018.

2500
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:17,120
It was like January 2018.

2501
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,840
And then Endless War came online in April of 2018.

2502
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:25,120
So yeah, that would have been before.

2503
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:26,640
Wow. Imagine that.

2504
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:27,200
Wacky.

2505
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:27,680
Wacky.

2506
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:29,120
Wow.

2507
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:32,960
And then Radcon 4, we created COVID and we infected the world.

2508
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:36,800
We made, we sure did.

2509
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:40,000
And I gotta say, things have gotten better than expected.

2510
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:51,440
Anyway, but anyway, the PCP was already a thing.

2511
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:56,720
The PCP was the thing, there was the horseshoe crew.

2512
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,800
Now the PCP was already the PCP well before the first Radcon,

2513
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:01,440
that's for sure.

2514
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:06,480
Like the horse days, the horse days were over by then.

2515
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:13,680
Next one is called Ray Tracing, more like Gay Tracing.

2516
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:15,440
Three, two, one, go.

2517
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:20,160
People are adding realistic lighting to N64 games.

2518
02:21:20,160 --> 02:21:22,800
And I just have to wonder what the fuck is the point to all this.

2519
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:25,200
They're just making the games look a lot worse.

2520
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,400
Like they were created with an art style in mind.

2521
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:31,600
And they're just spitting on the faces of all the artists

2522
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,840
who had to craft the games to look a certain way

2523
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,560
because they were designed with that aesthetic in mind.

2524
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,440
Do people even think this shit looks cool?

2525
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:40,640
Because it doesn't.

2526
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:43,840
And if you do, then I guess you're just fucking stupid.

2527
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,560
Well, there's no reason to be so evil about it, but I...

2528
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:52,240
I have not seen what this guy's talking about.

2529
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:54,320
I don't know exactly either.

2530
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:57,520
I guess maybe it's mods or something.

2531
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:00,400
It was like Mario 64, realistic lighting.

2532
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:05,280
It just makes old games look bad because they didn't have the technology to do...

2533
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,200
How would you even add realistic lighting?

2534
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:10,160
How would you even add realistic lighting to Mario?

2535
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:12,160
I don't know.

2536
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:12,640
Would you make everything shiny?

2537
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:15,520
I mean, people have made like texture pack things in Minecraft

2538
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:17,920
that completely change the way the game looks.

2539
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:21,440
So I think you can mod stuff around if you have the code.

2540
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,280
But I mean, do you mean like, I don't know,

2541
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,640
light coming off of like torches in the castle or something?

2542
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:29,680
Or like what?

2543
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:36,560
I mean, even just something as simple as the sunlight being a point that casts shadows.

2544
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:39,120
They didn't have that in other games.

2545
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:44,720
The shadows were like objects instead of like procedurally generated

2546
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:46,640
based on positioning of things.

2547
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:50,880
But yeah, I generally dislike realistic lighting.

2548
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:57,920
As like a default, it makes it look gooder idea.

2549
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:02,080
It's an aesthetic that can look good if that's what you're going for,

2550
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:04,560
but like it is not a blanket upgrade.

2551
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:10,480
It's not a straight upgrade to the alternative, which is not that.

2552
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:13,920
I haven't seen it, what this guy's talking about,

2553
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:18,720
but I'm sure that it can't be an improvement on, you know,

2554
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:21,920
just like a well considered art style.

2555
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:25,920
As like a technical exercise, I can see how maybe it's like,

2556
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,040
how what if we added ray tracing realistic lighting?

2557
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,280
I doubt many people, I mean, unless I'm wrong and people do think this,

2558
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:40,240
but I feel like people aren't going to be like, ah, finally, you know,

2559
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:43,920
finally I can play the game and it looks good now

2560
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:46,160
because it's got realistic lighting.

2561
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:50,720
Oh, they're like the non realistic shadow physics always like bug me so much.

2562
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,280
Like I couldn't, I just couldn't handle it.

2563
02:23:54,560 --> 02:24:00,960
People pog at, I don't know, technical stuff, I guess.

2564
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:02,640
I guess they like it.

2565
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:04,640
I've never understood.

2566
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:09,120
I can't lie and say that seeing something as intricately

2567
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:15,680
like detailed and well lit and beautiful as something like, I don't know,

2568
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:18,240
blood borne, right?

2569
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:23,200
That has realistic lighting, but it's also extremely artistically designed.

2570
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:30,080
Like all of the things you would see and the way like,

2571
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:34,640
like realistic shadows and stuff play well in that sort of a setting.

2572
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:37,280
It doesn't make it worse or better.

2573
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,560
It's just sort of, it works.

2574
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,000
It's a tool.

2575
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,760
I guess that's the main thing.

2576
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:49,600
Realistic lighting is a tool, just the same as any artist's tool that you could use.

2577
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:52,480
And you don't have to use it all the time.

2578
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:57,680
A lot of games look good with it, but not all of them, especially not all the ones.

2579
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,120
I just, I find it so, it seems alien.

2580
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:08,960
It seems alien to me to be like, like excited about something like that,

2581
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:13,520
like realistic lighting, like ray tracing, technical specs.

2582
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:16,080
I don't even think people are excited about it.

2583
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,320
I think they're just so used to video games looking that way,

2584
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:22,080
that when they come across one that doesn't,

2585
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:27,840
they feel like there's something missing when they're, I don't know.

2586
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,280
Who can know the truth?

2587
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:36,880
Like it's off-putting to see an older visual style,

2588
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:39,040
because it's just games don't look like that anymore.

2589
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:41,040
I guess so.

2590
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:46,960
I mean, oblivion objectively looks quite ugly from today's standards,

2591
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:57,440
but even though the textures are kind of blurry and the distance,

2592
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:03,600
the pop-in draw distance is very low, and there's no anti-aliasing on like leaves of trees,

2593
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:08,960
I still look around and I can see that that's like a beautiful image that I'm looking at.

2594
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,960
It's just low fidelity in some areas.

2595
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:19,040
A high AHD like crispier version wouldn't ruin it, but it wouldn't,

2596
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:23,200
it's not like necessary for me to enjoy what they're going for artistically.

2597
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:28,080
Some of these like, especially since I've been like riding my horse instead of first traveling,

2598
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:33,120
I get to like see the scenic route and be looking and like, wow,

2599
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:38,400
they thought about how the imperial city would look up on this hill,

2600
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:42,320
looking down on the road towards like Shaden Hall or whatever.

2601
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:44,160
It's like, yeah.

2602
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:51,920
I think at the time of oblivion, it was a novel thing that the mountains in the distance

2603
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:55,600
were actually physically there that you could walk up to and climb

2604
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:58,000
before they would just be a skybox thing.

2605
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:02,480
And it's sort of like a marvel of the time that like you could actually go to all of these

2606
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:05,600
mountains that actually physically exist as 3D things.

2607
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:17,120
I think you'll never, you can never make like Mario 64 or even oblivion,

2608
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:19,920
like you can never make it look like a modern game.

2609
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:25,920
Like you would basically have to just completely remake it to accomplish something like that.

2610
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:32,640
Like you'll never be like, oh, well, it doesn't look like games look nowadays, but I have,

2611
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:38,720
oh, by changing this and that about it, I have made it look like a modern game.

2612
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,120
You just can't do it.

2613
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,160
You're always going to have to put up with or, you know, accept some amount of,

2614
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:49,440
oh, this game looks old because it is old.

2615
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:50,880
And there's just nothing you can do about that.

2616
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:57,120
I think there's also a thing with like remakes of games that are in a cartoony style made

2617
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:00,320
in an era where things were low poly like Crash Bandicoot.

2618
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:04,320
Newer versions of Crash Bandicoot don't look bad.

2619
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:09,360
They are different and they're different in a way that I don't particularly like.

2620
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:13,360
But I don't hate, you know, I don't think it's a worse Crash Bandicoot.

2621
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:17,600
Necessarily is no like objective like, oh, more polygons made it bad because he had

2622
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,600
less polygons when he was designed.

2623
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:25,600
It's just that the less polygon Crash Bandicoot looks great still.

2624
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,760
You don't need a HD version of him to play the game and have fun.

2625
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:33,680
But the HD version of like the remastered Crash games,

2626
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:35,440
I haven't actually played those particular ones.

2627
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:36,960
I played the Spyro remasters.

2628
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,800
They're still good.

2629
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,240
There's nothing wrong with them.

2630
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:43,840
And I don't mind that they did that.

2631
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:48,720
But I do mind when people say that there's like a preferred like better version.

2632
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:52,880
Like you have to play the one that's the remaster because it's HD.

2633
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:54,080
Like there's no.

2634
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:55,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2635
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,360
It's it's just a different.

2636
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:59,280
It's just it's an apples and oranges thing.

2637
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,040
That's how I feel about that.

2638
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:02,400
That's how I feel about Mega Man.

2639
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:09,760
Like I just I just don't I've been starting to appreciate the like later graphical style.

2640
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:14,720
Like I don't I used to hate the like higher resolution sprites

2641
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:17,840
unlike the PlayStation games like X4 and Onward.

2642
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,120
I used to hate them.

2643
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:22,640
I've sort of been like, it's not so bad.

2644
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:28,800
But I do think like it looked perfect on the SNES 16 bit.

2645
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,400
It does not.

2646
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:31,680
I don't think it looks better.

2647
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,720
I definitely don't think it looks better in any of the later more high tech consoles.

2648
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:42,080
Even though even though they like fucking the resolution is like 10,000 times better.

2649
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:43,920
Oh, it's more detailed.

2650
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:46,400
All the frame rates are like, yeah, so what?

2651
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:48,160
It's it's very easy for me.

2652
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:50,240
That's fine and all, I guess.

2653
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:58,080
It's very easy for me to like think of the higher resolution versions of these things as worse.

2654
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:04,000
Because they're not they're not original and they're just graphics over art style.

2655
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,400
But genuinely, it's not always the case.

2656
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:12,960
This is sometimes you can like keep the art style basically intact or the feeling of the art style.

2657
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:17,520
And like just do it a different way with modern tools and it's it's good.

2658
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:23,040
It just doesn't it should not diminish the past because the past looked good at the time.

2659
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:27,600
It still does stop me if I said this exact thing before.

2660
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:35,920
But like I came to appreciate the X4's graphics more because at first I'm like,

2661
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:40,800
oh, like the higher res sprites, so many frames of animation, so smooth,

2662
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,240
is this really necessary?

2663
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,120
Who needs all this?

2664
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:51,520
But then I played X5, which has the same sprites, but like much worse art direction.

2665
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:56,240
Like some of the backgrounds in X5 just look wrong.

2666
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:59,520
Like they took like a high resolution, well, not a high, you know,

2667
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:04,240
they took like a photograph or something and they just like scanned it.

2668
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:07,840
And they just put it as a background object and the lighting doesn't match.

2669
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:10,080
It looks like a bad Photoshop job.

2670
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:12,080
It sucks.

2671
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:15,840
Like they kind of just made X5 look bad.

2672
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:21,040
And then suddenly I'm like, oh, they actually they actually did fine with X4.

2673
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:24,160
Like it didn't it didn't suck the way this sucks.

2674
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:30,240
Like I can't I can't believe I can't believe how bad some things in X5 look like.

2675
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:34,320
They were just they thought like, oh, well, we got high resolution.

2676
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:38,080
We got more we got more pixels on that we can do anything we want.

2677
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:42,480
Oh, we can just have the final boss be a big PNG in the background.

2678
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:48,160
It's great though, because we can fit because we because because our game is in 480p now.

2679
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:51,200
And it's going to look like, oh, this is going to stand the test of time.

2680
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:52,960
Like that's what they thought.

2681
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,040
Hmm. Sloppy.

2682
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,160
You there?

2683
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:00,880
Yep.

2684
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:02,400
Okay, excuse me.

2685
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,880
I have no Mega Man thoughts.

2686
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,160
That's that's all right.

2687
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:08,000
I think we've I think we're on the same page.

2688
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:12,800
Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder play Delta Broom chapter two.

2689
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:13,680
Okay.

2690
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:18,320
Next one is called talk about pirates.

2691
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:19,680
Three, two, one, go.

2692
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:24,080
Hey, did you read the new one piece from a couple weeks ago?

2693
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,720
No, pretty crazy, right?

2694
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:29,200
Yes.

2695
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:33,200
Look, I just want to hear someone talk about one piece, people who I like,

2696
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:38,560
people who aren't Ben's obnoxious pseudo intellectual little brother.

2697
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:39,760
Thank you.

2698
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:46,480
You know, I mean, I mean, you know, that's, you know, that's a valid opinion.

2699
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:47,360
If that's your opinion.

2700
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,040
Ben, Ben, I understand that's fair.

2701
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:51,600
All right.

2702
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:52,160
It's valid.

2703
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:52,400
Yeah.

2704
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:57,360
I at the, I'm not sure exactly which one they're talking about.

2705
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:58,720
They made this thing yesterday.

2706
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,000
They're saying a few weeks ago.

2707
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:04,320
I think they could be referring to any, any number of different channels.

2708
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:07,760
But the the the 1.0 arc is essentially over now.

2709
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:11,840
Oh, I should, I should catch up then because I they are in the phase where it's like,

2710
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:17,200
ah, the fighting has concluded and let's all think about what's happening next.

2711
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:20,000
And like the the lull in action.

2712
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,960
I basically now and partying and all that.

2713
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:27,280
I was like one chapter past Nika, I think.

2714
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,280
So that's that's as far as I got.

2715
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:30,720
So I should catch up.

2716
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:34,400
So specifically what they're talking.

2717
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:36,000
Wait, we did talk about one piece.

2718
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:40,080
We talked about the the gender bathroom, whatever stuff.

2719
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:41,280
Oh, yeah, we did.

2720
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:41,680
We did.

2721
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:44,800
So, I mean, you know, that's, I mean, it's if that's what you're talking about.

2722
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:46,800
Um, voice mailer.

2723
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:50,800
Um, so we can talk a little bit about pirates.

2724
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:51,600
We talk a little bit.

2725
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:54,480
Uh, I, I don't know what else there is.

2726
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:58,160
Like, uh, they did it.

2727
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:02,320
They punched the guy and they won.

2728
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:06,640
Oh, no, spoilers, spoilers.

2729
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:06,960
God.

2730
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:15,520
Um, uh, in the newspapers, the newspaper came and all the big numbers arrived with their

2731
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:21,760
were there more zeros or at the very least I shunt tell did the or did the number in front

2732
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:26,160
of all the zeros increment up somewhat perhaps.

2733
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:29,600
Oh, who can say nobody knows.

2734
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:33,360
In fact, I actually forgot I should reread it long.

2735
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,560
Well, I'll I should catch up with that.

2736
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:42,000
Next one is, oh, it's a it's a vocaru link.

2737
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:43,280
So let me know.

2738
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:49,840
The the the one piece is on a one month break right now, I think, and it's going to come back

2739
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:52,560
with the lead into the next arc.

2740
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:54,400
So I'm excited for that.

2741
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:56,320
Very exciting.

2742
02:34:59,040 --> 02:34:59,600
Delightful.

2743
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:01,440
Delightful.

2744
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:05,360
It's now now's as good a time as any, I guess, to, uh, to pick up.

2745
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:06,320
Oh, wait.

2746
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:11,680
Yeah, they said they said specifically is like the final arc of one piece is

2747
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,440
Oh, I saw that announcement.

2748
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:15,040
And crazy.

2749
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:15,760
That's insane.

2750
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:20,400
Yeah, people are saying like what it'll be the but it'll be the longest arc.

2751
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:23,360
Yeah, because I think the one hour took like six years.

2752
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:25,200
Six.

2753
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:26,400
Yeah, it could have.

2754
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:27,600
I haven't been paying attention.

2755
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,920
It took it took a few years at least.

2756
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,120
It took at least two years.

2757
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:32,720
Yeah.

2758
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:34,640
And yeah, I think that is the one so far.

2759
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:38,880
And I and I fucking thought I thought the fucking fish, not Fishman Island.

2760
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:41,760
Um, what's the underwater one?

2761
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:43,760
That's Fishman Island.

2762
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:43,920
No.

2763
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:47,360
Is it Shao Shao body?

2764
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:48,000
Wait, no.

2765
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:51,200
Sorry, I was thinking of our long park.

2766
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:51,840
Yeah, you're right.

2767
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:52,320
Fishman.

2768
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:54,640
I thought Fishman Island was long.

2769
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:56,480
That was the longest at the time.

2770
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:57,600
Punk hazard.

2771
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:58,080
No, no, no.

2772
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:02,880
Dressrosa was the longest since since the Fishman Island.

2773
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:05,760
Was dressrosa longer than Wano?

2774
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:06,000
No.

2775
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:10,240
No, but Wano is now the longest, I think.

2776
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,880
Yeah, he just he just keeps making them longer and longer.

2777
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,080
Yeah.

2778
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:17,920
It's just the way it's act five, act six, act six, act six.

2779
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,040
Oh, God, it is.

2780
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,160
Oh, God, it is.

2781
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,520
It's just like that.

2782
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:23,040
Well, it's not just like that.

2783
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,760
Just exactly.

2784
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:29,200
Yeah, things I expect to happen in the final arc of one piece.

2785
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:34,400
Elbeth, the giant island will be integral.

2786
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:41,200
Usopp will tell the tale of meeting Dorian Baroggi and their pirate captains,

2787
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:43,520
and then they'll be like, oh, Usopp, God, Usopp.

2788
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:46,800
Giant King Usopp or something.

2789
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:47,840
It'd be very funny.

2790
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,280
I hope you're right about that.

2791
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:52,960
I mean, it's it's been building up for so long.

2792
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:58,480
The fact that Usopp was friends, made friends with Dorian Baroggi way back in like

2793
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:02,000
the alabaster arc or like the beginning of the grand line.

2794
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:09,120
And then he met the Omo and Kashi at like Impel Down, the two like Frankie guys.

2795
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:10,720
Yeah.

2796
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:11,680
Who are also giants.

2797
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:14,160
And it's like, ah, and then he made friends with Hajrudin,

2798
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:17,120
who is now part of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

2799
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,840
And it's like, oh, all these giants who like Usopp,

2800
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:23,120
and they've got to go to Elbeth because Big Mom wants to go there.

2801
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:26,480
And Big Mom's, I don't think she's dead.

2802
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:27,520
I think she's going to come back.

2803
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:29,120
This is going to be like a war.

2804
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:30,720
There's going to be a war about it.

2805
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,840
And there's probably going to be a war about it.

2806
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,080
Yeah.

2807
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:36,320
Catechery's going to come back.

2808
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:43,760
It's going to be some sort of big Elbeth thing leading into a race to Raftel.

2809
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:49,440
Because at this point, I think the Straw Hats have all the pieces of the map they need to find,

2810
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:58,720
you know, that all the road pornoglyphs are at least, I think, in their possession in some form,

2811
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:00,720
either written down or like physical.

2812
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:03,200
They know how to get to Raftel.

2813
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:05,760
And then everyone's going to be there.

2814
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:06,720
Everyone's going to go.

2815
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:08,960
And everyone's going to fight.

2816
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:10,800
And everyone's going to die.

2817
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:11,760
I don't know what's going to happen.

2818
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:16,160
There's so many moving parts.

2819
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:20,320
But I think the beginning will be Elbeth because we've got to see that.

2820
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:25,200
That's been like built up since giants have been like mentioned in One Piece.

2821
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:26,560
Yeah.

2822
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:27,920
I mean, for sure.

2823
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:38,560
It's one of those things like Laboon that's like, well, you know,

2824
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:48,560
that's just been an essential character moment that needs to pay off or what was even the point.

2825
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:50,720
There's all the ancient weapons.

2826
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:54,560
There's the history of the world that Niko Robin is piecing together.

2827
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:59,840
There's Blackbeard and his plans and what he's got going on.

2828
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,600
There's the Revolutionary Army.

2829
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:02,720
Like what's happened to them?

2830
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:09,680
What happened to the attack on Marine for not Marine for the marriage war?

2831
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:11,840
Like what happened to like Sabo and everyone?

2832
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:13,120
Are they OK?

2833
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:16,720
God, there's there's God, there's so much.

2834
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:22,400
Yeah, this last if this is the last arc, it is going to be like 10 fucking years long.

2835
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:24,640
It's going to happen.

2836
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:29,280
I mean, I feel like when they say arc, they don't mean it in the way that the fans have

2837
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:34,240
interpreted the arcs because maybe they mean it doesn't necessarily mean like God,

2838
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:38,640
do you think they mean like just a thing where they arrive at an island and something happens?

2839
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:42,560
Yeah, that's sometimes considered an arc and sometimes it isn't.

2840
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:45,280
So like, I don't know.

2841
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:49,520
Could they mean it in the sense that like first there was like they were in the east blue

2842
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:53,920
and then they went to the grand line and then they're in the new world.

2843
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,760
Yes, and then there was the new world.

2844
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,480
Yeah.

2845
02:39:56,480 --> 02:39:59,920
So this is the final arc is like a four hour four arc.

2846
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:01,200
Yeah, act.

2847
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:01,680
I don't know.

2848
02:40:02,480 --> 02:40:02,720
Yeah.

2849
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:07,520
The new world was is that everything past Fishman Island?

2850
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:09,760
I think that's including Fishman Island.

2851
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:11,600
It's like post time skip.

2852
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:12,880
Fishman Island.

2853
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:13,840
Punk hazard.

2854
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:18,160
I mean, I meant a big elephant.

2855
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:18,880
Yes.

2856
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:22,800
I meant geographically past Fishman Island.

2857
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:25,040
They cross the red line or whatever.

2858
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,680
You cross the red line or go under it rather and that's the part of the grand line that

2859
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:31,440
a lot of people don't get to.

2860
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:33,600
Yeah, right.

2861
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:37,840
So exciting.

2862
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:39,040
I'm getting hype.

2863
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:40,240
I'm getting hype thinking about it.

2864
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:40,960
Yeah.

2865
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:48,960
The next voicemail is what was it called something son of a glitch?

2866
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:50,320
All right.

2867
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:51,760
You have a vocabulary link?

2868
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:52,480
Yep.

2869
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,400
Okay, three, two, one, go.

2870
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:57,600
My favorite show on the Internet, Son of a Glitch.

2871
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:00,240
Hi, welcome to Son of a Glitch.

2872
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:07,520
I'm Benjamin and today's glitch is women.

2873
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:12,880
Like a glitch of humanity.

2874
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:21,120
Like Adam, Adam was in the garden and then he glitched and uh-oh his rib turned into a woman

2875
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:21,600
suddenly.

2876
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:27,440
Well, you know, it's just women just have a glitch in their genes.

2877
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:30,160
They got that weird X chromosome.

2878
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:33,280
They don't, they don't.

2879
02:41:33,280 --> 02:41:36,240
They got that weird X chromosome that makes them be shopping.

2880
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:39,280
They just, they just turn out all fucked up and shit.

2881
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:40,880
I don't know.

2882
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:44,160
You think they're supposed to look like that?

2883
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:44,560
No.

2884
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:54,080
Unlike, unlike, unlike women, unlike women, I have no X chromosome and therefore have

2885
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:57,760
face no such, such, such problems in my life.

2886
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:00,720
What can I say?

2887
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:03,520
But I agree with this guy.

2888
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,240
Is that oblivion?

2889
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:07,040
Hi oblivion.

2890
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:11,120
I think it sounds, sounds like you've graced us yet again.

2891
02:42:12,320 --> 02:42:14,720
Next time is called popcorn nihilist.

2892
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:17,680
Live to see things burn instant gratification.

2893
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:19,920
Three, two, one, go.

2894
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:23,600
Bro, what do you mean caco?

2895
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:25,040
What do you mean?

2896
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:29,120
Unicorn, your Bible unicorn?

2897
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:32,880
We all know the best cow is Girafariga.

2898
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:33,680
I already told you.

2899
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,080
Girafariga.

2900
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:39,040
Yeah, the best cow.

2901
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:41,760
We're talking about maybe Girafs or cows.

2902
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:43,040
Turns out they're not cows.

2903
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:45,280
Yeah, yeah, we looked, I was wrong.

2904
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:48,880
Even though Kaku ate the Ushi Ushi No Mi model giraffe,

2905
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:52,480
that's just one piece taxonomy must be different.

2906
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:56,320
Girafs are not actually cows, but nevertheless, Girafariga's fine.

2907
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:56,800
He's okay.

2908
02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:59,600
Bufalant is better.

2909
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:02,640
More cow.

2910
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:04,720
Also, also not technically a cow,

2911
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:07,680
but maybe as much a cow as a giraffe is, so I'll count it.

2912
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:09,600
Bufalant's good.

2913
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:13,200
Taurus is good.

2914
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,240
I like Bufalant because he said Bufalant in the Minecraft server.

2915
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:19,040
He sure did.

2916
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:25,120
You know, I do like miltank just because I like Pokémon that have like healing abilities.

2917
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:29,840
I just think that's a really cool thing for a Pokémon to have is like healing moves.

2918
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:34,640
I thought you were going to say I really like miltank because I just like Pokémon

2919
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:35,760
that have their tits out.

2920
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:40,160
No, no, no, not today.

2921
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:50,080
I like Chansi because it had soft boiled and, you know, Mumu or not Mumu.

2922
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:52,240
It's got milk drink.

2923
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:55,360
Can milk drink heal other Pokémon or can it only heal itself?

2924
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:58,880
Does it like suck its own tits, but it won't let anyone else suck on them?

2925
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:02,000
That would be funny if it was selfish.

2926
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:02,960
Selfish.

2927
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,800
It's like a double battle thing.

2928
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:06,160
It would heal the other as well.

2929
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:08,080
It'll be fun.

2930
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:09,040
Actually, I'm curious.

2931
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:12,560
Milk drink move.

2932
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:14,560
Can it be used out of battle?

2933
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:25,600
Okay, prior to generation seven, milk drink can also be used outside of battle to transfer

2934
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:28,080
some of the users HP to another party member.

2935
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:31,840
Each useful transfer 20% of the users HP up to the targets maximum HP.

2936
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:36,400
The move will not work if the user has 20%.

2937
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:39,920
Wait, but not anymore.

2938
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:41,040
Does it not do that anymore?

2939
02:44:43,280 --> 02:44:45,520
It says it says prior to generation seven.

2940
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:50,480
Weird.

2941
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:52,240
Milk drink restores up to 50%.

2942
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:52,480
Okay.

2943
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:55,040
Oh, that's so bizarre.

2944
02:44:55,520 --> 02:45:02,080
It heals the user in battle, but outside of battle it gives away the users HP to other Pokémon.

2945
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:02,480
Awesome.

2946
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:10,160
That would be so useful in like a Nuzlocke sort of setting in like a dungeon.

2947
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:12,080
That would be great.

2948
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,880
You literally just have your fucking cow.

2949
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:18,240
Given its milk, all the other Pokémon are drinking it.

2950
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:18,960
They're staying healed.

2951
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,560
They're staying topped up and healthy.

2952
02:45:20,560 --> 02:45:22,640
And then you go into battle and you have it heal itself.

2953
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,760
It probably doesn't have that many PP though.

2954
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:27,040
Yeah.

2955
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:27,920
But that's awesome.

2956
02:45:27,920 --> 02:45:31,200
As with most things in life, when you run out of PP, you're fucked.

2957
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:35,200
Sad, but true.

2958
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:38,000
All right.

2959
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,160
Next one is called rest in peace.

2960
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:41,600
Three, two, one, go.

2961
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:42,720
Dude.

2962
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:44,480
You see them snakes right there?

2963
02:45:44,480 --> 02:45:44,880
Yeah.

2964
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:46,640
You see them snakes right there?

2965
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:47,280
Yeah.

2966
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:50,800
I care more about them snakes than I do a human life.

2967
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,040
Just like that, man.

2968
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:58,240
Them snakes mean more to me than any human being ever born.

2969
02:45:58,880 --> 02:45:59,600
What the fuck?

2970
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:02,400
I relate.

2971
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:07,760
I don't, I don't, I don't really understand, but I mean, sure.

2972
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:09,680
Why not?

2973
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:15,840
Kill people, live snakes, feed people to the snakes, let them eat the people please.

2974
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:17,840
Thank you very much.

2975
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:18,160
Okay.

2976
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:19,840
Next one is called thank you Gibbon.

2977
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:21,840
Three, two, one, go.

2978
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:24,080
Hey Gibbon.

2979
02:46:24,640 --> 02:46:29,840
Just wanted to say thank you for helping Ben St. process some of the thoughts there.

2980
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:32,480
Genuinely, thank you.

2981
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:33,920
Jesus.

2982
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:36,880
I want him to be able to be a funny man again,

2983
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:39,920
but he needs to give himself a break.

2984
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:46,240
And I mean, we all can, we all can point fingers and laugh at Ben St.

2985
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:51,840
But I know we are rather all point fingers and laugh with Ben St.

2986
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:55,120
Thanks.

2987
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:56,560
You know, you know what?

2988
02:46:57,520 --> 02:46:59,040
This guy's making a lot of sense.

2989
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:02,160
This guy's talking a lot of sense right now.

2990
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:04,240
I'm not pointing and laughing at you.

2991
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:06,240
I'm pointing and laughing with you.

2992
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:06,560
Yeah.

2993
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:09,760
I mean, at someone or something else, perhaps.

2994
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:11,520
Behind you, you see.

2995
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:12,800
Or maybe just in general.

2996
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:14,560
I'm not pointing.

2997
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:16,800
I'm pointing and laughing.

2998
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:19,200
I'm pointing at you, but I'm laughing with you.

2999
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:20,960
Perhaps.

3000
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:26,080
Next one is called a hot summer day with the Ralfa males.

3001
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,080
Three, two, one, go.

3002
02:47:32,560 --> 02:47:33,360
Oh, God.

3003
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:34,240
This baby.

3004
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,680
He's pretty annoying as babies go.

3005
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:40,320
Oh, gosh, darn hot out here.

3006
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:41,920
How?

3007
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:47,680
How am I supposed to get my training to kill Ben St.

3008
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:50,160
if I can't hardly breathe?

3009
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:58,880
Well, son, that that probably means you have asthma or something that she that kind of sucks.

3010
02:47:58,880 --> 02:47:59,760
But you know what?

3011
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:04,960
I'll get you an iron lung and I'll get you like a sniper rifle.

3012
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:06,320
So you don't have to like run.

3013
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:07,440
I am.

3014
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:13,920
I'm going to show you this movie called American Sniper.

3015
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:18,960
It's about a guy who who shot a sniper and he was American.

3016
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:20,000
It's pretty good.

3017
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:22,400
Wow, Papa.

3018
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:23,040
Thanks.

3019
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:32,080
You need to like fucking like go inside.

3020
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:37,040
Who gets you an iron lung and a sniper rifle?

3021
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:40,080
I'll just pick that up for you, son.

3022
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,000
I was picking up at the hardware store.

3023
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:46,160
OK, yeah.

3024
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:47,920
I mean, that sounds pretty dangerous.

3025
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:48,320
All right.

3026
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:51,120
I should watch out for that, I guess.

3027
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:55,040
The next one is called forgive.

3028
02:48:55,040 --> 02:49:00,400
Please add me at Vinny Vidi Vici for hashtag one nine seven seven.

3029
02:49:02,320 --> 02:49:03,760
You said the whole thing.

3030
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:04,320
Yeah.

3031
02:49:04,320 --> 02:49:05,840
Next three two one go.

3032
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:18,880
Hey, you should add me on Discord so like we can conspire against Ben and like send him memes

3033
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:26,160
that will brighten his day because I'm not good at like communicating all the time.

3034
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:34,240
But I can send you a meme and, you know, get somebody a chocolate.

3035
02:49:34,240 --> 02:49:35,280
Give him give him thinking.

3036
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:42,000
This guy does this guy does send me memes sometime and I generally don't respond

3037
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,200
because I don't know what do you do when someone sends you a meme?

3038
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:49,120
You laugh out uproariously, Ben.

3039
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,440
Well, maybe you go XD.

3040
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:52,880
Yeah.

3041
02:49:53,440 --> 02:49:55,120
Well, say I say it in real life.

3042
02:49:56,560 --> 02:49:59,440
But I don't type it to XD heard around the world.

3043
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:05,920
We can only we can only hope we can only hope.

3044
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:08,560
Next one.

3045
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:11,440
Last one, perhaps is called AIDS.

3046
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:13,360
Three, two, one, go.

3047
02:50:13,360 --> 02:50:35,360
Oh, I heard about this.

3048
02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:47,680
All of his aides are stored in his gun toe.

3049
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:50,720
But I have not that luxury.

3050
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:55,200
It is going to fucking kill me.

3051
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:59,360
I do not have long for this world.

3052
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:01,520
Damn.

3053
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:03,360
Damn.

3054
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:03,840
Damn.

3055
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:04,400
Okay.

3056
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:08,400
What seems like only yesterday you were just a baby and now you're dying of AIDS.

3057
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:09,600
They grow up so fast.

3058
02:51:10,320 --> 02:51:12,720
Uh, I just heard, you know, I didn't look into it.

3059
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:20,160
I heard that, um, you know, a while ago it came out that Ethan Ralph like date raped some girl

3060
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:28,240
like while like while he was like away in Vegas, like leaving while May was like giving

3061
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:29,600
birth to their kid or whatever.

3062
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:34,240
And I guess that girl might have HIV.

3063
02:51:34,240 --> 02:51:38,400
And so maybe Ethan got HIV from from this.

3064
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:41,360
I don't know.

3065
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,320
I don't know.

3066
02:51:42,320 --> 02:51:44,320
It's just, it's just, it's just a maybe.

3067
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:46,320
It's just, it's just a maybe I heard.

3068
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:49,920
You know, I'm, uh, I have no idea.

3069
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:51,360
Just what I heard.

3070
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:52,080
Just what I heard.

3071
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:58,640
I had heard about the date rape thing in Vegas before that I had heard before the

3072
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:01,360
AIDS thing is like a new development.

3073
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:04,400
So I don't know.

3074
02:52:04,400 --> 02:52:06,080
Ethan Ralph might have AIDS.

3075
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:06,720
I don't know.

3076
02:52:08,240 --> 02:52:09,520
I'm just asking questions.

3077
02:52:11,840 --> 02:52:13,600
I don't want to ask questions.

3078
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:20,800
Did you hear this is not about that, but did you hear some gimmick account on Twitter

3079
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:26,960
when it had some kind of meltdown because they thought they think that COVID is airborne AIDS?

3080
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:32,160
They think that like everyone who's in fact, who's had COVID now has AIDS.

3081
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:35,920
Huh?

3082
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:39,920
How could you, like, why would it, why would it now happen?

3083
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:44,400
Well, it's, well, I mean, it's not, why is there no evidence of that at all?

3084
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:50,400
Well, I guess, I guess it showed like, I don't know, some person had like an immune,

3085
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:58,560
like some person that got COVID showed like a, like reduced immune response that was like

3086
02:52:58,560 --> 02:52:59,600
similar to AIDS.

3087
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:05,920
And so it's like, oh shit, this person got AIDS from COVID, COVID gives you AIDS.

3088
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:07,200
Everybody's got AIDS now.

3089
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:09,440
Well, damn.

3090
02:53:09,440 --> 02:53:15,360
Well, I mean, I think it seems a little more likely that maybe, maybe they already had an

3091
02:53:15,360 --> 02:53:19,600
immune problem and maybe that's had something to do with them getting COVID.

3092
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:20,080
I don't know.

3093
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:27,520
But anyway, this fucking gimmick account, it's called like falconary finance or something.

3094
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:28,160
It's, I don't know.

3095
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:33,360
It's like a joke account about like, no, it's like UAE falconary finance.

3096
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:39,520
It's about like Saudi Arabian finance bros who are also into like falconary.

3097
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:40,000
I don't know.

3098
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:40,720
I don't get it.

3099
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:42,480
It's some kind of gag.

3100
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:48,320
But, but the other day he had like a, he broke character to have this meltdown about

3101
02:53:48,320 --> 02:53:50,400
guys, COVID is airborne AIDS.

3102
02:53:50,400 --> 02:53:51,440
We've all got AIDS.

3103
02:53:51,440 --> 02:53:52,560
Everyone's going to die.

3104
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:58,320
I mean, at that point, what do you do about, why would you freak out if everyone's got it?

3105
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:01,840
I mean, I guess we all got AIDS now.

3106
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:06,800
I see what you mean, but I probably would, if I sincerely believe that I probably would

3107
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:08,000
also freak out.

3108
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:12,800
I guess you'd freak out and you'd go and get medical stuff.

3109
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:18,640
You go to the AIDS shop and you'd say, can I have some AIDS suppression, please?

3110
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:21,520
I guess, I guess they have, I guess they have those.

3111
02:54:22,640 --> 02:54:25,280
I guess they have some pretty good like AIDS countermeasures.

3112
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:33,200
You need to like forever live on a diet of specific pills so that you have an autoimmune

3113
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:33,920
system.

3114
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:39,440
Did you, did you see, oh that reminds me, did you watch Oki's videos?

3115
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:42,000
Not particularly.

3116
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,280
I think I've seen a few.

3117
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:48,000
There's a new one that he just put out about, I forget the name.

3118
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:50,320
What was it, hang on, what was it called?

3119
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:51,200
I watched the new one.

3120
02:54:56,240 --> 02:55:05,520
Oki, the King of Stolen Valor, about this guy called Jack Idema, and Oki goes, he went

3121
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:15,440
across the country to interview this guy's ex-wife about him, and a lot of it is kind

3122
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:21,280
of just about what a fucking abusive psychopath this guy was.

3123
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:28,800
One of the, one of the things that like went wrong for this woman was that like she got,

3124
02:55:28,800 --> 02:55:37,040
she got HIV from this guy, so you know, now she's got that, which is one problem among many

3125
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,840
that she's had to deal with since being with this dude.

3126
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:44,080
It's pretty good, it's pretty good documentary, I would say.

3127
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:49,120
It's nice, recommended, but yeah.

3128
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:51,920
AIDS? No, it's no joke.

3129
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:56,000
You don't, you don't want, you don't want it.

3130
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:00,640
It's, you gotta fucking take your, yeah, take your, take your suppression meds like every day,

3131
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:03,840
and I mean you can handle it that way, but like what a bummer.

3132
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:07,520
Hey kids, don't have AIDS.

3133
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:08,560
Hey kids, it's-

3134
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:15,280
Choose the right path, don't smoke, drug, don't drink alcohol, and don't get aid.

3135
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:18,240
McGruff the crime dog here saying, saying-

3136
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:23,840
Say no to AIDS, if an adult offers you AIDS, say no.

3137
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:25,040
Definitely say no.

3138
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:26,000
Tell an adult.

3139
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,160
And then try to like, like hold your coat out and try to make yourself seem bigger than them,

3140
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:31,920
like to intimidate them, right?

3141
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:32,960
Yeah, yes.

3142
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:36,080
And make a lot, move around a lot and make a lot of noise to scare them away.

3143
02:56:38,800 --> 02:56:39,200
Base.

3144
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:43,680
That probably would scare people away if you think you're like rabid, insane.

3145
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:50,480
If you're like gibber, you're holding your coat out, gibbering, making erratic movements.

3146
02:56:52,800 --> 02:56:54,160
Yeah, don't play dead.

3147
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:57,920
With it, when it's a human, when the, when the predator is a human, don't play dead,

3148
02:56:57,920 --> 02:57:00,560
because they'll just, they'll call the police and they'll just bring,

3149
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:03,440
they'll call it an ambulance and they'll, they'll bring more humans around.

3150
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:07,040
So it's not an, it's not an effective strategy.

3151
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:12,800
Acting like a lunatic is, is more effective to get left alone, in my experience.

3152
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:15,840
Anyway, that's the last voicemail.

3153
02:57:16,960 --> 02:57:18,720
Oh, thank God.

3154
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:19,440
Thank God.

3155
02:57:19,440 --> 02:57:24,480
We're, are we just under, we're like maybe just barely at the three hour mark,

3156
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:27,440
which is honestly, doesn't even, doesn't matter.

3157
02:57:28,240 --> 02:57:32,320
The effects, whether Eleazar will animate the tombstones, but like, who cares?

3158
02:57:34,320 --> 02:57:39,600
There was some, my brother had, but Eleazar, you better still,

3159
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:41,280
if we're under three hours, you've got to do it.

3160
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:42,480
That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

3161
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:52,320
My brother was like, experimenting with like, the VTuber software that I used for my streams.

3162
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:53,120
Yeah.

3163
02:57:53,120 --> 02:57:54,160
The PNG stuff.

3164
02:57:55,520 --> 02:58:01,920
He's figured out that you can do, you can have, if you have like a virtual audio cable

3165
02:58:02,480 --> 02:58:09,040
from some, like for, hooked into like a Discord call, you can get someone else's audio

3166
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:16,400
and then put that onto a separate PNG VTuber and have two different people's voices

3167
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:20,000
animating two different VTubers on the same, like recording or stream.

3168
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:23,120
I thought that was really cool.

3169
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:24,400
Yeah.

3170
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:30,480
I don't know whether, I feel like you could, you could, you could have like a, a system.

3171
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:35,760
So it would be your, it would be your software animating them through this.

3172
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:38,080
Animating them and myself separately.

3173
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:38,320
Yeah.

3174
02:58:38,400 --> 02:58:39,760
In a single video file.

3175
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:42,560
And you could do like a podcast like that.

3176
02:58:42,560 --> 02:58:46,160
We could have our little animator, animation guys.

3177
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:48,800
They would just react to us talking.

3178
02:58:48,800 --> 02:58:51,920
It wouldn't have to be like an extremely costly rendering thing.

3179
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:57,120
They would just move their mouth or shake or whatever when we have voice coming out of our mouth.

3180
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:57,440
Yeah.

3181
02:58:57,440 --> 02:59:02,560
We could automate Ellie Azar's job away, just like, just like Yang said we could do.

3182
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:08,400
Finally, we can, we can, we can lay it, we can lay off an employee and have a robot do it instead.

3183
02:59:09,360 --> 02:59:09,920
Would you want it?

3184
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:10,720
It's the future.

3185
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:14,400
Would you want to, would you want to try that sometime?

3186
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:15,040
That would be funny.

3187
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:22,320
I maybe, I think the virtual audio cable is very confusing and I would need to like

3188
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:26,960
ask for a lot of help to like get that working because I remember using it for something else

3189
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:32,000
and it fucked everything up and I didn't know how to undo it.

3190
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:34,880
So I had to get rid of it at some point.

3191
02:59:35,360 --> 02:59:35,760
I see.

3192
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:45,040
If you ever get that working, I would, I would, I would make, I would make some PNGs for myself.

3193
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:47,600
It could be fun.

3194
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:48,160
It could be funny.

3195
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:50,100
Yeah.

3196
02:59:51,360 --> 02:59:53,280
Neat, nifty even.

3197
02:59:57,280 --> 02:59:59,360
The, okay, I guess shows over.

3198
03:00:02,640 --> 03:00:03,280
Alrighty.

3199
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:15,200
Patreon.com, Patreon.com slash the procrastinators for our extensive, our extensive backlog of

3200
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:16,160
bonus episodes.

3201
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:25,040
If that's something you would be interested in filling your, filling your meaningless hours

3202
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:29,360
between cradle and grave with, I know I am.

3203
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:33,040
There's the, the Minecraft server as well.

3204
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:34,720
Access at $5 or more.

3205
03:00:35,280 --> 03:00:43,920
Yes, I did not, I did not have time this week to fix my connection and test that out again.

3206
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:45,600
I will work on it in the near future.

3207
03:00:47,280 --> 03:00:47,760
All right.

3208
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:49,360
All right.

3209
03:00:49,360 --> 03:00:56,000
And, but I mean, but I mean, you know, but I mean, you don't need us to be, you don't need me in there.

3210
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:58,800
You don't have to, you can build and stuff.

3211
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:01,920
You could, you could be, you could be building stuff.

3212
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:06,720
And then whenever I do fucking get around to fixing my connection and making that work,

3213
03:01:07,280 --> 03:01:09,680
then I'll get in there and I'll be like, oh, I see.

3214
03:01:09,680 --> 03:01:17,360
I've been, I've been, I've been, uh, while I was away, you, somebody, uh, Cascava Montiado'd me

3215
03:01:18,080 --> 03:01:21,680
into, uh, into my own, uh, slime cave.

3216
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:23,600
Oops.

3217
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:28,080
And then I just teleport out and I think I was really clever because I circumvented your,

3218
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:30,400
your trap, but it would be funny for a second.

3219
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:34,240
What else?

3220
03:01:34,240 --> 03:01:34,720
Anything?

3221
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:44,240
Um, uh, I need to get around to, to sending off a few more load of ghosts things.

3222
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:46,720
I just got another one returned.

3223
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:48,080
I haven't had a lot of returns.

3224
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:55,440
So I assume if, if I hear nothing that it's arrived, um, but I have gotten a return and I

3225
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:57,280
would have sent some stuff out.

3226
03:01:57,280 --> 03:02:00,640
Kaiju, Koon, their one never arrived.

3227
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:01,520
Oh, bummer.

3228
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:03,120
Um, so I'm just going to send them another one.

3229
03:02:04,320 --> 03:02:11,200
And, uh, duh, that's, that's going to be my thing for the next 100 years is slowly

3230
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:13,200
sending more of those out.

3231
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:14,000
Yeah.

3232
03:02:15,440 --> 03:02:23,120
Again, uh, if you are, if you are, I have a few return packages for, uh, Road to Radcon,

3233
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:27,600
the book and the plebe and the wee blue rays, uh, these are just the ones that I found in

3234
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:29,440
my PO box before it expired.

3235
03:02:29,440 --> 03:02:33,920
There might have been some more that I got returned after the expiration.

3236
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:38,800
So if you're listening and you have ordered something for me and you never got it, I might

3237
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:44,320
have it here in which case contact me anyway so I can double check that your address hasn't changed.

3238
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:48,880
Or if I don't have it, contact me anyway and I will just, you know, send you a replacement

3239
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:51,680
because I would consider it lost in the mail at this point.

3240
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:58,160
Uh, DM me on discord or something, uh, or twitter or whatever.

3241
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:59,680
That's it.

3242
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:02,160
Uh, okay.

3243
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:03,600
I think that's all.

3244
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:05,360
Yep.

3245
03:03:05,360 --> 03:03:05,760
All right.

3246
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:06,560
Thanks for listening.

3247
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:07,680
See you next week.

3248
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:08,560
See you next week.

3249
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:14,400
We will, uh, I don't know, we'll have something.

3250
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,600
I'm sure we'll have something.

3251
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:16,560
We'll have something to talk about probably.

3252
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:19,440
I'm going to, I'm going to, all right, here's, here's what's going to, I'm going to do.

3253
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:23,600
I'm going to endeavor to finally finish the commissions that I have not finished because

3254
03:03:23,600 --> 03:03:27,440
I've been so like about doing them.

3255
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:30,400
I'm going to do those and they have like five to do.

3256
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:35,520
I'll try and then that'll be a thing done.

3257
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:36,400
How many did you do?

3258
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:41,920
Um, uh, off the top of my head, I can't really remember.

3259
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:43,760
I think it was like five or six.

3260
03:03:44,960 --> 03:03:46,560
A number of them were not safe for work.

3261
03:03:47,280 --> 03:03:48,960
So you didn't see them on my main twitter.

3262
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:50,640
Indeed.

3263
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:51,200
Indeed.

3264
03:03:52,320 --> 03:03:53,200
And, uh, yeah.

3265
03:03:55,440 --> 03:03:58,480
I think it was a pretty good set of things.

3266
03:03:58,480 --> 03:04:02,640
It was just an unfortunate moment for me to get really cripplingly depressed and not be

3267
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:03,760
able to finish the rest of them.

3268
03:04:04,400 --> 03:04:08,240
But, uh, thank you for your interest and I will do it again later.

3269
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:12,000
Unlike all those other times, which were great times for that.

3270
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
This, this one was just a really unfortunate.

3271
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:19,040
I mean, I, I, I managed to do the first ones like almost immediately

3272
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:19,760
when they got them.

3273
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:21,760
It's like, okay, got the thing.

3274
03:04:21,760 --> 03:04:27,040
I mean, I guess it was like partly because I needed the money to pay for my reimbursement

3275
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:29,520
of the flight back home because I just wanted to get home.

3276
03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:35,120
And it was like very motivated to make sure those were done so that I could get more commissions.

3277
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:37,360
But then people stopped asking about them.

3278
03:04:37,360 --> 03:04:39,600
So I'm like, okay, cutting it off.

3279
03:04:40,240 --> 03:04:40,800
Yeah.

3280
03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:42,000
Just got to finish these ones.

3281
03:04:45,360 --> 03:04:48,240
All right, let's, let's end the podcast so we can go make some gummies.

3282
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:50,000
Hey, all right.
