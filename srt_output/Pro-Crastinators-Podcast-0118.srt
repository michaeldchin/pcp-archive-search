00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello everyone and welcome to this episode of PCP. I am Mage and I am introducing everyone

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,320
this time for some reason and I am joined by Digi.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
Real fag hours every Sunday.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,680
Let's welcome Nate!

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,360
Um, guess all majorities. Thank you.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Hey Tom, are you alive? Are you with us?

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,480
I am alive. I've been revived from the dead.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,560
Huzzah! And finally, for once, he was not late. Ben Saint!

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,520
I, you know, be being late is a meme that needs to die.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,680
That's also true though. That was the old me. He's dead now.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,240
Well, prove us wrong, Ben.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,800
I did. I have been doing so.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,200
Well, one time, yeah, exactly. It could be an outline.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Ben was the most on time for our meetup for the Princess Mononoke film.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,800
That's because of the buses. We already established this.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,320
Serious question, guys. When was the last time I was late for anything?

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,360
Tell me. Tell me. Fucking face me.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,360
For your period, you pregnant poor.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,320
Change me up in my face and not online and see what happens, fucker.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,040
What'd you say?

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,720
The problem is, Ben, is that your macro ratio of late to not late

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,400
is still skewed heavily in one direction.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,240
I know. I fucked up a lot. I fucked up a lot.

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,720
But I've...

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,720
So what was it, Ben? What would change that made this huge revelation in your life

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,880
that you'll never relate to anything again? What was it?

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,360
I didn't say I'd never relate to anything again.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,480
I just... I've been pretty good. And I think I deserve money.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,720
I tell you what, Ben, we'll start believing you if you start showing up comically early

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,680
all the time. Then that will cancel out the lame.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,800
That's lame.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Almost as lame as being late all the time.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,400
You've cost everyone else by being late. You need to spend that time

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,800
by sitting in an isolation cube and doing nothing.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,800
I need to pay back the debt.

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,960
Exactly. You've got a big time debt. It has to be paid back. That's what it is.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,360
I see.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Isn't that the plot of that movie?

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,360
I wasn't going to say that, too.

41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,960
Is that true?

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,080
Yeah, that's literally the Justin Timberlake movie in time.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,200
In time. That's the one.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,480
Where the entire...

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,320
We hit all of the dialogue as time puns.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
That sounds awesome.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
Well, maybe.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,120
Well, here we are on another episode of PGP, the Pokemon Go podcast.

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
Thanks for joining us, everybody.

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm almost level 25. I'm doing real good.

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Oh, I'm so close to 30.

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm so close to 30.

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm subscribed.

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,960
Oh, man. I caught my first Shuckle just today.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,760
I got one of those.

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,560
That's a good boy.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
I also got a Maulwile in a raid.

58
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,280
It is a piece of absolute trash and completely worthless,

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,600
but I'm glad to have it because I love Maulwile.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
Yeah, Maulwile rules.

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,720
Well, you're over there gathering Shuckles.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
I'll be over here gathering Shuckles.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,040
Yeah.

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,280
Oh, is that Mad Dosh?

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,880
Is that in any way like the pun of Shuckle's name?

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,640
Like, other than that, what does it mean?

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,280
If it's like...

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,400
They're always Shuck.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Shuck, you know, seafood, right?

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,920
Like when you Shuck clams or whatever.

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,400
Yeah, yeah. Oh, right.

72
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,160
Or like you Shuck corn.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, you Shuck clams, too.

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,040
What is Shucking?

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,160
Yeah.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
So you Shuck out the innards, I think, basically?

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,120
Oh, no, no.

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,640
It's just when you remove the shell.

79
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,120
It's just when you remove the shell from something.

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, okay.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,680
So I guess like if you put your mouth, like one of Shuckle's many holes,

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,920
and you just suck and you get the poop out of there.

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
That's like Shuck and Shuckle.

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,400
All right.

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
This is the worst episode ever.

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,040
I Shucked some eggs last night.

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,280
Okay.

88
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,720
So, all right.

90
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,560
So pretty much my entire identity...

91
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,280
This is what's changed.

92
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,720
This is why I'm never going to be late anymore.

93
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,800
My entire identity has been erased and has been replaced with Keto.

94
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,200
I am all and only a Keto guy now.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,040
That's all there is to me.

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,320
So if you liked anything else about me, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

97
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,880
but that's all that's over now.

98
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,760
That is very exciting.

99
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,920
I do want to know more about that.

100
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
It's pretty interesting.

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,480
But let me tell you, I'm a little embarrassed to tell this story

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
just because of the names involved.

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,840
I made a recipe for some bread substitute.

104
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,280
It is called Oopsy Bread, which is terrible.

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
I don't like to say it.

106
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,080
It is also called Cloud Bread,

107
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,120
which I find much more aesthetic.

108
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,360
Oopsy Bread sounds like something that would be made out of children's...

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Aborted fetuses?

110
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,440
That's where I'm going with that.

111
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,080
Well, okay.

112
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,200
I was thinking more like when kids like shit their pants

113
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
and you have those Oopsy underwear

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,600
that it's like when you're in transition from diapers up to regular underwear.

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,400
I'm trans.

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,840
I'm transitioning from diapers to big boy underwear.

117
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,480
That's me.

118
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Pull-ups or pull-ups?

119
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,240
Yeah, pull-ups.

120
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,880
Yeah, pull-ups.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Well, no.

122
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Okay, so Oopsy Bread, AKA Cloud Bread.

123
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm going to call it Cloud Bread from now on.

124
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,760
That's way cooler.

125
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,960
Yeah, Cloud Bread is made of, I mean, it's basically eggs and some cream cheese.

126
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,920
Like, it's basically eggs and cream cheese and you whip it up and you bake it.

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,880
I assumed it was some kind of like crowdsourced peer-to-peer bread network.

128
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah, we get this from the crowd.

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
It's peer-to-peer bread.

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,040
This is what I'll call it from now on.

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,160
The point is though that it sucked ass and it did not just like bread.

132
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,400
It literally just tasted like eggs and cream cheese.

133
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,760
So, I don't know...

134
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,880
Well, that's a pretty good taste.

135
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,080
Like, I didn't like it.

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,640
No.

137
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,400
Everyone, everyone hyped it up.

138
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,960
Like, all the keto, it's like a really popular keto thing.

139
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,360
And I was like, wow, there really must be something to this because everyone is into this, this shit.

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,280
And turns out it's kind of gross.

141
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,200
So, that was disappointing.

142
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,240
Nate, what about eggs and cream cheese in combination sounds good to you?

143
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,200
My dad always used to make eggs, like scrambled eggs with cream cheese.

144
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,320
Listen, listen, listen.

146
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,880
It's fine.

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,080
Like, it's not that the taste was not vile or anything, but like,

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,560
baked into like this like fluffy, bubbly, like, like, like a cookie.

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't know.

150
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,440
It was, it wasn't, I didn't like it one bit.

151
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,000
I didn't like it one bit.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,520
So, I was supposed to use it like bread?

153
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
I was like, yeah, I was looking.

154
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,000
I was like, oh, I'm going to make this bread.

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm going to like put butter on it.

156
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,640
I like put some bread and butter and you know, but, but it's just like,

157
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,360
the thought of putting butter on this like cream cheese is like gross.

158
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,560
No, thanks.

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,960
Isn't that kind of the whole conceit of keto though?

160
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,840
Sounds kind of gross because it's just like so much fat and protein

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
and like no carbs.

162
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
I mean, it sounds gross.

163
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,720
Let me tell you about gross.

164
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,080
I have been, I have been drinking, I have been drinking straight heavy cream.

165
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,200
For like a past week.

166
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,680
Christ.

167
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,240
No, that's good.

168
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,720
It's good.

169
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
I put, I know it's a keto thing.

170
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,840
I put stevia in it and I put cocoa powder in it and I shake it all up.

171
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,760
You know, your goal is not to just like consume as much fat as possible.

172
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,200
Yes, it fucking is, yes it fucking is.

173
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,360
I am not meming on you right now.

174
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,080
Well, Ben, so you still, you still have a calorie count for the day, right?

175
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,200
That you want to achieve.

176
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
That's like the goal.

177
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,520
I mean, I mean, technically, yeah.

178
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,560
Okay.

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,200
Okay.

180
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
Calorie counts are more of a suggestion.

181
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,480
I mean, the most important thing is to become fat, is to become fat adapted

182
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,520
and enter keto and enter ketosis, which by the way, I am in deep, deep ketosis.

183
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,200
I have been peeing on, I have been peeing on strips and they have been turning

184
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440
deep, deep purple.

185
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,560
Like you shouldn't need the strips because your piss should smell like a dinosaur

186
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,440
if you're doing it right.

187
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,440
Well, I like the strips because it's very satisfying that they turn purple.

188
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,480
Listen, I am a, I am a fat burning furnace.

189
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
I am so deep in ketones.

190
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,880
I am, I am so many ketones that my pee melts bread like acid.

191
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
It just, it just tears.

192
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Fantastic.

193
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Yeah.

194
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I am, I'm no longer human.

195
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Guys, I gotta tell you.

196
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,840
I have become keto.

197
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,560
That I also found the answer when it comes to food.

198
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't remember if I told the story on a previous PCP because now that they're all

199
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,840
formless, I have no idea what we talked about.

200
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,560
Yeah.

201
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,280
Yeah.

202
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,400
So when, when Ben and DeVu first moved in with me, we, Nate had heavily advised us to use

203
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
crock pots.

204
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,520
He was like, crock pots are the answer because you can just put a bunch of shit in it.

205
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,680
Like you just put a bunch of healthy shit, like chicken and vegetables and just leave it on.

206
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,160
And then you come and you eat it and it's just there.

207
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
It's around all day.

208
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,640
The problem with the crock pot though is that, A, it takes like eight hours between you making

209
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,120
it and it actually being ready and you probably won't make it until you're hungry because that

210
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,960
inspires you to think about it.

211
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,400
So what would happen is we would make a crock pot.

212
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,880
We'd eat that first, that first glorious go, but then you can't just like let it sit out.

213
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,120
Like you can't turn it off because it'll get gross.

214
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,520
But if you leave it on, it will also get gross because it'll overcook and turn into like this,

215
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,920
this weird mush and no one ever wanted to clean the thing after it was done.

216
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,720
So it would just always be a disgusting mess on the counter.

217
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,360
And eventually we gave up on crock pot because we then discovered deep frying.

218
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,280
And then that was the answer.

219
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,120
So all we did was deep fry chicken all the time, chicken and pork.

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,800
We just constantly like, it was all panko, all just, you know, egg, egg or flour, egg,

221
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,920
panko, deep fry.

222
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,600
And that was like every day.

223
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,520
But the problem with deep frying is you can't really make that much stuff in it.

224
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,320
And it all tastes exactly the same because it's just deep fried.

225
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,440
So now I found the real answer and that is steaming.

226
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,760
And I found this answer because of the fact that there's an amazing Asian grocery store near me

227
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,360
that has like basically all Asian food is either noodles or some form of steamed buns.

228
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,080
Like, yeah.

229
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,360
And so I just started getting like all these different varieties of frozen steamed buns.

230
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,960
And all you got to do is just boil water, put them in a steamer and then put a lid on it for like

231
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,160
seven or eight minutes.

232
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,120
And you've got these unbelievably delicious steamed buns of different denominations,

233
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,080
whether it be like wontons or fucking,

234
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,320
You guys are making me hungry.

235
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,680
Like pot stickers, just anything, basically anything could be steamed.

236
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,400
But you know, it's just like a piece of flour filled with some kind of ingredient.

237
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,720
So you just get a whole variety of different fillings.

238
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,120
And now you've got breakfast every day.

239
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,160
And it has been amazing and healthy.

240
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,520
And yeah, it's made my life better.

241
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,040
I have not solved the food question in my life.

242
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,280
Just, it's absolutely a cluster fight.

243
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,840
I've temporarily solved my food question.

244
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,040
Yeah.

245
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,440
Eggs.

246
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,440
I don't like eggs.

247
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
So I can't, I love eggs.

248
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,400
I fry eggs, but I also put like, what's the word?

249
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,800
Okay, it's not garlic.

250
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,360
It's onion.

251
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,840
There we go.

252
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,800
Onion and eggs.

253
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,480
Egg, onion, omelette.

254
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,800
Omelettes are great.

255
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,560
I make omelettes all the time.

256
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,840
And they're delicious.

257
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,720
Onions, fried onions turn sweet.

258
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,360
And I love it.

259
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,920
They do.

260
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,560
They're great.

261
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,720
They're great.

262
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
Tom's been living with me for a week and a half.

263
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
And I have not seen him made one omelette.

264
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,400
And he's claiming that he makes them all the time.

265
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm calling foul.

266
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,200
I did, but I have this weird aversion to using your shit.

267
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,160
I want to be as like non-existent in your house as possible.

268
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Well, you're free to use the, I mean, if you use the pan and then you clean the pan,

269
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,720
I will have no idea that you used the pan.

270
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Yeah.

271
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,040
Well, what I've been eating right now is because, again, I was planning on not being in a house.

272
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,120
So I have like, I have a big thing.

273
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,160
Ass loads of fuel.

274
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,120
Yeah.

275
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,560
Protein bars and fuel.

276
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
And it's working out pretty good.

277
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,680
I don't even mind it.

278
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,520
It's a good, it's a good solution.

279
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,960
Wait, did you say fuel?

280
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,760
Fuel.

281
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
What is that?

282
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
It's like soilent, but not soy based.

283
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh, oh yeah, you told me that.

284
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,120
It's like a meal supplement.

285
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,400
You just like, it's like, you put some powder, you mix it with water,

286
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
and it's got all the calories you need.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,240
And it's nice and nutritionally balanced.

288
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,360
I sincerely want to be post food and consume things like fuel and all that.

289
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,520
The fuel, honestly watching Tom drink it, I'm like, you know what?

290
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,400
If I was a faggot, I would love this.

291
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,440
It's so efficient.

292
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,560
It's so efficient.

293
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,400
And that's the number one thing I care about.

294
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,480
Maybe I'll get into it because I'm wasting time.

295
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm starting to be broke.

296
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,960
And so, yeah.

297
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,160
Oh, okay.

298
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Let me tell you, you're gay enough for fuel.

299
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
You just don't realize it yet.

300
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Oh, well, I just like to taste things.

301
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
Yeah, that's my curse as well.

302
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,520
It's the like the tasting things is, well, that's secondary.

303
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,360
Number one is how lazy I am.

304
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,560
Like I've got eggs in my room right now, but instead yesterday,

305
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,480
I like, I ordered some eggs just like from a place and like they were relatively healthy.

306
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,040
You need to be post food.

307
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,760
This is literally takes like maybe 15 seconds.

308
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,800
That's the way fuel is literally just a powder.

309
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm ordering it today, Tom.

310
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
I make a solemn fucking vow to you.

311
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm buying it today.

312
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
I've been talking for a while.

313
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,560
And I think that no one has been able to hear me.

314
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,440
And I'm pretty sure.

315
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,880
No, no, it's fine.

316
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,280
It's fine.

317
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
I saved my old audio.

318
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,880
Yeah, I moved my microphone and the cord fell out.

319
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,520
So my old, my first part of my audio is saved.

320
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,640
I have started a new recording.

321
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,360
We'll sync at the end.

322
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,560
I just wanted to let everyone know that I had really great contributions

323
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
of this conversation that you will never get to hear.

324
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,600
And I feel sorry for you, viewer.

325
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,440
No, I haven't, I haven't heard you since I talked about deep friend.

326
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,160
So, well, you'll never know.

327
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
I'll take the secrets of my brain.

328
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,640
Well, is deep frying still kosher with the keto lifestyle then?

329
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
I guess so.

330
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,600
But like the breading, I mean, why would you deep,

331
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,360
I mean, you deep fry for breading, right?

332
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,080
Like there's no point deep frying like just meat or whatever.

333
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,720
So not really.

334
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,240
Although I do make eggs all the time.

335
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,640
I fry them in butter and it's fucking sick.

336
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,480
When my friend Don San did keto,

337
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,560
it was pretty much exclusively either just him like grilling chicken

338
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,480
and just eating that with like, with lettuce or going to like fast food places

339
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,080
and just getting burgers with lettuce wraps.

340
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Oh man.

341
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,920
That was basically his entire time.

342
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,920
When I was in town, when I was in Boston hocking my comics to store owners,

343
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,720
I went to Tasty Burger, which was not the same one that we ate at

344
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,000
when we went and saw Princess Mononoke, but you know, same chain.

345
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,720
I got a Gorgonzola burger on a lettuce wrap.

346
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,880
And boy, it was almost worth it.

347
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
It was almost worth it.

348
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,600
It almost cost me.

349
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm really shocked, Nate, that you hang out in Fit Boy communities

350
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
and haven't heard about this.

351
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,640
But if you go to basically any like, any place that sells burgers

352
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,840
and you ask them to replace the bun with lettuce, they will do that.

353
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,880
Some places even just call it, some place, like if you go to Hardee's

354
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,200
and you just say like, give me a no carb version of the burger,

355
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,520
they'll just like wrap it in lettuce and that's what they give you.

356
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,280
Damn, I should do that every fucking time.

357
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,160
I've been throwing away my goddamn games for nothing.

358
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
I found out about it at In-N-Out.

359
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,160
In-N-Out was the first place I went.

360
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,800
So do they replace the wrap with the lettuce or the burger with the lettuce?

361
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,760
They replace the bun.

362
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,240
The bun.

363
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,120
It's no bun.

364
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Imagine if they replaced the meat with lettuce.

365
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,440
Oh.

366
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,480
Disgusting.

367
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,400
That'd be ideal.

368
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,200
It'd be ideal.

369
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
And now I want that wrap.

370
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,200
It sounds pretty good.

371
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,840
I like wraps.

372
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,640
Yeah, I'm gonna try one of these.

373
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,880
And whenever I go to McDonald's, I just get a wrap.

374
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,280
Because they're gonna need like the big leafy shit to actually contain burger.

375
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,440
So a thing that I did not know about Keto is

376
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,480
you are supposed to eat protein, you know, like based on your weight or your lean mass,

377
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,120
you're supposed to eat enough protein to maintain your muscle mass.

378
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,120
However, you should not go over that amount because eating protein in excess of that will

379
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,760
become glucose and, you know, basically eating too much protein is basically like eating carbs,

380
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,280
more or less.

381
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,480
So is Keto any kind?

382
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,880
It doesn't sound like much of a muscle gain diet.

383
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,680
I mean, I'm sure you could gain muscle on it.

384
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,920
Yeah, okay.

385
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,240
All right.

386
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,800
Yeah.

387
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,240
I mean, it's mostly meant to make you lose weight like very rapidly.

388
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,160
Like if you're doing it properly, you should burn weight super fucking fast.

389
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,480
The purpose of ketosis is that it is burning fat instead of other things.

390
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,200
So, yeah.

391
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,080
I mean, you probably could gain muscle on it, but I don't think it's like it's not

392
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,360
designed with that in mind.

393
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,600
And that's...

394
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,320
I was doing for a while to lose weight intermittent fasting.

395
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,040
Intermittent fasting is a...

396
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,520
They say like combining that with keto is pretty effective.

397
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,000
And I realized that I just kind of intermittent fasted like without even meaning to for like

398
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,480
much of my life because I just...

399
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah.

400
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,440
Well, that's because you...

401
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,160
What's intermittent fasting?

402
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,000
It's when you just eat like one meal a day, basically, or stuff.

403
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,040
Oh, yeah.

404
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
My mom recently mentioned that.

405
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,880
Eat for a day or two.

406
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,520
Yeah.

407
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,160
Well, that's specifically called OMAT or one meal a day.

408
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,520
That's like the hardcore version.

409
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,880
Eating one meal a day is something that I just do naturally some of the time because

410
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,720
I just don't feel hungry when I wake up most almost any morning.

411
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,560
And then like often I just won't think to eat until like late.

412
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,480
I'm a terrible stress eater.

413
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,080
Like when I get stressed, all I can think about is having something in my...

414
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah, that happens to me as well.

415
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,440
Guys, if I'm in a good mood, I can do it.

416
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,160
You know what this episode is making me realize is that we are aging fast.

417
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, dog.

418
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,520
That's true.

419
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,120
It took you just not to realize.

420
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,520
Well, I'm just thinking about how, you know, the other half of the PCPs, I don't...

421
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,880
Mage, how old are you again?

422
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,000
26.

423
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
Okay, so you're my age.

424
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,520
So you got that like creepy question on your cat.

425
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,320
You're asked, what's it called?

426
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Yeah, curious cat.

427
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,840
Like they could have just asked you your age, but they didn't ask you your age.

428
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,040
They asked you, are you a minor or 18 plus?

429
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,720
And I was like, what a creepy way to ask how old someone is.

430
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,240
Well, I want to know the follow-up question before I answer this one, sir.

431
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,520
Yes.

432
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,200
But the rest of the PCP is younger than us.

433
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,920
And so when you've got someone like Munchie on here,

434
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,440
he might be talking about rambunctious fun things.

435
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,560
But when it's all the old fucks, we're just like, I'm dying.

436
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,200
You know what, I'm not eating carbs anymore.

437
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,440
We did talk about Pokemon Go to this day.

438
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,960
You know what, I don't think, but you know who plays Pokemon Go?

439
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,640
My mom plays Pokemon Go.

440
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
Well, so does Munchie.

441
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,960
You know, I disagree because Munchie talks about how, you know,

442
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,160
he lives, his body is always aching and he's always in pain,

443
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,880
and about how he and his girlfriend have stopped drinking sugary sodas.

444
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,600
So they're just as old and worthless as us.

445
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,360
But Munchie got a girlfriend.

446
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Oh, this is nice.

447
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960
We're all decaying machinery.

448
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,320
Munchie has definitely got this old snake condition.

449
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,360
He's just like aging that.

450
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,120
He's probably like physically older than all of us.

451
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,440
So we just don't know.

452
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,120
I mean, he was bigger than me when he was like a quarter of my age.

453
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,400
So, you know, wait, the math doesn't quite check out there.

454
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,120
But you know what I mean.

455
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,560
Munchie being a clone of Big Boss makes a lot of things make a lot more sense to me.

456
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,440
True clone.

457
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,160
He was the one.

458
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,320
He's a clone of a fictional character.

459
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,280
Ridiculous.

460
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,960
Something went wrong in the process.

461
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,080
Hey, I've got a topic to bring up just overall.

462
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I thought about what to call it.

463
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,080
And I have a title for this topic.

464
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,280
And it is simply the Cal Arts Question.

465
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,400
What's to be done about this Cal Arts situation?

466
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,880
And how are we going to stop the influx into our society?

467
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,480
Why don't you lay out exactly what you think the Cal Arts

468
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,280
problem is?

469
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,440
Sure.

470
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,280
Well, it's more of a question because I don't really know if I believe it is

471
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
as pervasive a problem as some people think it is.

472
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,800
Is it is it an accurate statement to say that like the the animation industry of

473
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,080
I guess the West, but like America, Canada, etc.

474
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,520
is like coming to be dominated just by specifically the Cal Arts art style.

475
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,680
And is this like squeezing out other options or possibly entirely just through its own

476
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,400
like merit or maybe it's like really easy to draw.

477
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
So people really like it.

478
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,320
Obviously, that's the case with like Steven Universe because they fuck up the perspective

479
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,280
all the time and sizes.

480
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,040
I don't have a clear answer for that, but I will speak on behalf of anime real quick.

481
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,760
And just that for the most part, like the vast majority of anime studios are all crammed in

482
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,000
the same part of Tokyo.

483
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,160
And it's just like the area that's like the cheapest to to live in and to have you know

484
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,800
shit set up.

485
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,280
Sure.

486
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,120
But as a result, the anime industry is ludicrously incestuous.

487
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,520
And this is why so much of it is just the same shit over and over again is it's the same

488
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,680
people making it the same people who are teaching the new people how to make it.

489
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,120
And so like I would say that if Cal Arts is just a place where not only are the most popular

490
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,360
shows coming from there, but the people who are learning how to make cartoons

491
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,320
are being taught by those people, you know.

492
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,080
So like that's basically the problem.

493
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah.

494
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,360
And it creates this.

495
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,080
But like it's funny because people will blame like Cal Arts or something.

496
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,200
But it's like if you want to solve this problem, the only way to do it is to build another school

497
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
and just teach them something different.

498
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,960
The thing is, though, people have the wrong assumption that like Steven Universe and Gumball

499
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,640
are Cal Arts, but that's not true.

500
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,800
Rebecca Sugar never studied in the Cal Arts.

501
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,560
And if you look at the pilot, her actual art style shows there and it's very different

502
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,920
from what it has become.

503
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,960
And Gumball was made, I think, in the UK.

504
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
So it's not even in America.

505
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,360
Gumball doesn't even look like the other shows that I've seen.

506
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,640
First of all, I don't actually know what Cal Arts is.

507
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,320
I just know that there's a bunch of shows that kind of look like Steven Universe coming out.

508
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,360
And to me, it's obvious that it's just because Steven Universe is popular.

509
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,280
No, that's like true because there are things that were out before Steven Universe that...

510
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Adventure Time and what not.

511
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,480
What's that one about the woods?

512
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,200
But Adventure Time doesn't look like the first of evil.

513
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,960
What's the one about the kids of the fucking woods?

514
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,560
Gravity Falls.

515
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,440
Gravity Falls.

516
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,560
Was that before Steven?

517
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Yeah.

518
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,040
Okay.

519
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,360
Yes.

520
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,760
Gravity Falls was Star vs. Was Not.

521
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,160
And then Sans, although not real Sans, just the way that fans draw Sans.

522
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,640
And of course, the new ThunderCats thing as well, you know, very much that.

523
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,600
But to me, it's painfully obvious that it's not about whether or not it's Cal Arts.

524
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,720
It's just shows that are copying the thing that's popular, which all shows have always done.

525
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,880
They're copying the style that's popular.

526
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,200
I mean, it's also just efficient.

527
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm sure it's a very efficient way to produce a show.

528
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,320
Right, yeah.

529
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,880
So it's not all that.

530
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,480
It isn't all the anime looks the same.

531
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
Well, let's just take it...

532
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,080
I mean, I don't know that that's true, mage.

533
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,240
Well, I'll just believe you that Steven Universe had nothing to do with Cal Arts.

534
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,800
But nonetheless, it is this art style that is called like the Cal Arts style.

535
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,000
And maybe that's completely wrong.

536
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,360
I mean, for a while, there was the Tumblr style, which was like people with fucking

537
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,440
animal crossing, animal crossing goses.

538
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,160
But that was not like, that was not like a mainstream like, that was not like on TV.

539
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,560
I mean, when Steven Universe came out, that was literally why all of us didn't want to

540
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,280
watch it was because we kept saying, oh, it's just Tumblr art.

541
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,320
Like it looks like Tumblr made a show.

542
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,640
And so like to to ascribe this aesthetic to Cal Arts, when it just looks like

543
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,400
what Tumblr was already doing.

544
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,840
And I mean, this is way more pervasive in the world of comics.

545
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,640
Like even before Steven Universe, if you go to a comic store and you just flip through like any

546
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,600
new series, they all fucking look like Tumblr art.

547
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,840
And it's just because, you know, people get in.

548
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,360
Because they're all people from Tumblr drawing, man.

549
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,080
Probably, yeah.

550
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,080
And they all they're all just influenced by each other because it's a very insular culture.

551
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,880
So like, you know, those people just come up copying the designs of other people.

552
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,200
And then they blow up really fast because even though there's nothing unique about their art

553
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,600
style, because it is, you know, piggybacking on something that's already big, they can

554
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,640
blow up really fast.

555
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,200
So we got like all these probably 18 to 20 somethings, like just copying the

556
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,680
style of Steven Universe and writing that wave.

557
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,280
And then as soon as that's not what's in anymore, the ones who have adapted and got their own style

558
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,240
and like are doing something meaningful might have a continued career.

559
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,960
The ones who are just going to look old hat in a couple years are going to fall off the wave,

560
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,520
you know?

561
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,400
What I think is with this is that I feel very similar about these shows that I do with like

562
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,000
3D animation and theaters and stuff.

563
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,680
They all look like Pixar.

564
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,920
And I just I'm just on both fronts.

565
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,600
I'm tired of the sameness.

566
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,360
I just like, we have this, these mediums can do anything.

567
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,200
The aesthetic can be anything.

568
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,240
And we're just, we've like pigeonholed both of these mediums now.

569
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,080
It's a very samey looking shit.

570
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,800
And it's very frustrating.

571
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
And I want, I want to do more stuff, especially with Pixar.

572
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,800
Because Pixar has been going on for what?

573
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,560
Like going on 30 years now that it's just been the same shit.

574
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
Like please do something new.

575
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
And I guess it's just the power of the zeitgeist.

576
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,640
It just has people all wrapped up and they're not, they're just seeing what's working.

577
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,880
That was what made the Lego movie so fucking exciting was that it looked nothing like that.

578
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,800
And it was like, whoa, you can do that?

579
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,360
But how much of this is just the natural?

580
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,680
I mean, like, there's always trends, right?

581
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,160
Like for a while, like, like Disney animation and who's that Don Bluth,

582
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,240
like they, they were the thing for a while.

583
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,720
And now it's, and now it's this, you know, thing trends.

584
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,080
You guys know that the person who made Iron Giant is studied CalArts.

585
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,840
Was that true?

586
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,120
Wait, was that not Don Bluth?

587
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,440
How do you know?

588
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,080
Because I researched it because it was a hot topic.

589
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,960
I said, how do you know?

590
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,640
I meant to say, what do you know?

591
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
As in like, oh, well, what do you know?

592
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,760
So ignore that.

593
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,520
That's pretty cool.

594
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,680
I guess, I mean, that was made in what like the early 2000s or like the 90s or something.

595
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,280
I mean, CalArts has been around forever.

596
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,000
So like, they're like the premier animation school.

597
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:49,800
I mean, I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people who like look at art in general

598
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,920
and like see the same.

599
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,880
And it's like, Vin, Vin Diesel, Vin Diesel voiced the titular Iron Giant.

600
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,760
That is that makes sense.

601
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,800
Yeah, that's true.

602
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
He's also the voice of Groot.

603
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,080
Is that how we got the voice for Groot?

604
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,000
They're just like, you can be this like silent only says a few words character

605
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,640
and like give him a fuck ton of money for like saying three words.

606
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,800
You know what?

607
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,280
I know I've told this story before, but just on now that it's Vin Diesel,

608
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,520
it brings a whole new perspective to me and my buddy, John, watch the Iron Giant in college.

609
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,400
I know the story.

610
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,760
And we both just watch it.

611
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,280
It was a real emotional thing.

612
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,000
And it just ended as I look over at him after the Iron Giant sacrificed himself.

613
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,680
And my friend John just looks within intense gaze and pounds on the desk and says,

614
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,760
I feel so sorry for this giant metal man.

615
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,600
And now I'm just picturing Vin Diesel just bursting into flames.

616
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Mate, I think about, I feel so sorry for this giant metal man every day.

617
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,160
I think about that story every fucking day.

618
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,160
What an iconic line, John.

619
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,960
You really did it.

620
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,920
I think that people underestimate how much influence,

621
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:02,440
like the environment where people learn how to do something like effects what their product is.

622
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,840
The reason Hollywood movies are all the same is because they're all fucking made in Hollywood.

623
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,960
It's the same influences, the same people asking for the same thing.

624
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,720
I understand why it happens.

625
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
I just don't like it.

626
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,480
I want to.

627
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
Yeah, no, it's unfortunate.

628
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,320
But the thing is that people complaining about it will never change it.

629
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,200
The only way you can change it is by building something different.

630
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,040
Unfortunately, when you do build something different,

631
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,640
it's going to be really hard to make that new thing the zeitgeist.

632
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,080
You can make something new and it's either going to be treated as,

633
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,160
oh, this is too niche to promote to anybody.

634
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
So we're just going to bury it.

635
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:43,320
Or you can be home stuck and just have some insane luck and make something that's totally

636
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,680
unique and distinctive.

637
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,880
And then it spawns its own.

638
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,400
And then there's literally 500 fucking home stuck ripoff web comics,

639
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,800
because it was an influence for this other generation of kids.

640
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,360
There are like tens of thousands.

641
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,040
Again, that wave is over and the only people who survived it are people like Munchie

642
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,520
and who've evolved their art continually to not just look like home stuck.

643
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,040
Granted, Rowdy fucker's cop killer's art is just home stuck.

644
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,160
Everyone says that.

645
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,240
And it is a complete overstatement.

646
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:16,280
The Rowdy fucker's art style is as multifaceted as the special snowflakes

647
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,520
in the community that contribute to it.

648
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:26,200
They're each one is a beautiful star shining in the Rowdy fuckers in the acid green sky.

649
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,640
What the fuck am I talking about?

650
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,800
Fuck you, T.C.

651
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,760
I don't know, but that sounds good.

652
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Look, all I know is I clicked one time on the Boru and every single image was like

653
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,320
some Victorian building like with a Photoshop filter.

654
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,440
Okay, that was a bit pervasive.

655
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,040
You know, we took inspiration.

656
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,760
You go with what works.

657
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,720
Why reinvent the wheel?

658
00:28:51,720 --> 00:29:01,080
I guess what I'm saying is that I'm for the Cal Arts style and I want it to stick around forever

659
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,640
because it works and why should we come up with anything?

660
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,640
I think people are making a mountain out of a molehill.

661
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,320
Yeah, I mean, we're just in it right now and I do think this is a natural cycle that'll

662
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,240
probably phase and, you know, out of nowhere, Steam just opened on my computer.

663
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,480
And I think I had accidentally clicked on it at the start of the episode and 30 minutes later,

664
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,080
it decided to just come alive.

665
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,120
Maybe it was doing updates.

666
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,000
Steam's a tricky beast.

667
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,120
You know, I saw an article like yesterday or something that was like,

668
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,880
it was called something of approximately what the fuck has Steam made in the last 10 years

669
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,080
or has Valve made in the last 10 years or something.

670
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
And it was like nothing.

671
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,400
And I mean, these people were like mad that Steam like make so much money or

672
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Valve make so much money despite, you know, like not producing games.

673
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,040
I mean, is it not obvious that when they made Steam,

674
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,680
they realized that this was just a way more important venture than making video games?

675
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,080
Like, can these things make Steam better?

676
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah, because the context of this was that Steam is rolling out like an updated chat client,

677
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,600
but it is worlds worse than like Discord or like TeamSpeak or any of the or even Skype,

678
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
all the established ones.

679
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,720
It's like, it's super bare bones.

680
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,840
And like, I think this person was just like, Steam, this is embarrassing.

681
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,760
Like Valve, what are you doing?

682
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,640
You're way behind the curve.

683
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,880
This is this is this speaks to something that really fucking frustrates me just in like,

684
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,240
technology and services and stuff in general.

685
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,760
It's like, I really hate how all these companies are like, this is a really popular thing.

686
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,600
We're going to make our own version of it.

687
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Like, I really want to see less copying and more integration.

688
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,520
Like, wouldn't it be great if Steam just integrated Discord instead of having to build

689
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,160
their own version?

690
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,640
Would make perfect sense.

691
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,000
There is some sharing audience integration there.

692
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,200
Like, well, that's all on Discord side, I think.

693
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,920
Like, it's just set up to like recognize games and stuff.

694
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,640
That might be true.

695
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,880
I mean, I'm not just this isn't just Valve like tons of companies do this.

696
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,800
Like when something's popular, we need to build our own version.

697
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,240
It has origins then.

698
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,720
Right.

699
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,160
With origin and then fucking you play from Ubisoft and it's just like, come on guys, come on.

700
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,040
It's just short-sightedness on like I like with the whole fucking origin thing.

701
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,080
It's like, they just thought, oh, we don't want to have to give up part of the the market share

702
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,720
to this thing.

703
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,640
And surely we can do just as good.

704
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,640
But it's like, if you are not going to make it legitimately a better product, no one is going to

705
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,440
want it.

706
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,040
You know, like you, yeah, that's true.

707
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,760
Like if if you have to pay steam or whatever and you're not making as much money,

708
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,560
like it'll be worth it because there will be more consumers.

709
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,080
That's why it's so weird when they when they make decisions like that to me.

710
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,320
Granted, maybe there's some way that even if they have less consumers,

711
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,440
they're making more money.

712
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,680
If that's true, then, you know, it's possible.

713
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,800
Maybe that's what the theory is.

714
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,760
A lot of those games are that are available in origin are also available on steam.

715
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,960
So what's the point?

716
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,920
They want to get their cut.

717
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,760
I mean, EA puts all their new releases on origin.

718
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,800
Like when I got Mass Effect 3, when it first came out, it was only on origin.

719
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,080
It was really annoying.

720
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,240
Inquisition is only on origin as well.

721
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,760
That's the reason I have it.

722
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,960
All I learned since 4.

723
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,440
Like, I don't mind people making new platforms and stuff like that or like making their own

724
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
version if they bring something new to the table.

725
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,800
Like GOG, good old games, they have a service.

726
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,240
But it's totally different than steam.

727
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,880
It's for like spotlighting older games that you can't get anymore,

728
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,520
like porting over DOS games and stuff to run on Windows.

729
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
And they don't have any copy protection.

730
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,520
So like, if you get something on GOG, you can use it wherever you want.

731
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,160
And like, their client is completely optional.

732
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,600
You can just go to their website and download the EXE and run that.

733
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,160
Or you can use their client to have it all in one place.

734
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,760
So like, it's like steam, but it serves a totally different purpose.

735
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,400
It just takes a steam model and adapts it to a new product.

736
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,200
That's good.

737
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,320
To be fair, this in no way redeems EA in any sort of matter.

738
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,080
Oh no, EA can get fucked.

739
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,560
No, no, I just want to say, I just want to say they do offer free games from time to time.

740
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,400
And that's how I got like Sims 2.

741
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,840
And they had like Dragon Age, the very first one, Origins for free for a while as well.

742
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,280
So they sometimes have some good games and I have like a library full of games.

743
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm never going to play on Origins.

744
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,200
That sounds like it's not even a compliment in that case.

745
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,720
By the way, I'm fucking tripping balls because Tom is literally directly above me.

746
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,960
And I can hear him talking when he talks, but I hear him like one second before I hear him.

747
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,080
I can do the same thing with you.

748
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,320
And I'm just like trying not to think about it too much.

749
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Yeah, just roll with it, guys.

750
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,840
Just roll with it.

751
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,200
Yeah, that's all you can do.

752
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,640
Just endure it.

753
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,320
Anybody else got like, I mean, I prepared like a bunch of topics.

754
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,760
I'm just going to roll out on these episodes.

755
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,920
I mean, I could talk about my adventure into Boston's hocking my shit.

756
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,640
Oh, I wonder all about that.

757
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,040
Yeah.

758
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:03,320
Well, before we even move on though, because that last conversation tied into this long ass

759
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,720
conversation me and Tom had yesterday, just about like the shifting technologies going on right now.

760
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,680
And like which how basically like it seems as though the big companies who like control

761
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,480
everything on the internet are finally starting to get their reckoning.

762
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,200
Like I don't know if you guys heard about like Facebook tried to make some kind of deal with

763
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,680
like China and it fell through and they lost like ass tons of money.

764
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,840
And then you've got like Google who they lost a hundred billion dollars of their net worth

765
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,400
as I recall.

766
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,200
And 20% lost the nation of China.

767
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,640
Facebook.

768
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,000
No, Facebook did.

769
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,240
Yeah.

770
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,480
Which is about 15% of their net worth.

771
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,160
And then Google has been losing tons of money because like the EU is like really putting

772
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,760
their foot down about like, hey, if you're going to record everything that everybody

773
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,560
says at all times, you should you got to tell them that.

774
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,080
And they're like, oh, fuck.

775
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,320
And that's why all these TOS's are changing and shit.

776
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,560
But like me and Tom are talking about how Google, Tom, please reveal what they did

777
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
about a month ago to their slogan.

778
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,680
Yeah.

779
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,600
They removed the don't be evil clause from their wait.

780
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,240
Hold on.

781
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,880
Hold on.

782
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,720
There was a don't be evil clause.

783
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,040
That was what they were known for.

784
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,840
Like Google fanboys used to constantly talk about how like their whole principle was don't

785
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,480
be evil.

786
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,480
That was like literally their motto and they removed it from their thing.

787
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,520
Okay.

788
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,040
That's extremely ominous.

789
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,320
But like I thought it was like de facto removed previously or something.

790
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,480
I mean, I don't know what you mean, but it's really funny for that to disappear from their

791
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,720
mission statement.

792
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,560
Now, like Google says an interview now like, well, you know, maybe you could be a little

793
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,080
evil sometimes.

794
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,000
Maybe we don't always mind.

795
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,720
But but we were talking about how like Google used to be like, like back in the late 2000s,

796
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,520
like everything they were putting out was revolutionary.

797
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,840
It was like Google Chrome came out and docs and drive and all this shit that was like,

798
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Oh my God, this is like changing the way the Internet works last revolutionized time.

799
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,560
They did anything in the city.

800
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,800
Yeah.

801
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,880
When was the last time Google came out with like a new thing that you were like, Oh my

802
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,720
God, this is like going to change the game.

803
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,280
And instead, like their services keep getting worse.

804
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,880
And meanwhile, other people are making competing services that are better.

805
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,440
And now people are telling me like, when Microsoft Edge is like a better browser than

806
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:24,840
Chrome.

807
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,040
And I'm like, I even Chrome is being taught.

808
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,480
What are you doing, Google?

809
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,520
Get your shit together.

810
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,000
You know, I've been trying to get off Chrome.

811
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,880
I've been trying to get off Chrome for a long time because they don't want to be tracked.

812
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,480
Apparently, Microsoft Edge is better.

813
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,200
Or whatever.

814
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,840
Or you don't want to be tracking these Firefox.

815
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,880
Firefox is pretty good.

816
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,760
I use Firefox.

817
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,520
If you want a browser specifically that doesn't track you, there's a browser called Brave,

818
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,080
which is designed, it's designed by Firefox guys.

819
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,960
They like left the company and started their own thing called Brave.

820
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,560
And it has an ad blocker like built in and it has like all these do not track things.

821
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,720
And it's specifically designed to not pay attention to any of your shit.

822
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,440
I do want that.

823
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
I hate being watched.

824
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,840
Get it right now.

825
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,560
You Google.

826
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,280
I mean, if you really want to do that, you should get a VPN.

827
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,840
Like that.

828
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,400
That's true.

829
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,200
That's true.

830
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,440
I should subscribe to one of those many fine VPN services advertised to me on YouTube.

831
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,880
This episode of the Procrastinator's podcast is brought to you by Private Internet Access,

832
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,920
the greatest VPN ever made according to like the YouTubers I watch.

833
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:19,880
That's true.

834
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,840
Oh, and I almost forgot.

835
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,120
In fact, I'm glad you brought this up.

836
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,360
Did you?

837
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,840
Because I wanted to announce that so from now on,

838
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,800
PCB episodes will be exclusively available through our proprietary online download service.

839
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,720
The PC portal.

840
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,280
There you go.

841
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,120
Speaking of the PC portal.

842
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,320
Me and Tom have also been talking about how we need to get the PCP on everywhere.

843
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,280
And what I mean by that, because I think that we've listened to our fans to say things like,

844
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,600
oh, put us on iTunes, put us on whatever.

845
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,520
But like these other podcasting services that exist,

846
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,280
like there's people who just listened to podcasts through those.

847
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,840
So like those people are not in our fan base right now because they have no idea who we are

848
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,960
because they don't use the services we currently are on.

849
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,680
So like potentially we could have entirely separate audiences who know about us from

850
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,040
totally different apps.

851
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,200
And I think that's worth exploring.

852
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,920
It's a good idea.

853
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,960
It's a good idea.

854
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,640
So everybody let us know what podcasting apps we should explore.

855
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,760
Yeah, let us know in the comments.

856
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,400
Seriously.

857
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,320
I mean, I think everyone commenting on YouTube is probably watching us on YouTube.

858
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,520
That's true.

859
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,120
Well, okay.

860
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
I mean, that's true.

861
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,680
If you know of any, I guess.

862
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Yeah, I mean, we should definitely be on every platform available to us.

863
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,880
That's yeah.

864
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,520
I mean, there is a diminishing return on investment.

865
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,720
But I mean, it'd certainly be a good thing to just be on everything.

866
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,000
And we could just push a button and do it.

867
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,120
So yeah, let's look into it.

868
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,000
Let's look into it.

869
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,480
Wherever quality podcasts are sold or offered for free or whatever.

870
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,680
Ben, tell me about your comic selling.

871
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,560
I want to hear about it.

872
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:57,880
Shit.

873
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,440
Wait, I was going to preface it was.

874
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,160
Oh yeah, I was talking about, I talked about it on my Twitch the other day.

875
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,880
Twitch.tv slash St. Comics.

876
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,920
Like, comment, subscribe.

877
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,760
Yeah, high five.

878
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,560
Nice.

879
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,280
High shovel.

880
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:19,720
So, but yeah, basically, so I had seen on Twitter, someone had tweeted this thing about

881
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,680
how you can sometimes just walk into a store and be like, I have a book.

882
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,680
Will you put it on the shelf?

883
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
And sometimes they'll just do it.

884
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,680
So I was like, well, what?

885
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,760
So I was like, what have I got to lose?

886
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,640
So I got, okay.

887
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,080
So I still have maybe like 200 or so copies of the Vapors from the Kickstarter that did

888
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,640
not get sold because I printed a batch of 500 because there was a price break at 500.

889
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,920
So I thought, why not?

890
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,720
Can I have one?

891
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,360
Do you not already?

892
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,760
No, I don't have a Vapors.

893
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,960
Um, give me five bucks and you can have one.

894
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,760
I'll give you five bucks for one.

895
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,720
I'll happily do that.

896
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,000
You didn't fucking kickstart me, you fuck.

897
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,120
Ben, I didn't even know that you, I didn't even know about the Kickstarter till it was like over.

898
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,240
What the fuck?

899
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,880
I knew.

900
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,080
I just didn't believe in you.

901
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
It was my problem.

902
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,280
So, you know, that's, that's where I'm coming from.

903
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,080
I mean, do you guys know that it fucking was a massive success that raised like 350% of its original goal?

904
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,080
Yeah, I know that it has cool black envelopes.

905
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,480
Yes.

906
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,760
Well, that's where the fucking pins came from, which I have and I love.

907
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,960
I love my Puba pin.

908
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
It's, I have it next to my desk all the time.

909
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,800
Yeah, I've got a bunch of Puba's floating around the house and I don't know like,

910
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,440
I don't even know how I have as many as I seem to have.

911
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,920
Like, I'm pretty sure there should only be one or two, but it seems like everywhere I go, they fucking appear.

912
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,200
Oh, and you know what?

913
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Here's a little thing that can multiply.

914
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,680
Small thing that makes me, that's true.

915
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,480
You know what, I already, I ordered the, the second pin for the second Kickstarter,

916
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,320
which will probably happen in, I mean, later this year, I guess.

917
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,200
I ordered the second kind of pin.

918
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,600
I'm not going to say what it is, but I just got the email notification that has shipped.

919
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,720
And I think it's shipping to our parents house, Nate.

920
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,480
I hope it is a pin of having a panic attack.

921
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,280
That's what I want.

922
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,480
I'll just tell you.

923
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,080
No, it's, it's infinite jests.

924
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,600
The pen is infinite jests.

925
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,520
Oh, okay, cool.

926
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,840
That's great.

927
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,880
It's funny.

928
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,520
It's a joke.

929
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,080
Laugh.

930
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,120
Wait, so Ben, how do you have 200 extra copies?

931
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,920
Like, surely not even 200 people like had bought them originally, right?

932
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,400
Like, how many did you sell?

933
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah, like, it was like 200 something.

934
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,040
Holy fuck, how long did it take to ship all that?

935
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,760
A while.

936
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,960
Oh, man, I took a picture.

937
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,760
Oh, I don't know if I still have it, but I took a picture of the mailing of the receipt that I got

938
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,720
from the post office, uh, for when I went to mail them.

939
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,440
And it is like this long, it is like a huge fucking jumble of paper.

940
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,280
It is like, it is like 12 feet long is the receipt from when I, from when I mailed them all.

941
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,560
It cost me like, it's funny.

942
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,080
It's funny, but it cost me like $700 just to ship everything.

943
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,840
Oh, God.

944
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,720
He is this Christ.

945
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,240
Well, because a lot of it was international.

946
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,960
When I shipped out all the, uh, yeah, when I shipped out all the RADCON stuff,

947
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,720
like they were like, do you want a receipt?

948
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm like, it's going to be super long.

949
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,200
No, just email me.

950
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,920
And they did.

951
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,720
But the problem is they emailed me for each individual item.

952
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,920
So my phone just started blowing up because I got 150 emails and quick succession.

953
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,800
Why?

954
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,680
I don't know.

955
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,720
Sending them domestically was about $2 an envelope.

956
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,680
Sending them internet.

957
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,560
Canada was like $4 and everywhere else internationally was like just under $7.

958
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,440
So it was about five extra dollars to ship them internationally.

959
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,840
So on the next Kickstarter, I will probably be like, if you're not in the US or Canada,

960
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,200
you know, $5 postage fee.

961
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,600
I should have done that on the first one, but I didn't think to do it.

962
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,400
Yeah.

963
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
There's a thing for that.

964
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,120
Yeah, I had the other way.

965
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,280
God, I really hope, I really hope that that is, that that shipment is headed to our parents'

966
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,880
house and not anywhere else.

967
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,080
But anyway.

968
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,240
The same.

969
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,880
But anyway.

970
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,720
You know, they did just move.

971
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,920
Was it moved to the new place or home place?

972
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,560
Oh, fuck.

973
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:11,800
Ben, you fool.

974
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,240
Well, I said I waited months ago.

975
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,640
Well, okay.

976
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,520
Okay, okay, okay.

977
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,560
I will.

978
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,120
As soon as this show is over, I'm going to go check in on that.

979
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,000
Ah, motherfucker.

980
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,520
Well, good.

981
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,000
And I'll go get that sweet soylent or whatever.

982
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,200
But the point is, the point is, I googled comic store.

983
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,920
And I picked out a couple that were on the red line or I picked out a couple that were

984
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,960
on a fairly linear route that I could take through the city.

985
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,800
So I grabbed a box of these, you know, these, these extra stock of comics and I put it in my,

986
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I put it in my Sonic Boom backpack, which I have.

987
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,280
Nice.

988
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,800
That was a homecoming present.

989
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,040
It was a homecoming present from a friend.

990
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,200
So I put it in my Sonic Boom backpack and I embarked on a journey and I hit up four stores.

991
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,520
I hit up a store in Davis Square, which I had been to before called Kamikaze.

992
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,480
And they were too fucking hoity-toity.

993
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,400
They were like, we only publish local artists that we, that we're like, we're publishing the

994
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,280
books ourselves.

995
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,600
And I was like, surprise that that is even a thing that they do, but I guess it is.

996
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,360
And they said that we, they said that they would throw, that they would stage a signing

997
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,160
event for me.

998
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,640
Like they, they, they, they do signings for local artists, but I thought I don't really

999
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,320
have the cloud for that to be worth it.

1000
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,560
I don't think I would draw a huge crowd, you know?

1001
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,840
So I was like, wow, whatever.

1002
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,280
Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,600
You might be surprised.

1004
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,240
I feel like we have a lot of listeners in Boston.

1005
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,760
We haven't, I haven't at least one.

1006
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,520
We really should try that.

1007
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,920
We've got, we should really experiment more with public things.

1008
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,800
Like, see how it goes.

1009
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,480
And we've gotten a lot of comments to the effect of like, wow, it's really trippy now

1010
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,000
that they all live in Boston, like hearing them say the names of all these places that

1011
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,080
I pass by every day and stuff like that.

1012
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,920
And I'm sure there's a fair, yeah, I've seen a couple of those.

1013
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,320
But I was tweeting to complain about how they were fucking like shutting down the roads

1014
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
for that like cop who died or whatever.

1015
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,800
Yeah, yeah.

1016
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,840
Those damn terrorists.

1017
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah.

1018
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,040
Someone was like, yeah, I, like, there's been like news vans outside my work all the time

1019
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,200
because I work near the station and like, like in town you live in.

1020
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,360
And I'm like, oh, like my fucking people are like right around me.

1021
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,240
Like it's probably a fucking someone who listens to the show in my goddamn neighborhood.

1022
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,840
All around me are familiar faces, worn out faces, worn out faces.

1023
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,800
Digi, well, here, I'll lip and finish this story.

1024
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:36,360
Wait, um, oh, about assigning, I guess like leave a comment or tweet at me if you think,

1025
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,160
if you would want to come to like a signing event in Davis Square with me.

1026
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,040
I mean, I would do it if I thought people would come.

1027
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,840
Um, but anyway, I mean, hey, if Ben does assigning, uh, I'll show up too.

1028
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,960
Oh, yeah.

1029
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,520
It can come meet Digi, bro and get dents on there.

1030
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,640
No, stay the fuck away from my signing.

1031
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,920
I don't want people showing up to be like, oh, hey, Ben, where's Digi?

1032
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,640
No, I'll tell them that they can't talk to me unless they buy your comic.

1033
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,800
That sounds like a compromise I can live with.

1034
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,880
I just want you to be at the table with your comic, like comics, and I'll be like 15 feet

1035
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,640
behind you in a chair, like wearing sunglasses and just like sipping a latte and like giving

1036
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,600
everyone the finger, like, and then like, if, if, if they buy a comic, like you'll like

1037
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,120
undo like this little rope and they can go back and shake my hand and I'd like,

1038
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,720
well, this feels dirty.

1039
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,600
This feels dirty.

1040
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,000
No, man, this is business.

1041
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,400
I guess this is business.

1042
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,120
Get used to it.

1043
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,800
You know, I guess this is what I signed up for.

1044
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,000
But so, okay, so Kamikaze said no, but we'll do a signing and I was like, okay, maybe.

1045
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So then I went to Harvard Square.

1046
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,960
Does Kazi have any relation to Kamikaze?

1047
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,280
No.

1048
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:44,840
You know?

1049
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,320
No.

1050
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,040
I don't get it.

1051
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,280
No.

1052
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,720
All right. Well, how about, how about we split the difference and Tom will be at the signing

1053
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,200
with you.

1054
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,200
You know, did you two point out?

1055
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,960
No, I want, no, I want you all to come.

1056
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,080
I want you all to come.

1057
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,520
If I do it, which maybe I will.

1058
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,600
Maybe I should do it just for fun, just to see what happens.

1059
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,720
What if no one, if no one shows up, whatever, it's an adventure.

1060
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:06,840
Yeah.

1061
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,400
Just better.

1062
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,200
Just have a party.

1063
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,840
Yeah.

1064
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,600
And then I will tweet that I had a signing.

1065
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,520
We'll have to, we'll have to just photoshop it.

1066
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,960
We'll have to photoshop a bunch of people into your signing and then post it on Twitter.

1067
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,520
Like, this is fucking hot and come get your comic.

1068
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,560
You're missing out.

1069
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,600
Photoshopping all the greats.

1070
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,920
You know, Sonichu, Tails, you know, Winnie the Pooh, you know, the whole thing.

1071
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,720
I think I can guarantee you get at least 10 people.

1072
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,560
Pooh's Adventures of the Ben St. autograph signing at Comic-Con.

1073
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,160
It's like, hell yeah.

1074
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,920
And Doug was there and then Tails and he went home.

1075
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,080
The Cheeto Man was there, you know.

1076
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,720
Knuckles, all the greats, all the greats.

1077
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,200
Hatsune Miku showed up.

1078
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,400
That was lit, you know.

1079
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,520
Comment writer.

1080
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,040
Comment writer, a known comic writer.

1081
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,920
Every Red Ranger, none of those beta blues though.

1082
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,440
So I went to Harvard Square and I went to this basement called Million Dollar Picnic.

1083
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,880
And that guy, there was a very nice dude in there behind the counter.

1084
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,360
It was a small little hole in the wall place.

1085
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,400
And I told him I had a book and he took it and he read through my comic.

1086
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,840
And it was very awkward for me.

1087
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,320
I just kind of like pretended to look at shelves.

1088
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,840
And then a guy came and bought something and he put it down and like rung this guy up.

1089
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,360
And I was just like, when's he going to finish reading my shit?

1090
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,000
But he eventually did.

1091
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,440
And he was like, you know, looks good.

1092
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,960
You know, I'll buy a couple and I'll put them on the shelves.

1093
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,040
He bought like, he bought three copies for $4 a piece.

1094
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,280
I made a whopping $12 from that exchange.

1095
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,360
And he said he was going to sell them for six bucks and you know, see what happened.

1096
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,360
He said, call back in a while and see if he sold.

1097
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:52,680
And then like the next day, someone tweeted at me outside of Million Dollar Picnic,

1098
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,080
holding a copy, presumably one that they bought in there.

1099
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,200
So I already look like a real cool guy.

1100
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,560
So, okay.

1101
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,360
So you obviously couldn't do a signing here because of the fact that there's people nearby

1102
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,480
buying your comics and who know who you are online.

1103
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,360
There's at least one.

1104
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,000
Did you like advertise that or was that an organic purchase that this person just did?

1105
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,800
No, I did tweet that I had put my...

1106
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,240
I did tweet and I mentioned which stores my shit was in.

1107
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,520
So it was not completely organic.

1108
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,000
Fair enough.

1109
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,480
Fair enough.

1110
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,000
So then I went to another place and...

1111
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,680
Hey, all that matters is that they sell.

1112
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,480
Yeah, pretty much.

1113
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,240
That's all you need to convince the people at the place that they should keep buying your comics.

1114
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,120
That's true.

1115
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,240
Maybe I can sell more than three of the next next time.

1116
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,000
So then I went to another place in Harvard Square.

1117
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,480
I think it was called New England Comics or New England comic shops or something.

1118
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,440
And there was a pretty enthusiastic guy behind the counter.

1119
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,240
He was pretty cool and he seemed to like me and want me to get my shit on the shelves.

1120
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,200
He took a look and he liked it.

1121
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,400
But he was not a manager.

1122
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,440
He did not have the authorization to do that for me.

1123
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,680
So I left a copy with and gave my contact info.

1124
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,080
He said, like, call back in a little bit and we'll see.

1125
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,120
And I was like, okay, cool.

1126
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,560
So that one's a maybe.

1127
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,040
And then the last one I went to the Heinz Convention Center and I went to this place called Comicopia.

1128
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,560
And they...

1129
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,360
He looked at my shit.

1130
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,040
They said there was a guy and a girl.

1131
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,280
The girl was like, this is very professionally printed.

1132
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,400
It's very nicely printed.

1133
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,120
And I was like, cool.

1134
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,760
Thank you.

1135
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,080
He's like, unfortunately, it's in black and white.

1136
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,000
And sadly, that is a problem because things that are not in color, they just don't...

1137
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,440
People just don't pick them up.

1138
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,800
And I was like, that sucks.

1139
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,240
But, you know, was it deliberate choice?

1140
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,160
I like the black and white aesthetic.

1141
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,800
She said that people complain about manga.

1142
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,680
People are like, oh, I can't read manga because it's in black and white.

1143
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,280
And I was like...

1144
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,560
I mean, literally, Jesse.

1145
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,280
Literally, Jesse.

1146
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,800
What kind of crowd is this?

1147
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,400
What the fuck kind of crowd is this?

1148
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,320
What the fuck is a philist?

1149
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,640
People who only read American comics, you know?

1150
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,000
That's like a weird and bizarre world that I don't understand.

1151
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,360
The world of Western comics.

1152
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,960
The funny thing is that most Western comics, what bothers me about them is that I hate the colors

1153
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,920
because so many of them are like terrible colorists.

1154
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,480
Or just like the aesthetics doesn't work.

1155
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,720
Marvel comics and stuff in the black and white.

1156
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,240
They have these collections where they are on a newsprint and they don't have the colors.

1157
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,200
They look so much better.

1158
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,960
I personally just...

1159
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,560
I personally don't really like the colors because it's just like...

1160
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,320
It's too much. It's too overpowering.

1161
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,640
Yeah.

1162
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,400
Like, it's overwhelming.

1163
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,280
I like the...

1164
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,080
I love the simplicity of like a simple black and white ink manga panel.

1165
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,760
I don't see how...

1166
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,880
I don't understand people that can look at that and be like,

1167
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,080
ugh, where's all the color?

1168
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:28,920
It's like...

1169
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,640
It's like...

1170
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,560
You know that drink called Trop 50?

1171
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,120
No.

1172
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,400
You know that one?

1173
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,040
Okay, what it is is it's orange juice with half the calories.

1174
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,320
So here's what they did.

1176
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,520
They took a gallon of orange juice and they poured water in half of it.

1177
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,400
So it's half water, half orange juice.

1178
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,760
Well, that's just my age old trick.

1179
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,240
My age old trick has been to dilute my orange juice.

1180
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,440
So like, they...

1181
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,280
Where's my fucking royalties, Trop 50?

1182
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,640
After sipping a couple of glasses of Trop 50, if you go, as I've done,

1183
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,440
and you sip just a normal glass of orange juice,

1184
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,440
it's the most decadent, overbearing, sugary drink in the world.

1185
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,160
So it's like that.

1186
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,360
That's what the colors are like for me.

1187
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,240
I can't handle it.

1188
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,400
My baby taste buds can't handle it.

1189
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,520
We can't talk about orange juice.

1190
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,560
This shit's not keto.

1191
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,680
I can feel my insulin spiking as we speak.

1192
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't think the issue is that the comics are colored.

1193
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,600
I just think it's that the way that it is culturally accepted to color comics

1194
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,120
in America is obnoxious.

1195
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,160
That it's all just glaring primaries and like...

1196
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,840
I think it's because there's a guy whose job is to just do colors.

1197
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,600
So they've got to like overcompensate.

1198
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,680
But I mean, I've seen color comics that look good before.

1199
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,280
You know what?

1200
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,760
It's weird.

1201
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,120
There's a ton of people.

1202
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,040
Like, I've been doing the potty cast for a while now.

1203
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,680
Like Cucumber Quest, incidentally.

1204
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,160
Oh, yeah.

1205
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,720
Yeah, yeah.

1206
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,600
I like Cucumber Quest.

1207
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,760
Cucumber Quest is colored beautifully.

1208
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:49,560
Yeah.

1209
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,360
I haven't really read it.

1210
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,680
With the potty cast, like of course, one piece manga,

1211
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,200
originally all black and white.

1212
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,040
But like, there's been a big thing to make the colored manga.

1213
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,880
So like, I've gotten a bunch of people into reading one piece

1214
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,880
through the potty cast and videos and stuff.

1215
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,720
And like, most of them read the colored version.

1216
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,400
And it's very strange.

1217
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,880
Get it.

1218
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,640
I don't get it.

1219
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,960
But what is worth the colored version of one piece does look good?

1220
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,040
It really is.

1221
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,240
It's like drinking.

1222
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,480
It's like drinking that pure glass of orange juice.

1223
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,320
I'm like, oh, it's just, oh, it's so strong.

1224
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,400
I mean, I think that the colored version of one piece,

1225
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,520
first of all, I think it works because of the fact

1226
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,400
that it's based off the color design of the show,

1227
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,520
which is really strong.

1228
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,360
And like, one piece is a world that makes sense in color.

1229
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,400
Like, I do think there are certain manga where like,

1230
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,040
because of the fact that it's like a wacky, crazy,

1231
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,520
like everything is audacious in one piece.

1232
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,440
Like, it just kind of makes sense to be colored.

1233
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,160
I do agree.

1234
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,400
Like, one of my comics that I discontinued basically,

1235
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,040
like, even Tied Eternal, well, not discontinued.

1236
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,880
It's just going to be on a haters for years.

1237
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:59,000
But like, I had to stop it because I realized that I can't color.

1238
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,480
And this comic has to be in color

1239
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,720
because they're going to travel to all these worlds

1240
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,760
and locations and stuff.

1241
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,800
And I cannot translate the world without using the colors

1242
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,520
because it's so integral to the whole thing.

1243
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,520
You know, when I read Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle,

1244
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,800
that's the one that comes to mind immediately.

1245
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,520
Oh, boy, yeah.

1246
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,320
That thing is incomprehensible in the black and white.

1247
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,120
It sure is.

1248
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,040
And in black and white, like, I just got no sense of like,

1249
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,880
feeling for like the worlds that they visited.

1250
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Oda's way better at that, doing that in black and white.

1251
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,760
I'm sure that the one piece color version is great.

1252
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,680
But I don't get needing that.

1253
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,640
Like, I think the black, like, the black and white version's fine.

1254
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,920
Like, when I reread Scott Pilgrim, like, maybe a year or two ago,

1255
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,920
or no, it was more than, maybe like three years.

1256
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,360
Geez, I should reread it again.

1257
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,000
When, the last time I reread Scott Pilgrim,

1258
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,520
I was like, well, there's the colored version

1259
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,960
or there's the black and white version.

1260
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,600
And I was like, I'm going to, I opted for the black and white version

1261
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,840
because like, this is what it was originally made as.

1262
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,880
And the colored version is like an alteration.

1263
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,840
And I'm sure it's cool.

1264
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,240
Every single time I go to the store,

1265
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,640
because I've never bought Scott Pilgrim and I want to.

1266
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,760
And I'm always just like tearing myself apart over like,

1267
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,400
well, the colored version's the one I haven't read yet.

1268
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,160
But the black and white version's the original.

1269
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,480
And then finally, I opened each one up

1270
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,360
to like some specific scenes last time I was at the store.

1271
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,160
And I was just like, the black and white is just superior.

1272
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,040
Just like, because you can tell, I think the problem

1273
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,240
with colorized versions of originally black and white comics

1274
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,880
is that like, there are times when the color adds something to it.

1275
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,200
And then there's times where like, in Scott Pilgrim,

1276
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,080
there's lots of just blank white backgrounds.

1277
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,560
And so they replace those with just like blank single color backgrounds.

1278
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,360
But that makes it more obvious that they're not in like a realistic location.

1279
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,200
You know, like maybe in the manga,

1280
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
it's just like a guy against a white backdrop.

1281
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,400
But now it's like a wall that for some reason is undecorated.

1282
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
And that seems unrealistic, you know?

1283
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,760
Dude, this is kind of like my feelings about like,

1284
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,680
just as one example, it pertains to everything,

1285
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,240
every like, whatever, like anime or manga to anime conversion.

1286
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,080
Like for like the one piece anime, or like any shonen conversion

1287
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,920
from the manga to whatever, it's like, in some ways,

1288
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,240
like Binksake from one piece is like so much better in the anime.

1289
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,680
But like moment to moment, it's like kind of way worse

1290
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,800
because it looks like shit and like audio is nice.

1291
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,520
It's just paced worse and like it's yeah,

1292
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,880
the audio adds something in that in a couple of instances.

1293
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,720
But for the most part, it's better.

1294
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,240
I mean, I made a video about that way the fuck back.

1295
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,480
The the one about soul leader and like how the problem with that translation

1296
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,640
was like there's parts where there might be a panel that's like really tiny on the page

1297
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,320
where it's just like a little cutaway joke.

1298
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,920
But then when they make it the anime, that's like 10 seconds of dialogue.

1299
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,840
And it totally kills the pacing.

1300
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,520
Yep, that's a big thing.

1301
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,840
But to round out my story, so this girl was like, I don't think they'll,

1302
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,160
you know, it's too bad they're in black and white because black and whites,

1303
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,080
you know, don't go off the shelves as much.

1304
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,120
And I was like, well, that's too bad.

1305
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,560
But whatever, I can't do anything about it.

1306
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,320
And they were like, well, it's well printed.

1307
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,440
So we'll they did not buy the copies from me.

1308
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,760
They said, you know, we'll take them and put them on our shelves.

1309
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,440
We'll sell them for six bucks.

1310
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,120
I suggested six bucks because it was what the other guy had suggested

1311
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,880
as a reasonable price.

1312
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,720
And they will split to 50-50, which is a shitty deal.

1313
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,720
50 to the store is a shit deal, frankly.

1314
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,040
But whatever, I don't care.

1315
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,720
And I was like, fine, if that's the deal, then I'll take it.

1316
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,440
We'll do it.

1317
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,800
And then I left.

1318
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,160
And then someone tweeted at me.

1319
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,360
They bought it from the other one.

1320
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,480
And it was pretty cool.

1321
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,920
So now I have seven.

1322
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,160
I have seven copies out in stores.

1323
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,000
And at least one of them is sold.

1324
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,080
And I will probably go into town again

1325
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,560
because there are plenty more stores that I did not hit up.

1326
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,280
I hit up four.

1327
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,960
And there's at least a dozen.

1328
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,400
I'm excited to hear about this plan, Ben.

1329
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,560
Because it would be very easy for us

1330
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,600
to make some kind of multi-tier deals around this area

1331
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,640
with these comic shops.

1332
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,880
Like if everyone is going to end up around here,

1333
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,040
imagine if we had some kind of PCP package deal

1334
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,280
where we'll promote them and they'll host different comics

1335
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,800
and things that we create and do art signings.

1336
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,000
That's an incredible idea.

1337
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,560
Yeah, but I don't think we're big enough for them to really care.

1338
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,160
I honestly think that because it's Boston, we are big enough.

1339
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,640
Because I mean, consider the fact that Ben was saying

1340
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,040
that there's local comic stores that are big enough

1341
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,520
that they literally publish local artists,

1342
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,760
which means that enough people are invested

1343
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,040
in buying a completely unheard of local artist.

1344
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,120
That they will sell enough to make it worth publishing for them.

1345
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,200
So we already have pre-established fan base.

1346
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,280
So it's not like we're building out of nowhere.

1347
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,120
We already have fans in Boston.

1348
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,400
And if those fans created a culture from these stores,

1349
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,400
if people knew every Saturday we're going to be at this comic store,

1350
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,960
then you build a community around that.

1351
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,640
Right, and here's the thing.

1352
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,320
Like these stores, their social media presence

1353
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,040
is like a fraction of what ours is.

1354
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,720
So especially if they have online sales,

1355
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,440
there's big gains for them.

1356
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,000
PCP has a swinging...

1357
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,720
In terms of when people look at the PCP channel

1358
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,480
and say things like that it doesn't have that many subscribers or something,

1359
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,760
it's like you're comparing it to the entirely wrong thing.

1360
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,040
Yeah, it doesn't have that much subscribers

1361
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,640
for a YouTube channel in competition with big YouTubers.

1362
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,840
16,000 subscribers to the average human being

1363
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
sounds fucking insane.

1364
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,760
Like if you tell a small business,

1365
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,400
yeah, we have the poll of 16,000 people.

1366
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,640
It's like, oh, that's the population of this town.

1367
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,160
So I think there's a lot that can be done with that.

1368
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,640
Not to mention the weirdness of the PCP

1369
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,880
and that almost all of us have more

1370
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,440
poll in the individual things we do outside of the PCP itself.

1371
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,960
I mean, imagine if I did that signing

1372
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,000
and say like 10 people show up to it.

1373
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,160
That's 10 people that like...

1374
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,200
That's 10 real people who maybe had never heard of this store

1375
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,520
coming to it for the first time

1376
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,680
and maybe buy in some stuff and maybe be coming, repeat customers.

1377
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,040
And to a little mom and pop shop that kind of thing.

1378
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,160
When we were hanging out with Ben...

1379
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,280
When we were hanging out with Econ and Zen Huxable,

1380
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,760
we went to Newberry Comics and May spoke to someone there like,

1381
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,160
hey, this guy's a famous anime YouTuber.

1382
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,000
Can we strike up some kind of deal with you guys?

1383
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And they were like, oh, well, you got to contact our office

1384
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,360
and they gave us like a card.

1385
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,640
She tried calling them but never actually got an answer

1386
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,960
because they were just like not in the hours, I guess.

1387
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,080
Oh, yeah, I stopped at Newberry and they seemed very like...

1388
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,920
They didn't seem...

1389
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,440
The thing is, Newberry is a chain.

1390
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,080
Newberry was super popular.

1391
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,640
Newberry is a chain and it's very FYE-esque.

1392
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,480
But I'm thinking now that because...

1393
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,760
Because I've noticed that there's Newberries all over town.

1394
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,680
Like, they're pretty common in Boston.

1395
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,440
So that means all the other comic shops are in competition with Newberry.

1396
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,560
Which means that if we can give them anything

1397
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,600
that would be a pull for them to compete with Newberry,

1398
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,840
that would be really attractive to them, you know?

1399
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,720
Let me tell you why selfishly this plan sounds great to me.

1400
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,760
It is because I have long felt like some sort of weird comics pariah.

1401
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,640
Like a guy who makes comics and makes his living off of doing comics

1402
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,600
and yet has like basically no connection to like other people who do that.

1403
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,840
And sometimes I wonder, sometimes I wonder about like the comic scene, right?

1404
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,440
Like breaking into that scene and being a part of that community, right?

1405
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,160
And I wonder about it.

1406
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,280
You don't want it.

1407
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,160
It's awful.

1408
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,040
The funny thing is I completely relate to that because of the fact that

1409
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,920
I hate all the anime YouTubers.

1410
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,760
And so I have always felt like a pariah in that same way.

1411
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,480
Because like, so many of them are about the sense of community.

1412
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,400
Like they just want to be in the group called anime YouTubers.

1413
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,760
And so they just do what everyone else in that group does.

1414
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,160
And like, I'm not really interested in that.

1415
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,840
Like I just want to make my shit.

1416
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,360
And I would prefer if everyone in the group was doing something different.

1417
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,120
Which is why I love the PCP so much.

1418
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,720
Because we're like, none of us are quite doing the exact same shit.

1419
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,480
So it's like we always have, we're not really in competition with each other.

1420
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,640
We're just people who are, you know, taking a similar approach to our career path.

1421
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
You know, I have had mixed feelings about it.

1422
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,840
Because sometimes, sometimes I feel like a weird pariah.

1423
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,960
And I think, boy, if only I were part of some kind of like community

1424
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,760
that would like support what I do and like help promote my shit

1425
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,160
and like, you know, have mutual interest in common

1426
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,640
and face the same kind of struggles and all that.

1427
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,960
But then sometimes I see, sometimes I see like on Twitter

1428
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,400
or in like various discords that I joined and then never looked at again.

1429
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:11,800
I see this community, I see the people, you know, communicating

1430
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,280
and the attitude is like foreign to me.

1431
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,760
The attitude is like hyper positive and like hyper supportive

1432
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,080
and like very like hug boxy.

1433
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,360
And I'm like, I'm shuddering in my chair.

1434
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:30,920
I mean, like I said, Ben, in the last like five, 10 years,

1435
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,040
every time I go to a comic store and I pick up something I've never heard of,

1436
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,320
it has Tumblr art.

1437
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,000
When I pick up your book, it has nothing of the sort.

1438
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,240
And I really think that like, again, it's people wanting to be a part of a click.

1439
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,680
They get into drawing comics because they want to be in a positive community like that.

1440
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:52,280
And I think that you are someone who is as an outsider to that.

1441
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,880
You're just someone who independently came to the conclusion of comics with no,

1442
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,760
you know, no motivation behind it to like make friends on that basis.

1443
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,880
And now you're like, well, surely I can make friends on the basis of what I'm already doing

1444
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,720
because surely someone else does comics and feels this way.

1445
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,080
You know, that's kind of how I felt when with my anime channel is like,

1446
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,160
surely, like I'm not doing this to be a part of the anime community,

1447
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,120
but surely I could form an anime community out of people who feel the same way about anime I do.

1448
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,680
I mean, with this question, one should really, I think about this a lot,

1449
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,400
you should lead your life with your values out in front ahead of you.

1450
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,360
You shouldn't like be aiming to join a particular group.

1451
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:38,520
It should be like, do the thing that you're passionate about or whatever that is,

1452
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,080
and then like, absorb the community that gathers around you naturally.

1453
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,120
Because those will be the people who are like, yeah, exactly.

1454
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,960
Which I feel like is what I have done.

1455
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,720
I feel like I have more or less lived by that, by that ethos.

1456
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,480
I think, same here.

1457
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,840
For me, I think the PCP entirely has lived by that,

1458
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,240
but for me, it's just a matter of we gotta build it bigger, you know?

1459
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:01,880
True.

1460
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,520
It's like, we've built it and they've come,

1461
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,800
but what if we could build it even bigger and even more of them came?

1462
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,120
Or what if we built it to be even better for them,

1463
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,280
and they left everywhere else that they were?

1464
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,000
You know what I mean?

1465
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,680
The PCP is gonna make them all come.

1466
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,720
I hear y'all loud and clear.

1467
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,360
Man, imagine that is my ultimate goal, to make everybody come.

1468
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:25,240
Imagine if we could become like a legitimate cultural force in like the Boston area.

1469
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:25,800
What a dream.

1470
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,200
I think we could.

1471
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:26,520
What a dream come true.

1472
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,640
I think it could happen.

1473
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,640
I am here to fucking lead the new type takeover of Boston.

1474
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,280
God damn it.

1475
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,520
We need Munchie and his foot shoulders marching in the streets

1476
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,160
to enforce the law of the land.

1477
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,840
We gotta burn this place in the ground.

1478
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,120
So that's pretty much all I have to say about that little escapade.

1479
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,280
I will probably do more of it soon.

1480
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,440
I mean my results were pretty successful.

1481
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,600
Discounting new grounds, which I did not really expect to make any headway.

1482
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,520
I was successful at two out of the four and one of the-

1483
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,480
You mean new grounds or newberry comics?

1484
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,920
I'm sorry, I mean newberry comics.

1485
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,400
Yeah, yeah.

1486
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,680
Yeah, I did not expect to make any headway there because they were so corporate.

1487
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,080
But yeah, two out of the four local shops that I went to accepted my shit

1488
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,840
and one of the ones that didn't is still a maybe that might pan out anyway.

1489
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,160
So, you know, I'd say the results were-

1490
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,240
That's really, that's great ratio.

1491
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,440
That's incredible about success.

1492
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,600
And you know, I don't care about selling them.

1493
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,440
I don't care about selling them.

1494
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,600
But I care about having them on shelves and I care about-

1495
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,560
Okay, okay.

1496
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,760
Here's what I think, right?

1497
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,640
I don't think I'm gonna move a ton of product this way.

1498
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,120
But I don't care about that because the people that do find it in this way

1499
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,000
are gonna be people who are really passionate about comics, right?

1500
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,280
Like people that are like into this medium and those people are like invested.

1501
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,040
And someone like that stumbling upon my work and being like,

1502
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,560
oh my god, this is a new guy who I've never heard of before

1503
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,400
and his work is different from everything else that I've read.

1504
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,520
And I connect with it.

1505
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,760
Like to get, like, you know, even just a handful of people having that reaction.

1506
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,640
Like that's what I'm after.

1507
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,520
And I think that this is a great way-

1508
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:12,440
I absolutely think the type of people who will go to the local published shelf at all

1509
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,160
are that type of people.

1510
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,880
Yeah, yeah, that's what appealed to me about doing it.

1511
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,040
Not the thought of moving a ton of product,

1512
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,000
but the thought about potentially reaching like, you know,

1513
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,360
the hardest of core of audiences potentially.

1514
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,400
You know, it's funny, Ben.

1515
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,560
Back when I, before I became a YouTuber,

1516
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,640
I was making this magazine called The Virginia Beach Hermit Society.

1517
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,840
And my plan was that it says on the cover that it's free

1518
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,360
and I was just going to just leave it in like Barnes & Noble.

1519
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,720
Just like leave it in random places and see if people would take it.

1520
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,480
Which apparently is how the band TV on the radio,

1521
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,120
their first like mixtape album or whatever was called OK Calculator.

1522
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,120
And they said that they pretty much did that.

1523
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,480
They just like printed off a bunch of it

1524
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,960
and would just like leave it all over their campus and shit

1525
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,680
or just like in CD bins and stuff.

1526
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,600
And just like hope people would find out about them.

1527
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,360
There are some stores just have like zines.

1528
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,680
Like people just leave zines and stuff.

1529
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,560
Like there's a crepe shop in Davis Square

1530
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,800
that one time I just like picked up some zines.

1531
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,920
They just had some fucking zines sitting around at like the front shelf.

1532
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,440
Any of them good or interesting?

1533
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,440
OK.

1534
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,560
I don't remember.

1535
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,760
It was nothing remarkable but you know.

1536
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,160
Yeah that's the sad thing about it is that like again

1537
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,920
it you always have to consider the culture

1538
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,160
because it's like if you put it in a zine rack

1539
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,800
but all the other zines are totally different from yours

1540
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,560
then it's like well the kind of people who would come to this rack

1541
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,120
are not the kind of people who are going to read my zine you know.

1542
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,040
Making zines is a popular thing.

1543
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,400
A thing that I don't quite get.

1544
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,080
Is there any profit to be found in making those?

1545
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,360
Are you talking about zines?

1546
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,960
Didn't we argue about this last time?

1547
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,400
Didn't me and Munchie get in a fight?

1548
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,240
I was not there.

1549
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,600
Yeah he wasn't Munchie calling it.

1550
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,600
I have never heard the word zines before.

1551
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,320
What are you talking about?

1552
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,200
I haven't heard zines.

1553
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,360
It's obviously zine because it's short.

1554
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,120
Yeah because it's short for magazine.

1555
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,400
No one says magazine.

1556
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,320
Well zines sound cooler.

1557
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,400
No it sounds dumb.

1558
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,480
You sound dumb.

1559
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,280
Oh good one.

1560
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,400
That's yes.

1561
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:15,880
Well done.

1562
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,360
I'm proud of you.

1563
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,360
Yeah am I crazy or last week didn't me and Munchie argue about this exact same thing?

1564
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,920
I don't remember.

1565
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,120
No okay well anyway.

1566
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,800
I don't even remember if I was on last week.

1567
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,360
A lot of people who draw comics make zines and I don't quite get why.

1568
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,720
I guess the idea is to make like a really short work that you can like put places but I don't know.

1569
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,520
There is a group.

1570
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,960
There is a group in Boston called.

1571
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,560
I'm just obsessed with magazines.

1572
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,520
There is a group in Boston called the Boston Comics Roundtable that I before I moved away

1573
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,040
I would I would most weeks I would attend these meetings and people would like bring their latest

1574
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,600
pages of their shit and post them up and critique each other and they had like a

1575
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,480
they had like a group sort of like publication that people would do their own comics for and

1576
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:09,880
contribute to but a lot of people that were at this thing made zines and I was like huh zines you

1577
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:14,120
say and then I never even considered making one of my own because why.

1578
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,800
Ben if you ever do consider that get me involved because I'm obsessed with magazines.

1579
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,360
Maybe it will.

1580
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,040
Just I grew up with them you know.

1581
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:27,000
Okay the reason the reason I think in my head I read it as zines is because like all of the

1582
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,280
like one syllable words with like four letters like a fine line time.

1583
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,240
Sure.

1584
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:33,560
You know.

1585
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,400
Yeah if you say if you saw it alone without.

1586
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,520
But etymology for magazines.

1587
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,440
It has to be related to magazine.

1588
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:44,120
It's probably you're probably right but like it doesn't read that way in my mind and it's just

1589
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,960
like it is just a big error message in my head I cannot make it as.

1590
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,320
You're right English is wrong.

1591
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,440
Yeah that's fair I can accept that pretty much.

1592
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,040
Let me tell you let me let me tell you my secret shame let me tell you my secret shame.

1593
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:01,560
I have been meaning to go back to that Boston Comics roundtable again because I used to

1594
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:08,360
enjoy it quite a bit and I have not done it yet and I well the reason doesn't

1595
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:13,640
make any sense and it's terrible the reason is and here's my fucking problem guys and I'm

1596
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,000
prepared to be judged for this.

1597
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,280
I'm judging myself I'm too fat and I'm too ugly and I don't want to leave my house

1598
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,800
and I don't want anyone to see me.

1599
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,080
Oh god.

1600
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,080
What's the competition like there though.

1601
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:30,200
What's the are these are these the much lookers that are going to look down on you for no

1602
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:34,840
fatness and your hideous body I just I thought that anyone would in the first no no I just

1603
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,800
I'm like I'm just like I could be.

1604
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:43,080
Yeah sure I sure I wouldn't be the ugliest guy there but I could be 20 pounds thinner

1605
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:47,080
and I could have my beard back and wouldn't that be a better first impression to make.

1606
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,440
I can relate to that.

1607
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,680
Yeah you know what you should do Ben is you should start going out in public and then

1608
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,440
use the shame that you feel over not being better to make yourself.

1609
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,600
Oh but I have oh but I have done that I mean that's that's a good job that's

1610
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,360
hence the keto hence the keto lifestyle.

1611
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,680
Yeah well you know going out going out getting out of the house getting out of the house

1612
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,120
really helps with motivation to like improve yourself.

1613
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,520
Yeah.

1614
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,880
If you're sitting at home and doing nothing all the time it's like well what do I even

1615
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,880
have to to work towards what's the point.

1616
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,320
Yeah nothing you'd be in a waistoid if you're living that when you have when you have more

1617
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,520
of a social life and you have like things that you go out and do it's like all the other stuff

1618
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,560
all this all the beneficial stuff it's like you just kind of want to do it more you have

1619
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:38,040
more reason to want to like eat right and and not and exercise and and you know not.

1620
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:45,080
It's like when you like when you go out to like do something and you feel physically

1621
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,640
weak it's definitely like you know when you when you're just like getting healthier for

1622
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,880
the sake of itself it's just like well why but then when you like try to do something you

1623
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:00,040
want to do and you can't that's when it's really like okay like yeah and I gotta say motivation

1624
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:07,240
is such a powerful thing because I have been trying to like talk myself into like going hard

1625
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:14,760
on making more money because I need to like to live in the house I live in and pay my taxes

1626
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:22,120
but uh but it wasn't until Tom yesterday informed me that there are now like 16 core processors

1627
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:27,880
that you can buy for like $800 that will like rip through render times that I finally actually

1628
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:33,960
started putting the effort into making more money like it was not the like financial freefall that

1629
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:40,040
did it it was the wanting to buy an expensive new computer that did it for me so well hey

1630
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:45,640
there it is classic motivation getting them 16 cores stand funny to make money

1631
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:52,760
no I think that was the mistake I was making uh like a few months ago is that I was like trying

1632
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,320
to like spend more money to make money and now I'm like no I'm not at that point in my career

1633
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:02,520
yet I've at the point of my career still where I can make way more money by not paying anybody

1634
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:08,360
by like just doing everything myself and just not being a lazy fuck each and every one of us

1635
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:13,800
lies without a question on the precipice of utter financial ruin it could easily happen

1636
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:20,360
but like if we any of us got sick uh like it's over it's fucking what do you mean by sick like I

1637
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:25,400
mean well you know let's say you um you you got I don't know you get some sort of like

1638
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,280
fucking long-term illness oh yeah I guess cancer or something extreme one oh you're saying like if

1639
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,680
we had to like spend a shitload of money over getting sick that's what I'm saying I could not

1640
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:39,640
afford kick cancer treatment does anyone in this group have health insurance at all oh I have health

1641
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,840
insurance through my job currently I live in Europe oh yeah that's right yeah so she's all right

1642
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:50,920
I still I have you saying Ben I still not gotten on Massachusetts health insurance even though it

1643
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,840
was one of the main things I was looking forward to doing when I got back here Ben do it today

1644
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:01,080
look come on Ben you gotta join me in the bottom rungs of society leaching off you don't have health

1645
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:07,000
insurance here yeah yeah oh oh how I love paying my oh well this may get your revenge for those

1646
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,120
really terrible by the way but it's free that's socialized medicine for you this is the closest

1647
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:18,360
I'll ever get you can see a doctor and what more do you want yeah yeah yeah he'll look at you

1648
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:25,640
tell you to get out and that'll be that uh when are we gonna have free when are they gonna make

1649
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:32,600
free technolized limbs I just want to have like a robot where is transhuman oh why is it not god

1650
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:40,040
wait I have to share the terrible tragedy that occurred in my life guys guys you lost an arm my

1651
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:48,440
oculus rift oh okay okay I think the rift itself is fine I think it's just the cord I think it's

1652
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:54,200
the cable oh god okay because because the headset connects to the computer with a cord that splits

1653
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:03,720
it splits into an hdmi and a usb and the usb connector works but the hdmi or hdmi connector

1654
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,760
it will not it says that it's not connected and I don't know the headset if there's a problem with

1655
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,640
the headset okay it's not a problem with the computer because I have plugged a monitor into that hdmi

1656
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:19,080
port and it has worked so it's not the computer so it is either something with the headset or I think

1657
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,640
more likely it's something is wrong with the cord so I looked into replacing the cord

1658
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:29,400
and this single cord okay you can buy one from the manufacturer from the oculus of

1659
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:36,360
manufacture free whopping $50 so I'm like fuck that so I head on to amazon right right I head on

1660
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:44,920
to ebay and I look for this cord $150 for just the cord uh wait yeah I'm like so that is the

1661
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,200
maybe that'll make any fucking sense like what but why would you buy a proprietary cord why would you

1662
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:56,840
buy it I don't know I I guess maybe uh that doesn't make any sense like an hdmi cable is like two

1663
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:03,960
dollars well it's an hdmi split with a with a usb and you know actually come to think of it the um

uh

1677
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:30,440
by my books in the real world in the real universe wherever quality comics are sold

1678
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:35,320
Ben what you need to do is when you get your Ben when you get your oculus rift fixed we need to

1679
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:41,000
make a virtual comic book store that's just your book so you can buy oculus rift oh no there's a

1680
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:48,760
plan there's a plan you can watch movies on the oculus rift sure yeah I mean I don't know how

1681
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,480
they're not like set up for that though it's just like a screen floating in front of you yeah

1682
01:18:53,480 --> 01:19:00,600
that you can look at like it's in 3d space but it's a 2d screen floating in front of you but

1683
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:07,240
but you can make it huge I guess you can that's like that's true how is that an improvement from

1684
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,880
real life it's not see the thing that gets me the thing that was the most disappointing about the

1685
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:18,120
oculus rift is that the the screen like the granularity of the screen is just not small enough

1686
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:24,920
and it it just doesn't feel like it never doesn't feel like I'm looking at a screen you know like

1687
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,840
you can you can tell it's a screen because you can see the pixels I can tell by some of the pixels

1688
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,760
but I haven't seen quite a few shoops in my day that's a meme well I mean be that as it may it's

1689
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:43,560
our only IRL portal to the actual rift cafe so by Christ then you need to get that fixed so we

1690
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,880
can access it please let's start talking about the music before we end up in the rift cafe

1691
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:57,240
all right all right here we go oh just a hashtag hashtag pcb themes everybody you still got at

1692
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:02,360
time of hearing this you are out of time by the time you have heard this but by the time of recording

1693
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:08,120
it you've got two days ends the 31st or the three days so uh so you will have heard this last time

1694
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,960
so you know so there you go so there you are we but we're done by the time you're hearing this but

1695
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:18,440
here's here's our here's our shit all right first one here we go it's from at pelvis esli uh what does

1696
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:24,040
you have to say uh Felix a cover of the original song by at footwear man uh might not fit the bill

1697
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:30,440
completely but I made it so listen to it god damn it uh and it's called uh pod castinator

1698
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:36,280
all right pretty good robo thing yeah like pretty good make sense and here we go

1699
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:53,800
I'm supposed to be working right now I'm supposed to be working right yeah

1700
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,800
myself

1701
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,760
I think the lyric is don't want to do yeah yeah I think it changed it up change the

1702
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,840
lyric that was nice it was nice I did not hear it because the pop was muted for me and I don't

1703
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:29,560
know why well let's fucking turn it up beige is your problem I managed I managed to like I

1704
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:35,800
managed to unmute it but like that's when it ended so I didn't hear anything I'm so sad I go back and

1705
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:41,640
listen to it and I thought that the tone was pretty pretty spot on was it an improvement the only

1706
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:47,080
problem with that one is I don't know if it's better than the one that I was gonna say is it an

1707
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:53,240
improvement on the original I'm not sure yeah I feel the same it's pretty chill I think it's a good

1708
01:21:53,240 --> 01:22:00,120
cover I definitely think that's one of the ones that like we should use first like just something

1709
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,640
for something like an outro or I don't know yeah yeah it's it's oh yeah it's definitely worth using

1710
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:12,040
for something yeah I like that a lot nice work Felix uh all right next one all right this is a

1711
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:17,080
big one this is a big one so our boy oblivion fall who's made a bunch he made those hardcore rocking

1712
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:23,400
ones oblivion yes uh uh did you guys see his tweet when he was like telling the story about his

1713
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:29,400
name that was a cool story oh you should check out the twitter van he made a little video explaining

1714
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:35,720
his name because like devu was giving him shit for it being possibly associated with scott and

1715
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:42,200
that's skyroom oblivion would I find it on the on the tpcrastinator's twitter yeah but yeah we

1716
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:48,840
retweeted it it makes him feel any better I never associated his name to any of the elder scrolls

1717
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,600
games you know so there you go when I think oblivion weirdly enough the first thing I think of is the

1718
01:22:54,600 --> 01:23:02,280
kingdom hearts keyblade that is a good one that's a good one that's the best in fact uh but so last

1719
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:09,880
week was his meme theme this week is his dream theme so damn uh this is this is an important one

1720
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,720
so let's uh get right the fuck into it wait was there any notes here he just said uh

1721
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:22,280
to hear my music played by real instruments is so surreal many thanks to at azariah and mayd for

1722
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:27,480
lending your voices and thank you sam madman for the sin is this a fucking like supergroup

1723
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:33,080
collab or something I don't know what sounds like if this is a dream come true he says holy

1724
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:38,360
shit well all right with all that said let's fucking get into it here you go oblivion

1725
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:49,400
i'm supposed to be working right now i'm supposed to be working right now but i love working

1726
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:56,120
i'm doing nothing my take i'm jerking unless i'm talking i am an asshole i am a stupid

1727
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:02,360
yeah

1728
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:09,960
um man it's been a while since i heard any brony metal but uh that took me right back yeah uh it's

1729
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:15,960
it's weird it's weird to hear it in like it's sung in such like in such like an earnest such an

1730
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:21,720
earnest way these these retarded right up bro it's a singer or something you know oh that's really

1731
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:27,400
so wait was that really he said it was real instruments but the drums did not sound real

1732
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:32,200
well maybe they weren't oh i mean maybe that part wasn't i don't know i don't know

1733
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:40,520
he said it sounded like tech drums with guitars over it it reminds me very vaguely of um the band

1734
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:49,000
slovonics slov i don't remember how it's pronounced uh oh gosh he's supposed to

1735
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,680
it just reminds me a lot of the the old ye old brony days when everyone was like making metal

1736
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:59,400
covers of the songs where it was like tech drums and just like shredding guitars with like brony

1737
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:06,280
lyrics over it you know yeah here we go okay dream theme oh by the way it was called don't

1738
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:13,160
want to do it uh it was a name i i mean that was dope as hell and i'd love to use it for something

1739
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:18,760
i just don't like it's i'm looking for a new theme you know i i mean i mean i feel like an

1740
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:24,760
asshole but that was awesome like yeah ultimately it is i don't know if heavy metal makes sense for

1741
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:31,240
this shows intro like this is not like an explosive show it's like two hours of like a bunch of people

1742
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:38,520
talking you know yeah oh man by the way i'm looking at his entry on on his soundcloud he says uh my

1743
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,920
second entry to the pcb theme competition i've been writing music for years this is the first time

1744
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,760
it's been realized with true instruments gang that's made with surreal and expensive process

1745
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:53,400
that put me wait that put me out by over two hundred dollars but it was worth it my god he's got an

1746
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:57,800
instrumental version as well what about that cost that was like a 30 second song how did that cost

1747
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,000
two hundred dollars he hired musicians to sing and stuff he hired musicians to sing and probably

1748
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,280
played guitar friends who could do that like damn i mean if you don't have friends who play music

1749
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:11,080
who play guitar or sing or something like anybody can be your friend if you give them enough money

1750
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,840
that's right he's fucking hired set musicians or some shit basically i feel like there's gotta be

1751
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,440
someone you can hire on fiverr to do that for you i mean i have paid i have paid people for

1752
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:27,400
well i mean i don't feel bad because like he got it made and we played it on the show and like we

1753
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:34,680
all like yeah so like i don't feel too bad it's i guess it's just i don't the only i don't even

1754
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,520
really want to like go on like i feel really bad it's just that like i don't think it's like the

1755
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,800
theme i'm looking for but i actually loved it and i want to use it for stuff because it was

1756
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:48,760
fucking dope okay okay question i didn't like it no well there you go he hated it um what do we

1757
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:57,480
what's the protocol okay so like how how do we go about using other like other songs from this

1758
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:04,120
contest for stuff well i mean one thought is that we use them as outro okay but can we just can we

1759
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:10,120
do that like are we allowed to do that i we did say at the very beginning that the thing was like

1760
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,880
we were playing to just use these so only submit if you're comfortable with like us using that

1761
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:19,080
stuff okay so i mean if somebody disagrees with that let me know but i'm pretty sure that i didn't

1762
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:25,480
realize those were like the explicit terms we did mention that okay we'll double check that for

1763
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:30,600
so everybody's cool but i mean yeah if you're not cool with him just let us know yeah and i mean

1764
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:39,240
yeah yeah like we'll credit the song any anytime it's used obviously certainly uh all right let me

1765
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:44,360
see here um so this guy made some variations all right next one's from love shorn at love shorn

1766
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,160
what do we got he's got old newer newest okay this is kind of weird he sent like a bunch of versions

1767
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:54,920
of this song i guess uh but here's craston eight and three let's let's see how it goes let's see

1768
01:27:54,920 --> 01:28:05,160
how it goes boom oh shit this is fucking metroid shit going on yeah

1769
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,120

1779
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,720
this part of it i've never vibed with anything before this song just makes me want to make a

1780
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:28,840
metroid clone and then put the song in it i'm i'm pausing i'm making the exact oh come on weak

1781
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:33,480
i would i mean i liked it i liked it i'm looking at the audio waveform of the soundcloud and it's

1805
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:11,400
strong strong contender yeah that was really strong right there it delivered on the title for

1806
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:19,560
sure okay but like that's true you guys did say you didn't want heavy metal i would consider that

1807
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:26,600
to be hardcore punk which is much more the aesthetic of uh i like i like i think i've said this before

1808
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:33,160
but i like that it's got it's got original lyrics that are like about the show yeah and i like i dig

1809
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:38,840
that right i dig i just like that it has that really rough aesthetic which is more like to do

1810
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:44,200
like the cleaned up like tech drums or all the the electro like we've gotten a lot of electronic

1811
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:50,280
music and i just don't really feel like that matches the tone of what this show is which

1812
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:55,880
is like a bunch of people who make outsider fucking weird abrasive art you know yeah yeah

1813
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,400

1836
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:35,800
whatever it was figure out we've got we've got some good questions in here uh we do we actually i

1837
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:40,920
i want to start with giffy's because i'm interested in hearing you guys's response uh does someone

1838
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:47,880
being an artist automatically make their criticism more valuable in your eyes no no absolutely not

1839
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,080
100 no you could be okay you know what artist i mean the fleet and utter retard it's totally the whole

1840
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:58,200
picture that i would say the inverse that someone not being an artist doesn't make their criticism

1841
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:04,440
less valuable but like being an artist or whatever like it could imply that you just have more information

1842
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:10,200
and inside than like you know if they're a good if they're a really good artist i might be more

1843
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:14,520
inclined to believe that they know what they're talking about okay but like it depends on if i

1844
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:19,400
agree with the criticism yeah yeah you know like criticism right if you're talking about like i think

1845
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:26,360
that like criticism is subjective i mean an artist a fellow artist might criticize something

1846
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:33,480
and then i might take advice on how to change it like like maybe this artist could advise me on like

1847
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:38,120
technique right because this person might know about technique but the fact that he knows techniques

1848
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:42,920
that might be involved in this do they don't make his opinion about it more valid they don't

1849
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:49,560
they don't make him more qualified to say that he does or does not like it yeah like as well like

1850
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,440
it depends really like if you have a vision or everything you really want to do and the artist

1851
01:36:54,440 --> 01:37:00,680
is unaware of that and he might advise against it and and you know like for instance like ben said

1852
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,680
like you know he printed it in black and white and that's that was his vision that's the way he

1853
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:09,480
did it on purpose but then like some artists can come around and say like oh don't do it in

1854
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:14,280
black and white that's you know bad or something you know maybe this is a little bit of a tangent

1855
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:18,680
but i just like i think this has been on my mind a little bit you and i think tom as well but i've

1856
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:25,800
definitely seen you liking posts like this what is the deal with the protect like the protectiveness

1857
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:32,520
around like people drawing your oc's like doing shit that like you wouldn't canonically have like

1858
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:37,960
i don't understand the world that this is coming from i've never retweeted anything like i don't

1859
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:43,320
remember no okay okay oh that's some bullshit okay maybe didn't retweet but i saw it liked i've seen

1860
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:48,600
this many times which is why i'm bringing it up no like this protectiveness of oc's no no no the

1861
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:55,720
only thing i like to retweet in regards to art is about art theft that that's i don't about oc's

1862
01:37:55,720 --> 01:38:00,600
like i got i swear was today this was fucking today i saw that you had liked a post that's

1863
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:07,160
well if you just don't agree then fair enough i've been playing a tale of two towns harvest moon

1864
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:12,760
all day i i don't know what you're talking about okay maybe this was yesterday but okay mage the

1865
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:19,080
real point is do you have a problem with someone drawing one of your oc's doing something you

1866
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:25,960
didn't want them to do um how about having sex for example that seems like an obvious one

1867
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:33,400
hold on let me think about this is like the thing is like it's it's i've been sort of on the fence

1868
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:38,760
about this thing and that's why i'm sure i never liked or retweeted anything because i don't have

1869
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:45,560
like a very solid opinion about this oh on one hand i don't really mind but on the other hand

1870
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:51,960
like if it's for instance like my character mage right and she's meant to be me and someone draws

1871
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:58,280
her having sex with their sona that's gonna creep me out like oh hell but if they just do like

1872
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:04,520
i guess that makes sense but if they just you know draw like a tasteful lude of my oc which

1873
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:10,280
actually has happened once like it was yeah i saw that yeah it was i loved it it was it was great

1874
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,680
the art was fantastic i really like how they drew the back i know it's very weird but i like the

1875
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:20,680
detail on the back name backs are hard to draw are the nate are you maybe thinking of this thing

1876
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:26,360
mage retweeted it and it is a thing about like don't trace people's art and don't don't post

1877
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:31,880
trace no no no no okay i mean i saw that too that's a very different thing uh and i mean

1878
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,840
you know that was kind of an interesting question too people were going back and forth on that like

1879
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:41,080
somebody had done i guess just since we mentioned it somebody had drawn like a picture of uravity

1880
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:46,440
from from my her academia and then like i retweeted that one that's right that was a different one

1881
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,680
but nonetheless and then somebody had done like you get they took a picture of their drawings they

1882
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:57,000
had definitely by the way well sure sure but somebody had just like probably traced but they

1883
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,880
say that they freehand drew and you could see it was on a piece of paper like the exact same image

1884
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:07,320
you can't print out the original image and trace over it by putting a new sheet of paper on top of

1885
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:13,480
it well don't yeah what if she did what if they did freehand draw it what if they didn't act what if

1886
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:17,320
they didn't literally trace because she did they did credit the original they absolutely did say

1887
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:22,760
they credit the thing was nobody believed that she drew it freehand for first of all as permission

1888
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:28,280
yeah like it's so one-on-two one that like it doesn't matter that you freehanded at that point

1889
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:34,600
if you could have freehand if you have the ability to freehand it like that then why copy it one

1890
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:42,360
for one like no see i think that it doesn't make any difference whether they traced it or freehanded

1891
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:48,280
honestly uh because i mean they're still drawing it they're still recreating something else's art

1892
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:54,360
but i don't know i don't i mean i think if you say like yeah this is a recreation of this art

1893
01:40:54,360 --> 01:41:00,120
like what more do you want like what what the specific the specific criticism the the person

1894
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:05,880
the person credited with they said like reference at this person they said that it was a reference

1895
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:11,320
that's not like a trick that's good enough no that's not no i've been i'm gonna fight you i'm

1896
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:17,960
gonna punch you no if they say reference at this and you look at that and it is like the exact same

1897
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:28,280
image well like duh like duh that's not a reference that's like copying is there anything

1898
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:34,040
different about this image that you guys are talking about and you can see that it's the same

1899
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:41,160
image it is a it is an admission that yeah i copied this image but they see reference that's the thing

1900
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:47,480
but they copied it entirely the reference that made me so cement exactly is your poli please

1901
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:51,960
articulate your particular grievance made just so i understand what don't you like about that okay

1902
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:57,400
a reference is like you take something and you and you just like build upon it it's kind of like a

1903
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:01,720
base like i don't know how to draw a hand i look at a picture of a hand it's like oh okay so that's

1904
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,040
that's like that's specific pose of a hand that i want to draw and then i draw it myself but it

1905
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:11,320
looks different it looks in my style it's it's mine now like i just looked at it for reference to

1906
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:17,320
see how a hand looks like that's a reference maybe a pose or something like that like if you if you

1907
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:22,680
put like those pictures next to each other you can see the differences you can see them like oh yes

1908
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:28,760
it's been referenced but the artist has made it entirely their own thing that's fine that's a reference

1909
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:33,880
i'm actually not against tracing when it's done for like when you're trying to practice and stuff

1910
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:39,560
i used to do that too sure but you don't post it and be and put your watermark on it i don't

1911
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:44,440
know mage would if you if you if this person had said that they traced the image exactly they said

1912
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:51,160
a reference if it said traced would that still be a problem yes but no it's one to one copy of the

1913
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:55,480
drawing and i have issues with it like what are people not allowed to build upon it and made it

1914
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:01,240
their own i would have not had so much like me i'm saying that's crazy it's crazy i don't i gotta just

1915
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:05,800
profit involved in this in any way because like they did they got a lot of likes they got a lot of

1916
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:11,240
likes yeah more so than the original one well that's not their fault that's true that's not their fault

1917
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:16,440
yeah i mean i would blame the consumer base for that but like in the age of social media it's like

1918
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:26,120
sure sure i just i don't think it makes any sense let time speak i was just gonna say i was just

1919
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:31,560
gonna say you had like renaissance master she did studies and copied paintings verbatim

1920
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:36,600
i'm like baby that was a known thing to do so if this person admitted that like this is a study and

1921
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,960
they essentially said that because i linked back to the original it's the same thing i don't see any

1922
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:46,360
issue there it's just like yeah i copied this i'm you know if they have okay the person the person

1923
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:50,280
said very specifically that they referenced and people challenged them they're like whoa you clearly

1924
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:55,400
traced this and the person's like they said no i did not trace this i drew this my and maybe they

1925
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:00,200
were lying but they said no i told i totally believe that they freehanded it i don't think it

1926
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:07,080
makes okay okay i need to have to i'll need to i'll need to take the both images and then like

1927
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:13,560
look at them and and like layer them over one for one to see because like i just don't agree with

1928
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:20,360
your i do not believe in the ability to freehand it so what what why well there's people who do that i

1929
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:25,000
mean there's people who sell counterfeits of like you know famous paintings who literally

1930
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:29,800
can just recreate them because it's just about studying the the i mean people it's about studying

1931
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:35,080
what they did and then just doing it again i mean people can do like photo realistic sketches by like

1932
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:41,000
using a photo reference and they can sketch it with like perfect photo accuracy well if they had

1933
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,480
that such talent then why copy someone else's it's because it's a totally different skill set

1934
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:53,080
you know it's like saying oh you can copy a photograph perfectly well why copy the photograph

1935
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:57,480
because the entire point is to copy the photograph yeah well then copy the fucking

1936
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:02,680
i don't know i i'm just i'm having issues with taking someone else's art and recreating it

1937
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:08,840
like i like one for one if it was built upon if it was made different i would argue that very much

1938
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:14,520
so okay i i think that okay i think that the recreation is worse than the original but i

1939
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,800
think you could argue that it did build upon it because it like it's colored differently right

1940
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:25,240
oh jeez it's a little bit okay so they made the colors i mean that's no different from like

1941
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:30,360
just taking a meme and giving it a new caption like you're just it's just the same art that you've

1942
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:35,080
been like an EU is trying to criminalize memes because they're copyright violations Jesus Christ

1943
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:40,280
is that true yeah that's true yeah oh fuck the EU all right let's move on to the next question

1944
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:46,760
uh all right all right mage uh you've been thoroughly dabbed on uh okay okay like i i i do

1945
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:53,960
want to say like okay guys i do see your point however i it's it's it's something that we don't

1946
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:59,320
have time to thoroughly discuss but i i do see your point so i'll i'll give you that much mage i i

1947
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:03,160
think i i more or less understand where you're coming from and i feel a similar sort of like a

1948
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:07,640
version like why don't you just draw something new but i i struggle to find any particular infraction

1949
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:13,880
yeah i just i guess i guess like if i saw someone else doing this to my art i would i would feel

1950
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:20,120
devastated honestly i if if i just feel like i feel like this person got less likes it would not

1951
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:25,160
be a problem but if someone sold yeah if someone was trying to sell a copy of my art i would be

1952
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:32,760
upset like is it like permission if i i would i would i would i would have absolutely no issue

1953
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:38,760
if they had permission and the artist was okay with them doing that then you know then that's

1954
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:45,240
then that's personally that that's the artist is it you know stands and i'm not gonna you know

1955
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:50,760
tell them how to think or is it is it kind of is it kind of sad and maybe frustrating that you

1956
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:55,640
know this this copier got you know so much more recognition for their copy than the original

1957
01:46:55,640 --> 01:47:02,120
did yeah but i don't that's not even my issue but i don't think they did anything wrong i just i

1958
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:07,160
can't nothing that what's done anyway the next question is from Kajorah Bitterthorn

1959
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:13,320
and it is how's your next big project shaping up on track or hit a snag cough please how they

1960
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:20,760
marketed ETA uh how they market it is is episode one's like basically done like uh it's just i have

1961
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:28,120
to add in certain shit and it is just not a financially viable decision to finish that video

1962
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:34,680
right now i know where you're at dog i feel you big time because there's like the how they marketed

1963
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:41,880
series was basically developed way back when i was after i made how uh we have accepted mediocrity

1964
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:47,560
and i was on my like oh i'm gonna make some big huge epic thing that's like world stopping but like

1965
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:52,680
the thing is it will be niches fuck and most people will not give a shit about it like it's

1966
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:58,120
gonna be something that is mostly appealing to me and even though the first episode is like mostly

1967
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,720
done so i mean i will wrap it'll probably come out you know it'll it'll definitely come out in

1968
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:08,680
august at the very least but like as an overall arcing project i already explained all of the like

1969
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:14,520
emotional and relevant details that like people will really resonate with in uh the gecko estate

1970
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,920
episode four everything is devil man like i explained the whole fucking point of the series in that

1971
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:27,960
video so like i just think that for for the sake of me making money at all and like making videos

1972
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,400
that people actually want me to make and that will get any views it how they market is just not a

1973
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:40,760
priority in that situation what's good to know but uh shinsa kai yori i just did a whole fuck wrote a

1974
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,840
just recorded a 35 minute video on and sent it to devue so that's the next big project oh yes

1975
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:53,400
oh yeah oh yeah ben go ahead well uh my next project uh well so endless war is a big thing but

1976
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:59,320
at this point in development it's kind of out of my hands and so i have kind of stepped back from

1977
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:03,720
that and that's just going to be ready whenever it's ready uh so i've been working on vapors three

1978
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:08,680
and that's coming along uh i was kind of i had kind of stepped back from that for a while but i'm

1979
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:13,640
ben you need to do something there's something you have to do uh to make endless war good and

1980
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:20,280
monetizable you 100% need to first of all you need to start using the cop killer and the rowdy

1981
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:25,800
fucker like logos in places because like i can't find them anywhere and it it annoys me that they're

1982
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:30,360
not they don't feel real yet they don't feel real we don't really have official logos like the ones

1983
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:38,120
that exist were made by like people in the community like we didn't make well that's all right okay well

1984
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:42,440
what you need to do is you need to iron those out and hammer them down i like the one that you have

1985
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:46,040
is your just top background that's pretty sick yeah but i didn't make whatever i didn't make it

1986
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:52,040
okay but whatever it is make one so that i can buy a t-shirt of it and wear it ben so you can

1987
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:57,400
monetize this shit and make money making shirts fucking munchie had to go on vacation he like

1988
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:03,480
he did yeah he did like he was like hey i'm finally making shirts and i was like okay cool and he

1989
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:09,240
and he was like okay i did some sketches like i did some really rough versions of these shirts

1990
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:14,600
okay now before i finish them by i'm going to italy for two weeks like well that was great

1991
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:22,360
unfortunately yeah so so yeah like obviously we need to start selling merch uh obviously um i just

1992
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:28,120
i want so badly an iRL meetup of people wearing cop killer shirts people wearing rowdy fucker

1993
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:33,480
shirts and street warfare i wanted so bad for iRL meetups right there was a thing in there for a

1994
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:38,920
while there was a map that people could enter their their their locations into you know roughly

1995
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,640
we were looking at like where the populations were clustered turned out it was this shitty

1996
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:47,880
this shitty service that like after a hundred page views was like locked and it was like you

1997
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:52,520
had to buy a subscription to look so that was a oh that was a complete bust those garbage and it

1998
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:57,720
really pissed me off but you know if we got clusters of people around certain cities i was

1999
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:05,000
imagining like meetups where that are like okay like we choose a location in like a city and like

2000
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,880
it's okay if you're in this meetup sign up and like show a picture of yourself and what you're

2001
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:16,440
going to wear and the the conceit is that killers and rowdies converge on this location and it is

2002
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:23,000
then a race to take a picture of people on the other team and once someone has had their picture

2003
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:30,040
taken and posted on the discord there they've been shot and they're dead and okay it sounds like you're

2004
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:34,680
copying the idea from touch and never falls in love i don't know what the fuck that is it's an

2005
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:42,200
anime well it's a cute idea okay cool uh so yeah it would be like it would be like gang warfare you

2006
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:46,280
show up you like you'd have to be dressed accordingly and the idea is you take a picture of someone

2007
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:50,200
and post it and that means they're dead and then they can't kill anyone and it's just like which

2008
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:57,560
team can kill the other uh i don't know it sounds pretty cool in my head well whatever it is i want

2009
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:03,080
more and everyone wear fucking official shirts and there will be official shirts soon because

2010
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:08,600
it's stupid that there aren't already i want one real real bad all that is to say that i've been

2011
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:20,760
working on vapors three fantastic uh i'm happy to announce uh my new jaguar is literally seconds

2012
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:26,360
from being done in the editing bay and it'll be out this very day of recording so by everybody

2013
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:32,440
hearing it next big project coming is what this is a pretty big project but uh to that point okay

2014
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:37,000
i'll what i'll say is this i have restructured my life to prioritize getting out big projects not

2015
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,520
just we aguas in answer to people's concerns okay uh and there you go so you know working on

2016
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:47,960
right eric c bass says how many wait what about mage and tom i don't know if they have any big

2017
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,520
projects at the moment do you do you guys talked about my big project we had a whole like half an hour

2018
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:58,520
discussion i don't know about it you're what i would describe as tom's big project would at best

2019
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:05,640
be at easiest be a year and a half away i'd imagine oh god sure but i have other big projects that

2020
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:11,240
are building up to that big project i guess yeah tell us okay all right um i want to make a button

2021
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:15,320
i'm just going to start getting into game dev because i do all this low poly 3d shit the whole

2022
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:20,520
makes sense is that it's just going to make games that look like PlayStation 2 games and have like

2023
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:27,640
the aesthetic of like low poly mascot stuff like ratchet and clank mashed with like uh the edge of

2024
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:32,280
like new grounds as cartoons and stuff like with your your little ninja koon yeah koon i believe

2025
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:38,600
this is his name exactly you got it sick so it's a she but right right i'm gonna make some short

2026
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:44,200
little animation with her doesn't her name some japs shit yeah she's some some tatsumaki hitzubishi

2027
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:50,520
honda tatoyama yeah something like that her name's mitzubishi greatest character of all time uh the

2028
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:57,480
best but no uh just just working on i do like on learning more 3d stuff i was i keep it's interesting

2029
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:01,320
because i keep like i was watching a gaming brit video yesterday because did you like you should

2030
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:05,960
watch the gaming brit and then i marathoned all his videos he's literally my taste in gaming

2031
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:10,120
i'm like that's true that's true this is my guy so uh i was watching something that was a shock

2032
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:15,800
never seen him since he's literally been on the pcp and we're friends i heard of him and i just

2033
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:20,760
never got around to do because i don't watch like review videos anymore like at all sure but then

2034
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:25,320
then i got dragged back into it so i watched all i mean i just been watching gaming brits for longer

2035
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:30,280
than i've known of any of you is the funny thing you know i guess i guess i just missed the bone

2036
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:34,680
i'm sorry gaming brit uh i've made it up i've given you tons of ad revenue the last three days

2037
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,640
nice so i was watching one of his videos on ratchet and clank and i noticed like i was looking at

2038
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:43,000
like the ground because like every time i look at playstation 2 games i'm kind of like deconstruct

2039
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
them now i noticed the ground plane had like repeating tile textures for the grass but then

2040
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,240
i had like random patches of dirt like i wonder how they did that so it took like three hours i

2041
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:56,440
figured out how to do it and i put us as a gift of it of it working just like a mask in like other

2042
01:54:56,440 --> 01:55:00,520
patches of a different texture on the same material and it was fucking sick and it felt like a god

2043
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:08,600
tom tom one criticism on your work uh sorry ben it's just uh uh mitsubishi the raccoon uh her the

2044
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:13,320
problem with her is that she doesn't have enough gender signifiers might i suggest a big hunk and

2045
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:18,600
pair of titties that's my that's my helpful suggestion okay i gotta get the porn artist

2046
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:25,560
something i wanted to ask so so you did some of the modeling on the uh run away from snakes pump

2047
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:31,160
game right i did pump yes you you okay you just did the character model i did the character of

2048
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:39,080
okay did you do like her animations or i i did not i was i said that i could because i i didn't

2049
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:43,480
even rig rig the character because i was talking hippo about it like like almost two months before

2050
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:46,920
the game came out and i was like do you want me to like rig it up or anything is like just make

2051
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,240
the model and like they were going to take care of everything else i'm like okay so it was pretty

2052
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:58,680
simple to do on an unrelated note where i have a shot glass of my urine here and i am going to dip

2053
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:04,600
my keto stick as we speak and i will tell you and i in about 15 seconds i will tell you all the

2054
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:09,720
results when did you produce this i look i went to the bathroom i have my wireless headphones in

2055
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:15,560
god oh my god shot glass i'm glad i'm glad i'm glad to piss in the pcb yeah munchie not here someone

2056
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:23,480
else is carrying on the piss leg you could pronounce the pcb yeah it is i guess so oh no guys

2057
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:30,120
it's not as purple as last time oh god i would i would i would call it a medium pink

2058
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:37,240
oh god well it's over it's all over and i don't understand why if you were on keto you would

2059
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:43,160
ever consume any carbs whatsoever well you don't well i mean i mean i'll eat like peanut butter

2060
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:48,520
which has like a couple grams in it and that's yeah it's tough to avoid yeah like you know veggies

2061
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:54,600
you know you just keep it really uh listen to listen to this question though this is from

2062
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:00,840
spicy salts in the in the discord uh who says i'm trying to make a video game called ultratopia

2063
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:07,480
but i have no talent skill or patience to make it any tips kill yourself stop i think he has the

2064
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:13,320
he has the name and nothing else is what i'm understanding i mean no talent no skill no

2065
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:20,920
patience get fucked dude get fucked well somebody else responded with the the the even better answer

2066
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:26,360
which is find people who have those and pay them a lot of money that makes it well i'm assuming he's

2067
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:33,240
probably doesn't have money either i'm i'm god that's a fair breaking suspicion either get money

2068
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:37,400
or get those other skills he said you don't have that's what i'm working on not not having not

2069
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:42,440
having the patience is what is what tells me that this is a lost cause yeah i got to start

2070
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
something dude you gotta get your headspace in a better place patience is is crucial to this

2071
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:52,760
you're playing a long game here buddy is a long game so uh eric seabass asks how many days before

2072
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:59,720
you die do you plan to stop making art and start enjoying life uh literally the moment i get rich

2073
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:05,960
i will not oh my god i mean jesus fucking christ you'll you'll get bored though you'll get bored

2074
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:10,520
what okay right it'll take a while for me to get bored if i have everybody if you live to be

2075
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:16,280
fucking 80 and you get bored at 60 that's quite a few years of terrible life i don't need money for

2076
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:22,440
anything all i need to do is live all yeah all i need to do is continue to exist so that i can

2077
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:27,640
continue to produce shit this this this guy's question has it all wrong making the art is enjoying

2078
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:32,440
life this is what i want to do exactly that was what my first thought was like at first i was like

2079
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:36,360
oh i'm gonna give the answer that like all i want to do is make art but then i was like

2080
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:43,320
actually i just want to eat and fuck all day jesus christ and like go to cool places you discuss

2081
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:49,160
i i i understand that i literally don't care about those things and we'll be happy to give them up

2082
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:54,760
forever for more productivity uh because i'm a machine that loves to work and nothing else i like

2083
01:58:56,360 --> 01:59:02,120
thank you i mean uh i like eating i like eating's boring eating's boring and you know what

2084
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:07,320
fucking's boring what are you what how can i'm post food i'm post food i'm ordering

2085
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:11,960
humor whatever it's called right now fuel fuel it's human fuel i mean that's a bit short

2086
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:20,840
exactly if i if i these macros look great i think that if i didn't have to actually produce art i would

2087
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:27,480
be content to just imagine art oh god you know like i can just sit around the thrill of the chase

2088
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:32,120
dude the thrill of the chase of of of worrying on the project and pursuing it whatever about

2089
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:38,840
it to me to me getting it done is just like when i've had the idea that's the big come it's like

2090
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:44,520
oh i just had an amazing idea and then it's like one of the come and then it's like oh god damn it

2091
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:49,000
now i have to somehow translate that into something that enough people will understand that i can make

2092
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,960
a living off of it i'm not trying to say that like for example like i i mean because for me the

2093
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:59,880
second come is releasing it and like having people react i suppose if i was rich enough i maybe i

2094
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:05,000
still would produce art it would just all be incomprehensible the idea is getting a bonus

2095
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:10,760
making it is the calm oh well i yeah i'm not that's true i'm not trying to say that like i think

2096
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:15,960
there's anything like morally better about like releasing something like i still i you know just

2097
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:20,760
a fucking machine that has inputs and outputs and you know it makes me feel good to get positive

2098
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:25,000
comments and upvotes and whatnot so like i'm not saying it's like better but like that is a that is

2099
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,680
a very valuable part of life that i i just think engaging in that will keep me healthy and happy

2100
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:35,560
long term yeah more than not doing that well let me let me rephrase it because i'm at a point in

2101
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:43,000
my life right now where i'm not as interested in being an artist as i am in like what i could

2102
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,720
like like something that i could do that would be bigger than art than like i really want to

2103
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:53,400
just build a city so like if i made enough money that i didn't have to do art and i could just

2104
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:58,440
build shit or just like hire people to like shape i just want enough money to shape the world

2105
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:04,840
you know what i mean like like like yeah sure so i feel like with art that's a way to convince

2106
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:10,040
people that they should shape the world but with money you just can do it you could just be like

2107
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:14,760
hey i'm gonna build the like hey this thing that that i made all this art telling people that they

2108
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:19,640
should like do this i'm just gonna well make that happen i mean if that's what you want to do it's

2109
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:24,760
time to stop making youtube videos and start getting into the stock market or something i mean i want

2110
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:30,600
to do it i only want to get rich on my own terms though how is how is playing the stock market

2111
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:35,400
okay rich on your own terms because i don't want to have to learn about stocks then you're

2112
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:39,960
fucking lazy you're the exact same problem that other guy does then i have all these great ideas

2113
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:46,120
but no patience and no talent well except i have talent and skill it's just not in the stock market

2114
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:50,280
it's in making youtube videos okay but if you if you have a goal that that's not going to serve that

2115
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:55,400
you either need to change your goal or change your skills serve that goal tom what if i can find a

2116
02:01:55,400 --> 02:02:00,680
way to make youtube videos make me absurdly rich uh i mean you're not gonna get you're not gonna

2117
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:06,840
make cities off of youtube videos i mean i think we don't know that you don't know even even like

2118
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:11,240
cutie pie you just gotta change the paradigm okay i was gonna like you know you okay nobody's

2119
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:16,040
gonna you're taking you're taking people around about options to your goal at this point yeah i agree

2120
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:22,520
let's say that i okay there are definitely like never mind youtube itself think of it as think of

2121
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:27,160
youtube as a jumping off point for just being an artist in general much in the same way that like

2122
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:32,840
celebrities might star in a movie that makes them famous but because they are famous now they just

2123
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:38,200
have an endless sea of opportunity before them so like and they usually you know a lot of them

2124
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:42,520
end up doing these like high-level ventures and shit because they just start reinvesting the money

2125
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:47,320
they already have and you can just pay people to invest your money for you you know like you can

2126
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:52,600
literally when you have money money is a self-propagating machine yes it is just something that you

2127
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:58,200
decide how much you want and then you just you know just operate that paradigm that will that

2128
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:04,120
will make that happen but you need a basic it's a constant redistribution it's constantly like

2129
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:09,080
assessing the money you have figuring out what you can do with that money to get more money and then

2130
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:15,960
continually putting that in but like to do that in the early days is just boring and gay and it's

2131
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:20,920
all like i gotta buy stocks and like i want to be past that point before i even worry about it

2132
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:27,240
like i want to make as much as i can through just being an artist and then once i'm like semi like

2133
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:31,560
new rich from being an artist that's when it's like i hire an account and and then i just like

2134
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:37,800
tell them hey put my money in whatever stocks seem good you know and like so yeah that's that's

2135
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:43,080
my methodology here that's sort of my my theory behind all this good luck you maybe you should

2136
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:51,160
have got a cheaper house well i'm saying it would i mean that's like a real short-term problem you

2137
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:57,080
know relatively speaking i mean if your goal is to achieve a critical mass of money then you

2138
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:03,800
gotta scrimp well scrimp right whatever right am i crazy here no i don't know where you're going

2139
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:08,280
up with that theory i i mean the less money you spend the more you have but like we're talking

2140
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:12,920
about degrees here well the point of it is that you should always be astronomically increasing

2141
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:18,520
your intake of wealth like it should never be a matter of like i have to save money it should

2142
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:23,960
always just be like if i need more money i just need to make more money you know okay you know

2143
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:28,280
yeah okay you don't want to get lost up in that i mean you can lose yourself in the pursuit of

2144
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:32,760
money but uh oh yeah but that's the that's why i don't want to go into the stock market that to

2145
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:37,320
me is losing fair enough you know yeah okay doing it doing it on your own terms as long as it's

2146
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:42,520
always just whatever you're comfortable with it's like you know i like like i said earlier it's

2147
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:47,240
possible to be in the youtube analysis game or whatever and then also lose yourself that is

2148
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:53,320
monetization or whatnot i do not care about money i've seen it happen at all i do not care about

2149
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:59,800
changing the world at all i care about operating within this world and succeeding in it with my own

2150
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:07,880
effort and my own my own two hands and i am glad to be an artist because that is a profession

2151
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:14,840
that i feel i can continue to do in a way that is you know you know fun and engaging and in a

2152
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:19,720
way that i can do it on my own terms right up until i dropped it yeah and that's what i want

2153
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:26,120
uh i just basically agree i just want to you know i i feel like it'll never it'll i'll never be

2154
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:33,160
i don't ever have to become completely obsolete i hope yeah i pray i i consider it my personal

2155
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:40,440
mission to to when i die to be able to look back and say i brought us one step closer to escaping

2156
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:46,760
entropy that's the best case scenario i'd say uh speaking of which i think all of us i think all

2157
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:51,320
of us have already made contributions to that end so you know i generally are all absorbed in my book

2158
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:57,480
well all right but speaking of entropy uh please look at this image that i put in the thing because

2159
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:01,560
i'm having massive second thoughts about getting this huel because of the sheer propensity of

2160
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:06,280
soy boys that are that are operating with this huel thing look at this guy on the on the second

2161
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:14,200
from the top right that's all i see in this picture it ironically it is the non-soil alternative

2162
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:19,720
and yet we're faced with a with a with a tire a wall of soy boys i don't know look look mate we

2163
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:23,800
gotta take it back clearly these people we do it you know what you're right you're right all right

2164
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:28,280
i'm still on board i'm still on board we'll do this together you you're more than me you'll be the

2165
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:32,600
poster child i'll be the one in the background adding numbers holy shit right two hours ten

2166
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:41,720
all right everybody uh the patreon uh yeah p-lash some say oh someone asked pro crass maybe no

2167
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:47,320
there was a question about whether we would ever introduce more reward tiers to the pro pcp uh

2168
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:52,680
oh yeah that was from uh i don't know what do you guys want that's they tell us that's a great

2169
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:57,560
question that's a great question actually yeah tell us what you would like to pay more money for

2170
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:02,440
and don't say more content as long as the answer is not more content give us an answer what if

2171
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:06,520
we uh like to be able to hear these live when they're recording them you know here's a really

2172
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:12,600
fucking simple solution i don't know what what if we like had a tech scroll of patrons during the

2173
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:19,000
an outro song i mean if that's what they want i just want to know like what do you guys like

2174
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,360
from what do you like to pay a lot of money for that is not more content or even what would you

2175
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:31,320
pay a little money for if you're not paying a little money already if you're a patron put in

2176
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:35,880
the suggestions bar in the discord you know and if you're not a patron tell us what we would you

2177
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:39,960
push you over the edge that's the important part that's the that's the big money right yeah because

2178
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:44,120
because we've been edging you this whole time and we really just want to push you right over that
