00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:19,120
guy ever. Today we're joined by Goblins 1 through 4 and I'm here to slay them all. Goblin

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:29,840
1, aka Ben Goblin. What do goblins sound like in goblin slayer? I haven't uh, I don't partake

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,840
I don't partake of the eastern of the eastern scrolls. Yeah, no one knows. Hippo goblin. Ben,

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
that SFX that just came out of your mouth is like point for point like exactly the same

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,560
as the goblin like noise in the Jimmy Neutron video game that I reviewed. Exactly that.

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:06,320
Little Aurora goblin. I am the purple one. And Tom Gobliver. My parents fucked up my name

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,200
really bad. Doesn't work at all. Nate, I'm here, I'm gonna collapse a cave on you all,

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,200
you're all dead. I am the goblin slayer, that's what I do. Nate. There it is. Nate. Here we

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:37,600
are. Nate. Yeah. Nate. What? Chicken butt. Do you remember as kids on our dad's computer running

11
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:51,280
Windows 3.11 for work groups? Do you remember a game called Dark Castle?

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Not just from that. It was a black and white game. It was like a side scrolling kind of like

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,640
puzzle adventure and it was like you go into a dark castle right and it's like you know screen

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,840
after screen of like things to do in this dark castle and you know it was way too hard for a

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,640
kid like I could I could not figure it out but you know you you would go into a new room and

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,320
sometimes there'd be like bats and you could like you could pick up rocks and you could throw them

17
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,560
the control it was it was like tank controls to the to the nth degree it was like first person

18
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,520
this is no no no no it was like it was like a you were a little man in sort of a side scroll

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,680
I don't know kind of every screen had its own perspective but anyway I just bring it up because

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,440
I remember there was one screen where there were these little like goblins running around

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,120
and they would and you would have to throw rocks at them to knock them out and they would make a

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,920
sound like I recognize that sound not because of the Jimmy Neutron thing although it's similar

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,840
it's because AVGN reviewed Dark Castle and he and he got it right that's right he did he did

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,360
and it was an incredible blast from the past because yeah yeah yeah I mentioned guys I've

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
actually been getting into AVGN recently but specifically I watched one of his game reviews

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,360
but the rest of it was just all his like monster madness movie compilation reviews those have been

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,200
great those are pretty good times and whatnot yeah those are so good I should get back to

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,800
a fucking like he like knows about movies you guys he like knows about like makes them and

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,880
everything it's fucking crazy childhood is thinking AVGN is funny adulthood is realizing

30
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,560
that it's all about Bored James no it's terrible no it's the truth Bored James is very funny

31
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm looking at his review of Dark Castle right now and this looks vaguely familiar

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
that's the best I got it's the best I got it's like he's taking you back to your past

33
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
hey speaking of getting taken back to the past it's almost to play to play shitty games that

34
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,960
suck ass yeah yeah yeah yeah uh uh my mom came to visit uh as made famous by the last episode of

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,160
Shackles for heckles yeah I hate you how how do you how did that how did that go like okay so so I

36
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,040
could not I could not fucking believe you pulled that shit Ben and team was kind of great Shackles

37
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,000
for heckles so always tune in you never know what's gonna happen it was it was well it was it was

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,600
munchy and hippo and I jumped in a little late um for for TF2 yeah and I came in to chastise Ben

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,040
for being late releasing the pcp episode and uh and I had his mother our mother on deck to yell at

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,240
him for being late that's fucking incredible like it was great I like I couldn't I I did not expect

41
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,840
to actually be her so like I was expecting you to have like Michelle do a voice or something

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,800
or something like but no I was like oh my god

43
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,000
hippo hippo when like did you accidentally invite Byte instead of Ben to TF2 that time

44
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,080
oh no I was doing it as a meme for like five minutes oh like we need Byte on the team like

45
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,360
he's in an integral part oh yeah he's he's a machine he's just one of the people who was on

46
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
my friends list I was just like you have Byte on your team friends list uh yeah from like

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,320
way a long time ago huh hey well so the reason I bring up my mom is because there's a topic uh

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,120
that I want to bring up related to that uh if you guys just seize the day on that um uh here it is

49
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,760
it's uh uh it's it's how desperately I want to make my parents proud of me is is the topic

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,920
I guess I guess making your parents proud or making proud of your boy I'll make you proud

51
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,480
of your boy that's what I feel like all the time and I know Munchie and I I think talked about this

52
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,320
on an episode previously but just having her around was so nice and so great and I so desperately

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,360
want to make my parents proud of me uh this is such a major motivation in my life alien concept

54
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,920
you're talking about to me right now that I can't even relate at all well that's interesting too

55
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,320
all right I have I have thoughts maybe because my parents literally dab on your parents and

56
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,560
no like that probably I just I just I have like I guess I have a similar related motivation I just

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,160
want to stick it to my parents okay that's okay I feel like those are two sides of the same coins

58
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,880
it really is it's just like it comes from a position of lover brutal hatred uh which is where

59
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm coming from I have a lot of gratitude but again what were you saying well I was saying like

60
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,960
I have like I I know the feeling but I also like I have had the bad experience of that where like

61
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,640
trying to make my parents proud was like like a thing that fucked me up in school because I tried

62
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,640
really hard but I was really depressed and they didn't understand because I never talked about it

63
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,920
and it was and it was because I was trying so hard to make them happy and then they said

64
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,680
but we want you to be happy and I was like oh okay you know like I was I was severely fucked up in

65
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
the head and that like has ruined my my whole childhood and like I never really talked about it

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,720
like that so like and now having gone through that I I don't necessarily want to make them unhappy

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,920
I don't hate you know but like I'm I'm more like for me and then I guess yeah that's very

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,720
understandable um I mean that's what parents want right they want their kid to be happy well they

69
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
want them to be happy but I mean I talk about this and I think about this a lot it's like like I

70
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,200
want to do the things I want to do in life but I want to like make them feel not worried and

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,760
like content I just got I don't know what what changed at some point I just became so focused on

72
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,560
like wanting my parents to be happy with what I'm doing and you know what I say that but then like

73
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,640
I call them fairly rarely they're just like it's like a daemon in my mind you know my my desire

74
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,840
to make my parents proud I mean is that like a societal thing like you said I wouldn't be

75
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,440
fucking sick if I just fit in I you know I was probably one of the guys yeah um I'm pretty I feel

76
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,040
like I don't know it sort of feels like a sycophane task you know you're like like I don't know like

77
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,240
you're never gonna be perfect right I always never maximize this I always felt like I always felt

78
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,520
like attempts to do good attempts to do good and make the parents proud we're not generally met with

79
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,000
like any greater enthusiasm I don't know than than any other time I always felt like well I always felt

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,840
like trying hard to do that was sort of pointless well I think the maximum way like based on everything

81
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,360
that mom and dad always said grown up I think the maximum way to make my parents happy and proud

82
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,440
would be to be incredibly successful at something that I love doing yeah and being financially

83
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
secure so that they don't have to worry and you know like all the it's never going to be perfect

84
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,920
of course so that's why I think it's a large part of why I'm so economically well I mean you've you

85
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,960
I mean I mean you've you've done all that so so you're fine but I'm not I'm not I don't know

86
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,680
like I think about this a lot too our whole generation has such low standards for quote

87
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,760
unquote making it yeah mine are much higher than I think a lot of other people and so I just think

88
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,280
like like I mean for example like dad's career as a psychologist and stuff is like way beyond

89
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,600
anything like like what youtuber I wonder what tier of youtuber do you have to be at to be like at

90
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,120
the level of like earning as stable and good a living as like a professional psychologist

91
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,880
I would estimate it's massive I would estimate maybe maybe if you're in the 10 tens of millions

92
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,640
yeah exactly yeah exactly um and like as a as a programmer right now I do like so much

93
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
better financially doing that than youtube and I know I'm still a small youtuber but

94
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,440
it's like uh I don't know like I really want to do all those things that I love doing but I'm very

95
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,720
concerned about doing it in a sustainable way so that nobody they don't have to worry about me

96
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,080
and I don't know sounds like it's holding you back you material success always just seemed like a

97
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,680
rigged a rigged game to me you know but it's there I mean obviously there's a lower threshold

98
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,960
you have to be no one who wins it no one who wins that game says yeah I made it and now I'm happy

99
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
well some people do it's what it's a security blanket sort of thing I think yeah it's like a

100
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,440
safety net more than anything else well I mean obviously having enough that you're not in financial

101
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,600
peril is good but I mean like like having a million in the bank so that you can just go try to be a

102
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,360
huge I mean our dad is not I mean our dad is not rich right like our dad like we're not we're not

103
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,120
rich per se but like I think I think I think I've heard that like something like 50 or $60,000 a year

104
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,800
is like the cutoff point where like happiness does not increase beyond that I believe that was 70,000

105
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,960
and that that is the peak and after that it goes down if you if you go up I'm pretty sure our dad

106
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,440
makes more than that maybe not by that much yeah yeah yeah he makes more than that and like you know

107
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean I'm not criticizing the guy for making money but yeah I don't but I think that in in

108
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,960
his case it's he's it holds true that more money does not increase happiness you know okay Ben

109
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,400
you're totally right but all of us here today are significantly below that threshold wait even so

110
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,520
just saying that there's even even not wait no wait not you with your real ass job I am actually

111
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:25,360
above that threshold at this point yeah obviously obviously uh well I mean it's it's a it's a thing

112
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,080
of like living well within your means like like as long as you're happy with less then you don't

113
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,640
need as much money and I agree that like it seems like people of our generation have lower standards

114
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,400
for what would be considered good enough my standards are too low I'll just I'll just come right

115
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,720
out my standards are too low I'm glad that you admit it yeah but like yeah but like it's it's not just

116
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,400
because like oh our generation is lazy it's also like like things are more expensive and jobs are

117
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,400
harder to find and like that it's not exactly the same criticism isn't about laziness so that the

118
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,000
generation is bad it's that like for whatever reason like their standards were just made to be lower

119
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
that like because everyone wants to be like a starving youtube artist or something and obviously

120
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,440
not everybody but like in in my circles like guys like like really Ben is the worst of the worst

121
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,640
absolutely you know you know I'm just I'm just it's a rigged game material success is a rigged

122
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,120
game I'm convinced I don't disagree I mean if you're shooting for like your money and possessions

123
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,040
aren't gonna make you happy when you're about and I and I know and I know that my I know that my

124
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,480
standards are too low and as a result I am I mean you know I'm motivated I don't know I'm not

125
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:47,120
unmotivated but I am I am I'm I've kind of I've sort of let myself be content with enough to get

126
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,800
buy on but not enough to like be secure exactly Ben's an economical chameleon able to adapt to

127
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,680
whatever situation he siphides himself in pretty much damn um humans can adapt to anything do you

128
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,200
feel this whole thing about want to make your parents proud I mean obviously to some degree

129
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,240
but I'm just curious what you think oh yeah like I've been I used to have like this terrible

130
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,760
terrible issue of um feeling like I've disappointed my parents because I feel like a lot of sort of

131
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,040
you're just a lowly artist after all so that's a that's a blow to the old parent ego I'm sure

132
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,000
kind of like that was a joke and you guys did not rebut it so I'm uh no I mean I mean we're all

133
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,480
creative people yeah you guys all know no this is terrible so we're all like yeah no no no that's

134
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,880
true okay I just feel like my parents invested a lot of hope in me and I kind of disappointed them

135
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,440
at least that's how I felt I don't feel like that anymore but it took me a lot but yeah yeah I mean

136
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,840
it's excuse me I mean every parent has no idea what a child is until it's already grown up and

137
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,040
then well I have a sister especially if you're the older one and I have an older sister yeah maybe

138
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,640
your older sister really fucked up I don't know if this is true or not and they were hoping that you

139
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,560
would be the one to save the day which is what I am for our parents for sure she's doing quite quite

140
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,120
well actually but but she has like I don't want to get into it because it's personal for her so but

141
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,440
like yeah I should have I should have killed you in the cradle when I had the chance to like now

142
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,600
motherfucker oh no all right all right I want to go around the room okay how many of you your parents

143
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,560
were like how many of these child fulfill my fantasies because I failed no well our parents

144
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,880
were definitely not like not like they were very encouraging yeah about what we wanted a lot of

145
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,880
my pressure I feel I was self-inflicted yeah with myself did did you have any of that kid no because

146
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,040
like if I like I used to think like oh shit I got it I got to do all the the stuff I got to be the

147
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,560
perfect boy because I like my parents and I want to make them I don't want to make them unhappy

148
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,200
but like if I thought about like their decision to bring me into the world it wasn't so that I could

149
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,320
become you know the prime minister or whatever it was just so that they could have like a nice family

150
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,520
and then as long as I'm a nice son that's all it really matters yeah I just treat them right and

151
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,680
that's it I what about you Tom yeah my parents like they don't my parents don't really even have

152
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,280
dreams that they even want to pass on to me uh my dad's a writer though that sounds like he writes

153
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,000
the only reason he even started writing is because I told him to so I'm gonna take credit for that

154
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,880
but uh no like my parents they're just like they have a very specific vision of what they want me

155
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,880
to be like they just like please please son get get a real salary job and stop like hobbling around

156
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:45,760
and and just like being a piece of shit and I'm just like no I like I love being in the gutter

157
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,880
it's so comfortable the slime I just like it gives me solace at night I have another I have one more

158
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,560
thing about why it's a rig game not just material success but pleasing your parents specifically

159
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,960
as a rig game because as the old saying goes parents will never get it right I suppose yeah

160
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,680
I mean how how many parents like really know their kids like you know what I think about Ben

161
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,880
all that all that all that all that parents know like all that most parents like they have some idea

162
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
of what their kid does like like our parents don't understand don't really understand what we do

163
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,240
right they and and I think that's probably true for most people like they'll know they'll know

164
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,360
their kids job title they might know what the one or two things that they will have loose associations

165
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,520
that they make oh my son's a lawyer oh my son's a dentist or whatever but they don't know right like

166
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,360
all they want well they wouldn't know like if I was like I'm a programmer they also don't understand

167
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,560
what that consists of yeah well exactly yeah so they can so they can say oh my son's oh my son's

168
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,880
a programmer oh my son's a programmer and that's fine you know that probably is pleading but it's

169
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,200
just aesthetic like like for them on the parent side it's just an aesthetic thing and say oh my

170
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,600
son's a programmer oh my son's an artist yeah it doesn't always the real they don't they don't

171
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,120
experience the reality of it and I feel like it's a fool's game not always though like I have a friend

172
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,640
and her mom is very very involved in her activities and stuff and she always knows what's up so well

173
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,320
that's not that's not me well I think it's not so much like literal like they don't get it it's that

174
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,160
like for them being a parent is an entirely different lifestyle that they've known so

175
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,840
everything they're doing is like they're full of stress they're like oh shit this is my life is

176
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,560
completely different now I've got to try and adapt to it like by the time they're grandparents then

177
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,120
they get you like grandparents and and and grandchildren like well my grandma so can't

178
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,120
wrap her head around the concept of the computer I mean it's it's not it's not like the the the

179
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,240
literal like what the kids are doing but the fact that like what you know how to raise a kid

180
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,960
like like the fact that it's new and it's different and it's challenging and it's all this stuff and

181
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,640
it's like a grandparent would would get it a bit better because they're not they're not in that like

182
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
you know they've done it already they can see it happening again they're like ah yeah I got this

183
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,360
I think the difference there is that like a parent a parent has the job of making their

184
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,240
kid as good as they can be a grandparent has almost zero responsibility so they can just

185
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
chill and like connect with the kid it's it's why it's why grandparents and uncles and aunts are

186
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,720
like more fun a lot of the time absolutely they don't have to be the disciplinarian or anything

187
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,960
but I was gonna say about uh to to Ben's point I kind of do agree with the whole um parents will

188
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,200
never get it never get a thing to a to a pretty large that's not even just that's not even just

189
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,240
like an edgy teen thing I just think like parent unless you're unless you're one of those kids

190
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,320
who has who's like super close oh best friends with my mom who but I but I make I'm making a

191
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,920
jerking off gesture right now good um yeah I was listening to Joe Rogan's podcast he had Billy

192
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,440
Corrigan on who is the main guy from uh Smashing Pumpkins and like Smashing Pumpkins is like a

193
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,600
huge world-renowned band super famous whatever point is um uh like Billy Corrigan was talking

194
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,000
about how like he had I believe he said it was his grandpa and like in his family they got that he

195
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,280
was like a big deal but his grandpa even when he was like a platinum selling like huge deal

196
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,320
didn't give a shit until like until until like was he on Oprah or something no no no none of that

197
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,200
stuff made any difference to this guy but it was when he found out how much money that his son was

198
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,440
making that's when he was well now I get it now I understand people care about this and that's

199
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,840
why I'm saying Ben the parents won't care they'll never understand exactly what you do as nobody

200
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,680
can really understand what's going on in your job pretty much unless they're in the same exact field

201
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,040
but they'll understand if you have that dollars in the bank my dude that's what they'll understand

202
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,360
the universe that's how my parents work because they wanted to take it from me as soon as they

203
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,720
thought I was making money they immediately started charging me to stay in their house despite despite

204
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,960
my charging you rent what villains am I right I don't mind paying rent now guys now I don't mind

205
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,040
paying rent the thing was that it was as soon as they found out that I had money it's like oh we can't

206
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,400
let you keep this now we will we'll take it more like the fact that you can't pay me no no no no

207
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
you gotta you gotta understand the full context the full context was I was working a job yes

208
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,440
then I got uh laid off then I got on patreon and then they were like oh uh now that you're making

209
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,640
money online we need to charge you rent but if you go get a real job again you can stay for free

210
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,400
that is a little bit uh a little bit iffy my dude fuck your dreams go be a slave was was pretty

211
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,880
much the message I got from that point okay guys guys guys so uh um earlier I did sort of protest

212
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,960
against uh Ben's argument but like I do agree with him to to an extent like a big extent the the

213
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,080
one I mentioned was mostly an exception because from my experience is Ben is quite right at least

214
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
in my experience like I think the people that are close with their parents are kind of creepy

215
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:56,320
personally yeah yeah I love our parents my whole family has no idea what I'm doing online sorry I

216
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
was just saying that like I love my mom I love having her around but like I love to see her once

217
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,240
it's not even that I don't like to see her it's that we don't have a ton in common actually yeah

218
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
so yeah I know we've got like our whole lives I mean so that's fair we can talk about any of

219
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,520
that shit but uh it's like I think all the time about just like working and editing and being online

220
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,480
and doing this stuff and you know my job and stuff and uh I think she wants to hear about that so you

221
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,960
know yeah it's different I think there should always be like a healthy awkwardness when it comes

222
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,880
to parent child yeah because like with your siblings like you are the same like you know

223
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,560
you get it you you know you're basically the same age you you would understand each other a little

224
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,600
um you should always know your siblings better than your parents like if your parent comes in

225
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,960
and watches sees you watching a youtube video that's kind of weird like you should be a little

226
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,440
like ASMR slime uh goop extravaganza you know it should be it should be awkward because if it's

227
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,720
not awkward then either your parent is too as I hastily put my dick away yeah like you are doing

228
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,960
like you were doing like the too much of a normie thing my sister just don't understand me like at

229
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,200
all like the difference between me and my sister is she's significantly older than you right like

230
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,800
six six years I think but she's so she's such a normie like like like a month ago or so that

231
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,800
should be a buzz sound of mage going she's such a normie I want that your sister sounds like exactly

232
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:32,080
the kind of person who would get hello fresh like that coward monkey white picket fence 2.5 kids

233
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,720
ass motherfucker there was a great voicemail about hello fresh I can't wait to get to she does have a

234
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,280
house and she does have a challenge she's gonna maybe get a second one my sister turned into a

235
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,800
normie and it's been this slow decline that's just depressing me to no end let me let me tell you

236
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,920
let me tell you a quick story about my sister I just kind of made me sad like a month ago or so

237
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,600
she was like hey I was talking to my boss about you and like I have nothing to say about you

238
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,360
because I don't know what you're doing could you like send me some of your drawing so I could show

239
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,960
it to her I was like okay that was weird but you know why why are you talking to your boss with me

240
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,840
about me yeah but yeah I sent a few pictures a few drawings to her and she was like oh all of them

241
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,600
except for this one are ugly

242
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,000
she's been like this for like forever like the last time I showed her a drawing was back in

243
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,640
my pony days and I showed her a drawing of a pony and she was like is is that a flower and I'm like

244
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,840
never showing you anything ever again and then I made the mistake of showing her stuff we need to

245
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,880
get a picture of mage's sister put it on that meme of the guy and just be like have the have your

246
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,840
drawing like is this a flower oh yeah oh yeah yeah that's a we need clearly no observational skills

247
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,000
whatsoever hey I've got I've got uh an extension of this topic slightly which is ties into a couple

248
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,160
things that just happened to me earlier today uh which was so so um another way I want to make

249
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,240
my parents proud and to like be a real man this is definitely more of a socially influenced thing

250
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,560
is I want to be able to like fix things and repair things and you know be a man and that in that

251
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,000
kind of way and I'll uh so so I was using Michelle's uh electric skateboard and stuff

252
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,200
and you're using it a ton and having a great time but a week ago it broke and it wasn't

253
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,920
fucking working and it was expensive so I was I was very upset and I thought that I had broken a

254
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,160
thing through excessive use this is very sad to me but like a man I took it apart I found the

255
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,200
problem it was that one of the rubber bands had worn one of the rubber like treads had worn out

256
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,200
from excessive use excessive hardcore grinding and rail riding uh naturally ordered the part

257
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,960
got here yesterday replaced it myself was out there killing it and having a great time and

258
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,880
being a hero and I love fixing things also side note I fell for the first time off the skateboard

259
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,200
and got a big old fucking raspberry on my fucking arm and I was posted for you now in chat so you

260
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,520
can all enjoy I don't think I want to see my wound I'm not sure they used raspberry I don't think

261
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,600
that is what it's right right raspberries are like raspberry is what will ferrell said in uh

262
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,640
anchorman when uh jack black fell off his motorcycle and had a bunch of scars and you know you blow

263
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,440
raspberry you don't get a raspberry from you mean an indian burn he said raspberry and anchorman

264
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:27,680

265
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,800
repairing things uh and it was great yeah and I'm better than all of you because I did when you feel

266
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,720
good about fixing shit it's like yeah yeah it was broken that's right that's why you wear longer

267

275
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,920
it's a good feeling I've been like building more computers than ever because like we're returning

276
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,360
digi house into a cyberpunk 2077 technocratic future state uh dope there are computers everywhere

277
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,000
it's insane ordering parts all the time building things fixing things getting pissed off and things

278
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,040
this is all part of going full games uh a part of it yeah some of it just like I I just had a

279
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,120
bunch of shit lying around and I was like oh yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do this I guess I'm

280
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,880
gonna sell it did you just like no just bring it over here I'm like okay so now there's like a

281
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,920
computer in every room in the house for no reason and uh yeah and and I'm building one for May that

282
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,440
I had just hitting around I'm gonna upgrade that make that cool because like they broke their laptop

283
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,720
like three times in a row and it was funny okay the screen just falls out now and it's it's insane

284
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,480
yeah so I'm just I've just become the IT for I am game that's my job description it's real

285
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:27,040
oh good and that's what I do and uh yeah fantastic uh I can I can do other pools I can dovetail

286
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,720
into a new topic from here is that okay yeah go for it go in terms of technology and just in general

287
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,560
we have been having so much technical difficulties with trying to get I am games to work because

288
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,280
every time we switch it to a different game we got to change the entire setup get to unplug

289
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,280
everything and plug everything back in and then there's always something that breaks or doesn't

290
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,080
work and even in like my personal work doing like working on the game and and trying to just like

291
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,840
make computer shit work like digis uh motherboard didn't work for some reason so we had to send

292
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,520
that back and then like for some reason like my stream capture software on my big 12 core processor

293
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,400
can't record more than 20 fps unless I disable windows arrow I'm like there's a bunch of bullshit

294
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,160
that just constantly happens and I don't like like someone I ordered a new cpu for maze computer

295
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,320
I have to send that back because even though it's like the right kind it just doesn't fit in the

296
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,840
slot even though there's no reason it shouldn't be so I just want to get like a t-shirt that just says

297
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,520
it should be working but it's not because that's my entire life these are the kind of things that

298
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,880
make me want to kill myself and not put up with life anymore maybe you should maybe the t-shirt

299
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
should have a computer with a little speech bubble that says I'm supposed to be working right now

300
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,600
oh my god I am games oh and on the back there's a big I am games x pcp thing or something it's

301
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,760
like crossover damn that's good I could make that immediately we did I did just make a brand

302
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,440
new shirt for iam games yesterday and it was great the pcp will take a cool 98% of the profits from

303
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,800
that well I'm in both ventures so I double dip on the price that's true damn just saw this elbow

304
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,440
it looks it looks painful uh yeah it hurts a lot right now as a matter of fact you can see the skin

305
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,200
just scraped right off like with its ice cream scoop describe it with a tiny ice cream scoop just

306
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,040
I feel your description is worse than the image itself stop that's that's true the image it does

307
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,640
just look like a raspberry yeah yeah it's even got kind of like bumps on it the way I read well

308
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,320
Farrell is such a wordsmith I guess so yeah he's created a new phrase that did not exist before

309
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm angry with him because I swear like blowing a raspberry it's like it's like yeah like it does

310
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,360
not leave a mark it's just like yeah mage you're you're absolutely right that this is a new

311
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,360
this is a new neologism playful with language and uh yeah raspberries can be many things sometimes

312
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,560
creativity try it out sometime yeah maybe send that to your sister when she went to ask what you do

313
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,840
stop drawing flowers mage get get more creative speaking of physical maladies

314
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:09,280
yeah um so I'm dying last week I was talking about how I could feel a cough coming on yeah it did

315
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,000
it did yeah we're all well aware at this point my throat hurt pretty bad for a while but that

316
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,800
went away and I thought I was over it but then I've just been I've just had like a I've had a

317
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,920
what what a what a doctor might describe as a productive cough uh forever since then is this

318
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,360
is a keto induced illness or no no absolutely no this happened this happened after I went to

319
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,720
I am games I'm pretty sure that I am games made me sick uh it had to be okay so it's a video game

320
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,960
we are just in yeah video game made me sick and now I'm like well now I'll like start breathing

321
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,680
and my breath will be all like oh yeah it'll all be all crunchy in my lungs because it's

322
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,080
mega man 11 literally gives you cancer conferred do you guys feel uh when you feel like that

323
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,080
afraid to go to sleep because you're afraid that you'll die in your sleep and your body just won't

324
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,960
be able to breathe yes but I'm all the time well I'm not about this not about a cough but about

325
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,360
things like a fever or something yeah like an asthma okay I've always suspected I have asthma

326
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,480
it's not for me it's not even when I go to sleep it's just all day every day even right now like

327
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,600
what if I just die I'm afraid this the switch is just gonna get flipped uh you know oh yeah I

328
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,320
I used to be really paranoid I think I'm a little less so nowadays but yeah yeah there was a time

329
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,240
when I was like what if I just die what if I just drop dead for no reason what if my heart just stops

330
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,320
you one could fixate their whole life on that but yeah I sort of get what you're saying but

331
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,800
like I don't fear death because like shit found like when you're gonna be dead you're not gonna

332
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,400
care that you're dead yeah I mean yeah when I'm dead I won't care but the me that is alive now

333
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,080
cares that I will be dead then and it's a separate for the living for sure if you're not gonna notice

334
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,360
that you're dead but no but but I notice now right now I'm afraid of it I understand the feeling

335
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,640
of I get what you're saying but I don't agree of feeling because like it isn't a rational thing

336
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,120
my room has as like a lot of dust in it and it has had a lot of dust ever since uh we like

337
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,840
refurbished the room underneath it and like the floor was all torn up and put back down

338
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I need to re-go over it because there's dust there's like bits in the wall they're sort of

339
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,840
cracking and I know that every time I go to bed I think this is there's there's just dust in the

340
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,680
air there's dust all over the place and sometimes when I go to bed I'm like I'm breathing it in

341
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,320
I can feel it going down my throat and I'm like all right I know in the morning I'm gonna be

342
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,240
you know smokers cough like here yeah I'll be fine later but like it's happened too many times

343
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,440
and I haven't done anything about it and it's sort of like I feel like this room that I'm in

344
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,720
has given me like an eternal cold that is not debilitating but like it's just like

345
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm sort of stuffed up at all times with like dryness but like it's never really it can't

346
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:05,360
like I don't remember what it feels like to not be stuffed up and it's the sort of it's the sort

347
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,400
of thing where it happens for so long that I'm not even really sure whether it's happening or not

348
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,520
maybe I'm just like losing my sense of smell normally and this is why we need transhumanism

349
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I'm so I mean that's true we need uh uh okay so first of all somebody please draw a picture of

350
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Gibb uh eyes wide open bloodshot staring up the clouds of dust hanging over him as he tries to

351
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,560
sleep it's not a lot of dust but like over the course of like months and months like I haven't

352
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,440
I haven't even put a put a I don't know a water in here I don't know what you're supposed to do

353
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,000
about dust like a lack of dust you just put dust in there you got a dust yeah I gotta remove the dust

354
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,280
do I mean okay the right thing to do is to like to rip down the walls and then re-plaster them

355
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,000
because the plus I was gonna say if it like if more is coming from the walls uh I don't know

356
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,680
what's to be done about that I gotta move maybe go to different room I guess I mean yeah it's it's

357
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,120
not like every night is terrible but like occasionally it'll be like oh yeah fuck I think it's like

358
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,560
it it it it adds to a cold like it's cold like I might have a cold now but like it's made it so

359
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,760
that the line has the the line has blurred between having a cold and not having a cold

360
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,800
like I sort of like suddenly I'm like I'm sneezing I'm like oh wait am I sneezing or do

361
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,240
I have a cough or no and actually I'm fine like I sometimes I just don't know and I think I'm dead

362
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,040
I think no one should live in that kind of in between world the twilight it's kind of weird

363
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,200
it's kind of weird to be constantly not sure and kind of definitely sure that I am sick I just

364
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,640
remembered something that that kind of relates to this topic of of death and sleep and stuff

365
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,360
so back in my so back in my Lithuanian home and in this room that I usually stay in the layout

366
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,200
has changed over years every now and then and like there used to be like the where the bed is now

367
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,640
it used to be on the opposite side and there's a shelf like where it used to be okay there used

368
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,640
to be a shelf on the side where the bed is right now and the thing is back when the bed was on the

369
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,200
other side one night the shelf just kind of fell and it like it was the big crash in the middle of

370
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,080
the night as well and it it spooked me really really bad and that was back when I was living there

371
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,200
but now whenever I go over during the summer I have to sleep under the same shelf that fell at night

372
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,920
oh no that's a real uh what's that sword the edipus

373
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,080
damocles? sort of damocles? thankfully the shelf has been removed this year so I actually

374
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,800
managed to sleep peacefully oh man that's nice I mean who the fuck would want to sleep under that

375
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,680
I'd be freaking out the whole time oh I thought you said like you you had to as in like I just

376
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:58,400
want to feel that rush like at any moment all night while I'm sleeping I can't I can't sleep without

377
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,520
that adrenaline I have the same paranoia whenever I have to sleep but whenever I sleep on a bunk

378
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,680
bed I'm always like if I'm on the bottom bunk like the top one's gonna follow me I'm fucking dead

379
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,800
to be to be quite fair like I'm not that scared of dying myself I just feel like it would be an

380
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,600
inconvenience because I want stuff like I want to do some stuff in my life and I haven't done it yet

381
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,640
I was like well I don't want to understand that's where a lot of the fear for me comes from is just

382
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,680
that like I if there's so much not on the table yet there's so much I still have to do I just I

383
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,480
just be annoyed if if there's some sort of afterlife I just be annoyed just like well I wanted to

384
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,400
do this thing and now I can gosh you know it's it's weird before like bucket lists and stuff because

385
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,760
I I never felt like I remember like as a young child like oh shit a bucket list is things you

386
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,360
have to do before you die and like every cartoon has that episode where the character thinks they're

387
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,160
gonna die and they do everything on their bucket list and I'm like I should write my own and then

388
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,160
I it it's just never actually appealed to me to have a list of things I need to do because I don't

389
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,320
I don't know I just don't care I guess there's some things I I guess I take things as they come

390
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,240
that's fair now that I've like been to Hawaii like I feel like that would be something that I would

391
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,080
have put on except I've already done it but like I'm sure like it's made me think about like other

392
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,760
things I'd like to do because travel munchies right guys travel is so great yeah it's so worth

393
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,760
doing to go to amazing places and I hate travel well fair you do it more than most of us I think but

394
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,880
probably more sick I do it pretty well she does it like once like twice a year she goes from one

395
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,040
place to another that's not an obligation though I guess I don't like I don't like traveling from

396
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,840
country to country I guess through the yeah you think you think it's hard going from country to

397
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,880
country over there in Europe it's just it's way easier like getting out of America is so much

398
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,720
harder although once Britain's out of the EU that might be yeah I'm thinking of doing like an EU

399
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,720
like a mega a trip just so I can see all of it before I'm locked out and forever that's a great

400
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,680
idea you really should do that I yeah I like that a lot I don't care how much hard it is I just don't

401
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,280
like the traveling aspect it was like so many people so many stupid inconveniences and waiting

402
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,640
in line waiting in lines with a lot of people I hate it I hate public places I like hang on hang on

403
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,080
I want to answer this question again if you had to go one place in the EU what's your number one

404
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:26,240
place you want to go I had to go one place um I would like to go Auschwitz please one ticket to

405
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,880
Auschwitz I mean I I'd visit I'd visit yeah but I want to go to Hamburg because I haven't been

406
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
I'd go there and press F

407
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,520
I was laughing at the meme would you say I'd go to Hamburg um because I've never really been to

408
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,880
Germany properly like I'd stayed there a little bit um for an animation thing but like um it's a

409
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:56,000
country that is cool and it's also not incredibly hot so that I won't die maybe it's a true Brit

410
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,560
you should go to I forget the town where the European Union is based in Germany but you should

411
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,160
consider blowing it up like uh you know like who's that who's that guy guy fox guy fuck pull a guy

412
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,400
fox on the EU and be a be a real best guy ever for no best guy forks damn it that's guy best guy

413
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,520
forks ever yeah that's it hey but what you need to do is you just you need to go to all the places

414
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,200

I feel like I've talked a lot this episode I don't want to dominate but I do have a very funny

420
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,720
short story that I thought I'd bring up the thing is I don't know if I've told it before

421
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,760
have I told a story about me my dad and a roller coaster game in the past have I told the story

422
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,280
roller coaster not that I remember okay forgive me if I've told it before but I'm gonna tell it again

423
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,360
I was I was thinking about this I was telling this to Michelle and I just realized what a great

424
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,440
story this is um so okay so one day me and my this is the story of one of the worst things I've ever

425
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,000
done in my life uh is is what it is this is I think about this memory haunted by the ghosts of

426
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,560
what I did in this story to my dad and and so this is what it is this is what it is so I was around

427
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,080
I was probably around between 12 and 15 probably something around there and me and my dad it was

428
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,200
just totally normal we were at like some kind of store like a what's called like building 19 or

429
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,400
something or like oh dude I love building 19 yeah I think it was a store like that kind of just

430
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,280
suffer a little save a lot yeah yeah they're cool and um uh like as we're we just went to buy some

431
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,000
stuff my daddy cabling or tubes or something or whatever and uh and we're leaving and as we're

432
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,440
leaving I spy on the side of the of like the aisle there's like a game there and it's a roller coaster

433
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,960
game for the pc and it's not roller coaster tycoon it's something like like roller coaster builder

434
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,200
simulator 2000 or something some like nondescript totally unaffiliate with any big thing roller

435
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,520
coaster building game it's like an engineering sort of thing and I see this game and for some

436
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:28,720
unexplained reason I'm filled with lust for this game just immoral passionate massive lust to play

437
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,400
this roller coaster game he's a young man he's gotta have it sometimes yeah and so I say dad

438
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:42,560
you need to buy me this game and he's like he's like well uh oh okay um by the way this game is

439
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,680
like it was like 10 to 15 dollars I'm gonna say 15 or something and I'm like I don't have any money

440
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,040
on me and I'm just like I didn't have much at the time anyway dad buy me this game he's like oh uh and

441
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,880
my dad never buys me stuff um or not it's not that he's mean he's just you know like why would he uh

442
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,720
but but in this one situation I'm like dad buy me this game I need it I need this game that's pretty

443
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,440
frugal yeah yeah yeah and my dad he's just like he's just baffled understandably he's like Nate why

444
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,640
do you want this you really like this is the thing you want so bad and I'm just saying yes

445
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,880
yes I want it so bad uh I'm going to play it forever I say to my dad meanwhile in my mind

446
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,800
I know I don't even want this game that bad I don't even really give a shit why just why this game

447
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,600
I don't know I'm being so too faced in what I'm saying to my dad I'm manipulating him intentionally

448
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,480
pretending I have these strong emotions because I just kind of want to play this game a little bit

449
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,760
who wins in this situation what was that saying our lord and master who wins in this scenario

450
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,600
no one wins because oh I beg and plead convince him to buy this game and he really thinks he's

451
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,160
doing something real nice for me and he's it was it was a touching moment for him for me it was a

452
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,880
purely evil moment and so we get home we install the game on the computer I play it one time for

453
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,920
like an hour and I was super bored and don't give a shit and I never play it again I I just manipulated

454
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,080
my dad into spending $15 he didn't need to spend uh and it was the most evil I've felt about pretty

455
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,960
much anything in my life years later this was like a year ago or something I remember that this

456
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,920
happened and I just I throw myself at my dad's feet he didn't know any of this he just thought he

457
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,160
done something nice for me but I'm just like dad I need to confess something to you I I did a bad

458
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,480
thing and I tell him this whole story and he's just like oh I don't care it's fine yeah yeah nobody

459
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,760
gives it and so just I believe it was just yesterday I tell this whole story to my mom who's visiting

460
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,360
and she just looks at me you know Michelle's there and she just my mom looks at me just like

461
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,800
god you're boring

462
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,960
so my question for the group is do you like rollercoasters

463
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,120
wait what no nothing I do you like

464
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:14,800
oh yeah yeah so that we get the expert divu on on the show we do yeah yeah it would have been good

465
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,560
to have him here uh yeah I just I just get consumed by these tiny immoral things I've done in the

466
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,840
past this is what I'm talking about this is what I'm talking about you think you think you do a

467
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,160
thing you're you think your parents will feel such in such a way and they just don't like I've

468
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,480
there's been so like so many times like I thought parents would be mad and they didn't give a

469
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,400
shit so many times I thought they'd be pleased and they didn't give a shit in fact almost all

470
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,240
the time they just didn't give a shit I'm seeing up I'm starting to see a pattern here well they

471
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,960
sure they've they've they've given up they've let the the ship sail up to be fair though to be

472
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
fair though I didn't really think that my dad would care that much I just thought that this is

473
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,960
just something that really bothers me that I did and so I had to it's a good example of like

474
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,680
doing doing anything for your parents say doing anything to make them proud it's like it's a

475
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,680
fool's game you it's sysaphy and task you will never get that boulder up the hill in fact factoring

476
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:14,480
no seriously I factoring anyone else's feelings into any of your decisions at any time is a

477
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,840
fool's errand and is a mistake and will result in greater suffering for the world yeah it's going

478
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:27,440
too far no it's not no it's not you need to it's like you need to just eliminate you have to put

479
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,160
yourself first in any and all things you know it doesn't make any sense it does not make any sense

480
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,960
to do otherwise I think I know why that is for anyone it's it's because they made you and then

481
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,240
they were tasked with like making sure you didn't die for like 10 years oh and and then they had to

482
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,120
like deal with you being a teenager and all right well it's 18 20 whatever yeah once you hit 10

483
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:56,800
you they give you they give you a pokemon and they shove you out the first door like they do all

484
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,360
that stuff and then by the time you're an adult they're like just I'm done with you yeah they're

485
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,000
you're boring to me it's time to cash the chips in at that point it's time for you to go away and

486
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,040
then uh like put me in a home come back uh uh yeah I mean that's fair enough it's fair enough

487
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,240
you know the bend your point there reminds me uh I didn't really understand uh well what you're

488
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,120
saying reminds me of objectivism as explained by rucka rucka Ali in the podcast I did with him

489
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,000
about objectivism which I'm sure one could learn more about but it was I didn't fully agree with

490
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,480
him on this or that like that I subscribe to this belief but it was that like there's kind of an

491
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:39,520
inherent almost spiritual value in like pursuing one's own goals as opposed to like worrying about

492
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,880
society so maybe you uh you're a little bit of an objectivist in that in that way I mean I think so

493
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,480
yeah I don't know I sure as soon as everyone else is an object I really feel I really feel like when

494
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,520
you put like you can like you can factor others desires into your decisions as data points

495
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,920
for you to make an informed decision but when you put other people's needs above your own I just

496
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,120
it never a little cook it never works yeah it just doesn't like it just doesn't work I just

497
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,640
find that even if the goal is to like oh well we'll get this person what they want I just don't

498
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,920
ever feel like they actually are happy to receive the thing that you think they want it's like people

499
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,000
don't know what they want well it would be more like I think what you're gonna say is like you would

500
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,640
do things to make people happy so that they would then do things for you it's like or just that it

501
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,320
makes you happy that they're happy like but yeah like it would all come down to like yeah self-serving

502
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,720
things but like yeah if you don't feel like your parents give a shit then that isn't going to make

503
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,800
you happy it's kind of like that expression happy wife happy life which is just like yeah like if

504
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,480
you're married you know make your wife happy it'll make your life easy because you know you want to

505
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,240
just like yeah I reckon the only way I have the only way I interface with the universe at all

506
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,720
is my own level of happiness and I'm just aware that if I make the world around me happy and

507
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,680
better it'll be better for me too so that's yeah yeah yeah obviously I mean that's what I mean

508
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,840
like yeah yeah I think we agree on this pretty much yeah like like take take take take those things

509
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:16,560
into account but you always gotta put yourself first I totally agree okay all right then then

510
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,880
there's no need to argue any further uh well all right I feel like I got like three topics in this

511
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,280
time so who else who's that something to break I have something to talk about okay uh it's the

512
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,400
fact that I'm dead like hypocrites dead and he's been killed and he's never making a video game

513
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,200
reviews on the ground what uh canonically what's hypocrite doing right now what's the hippo he's mad

514
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,520
that I quit the show and he's writing his own reviews but they will never be published because

515
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:53,040
I deactivated no I banned him from using the computer yes he has to he has to ask me to use

516
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,920
the computer and I was like no how are you such a monster that you just made yourself the villain

517
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:08,640
of this tale I'm definitely the Maddox in in the in the breakup of me oh yeah well yeah I mean

518
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,320
let's talk about it so so it specifically what you've decided to do as I understand it um is like

519
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,480
the the game reviews specifically you don't feel are working out the way you wanted them to so you

520
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,440
want to direct your energies elsewhere right it yeah I mean I I framed it like that because it was on

521
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:31,440
that channel but like what what it really is is like the idea of like making a career on youtube

522
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,280
yeah has always been the thing that is it's you know the most stressful and the most difficult

523
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,720
thing and youtube used to be about just having fun and putting stuff on the internet to make people

524
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,200
laugh once money came into it money sort of you know owns your mind and then everything that isn't

525
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,080
making money is like oh that's a waste of time I didn't make money off of that when before it wouldn't

526
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:00,640
have mattered so much so like I've what I've done is that it's not just I'm not I'm stopping game

527
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:07,120
reviews is that I'm stopping youtube being my career as an end goal like if like if I ever make youtube

528
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:14,000
videos again they would not be for the purposes of building uh you know any sort of youtube presence

529
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,520
up and if it does happen it happens accidentally what about uh you talked about still doing I

530
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,240
think animations would those be posted to youtube in some capacity uh yeah because it's just an easy

531
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,840
way to put things on on the internet like youtube is a very handy platform but like as a career

532
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,920
opportunity like that's gone like I'm never gonna think of it as a career thing ever again

533
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,920
because it's just not worth it even if it gets better it's never gonna be perfect

534
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,800
oh and never gonna be good enough I think you know this is this is very interesting to have somebody

535
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,080
one of us uh adopt this opinion because the thing is I think it's a completely reasonable

536
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,000
and just grounded thing to recognize if you're just not obtaining the success or wealth or whatever

537
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,240
like at a certain point you gotta be like like I mean look at me I've decided I decided a long

538
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,440
time ago that I wasn't doing well enough on youtube to just do it so I like hopefully one day I'll be

539
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,920
able to uh and I'm working towards it but like yeah uh I want the fans of wanting I like I don't

540
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,680
actually want to have youtube as my career but I like uploading stuff on youtube and if it makes me

541
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,120
a little bit of money for like once every five months I don't mind yeah it's fine that's like I

542
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,640
think it's it's really just like I used to enjoy the video game review things because I watched AVGN

543
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,920
and I just wanted to do that and then I learned over time that youtube can be a career and like

544
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,960
jontron was making money and I was hearing about that on game grumps and I was learning about how

545
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,040
let's plays make so much money and then once that's in your brain every time a new fad comes in or

546
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,600
like a new billionaire youtuber or like a vine star like makes so much money you're thinking

547
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:53,120
oh if only I was doing that which is kind of easy like you know I just I just need to be doing that

548
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,000
and I can get so much money and it sort of muddies your intentions like the only reason I got on the

549
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,160
platform was not to make money it was to make stuff that I liked and the the two of them became

550
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,800
intertwined and like video game reviews became synonymous with money and because they weren't

551
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,360
making money they became depressing I know what you mean that's that is how it works do you know

552
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:21,440
for sure it's it's a shitty fucking feeling like there's like there's like a an area where like okay

553
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,000
if you're not making enough money to even have it be like anything then you probably like work a job

554
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,960
or like you do whatever else you need to make money and then you do the youtube like as for fun

555
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,760
and that has however successful it is and I feel a lot of people can do really well like in that

556
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,080
space then there there's the tier of like struggling to make it where you like try to make it a thing

557
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,080
that's kind of where I'm at where I'm like trying to get ahead trying to you know push ahead and

558
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,160
make enough money so it can be your thing but there's going to be tension there and temptation

559
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,480
about like selling out to make more money so you're making it and then there's that and then

560
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,160
eventually you can get past that like wave crest or whatever and you're in the land of you just

561
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,200
make enough money up top where you kind of have another freedom that you obtain and you can kind

562
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,160
of do whatever you want but even when you're there you have the constant fear that you'll lose right

563
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,760
there's no security on youtube like it can be gone at any moment like and then the people can turn

564
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,280
on you the algorithm can change you can't build up a safety net on youtube it's like every day

565
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,280
you're one bad word away from being dead I mean it's getting more like that all the time and I

566
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,680
feel like like this three tier it's kind of like a not really a class system because it's not like a

567
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,360
hierarchy it's just like I feel like like somebody who comes to mind is like mr meddaker is a guy who

568
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:42,560
like has a full-time job is a popular youtuber or you know internet aristocrat as it used to be known

569
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:48,240
like he isn't that first camp um in that he doesn't depend on it to like make a living and stuff at

570
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,360
least I don't think so he's like uh he's like uh deleted his accounts and like slashed and burned

571
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,720
and like yeah because they get too big before he wants that freedom so like that you can feel

572
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,520
about him however you want but like it's interesting to note how because he's never depended on it

573
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,480
you can you there's a sense of authenticity about his work I mean he just doesn't give a

574
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,000
shit about whatever his whole his whole his whole platform is like to point out how absurd

575
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,880
this entire like thing is yeah but and then like uh I mean that's absolutely true and then you when

576
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,600
you move up then there's other people and like it's sort of like you can feel the authenticity

577
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,640
kind of dissipate as it be like when when money comes into it and like you've know like hey man

578
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,360
I've got like a wife and kids I'm a youtuber I have to feed them I'll do whatever it takes

579
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,520
to get enough money to like feed my family this month or whatever you get guys like

580
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,760
not to shit on the guy or I mean he didn't do very good things but like Monday and Matt for example

581
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,640
is exactly the first person I thought of oh yeah he kind of like he's a full-time youtuber he got

582
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,200
some success he has a wife and a kid and he got into this thing and I mean whatever his whole

583
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,480
thing about claiming people's videos or whatever it doesn't matter the point is he like you could

584
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,320
feel kind of him tailoring himself and designing himself to be able to survive on YouTube and

585
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,720
don't get wrong I'm like this too with like we are going shit so I'm definitely in this camp as well

586
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,280
to a degree um and then like I don't know guys like James Rolf just like they've made and they're

587
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,680
in the clear basically yeah I mean what seems at least the thing is like you have to get to the

588
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,040
point where your brand self-perpetuates it's it's up you're no longer dependent on YouTube's mechanisms

589
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,000
like when you're in that like second rung you have to play the game because you have to build up

590
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,440
momentum you no longer have to I mean if I I'll bring I'll leave an example and I don't mean to

591
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,360
shit on the guy uh but Psy Psy is like that like he succeeded by the YouTube algorithm but it didn't

592
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,800
he he didn't have like a like a dedicated audience that was like I'm sure he'd agree with that

593
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,480
willing to I mean to a certain extent he did but like not to the extent that you would think like

594
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,800
like you know a lot of his videos went really viral and stuff and probably made a decent amount

595
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,840
of ad rev but then like when he tried to transition into other things like it just didn't carry over

596
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,200
for whatever for whatever reason yeah because it was all it was he succeeded on the algorithm

597
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,280
right it was the force the other that's true for him it was like if YouTube if YouTube just

598
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,240
dissipated then then it all it all went up in smoke and it's such like a uh it's like it's such a

599
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,000
double-edged sword succeeding on the algorithm because you don't even really have any control over

600
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,320
it you can't yeah because you because nobody knows what it actually is like we can make assumptions

601
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,640
but like if you get into the algorithm you don't really you can't pinpoint how you got there and

602
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,200
you can't continue that wave it just kind of starts and stops and then you're just like okay

603
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:33,920
uh shit you just have to trial and error it yeah I mean that's true and I guys like Matt Pat

604
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,640
early pioneers and stuff and I can't remember who made this but like somebody made a video recently

605
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,200
about how like uh yeah like like PewDiePie would never have gotten to the places out if you started

606
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,920
today just like making the content he does yeah right in a wave basically it's really fucking

607
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,880
emplemin I think that's exactly right it was emplemin and by the way not and I think I need to

608
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,160
finish that was that was pretty interesting uh none of this to say that I'm at all happy that

609
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,600
like hypocrite videos have like gone away obviously I think I'm probably one of the biggest fans of

610
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:09,440
the hypocrite stuff but uh yeah yeah I mean you know like I'm also a big believer in facing reality

611
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,480
and making important decisions that are tough when you feel that way and like I sure hope that

612
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,240
things change and you come back and make more great videos but yeah I mean I I hope I feel like

613
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:28,720
the the like sincere drive to make a game review again that's funny like like it was it was just

614
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,560
inspired by stuff I was looking at that I you know I admired AVGN it's like it was really funny

615
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:42,800
game review stuff and so I just wanted to create based on that and yeah like the money forces it

616
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:49,280
to become like a repetitive cycle it's true and it's true I feel like if I if I have enough time

617
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,720
away I might feel a hankering for like actually doing it again but for the foreseeable future I

618
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,600
probably won't like it's yeah yeah it this reminds me it's just sort of gone this reminds me of

619
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,800
something really interesting I've been watching for the last couple days like I don't know if

620
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,960
anybody here knows Gary Vee Gary Vanderchuck sounds familiar he's like he's like a guy on YouTube he's

621
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,520
like a YouTube personality but he also runs like a 150 million dollar business called Vayner

622
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,720
Media's like a consulting business stuff he's like a business guy he's an entrepreneur and that's

623
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,000
like yeah about entrepreneurship and stuff and like it just like it reminds me that like you

624
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,560
have to love the game to be able to do this because like he just started a new series on his YouTube

625
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:32,880
channel called Trash Talk and what he does is that he has he's got like millions of followers

626
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,920
stuff he makes a fuck ton of money his company makes 150 million dollars but he loves the game

627
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,560
of just like making money so much that he just goes out to yard sales and flips things on the

628
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,560
weekends and I was documenting it so he's like you can watch his Twitter just like yeah just picks

629
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,800
up a 50 cent sold over 10 bucks fuck yeah and he's like super stoked about it because he's trying

630
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,280
to like teach people how to like make extra money and like you can do it on no budget but like he's

631
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,600
jones to go out and make ten dollars and like he loves business as a thing that much that even

632
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,400
though he has no reason to do this it's just the act of it and I feel like that's a thing with YouTube

633
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,920
is that like you have to love just like the act of being a YouTuber like if you have like if you're

634
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,000
using YouTube as like a means to have different end you're gonna sputter out eventually or it's

635
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,320
going to become mature so yeah like like you can love making YouTube videos but hate being a YouTuber

636
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,920
and hit a wall eventually yeah because so many things just have like a finite shelf life you know

637
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,760
you have an idea you make the idea but then like there's this if you've built up any traction

638
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,640
by getting that idea done there's this unspoken like obligation that it has to perpetuate into

639
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:49,040
infinity and then that's where the problems start yeah also like the the platform itself shifts as

640
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:55,120
you grow older like the the thing that you want it to be as as like it's changed and is no longer

641
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,960
what it used to be anymore like literally like I used to be like also like I was inspired by

642
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,080
like the nostalgic critic and that guy with the glasses and all those like funny silly stupid

643
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:13,520
review shows and I wanted to be on the big collective the the big like every so often

644
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,320
like movies they would make where they flew everyone out to one place and they did stupid

645
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:25,360
video game movie cliche trash and I just wanted you want to be on channel awesome I wanted yeah I

646
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,920
wanted that um like like a lot of people did I mean I was a little I was a little boy and it was

647
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,040
just like really cool to see a crossover of of things like I didn't really care about all of them

648
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,160
but it was just it was just cool I just I want to be in a community I want to be part of a thing yeah

649
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,440
and so when I was a little kid I really wanted to be a reviewer for Game and Former magazine

650
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,560
I wanted to write I wanted to write for EGM really bad I loved that magazine a lot yeah

651
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:57,040
and and and it's just like you grow up and you realize that those reviews are generally bad

652
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,240
and it would be really stupid to have gone to that thing like I was too young to go to one of those

653
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:11,440
yeah um but like if I like if I had the clout now at age 25 would I go like would I be like I

654
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,240
probably wouldn't like even disregarding like scandals and stuff that has happened well I mean

655
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:21,600
those things kind of seem to me like like rad con but less cool and also more polished I guess

656
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,560
it's just like your your tastes change so like if you desire to be a thing

657
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,880
are based on like a childish impulse and you start that as your youtube channel and you get

658
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,960
into that and then you grow older and you don't want to do it anymore but now that you're you're

659
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,760
stuck in a cycle where people expected of you and it's all I've I've thought once in a while about

660
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:48,560
like will I still care to review like anime and video games when I'm like 40 I mean I don't know

661
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:54,560
I have no idea probably but who could say who could say you got to think about what were you

662
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:59,520
going to go from there folks we have a like the main thing is like like like think of what you're

663
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:05,760
doing and if the money was gone would you continue it assuming that you could get the money in some

664
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:11,360
other way right right because like to take money out of the equation would you still be doing this

665
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:16,880
thing see that's exactly why I think about like uh like your like the animation you did for endless

666
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:22,720
war for the end of season one uh was just done out of love and was so great and everybody loved

667
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,200
it for that you know little community that is the rowdy fuckers cop killers yeah and uh it was

668
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,560
truly legendary piece and it came out of nowhere and I didn't expect anything like that to happen

669
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,880
and it was like one day you were just like hey so I made this thing and I watched it and it was

670
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,000
like the coolest thing ever it was unironically my favorite piece of media definitely from the last

671
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,680
several years uh yeah and it was absolutely incredible so like I hope to see more stuff like

672
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,760
that from you I mean not it doesn't have to be that maybe something that actually makes any money as

673
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,800
opposed to literally zero oh yeah by the way everyone go to Gibbon Fortress 2 and watch that

674
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,960
a million times yeah please do we got to link that to Gibbon Fortress 2 for sure you can you can also

675
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,800
see it on twitch.tv slash rowdy frickers cop killers I gotta say the way that it that that happened

676
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:13,440
during a stream in rowdy fuckers like that was the most that was absolutely incredible no nobody

677
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,680
even I barely saw it coming god it was so great guys way to go I think you didn't even tell me

678
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,760
you were making it until like that day yeah I was I was just like oh I had the perfect idea and I

679
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:34,160
made it as fast as I possibly could yeah it was great the chat went nuts the chat went nuts don't

680
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,120
you love people with big projects like that it's my favorite it's my favorite it's it's pretty cool

681
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:46,400
but like what I love the most is when I go completely insane fast editing recording like every time I

682
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,760
have like a funny stupid give and take vlog idea that is just one stupid joke and I was like oh I

683
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:59,040
gotta make this I make it in like 10 minutes yeah yeah yeah the best idea is that you just bang out

684
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:05,200
they always like those those moments of inspiration like when a dwarf in dwarf fortress gets a oh god

685
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,800
what do they call it a fey mood pickaxe yeah yeah a fey mood or a weird mood or whatever it is like

686
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,640
I'm surprised you knew that mate I actually been watching no no I've been watching a person

687
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,120
played dwarf fortress with my boyfriend it's like fun stories yeah that's dope that's awesome like

688
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:28,080
that's where my like my my Ridley video and the subsequent okay like the Ridley one I was just

689
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:36,160
possessed with a ravenous inferno of inspiration to make a celebratory video about uh like the

690
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,440
inclusion of Ridley into smash bros at long last and luckily for me it's also like the most literally

691
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:47,680
the most popular game series except maybe for pokemon uh so people were interested and I like Ridley

692
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:55,840
because he's purple how basic of you who could have care so so so gib like what's your new focus

693
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:01,840
where what are you what are you working on primarily now well I'm I'm working right now I'm finishing

694
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:08,960
my comic bail jpe yes uh so definitely before the end of the year maybe even at the end of

695
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,560
october I don't know but I'm working hard on that oh shit and then I have like a lot of ideas for like

696
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:25,360
like I've had this idea generally for like doing music review not music videos um to

697
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:31,760
license music that will get copyright struck and like like a demonetize like uh in my head I'm

698
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,280
listening to it and it's like this is a perfect song I don't care if I don't get money I'm just

699
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,280
going to call it you know unmonetizable music video that's how I feel about my and then do that do a

700
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:48,000
bunch of those and just be like I don't know guys dance into it so is there well yeah I mean cool

701
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,080
dude I I want to see him also I also have like plans to make like adventure time but with my

702
01:05:54,080 --> 01:06:01,280
characters instead because I love adventure time just make adventure time but with me and hippo

703
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,040
you fame oh actually I want to ask you about this you famously rewatched all the adventure time

704
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,520
recently famously you're renowned for this don't don't talk about the finale because I'm on season

705
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,960
10 and I'm almost at the finale okay I won't talk about anything specific but I love the whole

706
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:21,440
show it's perfect you said Gibb that there was one bad episode uh to for to your estimation

707
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,680
and I want to ask I forget what that was and I maybe that I assume that it was correct one

708
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:33,520
ends it was season four episode three or four the spiders having marital problems that sounds

709
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,520
like a stuck in a web and they don't really do I remember that episode now I actually did see

710
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,160
that one okay but I wanted to bring up the worst episode I saw that made me quit the show was when

711
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,640
they brought back party god who was like in love with an island or something oh that was so weak

712
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,920
did you what did you think of that episode game I was really curious um the episode itself is fine

713
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,520
it's just where the party god is the guy that they use party god it has no relevance to anything

714
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:03,040
else party god is like hawn's mole man you don't want to know like what's going on with him behind

715
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,760
the scenes not to mention there's there's vast different continuities for the origin of hawn's

716
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,760
mole man that all conflict with each other and that's exactly how I like it thank you very much

717
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:18,800
I I like I rewatched the simpsons like a year a few years ago like the whole thing well there's

718
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,880
like there's like a thousand seasons well I watched like the first like 12 seasons or something like

719
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,320
it was a big marathon yeah um okay but like I didn't even realize that his his joke is that he dies

720
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:33,280
every time like he dies over and over more less yeah he's coming back I terrible things happen so

721
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,240
I may have mentioned that I watched this uh the simpsons simpsons tuber on youtube called the

722
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,760
real gyms who does uh he does a bunch of different simpsons related content but in

723
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,440
particular he does simpsons histories where he goes into like the whole timeline of like a character

724
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,200
and simpsons miss you you know them I love them I've seen a few I love the I love the real gyms

725
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,400
he did a simpsons histories about hawn's mole man oh good and uh there's cannot be like 35 or

726
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,560
something right well it depends because yeah the one in that in that like AA meeting he says like

727
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:14,960
I'm 35 years old uh but then in in a in a later episode he was actually like like 50 years ago

728
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,960
he was mayor of Springfield yeah because like he's in old homes for old folks homes sometimes and

729
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,120
it's it's yeah it conflicts and like I don't know it was interesting because like apparently his

730
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,640
early appearances he's like he's usually driving and he's usually interacting with patty and selma

731
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,040
and these are like the two things that are consistent in his like the first couple seasons

732
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,680
that he starts appearing fascinating fascinating yeah because he can't see he's like he's like yes

733
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,440
the old man because his glasses are so but he was probably introduced as a joke of like he's the old

734
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,840
man driving who like I don't know they'd fuck with or something well also in in an old tracy

735
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:56,160
omen short there is an old man in a movie theater who is questionably hawn's mole man he sort of

736
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,920
bears a slight resemblance to hawn's mole man okay it's probably based on him I bet there's

737
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:05,280
literally like a hawn's mole man episode uh because it's gone there is not that's so weird

738
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,520
there is not there is not a hawn's mole man spotlight episode did you say your sister's

739
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:16,640
husband's name is is hawn's no no I said I said it's so weird that his name is hawn's why why is

740
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,280
that weird I don't know it's just I never realized he had a name and now his name is hawn's isn't that

741
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:29,680
like some miscellaneous european name it's it's I think it's German oh yeah right hawn's well all

742
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:35,680
right he's probably actually a nazi I bet there's an episode about that uh because you know Germans

743
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:41,280
they're all bad um yeah he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't die in us with Abe Simpson he doesn't

744
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,560
die in a star as burns the one with the man getting hit by football that's good he should be the

745
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,920
star he should be celebrating it's gonna he's gonna go hit by football yeah a fate worse than death

746
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,720
uh hey we're winding down what do you say we get to the voicemails let's let's go yeah yeah yeah

747
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,720
let's do it up all right oh wait wait I got one more I got one more thing to talk about I got one more

748
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:08,240
life update oh whoa hey we were gonna get pumpkins later me and michelle what do you know hello what

749
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:16,080
happened to your voice I suddenly had a house and money for a second there was crazy how many

750
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,880
you think it's a fool's game Tom it's a fool's game what what's that Ben I said having a house

751
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,720
and money is a fool's game oh yeah uh hey how many pumpkins you think are going to be carved this

752
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:33,920
halloween to look like pump would you say all of them prop hopefully all of them and you have to buy

753
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,080
a funny jack o lantern face too so yeah you know nobody it's like hiding your power level but with

754
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:47,120
jack o lantern carving pumpkin so good I did carve a couple years ago I did carve some

755
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:53,440
problem sleuth pumpkins don't I'll do something I kind of want to carve a pumpkin someday saw my

756
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:00,640
bucket list uh fuck them oh it was uh I hate that shit it's dumb it's gay I love it it's it's like

757
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,360
it's like um it's like building something but you're destroying something instead when mom was

758
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,880
driving out here you know it's almost halloween and stuff she she stopped at like a halloween

759
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,360
pumpkin display thing and like they had the most she took pictures that she showed me the most

760
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,760
insane pictures of carved pumpkins I'm gonna see if I can get one for her to put on screen here

761
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,040
but it was like there was one for example that was uh it was like a tiger but the thing is they had

762
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:31,520
like shaved parts oh I hate that so like there were various lane it wasn't just like cutouts it was

763
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,520
yeah fucking you know what I mean like it was glowing at various degrees at various points like

764
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:42,240
based on how thick or thin the skin was yeah yeah there were other ones I I I hate those so much

765
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:49,280
why why are they try hard the no well in one way yes they are try hard but like it sort of

766
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,640
goes against the whole idea of it being a fucking carved fruit like like no it doesn't it's fine

767
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,240
I don't know they're still carving the fruit it's it's technically impressive I just don't

768
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,320
like it makes for a good image on your Instagram but doesn't make for a good fucking pumpkin you

769
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,720
want something to scare the kids outside well sure I don't like I don't like halloween but I guess

770
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:13,360
I guess carving pumpkins is the only is kind of an okay part of it because it's kind of creative

771
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,480
and it's kind of cool and it's not the not the getting sweets part I like that's a good part

772
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,280
that's not keto I never actually that's not keto halloween is not keto that's not keto at all

773
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:31,200
at all arguably the least keto holiday I get the children chocolate dipped potatoes

774
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,920
I kind of thought halloween had become an international thing during halloween

775
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,560
you know they run movies and there's like oh you know they sell candy and stuff like that but I

776
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,640
don't think anyone actually goes trick-or-treating or whatnot so it's sort of like an acknowledged

777
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:03,840
holiday but no one really you know does that thing people in the UK do celebrate it yeah but

778
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,840
obviously not as much as America we do I like I never really got into the whole trick-or-treating

779
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,640
that much I did it a couple times with my my brothers and we would just go around the neighborhood

780
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,680
but when I got into a teenager phase like other teenage teenagers and stuff they would go like

781
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,880
you know let's go around and and egg people's houses and do stuff that's on the simpsons and

782
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,000
like yeah that's yeah and then and then they were the young adults and let's like let's go get drunk

783
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,600
and do the same thing we did and I'm like I don't want to dress up anymore it's stupid I think like

784
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,440
I love the halloween version of halloween I went trick-or-treating twice but they weren't

785
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,760
too successful over times like the first time one of my friends was in the UK or in or in Latvia

786
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:54,880
or Lithuania oh I know I know you're Lithuanian I just fucked up it's okay it's okay in the first

787
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:01,280
time my friend's bag of candy was stolen by like teenage boys and I ran after them but I couldn't

788
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:08,400
keep up damn that sucks yeah and the the second time a lot of people just didn't open their doors

789
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,560
because they were rude wait was this in the UK no Lithuania yeah I you gotta go to like a good

790
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,240
neighborhood like there's the neighborhoods where like families live with lots of little kids

791
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:22,640
generally in America yeah well pretty good you know that was my neighborhood and you know my

792
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,960
neighborhood so yeah bombed out uh I just this whole conversation just tells me thinking about

793
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:35,280
how great America is for creating halloween and I'm picturing you know that picture of uh okay so

794
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:42,560
there's a picture of a fat wojak face fat feels guy face wearing an american flag and crying

795
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:48,080
shirt that says you will always be a mera fat but there's a variant of that that's which is coming

796
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:57,200
to mind which is it's super buff super swole a smug ass wojak uh wearing american flag boxers I think

797
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,640
and there's a noose around his neck but he's he's breaking the noose and it says you will always be

798
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:09,840
a mera fat um so it says the same thing but uh he's winning anyway his name is wojak yeah he's

799
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:16,240
he's made by this polish guy named wojak you're talking about feels guy yeah yeah I I did not

800
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:20,640
realize wojak is not realize he had a name I feel bad even calling him wojak it like that is

801
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:26,320
kind of one of his you guys are experiencing what made just I I only know him as feels guy

802
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:31,600
well okay that's perfectly acceptable but is that why they called bojack crossman bojack well maybe

803
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:38,000
he has a lot of feels a lot yeah maybe do that I wouldn't be shocked uh but do you have a life

804
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,880
update or should we go to the questions uh my life update is just yeah since I've been sick I may

805
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,200
have mentioned this before but it's getting sick I broke keto so that I could chug cough syrup and

806
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:54,400
get and get high on that lean um is that break keto cough syrup it's the sugar in it there's sugar

807
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,600
in it I mean I could have I was just like I'm gonna be eating cough drops and drinking cough syrup

808
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:05,280
so I'm just like can I get the bear cough syrup please yeah so I just uh so I just I haven't been

809
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,800
I was ready to chastise you hardcore but that barely counts in my in my well no no no it's because

810
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,640
like I was drinking the cough syrup but I have also just been eating carbs normally because I was

811
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:22,560
like I fuck it oh too bad okay guys yeah but I'll get back I'll get back on it I gained I gained a

812
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,120
couple pounds in water weight and I'm very I'm very you know it's very very distressing so you know

813
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:33,680
distressing um I since we were talking about Halloween I actually looked up of maybe buying

814
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:39,200
like candy corn online and like the thing is yeah the thing is I love candy corn nobody likes

815
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:46,480
candy corn I am candy corn is good advocate I hear people like the either love it or hate it

816
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,400
there's no in between I haven't heard a person say I was like oh they're kind of okay you might

817
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,600
like them but I don't or something like that I haven't I like them people that say that they're

818
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,800
people that say that they're bad and compare them to the sweethearts are criminals what is that a

819
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,360
real thing there's like a people are like oh candy corns grows oh it's just some chalky shit like

820
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:11,520
sweethearts oh my god sweethearts are literally in sweethearts aren't even food yeah they're disgusting

821
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:17,200
they taste like medicines yeah but yeah but like candy corn looks like soft cough syrup is literally

822
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:23,200
tastier than it is sweethearts and also it gets you high as well the good news mage is that people

823
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,080
have been harassing us for some people were telling us that we should send you candy corn I was like

824
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,800
she's a big girl she can get her own damn candy corn but at least the bullying will end now if you

825
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:38,160
seal this deal hopefully I get to decide if I want to because it's expensive and there's a lot and

826
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,720
what if I don't like it I don't want to just throw away like 15 quid worth of candy cord which is like

827
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:49,360
300 15 quid like it's it's it's costly to get it he it's to get it shipped here at least on amazon

828
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,720
from what I've looked it's 15 quid that's like four thousand dollars

829
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:57,440
he's just in line with a couple people maybe I'm a couple people I don't have friends Nate

830
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,040
what about a gay boyfriend uh I don't know you got your topa you've got your head mates you know

831
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,480
you've got a whole squad why don't you send your cat out to get some for ya that is important

832
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:13,280
send your send your cat out to get some have she's got a polar way the only thing my cat brings back

833
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:20,160
is rats wait what would you say geb I'm looking at amazon.com for candy corn little bag of candy

834
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:26,960
corn it's like six pounds it's half off that's good that's good oh right now wait put it on your

835
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:32,000
amazon wishlist all right I want to have like an amazon affiliate link in the description so you

836
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,280
can buy candy corn from the UK there's speaking of candy corn candy corn right now is teaching me

837
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:44,640
self-control because six quid for 300 grams that is madness it's a bit it's a bit shit but yeah

838
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,040
did you and me put out a whole big thing of candy corn and it's just sitting there and

839
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,920
I don't know if I said it on the pzp but Ben Ben inspired me to go keto so now I've been keto for

840
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:59,440
a week and I can't have it and it's very difficult but I'm learning to like consciously control

841
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,120
because like when I go out and buy food from like the store I have to like consciously make the

842
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,520
decision but with candy corn I could just grab it without thinking and I haven't fucked up yet

843
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,400
but it's there constantly tempting me I don't understand like a lot of people do this and I

844
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:17,280
don't get it people that like have like candy bowls out and I don't understand how people don't just

845
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:23,360
eat at all my work my workplace has a candy bowl with like just tons of fun-sized candies I'm

846
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:29,840
I'm eating that shit every day yeah it's not like when I'm around it's pointless yeah I don't

847
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,760
have no semblance of portion control like whatever the package is is a portion to me

848
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,080
yeah yeah yeah I know people that leave food I might have I think I got mad about this on the last

849
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:44,240
one people that leave food unfinished I don't understand people that leave that is more than

850
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:48,720
don't fit people that like will leave like a quarter of a sandwich unfinished and like put it in the

851
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,800
fridge for later that is a constant thing that happens in this house and I don't get it there's

852
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,120
happy and food everywhere I don't I don't get people that like don't finish their food when

853
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:05,360
you're full you stop yeah that's so rare no you stuff your face until it's done if you put a

854
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,480
personal pan pizza in front of me I will eat it and be satisfied if you put an extra large pizza

855
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:15,280
in front of me I will eat it and be sick but also satisfied I'll be full and I was like but I'm not

856
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:21,360
gonna not finish this pizza right there is there is some there is some hefty psychology um which is

857
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:28,880
what I'm gonna call it that uh seeing a plate uh like cleaned or food is like yeah incredibly

858
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:35,280
satisfying to some people and others not but like if you give like children like a big old

859
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:40,720
bucket of spaghetti they will eat as much as the of that as they possibly can but if you give them

860
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:45,120
like a small plate they will eat it and they will be just well they'll be happier I think you don't

861
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:50,400
feel like they got shortchanged right exactly it's all about the packaging like if the if the

862
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,080
large pizza came in two pizza boxes and you ate a whole box you'd probably be all right

863
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,800
yeah maybe I mean I love saving food for later and I yay I get to enjoy the rest of my food later

864
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,480
I'm happy about I mean I have leftovers I love I love having leftovers but I never but I rarely

865
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,560
do because I'm just so compelled there won't be any leftover if you're once you're done with that

866
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:16,560
yeah yeah I used to when I was a kid psychologically to just torture myself like whenever I didn't

867
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:22,000
finish my food I think I think about like but there's people out there who are hungry how can I

868
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,840
waste this food and it's like I did this when I was a little kid and I always finished my food

869
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:31,600
because of it because I felt guilty about wasting food I just get a job starving children this ain't

870
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,880
my problem and then I go about my day throwing my pizza in the trash all nine tenths of it

871
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:43,120
like I got I got so upset when I went to college and I had a friend like and for the friend like

872
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,920
the mom would pack her a lunch and she would like usually not eat it and just throw it away not even

873
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:53,760
touching it was like but why just take it home just poor plan just take it home the weird thing that's

874
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,240
me is like like there are like stores that will throw out their extra food at the end of the day

875
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,800
and not yeah it's like they can't resell it and then apparently like you know people like people

876
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,960
who need food will come and like take it and like there are stores now that will like dump bleach on

877
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,880
their leftovers so no one could eat it okay why why there is a reason to do that sort of thing

878
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:19,600
and it's that okay the market demand that they're satisfying is hunger they want to keep hunger there

879
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:25,440
so they can sell you food and if they just give away food then there goes their market so that's

880
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:32,000
some fucked up capitalism doesn't work shit right there kind of yes kind of I uh I um you know one

881
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,480
thing yes I've been off keto so I've finally been able to eat some of those pastries that my

882
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:42,560
housemate brings home from his uh job at the pastry shop uh not not too great I feel like I'm

883
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,720
gonna talk to you about this last week like that I had like I had a pastry and like they're never

884
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:51,280
as good yeah they're just not as good decreased or something right or they're just like they're fine

885
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,200
but they're like why was like why was I craving these so bad like they're just whatever they're

886
01:22:55,200 --> 01:23:00,240
just food do you think you're gonna have to like ease your way back in to keto again or do you

887
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,760
think like you're just gonna be able to flip the switch instantly and just get back I think it'll

888
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,560
be a I think it'll be a little bit of a challenge now that I'm out of it to shift gears back in but

889
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,800
you know I did it once I can do it again it's entering so far it's been surprisingly not as

890
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:18,960
hard as I expected yeah it wasn't as hard as I thought like you can eat you can eat to satisfaction

891
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,960
you can eat like you can eat a whole bunch of shit you can eat like a lot and like be full on

892
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:30,480
keto and it's fine I want to see uh I want to see a superpowered keto individual fight the vegan

893
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:36,240
superpowers and uh somebody on twitter the ultimate fight it was a while ago someone tweeted

894
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:41,200
I'm sorry I can't remember who it was because it was a while ago but someone made tweeted at me with

895
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:47,600
like a write-up for like a keto superhero it was a guy he would no it was like a guy he was like

896
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:53,280
he had two forms he had his his he was normal he was a really buff guy but he was just a normal

897
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:58,160
buff guy with no superpowers his superpowered form was that he would become really fat

898
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:03,280
but he would be keto but what in his super fat form he was fueled by his fat and therefore had

899
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:08,640
super keto powers okay it makes sense isn't that like it's an actual character in my hero academia

900
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,040
like he his fat gives him powers I forget his name I think I think you're thinking of choji

901
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:18,320
from Naruto no there is a guy in my hero academia but yeah there is a superhero and like as he uses

902
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,640
his power he gets skinnier because his fat gives him his powers yeah that happened didn't that happen

903
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,600
to choji didn't choji literally like burn off his fat long yep in his first and only good fight

what do you got for us buddy all right as of this recording it is october 14th and as you

909
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:05,520
no doubt remember I said earlier that october 15th is the official end date for the bounty

910
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:12,080
and I'm pleased to announce that it was a huge failure yeah no time stamps in the document

911
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:17,760
and uh the chances of the conspiracy ever being proven are between slim and none but hey there's

912
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,760
good news sorry about that you see after last week when I got my legs broken by those guys I got

913
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:27,440
by wolves but I managed to befriend them and now I live in a wolf den and I have a wolf family I

914
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,760
even got asked a wolf yeah the thing I was wearing this fursuit the whole time and asked for what

915
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,400
will happen to me well I was able to pay off the wolf mafia for protection so I don't think I have

916
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:41,600
to worry about the starfleet guys anymore so yeah I think I'm just gonna let the bounty die uh to

917
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,280
heck with this to heck with you guys uh I have a better family now uh wolf family I have my very

918

920
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:02,000

921
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,760
might find you get what you need like a wolf family yeah this is guy saying lyrics yeah yeah yeah

922
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,480
I'm a musical I'm a music man an end to this thing I don't even know kind of what the point

923
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:20,080
of all this was no I don't know where this was going um but I'm glad like a huge ass from the

924
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:28,000
beginning so this was just him like finding a way to come out as a furry I didn't explain why he had

925
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,920
that fursuit from the beginning I feel like the point of this was that his his bounty idea completely

926
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:39,280
failed and he needed to narrow but he needed to narratively justify it with the humorous conclusion

927
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:45,520
so he let us on a wild goose chase culminating in a wolf in a wolf in a wolf happy ending also

928
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:50,240
he's like we were we all were richer for it I wasn't aware of this link to a document that he like

929
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:55,280
wanted updated with timestamps anyway so like maybe if he'd given us that information uh we could

930
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,320
have helped him out maybe if only if only we had uh helped him out with that he would be he would still

931
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:05,200
be among humans true his own kind well he's fucked now but that's just a sale he's a total

932
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:11,920
romulus remiskay right now that's that's true uh so okay so here's one here's one from food boy

933
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,560
there's another message from him gross what we're past that but let's see what he's got

934
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:24,480
hey hear that sweet sizzling sound yeah of course you don't because you're weak weak of body from

935
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:28,400
a shit you're consuming and weak of mind there's not a single one of you managed to present a

936
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:35,040
non-retarded opinion food so lonely a venerated mealmaker to set the record and all of you faggots

937
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:41,120
straight the soulless process of assembling a hello fresh kid does not teach you and cannot be

938
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:48,160
considered cooking yeah understand what you're doing following orders like a fucking Nazi

939
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:56,480
switching out ingredients and methods of preparation and seeing what works it's a creative process as

940
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:03,120
opposed to the mindless adherence to dogma this mind washing service demands I agree I agree at least

941
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:08,080
you're eating real food when you're done good thing no one in the pcp proselytizes for going that

942
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:20,160
step wait fucking kill me all right um all right disagreed uh on all counts uh no he's on point he's

943
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:26,720
on point I'm I mean I'm not saying you can't you couldn't learn anything by cooking a hello fresh

944
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:32,080
meal I'm not saying it has no value the hell is hello fresh is it like hello kitty but different

945
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,880
we talked about last week if the service munchie has they deliver specifically the

946
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:43,120
ingredients you need to cook like one meal like oh terrible it's you know hello fresh is childish

947
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:47,600
hello fresh embarrassing is like a tutorial like you go online you're trying to learn like programming

948
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,520
or art or something and you follow the tutorial perfectly it's like oh I made this this little

949
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:56,640
baby thing but like it's not you would never like make a tutorial and be like oh I did it for real

950
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:02,000
like no that is like I guess that is like getting getting a lego kit building the lego kit and then

951
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:08,960
never ever experimenting with that lego yeah yeah a fair enough fair enough you people were

952
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:14,080
defending fluttershy when she was taking baby steps but it's not okay to get hello fucking fresh

953
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:21,360
fuck you all it is it is baby steps and uh and and it's it's training wheels and and if you just

954
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,360
really need to cook a nice meal right and you don't know what the fuck you're doing then yeah

955
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:29,760
you could maybe get some of this right the baby steps is you go to youtube or you go to google

956
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:35,200
you type in how to to cook x and then you find the ingredients list you go to the supermarket

957
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:40,720
you find what you can okay you're gonna save so much money in the long run if you just go buy

958
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:46,480
fucking groceries yeah you'll save money but what if I just want to save time by having them give me

959
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:52,320
literally everything I need and I can just cook that I think in the long run buying in bulk will

960
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:58,320
save you both but I don't want to think about it I just want other people to do the thinking for me

961
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:03,360
it's like not thinking about it it will result in you in the lifelong dependence of you right

962
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,440
subscribe if you don't want to think about it then why you want to learn how to cook like you're

963
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:13,040
clearly not interested in it okay you know what the longer the longer you the longer you go without

964
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:18,160
thinking about it the longer you are you're siphoning money off to these fucking millennials running this

965
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:24,560
bullshit millennial company you're not wrong as much as much as it sucks to burn a meal or to not

966
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:30,720
know what you're doing that those are like important formative steps to being a chef is to like okay

967
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:36,640
so if I if I put garlic in with the oil uh too early then it gets black before I put the other

968
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:42,320
stuff in so I got you know it's just like things you you learn that apply to loads of different

969
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,600
types of cooking and different meals that's true like you need to learn basics through trial and

970
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,720
error or like you know like you can use youtube tutorials and I guess hello fresh is fine once

971
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:58,080
or twice but you should never have it as like the be all and all I don't I don't think it's I don't

972
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:04,240
think it's worthless but I don't think it's worth much is I guess that's fair enough I kind of want

973
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,960
to try it though just for a time I don't know maybe I won't end up doing it by the way this talk of

974
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:15,760
millennial bullshit just reminded me of uh uh yesterday hello fresh is quintessential millennial

975
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:24,560
bullshit what characterizes to me what characterizes millennial bullshit is a desire to like fake

976
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:30,640
creativity and individuality and hello fresh embodies this idea that you have a shortcut

977
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:36,640
that you have this like shortcut that you can pay for to like fake a to like fake a creative skill

978
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:41,840
I guess that's true I guess that's kind of it's it's it's like buying a ready meal but you know it

979
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:49,760
it's it's it's the selling beads on Etsy of cooking it's I did speaking of ready meals like like

980
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,000
we had like a person knock on our door which is weird how did he get in because we have like the

981
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,760
um we live in a flat and you know like the it was like not the outside it was the inside door so

982
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,240
that was weird and he was like so he knocked on a door and he was offering like some sort of service

983
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:12,080
of gusto I think.co.uk and it's it's like you order a meal specifically like a meal on their

984
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,640
site and they make it for you and then they deliver it which is kind of like takeout but you know

985
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:23,760
their meals are like not like pizzas and burgers they're actually kind of cool yeah I was like oh

986
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,880
that's kind of neat I might I might try that and that sounds like the sort of uh thing they have in

987
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:34,160
old people's homes that they deliver it does but I like those I like those a lot I yeah I'm not

988
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,800
saying that that is like is a bad thing it's like yeah you know fair enough by the way you you want

989
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:44,240
to order a roast dinner it's a way it's a way it's a way to try out all these new different recipes

990
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:49,040
of foods and stuff speaking of this millennial bullshit though that I was mentioning uh when me

991
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,960
and my mom went out to this place Finley Market you know whatever it's a nice place around in

992
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,520
Cincinnati highly recommended uh but like have you guys been aware I don't know how many of you

993
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:03,520
guys live in cities but like there's been these these things I've seen around of just like people

994
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,680
using these scooters they're just using scooters and then you'll just see them on the side of the

995
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,440
road this is like in the like not the inner city but like in the city there's like urban centers

996
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:18,320
you'll see like there's just like green scooters three hours ago did I well I figured it out I

997
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:23,280
figured out what the issue was and I rode them and it was dope it's all right here's what it is

998
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,240
there's these two services called like a bird and lime and what they are are

999
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:35,520
they just leave scooters around the city and you can use the apps to GPS locate where they are

1000
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,280
you go to them you scan them in your phone and then they activate they're all they're all electric

1001
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,280
and then you can just scoot around on them like like an electric skateboard only you know a scooter

1002
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:50,960
I've seen I've seen like I've seen like in Boston there's like bike racks with like bikes that I

1003
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,920
similar to that yeah there's like and you like you can like rent a bike and like ride it between

1004
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,200
like bike locations there's a bike rack like that around UC in Cincinnati as well it's just like

1005
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,680
that it's called like blue something I want to the ones in UC are red everything in the city is

1006
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:09,520
red because that's like the color but like the the thing about these is that you literally leave

1007
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,160
them on the side of the road you just leave them there and you you say that you're done riding

1008
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:18,080
after like 10 minutes right in the middle of the road well what stops someone from just taking

1009
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:22,960
absolutely nothing except the fact that they're probably GPS tracked or something well I don't

1010
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,600
know I'm probably also the the fact that they're electric and they won't like maybe the brakes are

1011
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,680
on by default and you you can't like ride it around without yeah being activated but couldn't

1012
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:36,400
you just like pick it up and toss it in your truck or something you you definitely could do that I

1013
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,160
don't know exactly what stops them but it's gotta be something they must have a business model here

1014
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:46,960
that if they're GPS track that they are yeah yeah yeah yeah maybe easy easy crime easy crime catch

1015
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,520
it's pretty cool though and we rode them and they were fun and I liked it though I missed my skateboard

1016
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:57,600
was it uh expensive uh no it was like it was like I don't know five bucks for me and my mom

1017
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,480
both took a ride for like I don't know 20 minutes or something uh that's pretty good you know maybe

1018
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,560
it was less I didn't actually check how much it costs now I think about it but it said like a minute

1019
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,600
or like a dollar for like an hour or something I don't know I could be wrong but it was it was

1020
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,480
cool I liked it I've never I've never seen scooters like that it was but it was I don't think we

1021
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,080
have them around this is kind of like app-based activation city living things just such millennial

1022
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,600
bullshit and I'll just have none of it thank you very much but that doesn't sound bad though

1023
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:32,080
millennial bullshit is characterized by being bad I don't agree with that uh what's it called

1024
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,480
what's called birds one's called mime they're two absolute the exact same thing

1025
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:41,200
they're called scootaloons that's true all right let's move along we've got another

1026
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:46,320
that would be a good epony for this blue bikes the thing is called blue bikes

1027
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,400
metroboston's bike share program all right well it's uh it was the thing we've got around here

1028
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:56,640
yeah all right here here's another one this one this one's called the dreamy or the dreamer army

1029
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:03,040
anthem and I believe it's by center point let's it's it's 10 seconds long let's see what this is about

1030
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:09,760
wait how long are you saying 10 seconds yeah

1031
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,760
fucking it shit okay that that's all it is I think what this is is I think these are the

1032
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,960
people that are very much hashtag let mage dream and this is their anthem I didn't think that's

1033
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:29,440
a classic beat sequence is that the the segment intro I think yeah that's the intro oh guys you

1034
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:34,640
know what this is actually a great idea um it'd been proposed that we should do this at some point

1035
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,600
maybe this should be like a separate show or I guess it could be an episode but literally like

1036
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:45,520
the dream cast and the here's what it here's the conceit of the show oh my god you play dream cast games

1037
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:51,520
in uh like let's play format while discussing your dreams that's the that's the format oh wouldn't that

1038
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,400
be sick isn't that dope I mean we have a dream yeah yeah I think that's not people suggest that that's

1039
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,640
yeah we could do that for for heckles for shekels we should do that cast one of those heckles for

1040
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:06,480
shekels dream cast um it's a good idea it's for for dreams and if you feel if you viewer if you

1041
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:11,600
feel strongly uh that people should be allowed to dream or if you feel the opposite way that

1042
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:17,120
dreams should be banished and abolished and punishable by death uh you got to get in the uh

1043
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:22,320
procrastinators bonus lounge and to argue your point you got to get in there and be a soldier

1044
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,040
yeah true for whatever side you uh you want yeah yeah yeah we need to there's the there's a civil

1045
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:34,960
war there's a civil war breaking out the dreamers versus the memers and it's dreamers will dominate

1046
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:42,080
dreams will be crushed uh memers for life your dreams are my memes uh right okay so there you go

1057
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:53,360
I'm not gonna fast anymore this is the faster guy I am on an eight hour fast right now but it's only

1058
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:58,960
because my mom's doing busy fucking her new boyfriend anyway you guys were talking about

1059
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,520
your and if you didn't hear it from my accent already I'm from the Netherlands and there's

1060
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,200
this something we do here in the Netherlands we speak Dutch so I was wondering how are you

1061
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:15,040
guys with foreign languages do you speak any do you want to learn any is Esperanto cool or is the

1062
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:21,360
meme it's a meme questions sorry about that okay bye yes I do speak a foreign language

1063
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:28,080
Esperanto is a meme but as a memer I'm all about it I'd like Esperanto to replace all the languages

1064
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:34,320
I think why not why not have a language that people already speak be the language that takes

1065
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:40,160
over the world it's an ideal what is what is this what is Esperanto oh uh give Esperanto is a

1066
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:45,360
it's not fictional but like it's a it's a one-man made a team made up a language that was supposed

1067
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:53,840
to be like easy to use easy to learn it's like similar you know how it's around Star Wars there's

1068
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,920
like basic where everybody in the fucking universe knows basic so they can communicate with each other

1069
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:03,520
that's what Esperanto is but here in Star Trek Star Wars and Star Trek both have this I believe

1070
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,600
yeah I think so and it's called basic in both I call common well I'm everything

1071
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:14,240
that's indeed it's called out wait wait hold on Star Wars and Star Wars both have a common language

1072
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,080
called basic I know it's called basic and Star Wars I don't know what's called the Star Trek

1073
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:23,360
it is called galactic basic standard according to the wookiepedia let me see basic

1074
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,680
language

1075
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:34,560
it's brought up Klingon top 10 Star Trek languages to answer the question maybe Star Trek doesn't

1076
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:40,160
have basic maybe yeah maybe it's just uh my my favorite foreign language wait it's not favorite

1077
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:45,680
I'm not good at anything I can speak English but only bail federation standard there's a federation

1078
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:53,280
standard language uh so there you go I studied Spanish I studied Spanish in high school and

1079
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:58,240
through a bunch of college so for like six years or something I took Spanish class I was supposed

1080
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:03,440
to be really good at it I did really well in Spanish class when I graduated college never used

1081
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:07,440
it it's completely decayed I don't use it at all it was totally a waste of my time same with me in

1082
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:13,440
German and then when I went to Poland I learned a couple of phrases because I wasn't interested

1083
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:18,160
in learning another language for a country that I was probably never going to go back to right I

1084
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:25,120
I learned a bit of German I know a bit of Russian by like cultural osmosis yeah yeah the

1085
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:30,320
unfortunate thing about languages nowadays is that in order to learn a language you need to

1086
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:36,160
really really really want to like I have like oh yeah wouldn't it be cool to have like no a language

1087
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:41,120
but the only reason the only reason I would need to learn a language or like would would want to

1088
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:46,400
learn a language is to impress other people with how many languages I learned this is and not because

1089
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:51,200
I really want to go places and use it yeah I know because I don't need to everyone speaks English

1090
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,800
well I mean I have a strong desire uh uh

1091
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:01,680
my inichi nihongo de hanashitai no no no uh benkyoshitai every day I want to learn Japanese

1092
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:06,400
because there's actually a real tangible benefit uh because not everything gets translated fast

1093
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,560
you're a weeb enough for me I'm big enough into the weeb shit that learning Japanese would be

1094
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,600
actually useful to me and so why don't you and did you gonna make your Japanese video series I mean

1095
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,760
I've still got I'd love to do it now once we move and we're closer we should talk about that more

1096
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:25,280
but like I think I'm learning Japanese I think I'm like I have an app I've been bad the last I

1097
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,600
know a couple of weeks I want to be practicing Japanese every day on my little app what's called

1098
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:35,920
it's called uh Memrise Memrise it's pretty good um we're like more like meme rise hey you're not

1099
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:43,200
wrong it's accurate team memer for the win another point for us come on dreamers pick up a pace I

1100
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:49,120
would like I would like to accidentally learn a language like Bart did in that episode of

1101
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:54,080
Simpsons where we learned French just by being in France like that's how the most efficient and

1102
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,320
best yeah it just clicked one day it just clicked and suddenly he could speak perfect French I always

1103
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:03,280
do that like if I if I go to like Swahili or something I like I stay around there and I like

1104
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:09,200
suddenly I'm speaking with everyone and I'm like you know I become a pirate 13 Swahili country uh

1105
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:14,240
Swahili language I can't remember I don't think there's a place called the Swahili cut wait maybe

1106
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:20,240
there is you know that episode of Simpsons where Bart learns French I always thought that you know

1107
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:23,920
like he's talking like trying to get that Constable or whatever the the French police to like help him

1108
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:30,400
with his whatever it is and uh like the Constable like gives him a big pink candy I always thought

1109
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:36,640
that candy like somehow let him speak French suddenly like it was like a I really thought that

1110
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:41,360
for a long time because it's like as soon as it gives him this very strange looking candy

1111
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:46,000
he can suddenly speak French and I stand by it actually I still think that's what happened

1112
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,160
now I want to go and re-watch that you see I would prefer to learn I prefer to learn a language

1113
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:54,640
like in Dexter's laboratory when he has to study French for a French test and he only

1114
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:59,440
learns omelette du fromage and all the girls are instantly wet for him and yeah yeah that's

1115
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:05,840
that's the way to be yeah that's accurate but like it's it's it is like a better use of your

1116
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:12,080
time to go to a country and just be an idiot for a while um living living among like real people

1117
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:17,440
not in a tourist trap um and then you'll you know you go to the market and you say uh you know you

1118
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:21,680
have the pocketbook of like basic phrases but then you'll learn more as people speak to you yeah

1119
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:26,400
you gotta be like you gotta be like Jeff Ferrell the soccer guy you gotta go to Mexico City you

1120
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:31,680
gotta go to all right Cuba and Canada you gotta go to the city center juggle your soccer ball

1121
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:37,920
get called a gringo get them to take pictures of you uh decide no no teach teach random strangers

1122
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:43,040
English even though they didn't ask you to come home come home and try to and decide that maybe

1123
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:47,520
I'll become a Spanish teacher even though I barely learned any Spanish and my Spanish sucks damn

1124
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,400
yeah that's a bold plan that's that's how that's how to live anyone could pull it off it's our boy

1125
01:44:52,400 --> 01:45:02,240
Greg um with Jeff Jeff right um yeah whatever it doesn't matter okay let's move on next call from

1126
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:09,600
mr bones rattling them up lads let's see what we got I'd like to express my sincere appreciation

1127
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:15,760
for munchie j trump and the way that he criticizes the other members of the pcp in a kind of playful

1128
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:21,440
ribbing manner you know like the way he takes digs uh the kind of miniature cultur personality

1129
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:27,440
surrounding Nate so I'd like to invite the rest of you to take a moment and give a small piece of

1130
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:33,360
critique about another one of your fellow pcp members uh also mitian is gay fuck you

1131
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:41,520
well fair enough uh I mean I do like that about munchie like when he sees something

1132
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:46,240
that nobody's talking about and he will just say it because it's like it's funny to draw attention

1133
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:52,000
yeah no it's good it's good uh a lot of the times people can be too worried about offending their

1134
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,840
friends or something and I want to rock the boat yeah the thing the thing is with munchie that he

1135
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:01,600
has that that that boyish charm that makes it like water for ducks back and we know we don't get angry

1136
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:08,400
at him that's true even though we all agree he he he takes he can take the core gesture of the pcp

1137
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:13,120
there's no he can he can take refuge in audacity you know what I'm saying you know what I mean by

1138
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:19,120
that I know yeah he can compress those waveforms and it sounds fine no that's not because the court

1139
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:24,720
jester uh traditionally could say things to the king that like if like a serious lawyer brought it

1140
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:30,080
up he'd probably get fucking executed but the gesture can be like he's like he's he's like the pcp

1141
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:35,680
the the contingent of like serious lawyers well you know discussion about as as clowns go he's more

1142
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:40,480
like the evil kefka like whispering in our ear with his fork tongue just like telling us sweet

1143
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:45,360
nothing's in like gradually turning us into who is that king in lord of the rings kefka kefka

1144
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:49,760
didn't whisper in anyone's ear except when he was fucking sling their throat here who is who is the

1145
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:55,840
guy in um in yeah worm tongue and lord of the rings yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

1146
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,880
true i'm confusing him with worm tail from her that's a named character i think if we're talking

1147
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:06,000
about gentle ribbing uh i'd like to say munchie sucks and i think we all agree and that's you know

1148
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:10,560
frankly all there is to be more specific you have to be specific otherwise it's just a gentle

1149
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:16,160
let's let's see if we can think of some some some actual minor gentle ribbing criticisms um

1150
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:22,000
i'll i mean i'll i'll come out sure you're pretty like munchie you're not afraid to stir the munchie

1151
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:30,720
has i mean munchie has uh where's fuck where's fucking investigators yeah fair okay okay i know

1152
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:35,920
i mean i will say that i know he has released some pages i don't know how many there's someone

1153
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:40,560
his tumbler but he has not made it public at all and i interpret this gesture to mean that he

1154
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,960
is not actually ready to have people see it probably because if he was he would say he would

1155
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,920
announce it he's been very secretive about it they're up on his tumbler and i feel like he put

1156
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,000
some out just sort of to like be like yeah yeah i put something out like i'm getting something done

1157
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:59,760
but it's not ready and he like it needs to get ready it's still not ready fuck you

1158
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:06,800
uh good i don't know what i should say but you know i'm guilty too i'm guilty of the same thing

1159
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:12,240
with vapers three yeah where the fuck is vapers three it's coming a bunch of stuff but i mean i

1160
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:17,200
mean that's fair you know i've been where i've been working on the max reviving tbap i've got a

1161
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,120
while i was working on ten paces and draw for a while you have a whole list you have a whole

1162
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:26,720
list of shit i i bang out a new page of vapers three whatever i get like a free day yeah yeah

1163
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:34,080
i still like seeing vapers the the vapers on on my shelf next to like home stuck and problem

1164
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:39,680
sleuth it's fun man when vapers three is done i'm so i'm so excited for the second kickstart i think

1165
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:43,840
the second kickstarter will do even better than the first one probably because i'm gonna have bundles

1166
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,000
i'm gonna offer bundles because i know a lot of people people sometimes ask me like hey where can i

1167
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,040
buy the vapers out none of the kick starters over and i tell them hold on i'm not just selling it

1168
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:58,160
like on a one-for-one basis i don't want to just like sell like sell just whenever just whenever

1169
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:02,960
anyone happens to email me no they'll be like available for the second kickstarter and i feel

1170
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,400
like there's a lot of people that miss the first kickstarter and will want to get in on the second

1171
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:10,560
one along with all the third people that did get in on the first one that are gonna want to buy

1172
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:16,800
volume two uh i'm really excited and uh i want to finish vapers three before before i run that

1173
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:23,680
campaign though yeah anyway good that's that's uh that's sorry to derail about that yeah whatever

1174
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:30,080
no past all right mr. bones there you go we discussed things nobody else nobody nobody else

1175
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:38,160
you fucking cow i have i have a i have a gentle ribbing of of of nate uh you suck no uh you have

1176
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:43,840
um a tendency yeah i mean i've told you this like in private so it's not even really a big deal but

1177
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:49,040
you have a tendency to bring in like topics that are not real they're just like here's

1178
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:54,880
something that happened today lol and then and you hope that that will like blossom into a big

1179
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,960
discussion i mean it didn't happen this time so my because i thought it was really good give me

1180
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:05,120
give me do you have do you have an example um the last time the skateboarding one is what we talked

1181
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:09,760
about nate nate just brought up the fact that he was on a skateboard and he liked it and that was

1182
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
topic that he brought forward cool that's yeah i mean i use you change it around for this one i will

1183
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,680
agree there okay well that's but i have to rip someone i have to rip it somewhere i'm a little

1184
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:25,360
fraught no that's fair that's fair it's true i guess we all gotta we all gotta make sure we

1185
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:32,320
bring something actually good and not just more shit thing more more more ribs um tom someone killed

1186
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:37,920
me someone killed me well hang on okay i got one for tom you can't do it i'm too powerful i don't

1187
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:44,320
understand where your career is going tom and it confuses me and i i feel that what this really

1188
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:51,680
indicates is is a lack of like uh communicating to your audience where you're like like are you

1189
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:57,360
working on getting a game done right now or are you let me let me let me let me simultaneously

1190
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:03,760
bolster that statement as well as pose a follow-up question um so you were talking before about

1191
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:09,760
a game demo i don't know anything about the game you're making yeah i mean wait i i have

1192
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,880
a sort of a sense that it is it's a side scrolling action platformer right correct i know that i i

1193
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:18,960
think i know that much about it i've been i've released it of a devlog every day this month

1194
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:24,480
there's 13 of them out yes the fact that we don't know that is a problem was it on maybe is it on

1195
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:30,240
polystation uh it should be they're on youtube and they've been tweeting about them on twitter every

1196
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:36,000
day and oh you know it starts with like they all so okay i guess this is on me then shit i have

1197
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:44,080
seen those pcp uh like um feed for content like did you upload them all at once um first 13 i they

1198
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:48,320
were originally private because i was doing them for patrons but i was like fuck that uh people

1199
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:53,280
should see these okay so that was kind of a cared yeah so but for the last like five days they've

1200
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:57,920
been up to public every day and there's another one coming out today those all appeared at once

1201
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,680
and i was like well i don't really want to watch all of them i'd rather just see the finished product

1202
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:07,600
or like see like here's my promo trailer like here's my game okay that's all fair here's here's

1203
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:13,600
a thing give an elevator pitch for this game it's a side scholar in the style of a classic

1204
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:18,160
sega game with more forgiving controls and expanded mechanics make it more appealing to

1205
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:24,640
modern gaming tastes okay i mean maybe this is all way premature like like maybe you're

1206
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,000
playing to get it out in like three years or something and i don't know i'd like that's

1207
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,560
he said you said you were gonna put a demo out in like the next couple weeks right yeah i'm trying

1208
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,360
to get some sort of like demo slash vertical slice in people's hands by november 8th because that's

1209
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:42,400
when i'm gonna be an old man and i want to have something i'm semi-proud okay well i i guess my

1210
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:49,440
question is so is this the main thrust of what you're working on um for right now but like okay the

1211
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:54,880
whole idea is that like i want to have like kind of like the the assuming characters like a multimedia

1212
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,960
project there's going to be like animations and motion comics and games and stuff but like the

1213
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:03,520
game is just something like tangible and like meaty okay that i can get done and like have a

1214
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,760
forearm 30 so that's what i want to work on right now you know that right there is interesting i feel

1215
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:15,280
like this this concept of a multifaceted multimedia like character it like it confuses me like what

1216
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:20,720
that's going to and i just think that as like a viewer i just like i'm left with nothing i can

1217
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:24,880
grab onto except the game like the game obviously is the thing that you're talking about so maybe

1218
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,840
i'm just talking out of my ass here i don't know what platform what platform what platform are you

1219
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:35,760
building the game in uh it's uh construct three it's like a it's like a visual programming

1220
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:41,120
sort of thing right now you'll be able to play it on your pc gaming system band that's yeah it'll it'll

1221
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:45,040
be a very i don't know i knew it was going to be a pc game i mean like what engine like game

1222
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:50,640
game maker yeah it's it's something like game maker essentially is what it is okay my playful rib

1223
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:55,120
is i have no idea what the hell you're ever doing tom and now you're explaining it to me which is good

1224
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:59,840
but now i'm wondering if maybe that's my fault maybe i just haven't been paying attention well

1225
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:04,880
the audience could only blame itself so much for not right i did be in you know i did see uh i did

1226
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,680
i did see you were uh the slime i did see you modeling that slime which was very pertinent to

1227
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:15,040
my entry that is like i have a death animation for an hour it blows up into like a pile of slime

1228
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,960
and it looks cool cool all right well okay well i will definitely go check this out now that i

1229
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:24,880
understand more uh well this is good feedback i will try and be more blatantly obnoxious about

1230
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:29,280
developments so people can actually see it i think what would be helpful for me like if i like if you

1231
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:35,600
made a video that's like i'm making a game it's whatever azumi fucks everyone that's the name

1232
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:41,120
guys come into your computer right now you like jack and your dick you like furries i'm your man i'm

1233
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:46,800
tom oliver i am a furry uh you know something you want him to make a billy maze commercial

1234
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:53,520
that would work i mean it would it would be pretty fun uh yeah well whatever okay i get the point

1235
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:58,000
we're not we're not trying to fucking break the man's spine here more more more more more

1236
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:02,240
more ribs i have a rib for all of us because i'm trying to think of one thing in particular

1237
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:07,120
okay that that bugs me but we all do this we when it comes to the pcp we all suck at making

1238
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:11,120
decisions we all sit here and discuss it for 10 hours and all the good things that have happened

1239
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:16,960
to pcp lately it's just one of us just doing it and letting it be real like what uh the voicemails

1240
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:21,440
i just did it and that happened and then that just happened like these were things no censor that

1241
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:26,880
censor that that can't be on the episode put a beep over that no one can know no one can know

1242
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:35,200
what is it okay uh it it matters to me it when when will they know uh soon okay i promise i promise

1243
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:40,240
i guess i'd assume this would already been talked about on an episode because again this

1244
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:45,200
just reinforces my point that it takes too long for the shit to happen okay no you tom you're total

1245
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:51,440
i agree with you on a lot of this but the thing is uh like like that thing happened and i'm like

1246
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:55,600
let's run with this and then people are like um actually i don't think that's where i think we

1247
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,440
should like gib was doing this i don't actually think this is perfect like we want to change

1248
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:03,760
something and you know what i actually agree on some of those points but that's where we hit

1249
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:08,720
snacks you know with those sorts of uh the pcp is not a perfect production and it needs to just

1250
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:13,520
be flawed and bullshit so it can actually get things done i you know i know it feels like

1251
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:18,800
everything moves at a glacial pace but like i understand why like like when i when we get

1252
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:24,000
into a meeting and we're talking like it's not like it's nonsense like that it makes sense why

1253
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,800
there's like disagreements and we can't move forward yeah and those have to be resolved in some way

1254
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:33,040
which they almost always can be if we meet and like people show up to the means which none of you

1255
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:38,400
did except for munchy yesterday so you know well i was like was there a thing was there a thing to

1256
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,720
be discussed at yesterday's meeting was there like a specific i mean there was at least one there was

1257
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:46,800
actually this exact topic that we're censoring right now was the one i wanted to discuss with

1258
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:54,160
everybody i am usually not abreast of what is going on that is why i usually just i just i just

1259
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:59,520
just don't worry about meetings when i happen to be when i happen to be at my computer since we

1260
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,280
can't actually talk about this since it's centered i'm going to dovetail this off into another targeted

1261
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:08,880
rib digi i know you're not here but you can't fucking complain about things changing in the pcp

1262
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,720
and being mad about it when you don't show up if you don't show up that is there yeah you can't

1263
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:18,720
that's not yeah the thing is with digi he thinks the meetings are pointless for some reason uh but

1264
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:24,560
then he doesn't they are the only thing that gets things moving and done basically uh well at least

1265
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:30,560
like the bigger issues not not like like i'm just going to make the voicemails was great uh yeah i i

1266
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,000
think well of course he would think that they're pointless because he doesn't come to them and

1267
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,480
then there's things just happen without him thinking about him so to him it just seems like

1268
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:43,680
things just happen on their own right but that but he expresses great disdain in these changes

1269
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:46,880
and like says like in this upset that they're happening like well if you want to

1270
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:52,480
make them not happen be there when the changes are happening i mean i just for example digi

1271
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:57,680
i'm not trying to show you too hard but if you ever came in into the pcp discord like added everyone

1272
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:04,560
and said hey guys like what are the relevant topics like i'm there all the time and i'm there to explain

1273
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,960
everything that's going on digi you don't even need to do that you can just go up one flight of

1274
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:13,760
stairs and be like hey tom what's going on that's that's true but i mean i don't know like i kind of

1275
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:18,080
i kind of feel for digi only because like like because the pcb is set up to be like that you

1276
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:23,120
don't have to worry about it unless you want to pretty much yeah like you know yeah i mean i'm fine

1277
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:28,720
with him not participating as long as he doesn't then complain and bitch and moan which he has does

1278
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:34,880
sometimes once in a while i don't know yeah i don't blame him that much it's not that big a deal

1279
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:42,640
but i that's fair that's fair criticism of the guy um well the thing okay so gib uh i would have

1280
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:47,760
criticized probably up to this point the fact that like i don't know exactly what your goals are

1281
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:52,720
like i'm not sure you like you seem to have a feat in multiple worlds and you seem indecisive

1282
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:57,520
but then you've just made a huge decisive step which i think is very good for you to do in in some

1283
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,800
direction that you're confident so like that criticism is kind of curtailed by you doing yes

1284
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:08,880
and taking those actions so dodged yeah so that's real i mean again i'm not happy at all that like

1285
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:14,800
the hypocrite reviews won't be coming or at least not nearly as regularly if ever uh but like you

1286
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:20,320
know facing reality making big decisions hard choices about how to handle your life mate here's

1287
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:25,440
a fucking rib you're terrible at ribbing you're such a little skating yeah yeah yeah yeah these

1288
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,640
are these are pussy that's you're you're right you can feel like you're reading you're reading some

1289
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:35,040
little you're reading some little pussy some little pussy piglet pork ribs you gotta get the big

1290
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:40,800
ass beef ribs you know i'm saying the table and it just there's there's no they are absolutely

1291
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:48,880
both right now so you know well at least he's giving some uh let's give major rib all of us guys

1292
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:55,280
how about a mage i don't understand uh how you make any money if you make any and this worries me

1293
01:59:55,440 --> 02:00:00,400
and i'm confused by it that's what i have to say to you friend what's your business model

1294
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:08,400
i i do come i do i do come you know commissions that's what it is i yeah i didn't really post them

1295
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:13,040
but yeah are those things that like can't be posted because they're like you know they're

1296
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:18,080
four people so like they use them for projects and then they're up doing stuff some of them yeah

1297
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:23,120
sometimes i just i'm just lazy mage is a prolific porn artist with commissions she just doesn't

1298
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:29,760
want to ruin her innocent image on the piece she never talks about it her dark her her after dark

1299
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:36,400
pain yeah uh shit what was i gonna say oh it's like um we like with some of the people that i work

1300
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:40,640
with like who've made like music for me or something like i'll want to keep the thing a secret but

1301
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:45,520
then like once the project that it's for comes out then like like then they're like allowed to like

1302
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:50,080
retweet it or like make it public that they like did this work or something so like i don't know maybe

1303
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:56,320
i don't know you know my criticisms i guess aren't even really that relevant you're just

1304
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:01,120
kind of in a totally different world than me that i couldn't really follow even if i wanted to i mean

1305
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:05,360
i could i guess but it would be who you talking to right now talking to mage i'm talking to mage

1306
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:11,760
like the world of commissions is one i don't understand or you know yeah it's it's like uh i

1307
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,880
don't i mean when you do a commission mage i'm curious do you post it on your like social media

1308
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,560
and stuff do you post it like hey guys look what i did or do you just give it to the buyer and like

1309
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:25,920
don't give it to the buyer and then i'm too lazy to post it most of the time well there you go dog

1310
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:31,920
what's your future business plan how do you grow from here and get more money and you know build

1311
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:37,520
that 401k i like doing commissions and i'm not short of them right now it's like i'm currently

1312
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:43,360
i hate doing commission i like i'm i'm so envious of you for being able to do commissions i could

1313
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:50,720
make so much more money if i just didn't hate doing other people's dirty work ha yeah yeah i used to

1314
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:55,280
not like them back in the pony days because all of all i i had to do is draw ponies can you draw

1315
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:02,800
my lc fucking twilight sparkle i mean like i like drawing ponies but it got really boring because

1316
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:07,760
i had to draw like basically the same things in a way but now i get i'm getting varied requests

1317
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:13,680
and i quite like that perfect perfect scam you just make a show accurate template

1318
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:21,040
and then you just swap out assets on like the whoever's on top you swap out to be their oc and

1319
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:25,120
the one on the bottom you swap out to be the main six of their choice makes sense and then you can

1320
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:31,600
have uh yeah yeah you can have uh yeah yeah infinite infinite commissions available in a moment's

1321
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:38,880
notice your character here whoa uh whoa that's a funny joke that should have been a real character

1322
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:44,160
i get it i get it why is why are we not actually doing this makes so much money who says we're

1323
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:48,400
oh we could we could have made money i don't know if we still we'd probably make something still

1324
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:55,440
i mean furries are still evergreen right furries will never stop be cash cows yeah yeah yeah like

1325
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:59,440
the the pony thing may be on the on the decline but furries are forever i mean the pony fans have

1326
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:04,800
to go somewhere and where else what's more adjacent to pony than furry the only place for them to go

1327
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:11,280
is patreon.com slash tbbvap that's the best bitch about ponies they all get they all get a migrate

1328
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:18,880
from derpy borough to fur affinity probably true um all right that was a good healthy round of ribbing

1329
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:24,960
going around um all right let's let's move on next up uh we got we got i think there's four more of

1330
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:34,000
these um bongo fag let's see whoa play one for me champ i asked you pcp how can i go to a school

1331
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:41,760
literally called friend school and at the same time feel like i have no friends because like i

1332
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:48,320
talked to people at my school and even follow a couple of them on fucking instagram but they all

1333
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:55,200
feel like ghosts they all feel unreal and transparent and i've considered the possibility

1334
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:00,800
that perhaps i'm just too intelligent for all of them i'm just too woke for all the normies yeah

1335
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:06,960
yeah yeah i was like i was saying gay ass podcast every week right this is what did it but i've also

1336
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:12,880
thought that perhaps they're all intelligent too intelligent for me oh no that i'm just no that

1337
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:22,160
can't be it he's breaking the condition please send help uh i i would say that like it sometimes it is

1338
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:28,480
that you are like you know more intelligent in that you have deeper interests in stranger things

1339
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:32,880
and that they can't understand you like stranger things so much more than everybody else it's just

1340
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:41,760
a real yeah no oh yeah i hate that thing lol um um i i mean i don't believe i i know this guy was

1341
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,760
memeing to a certain extent but i'm just gonna take his yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna engage with

1342
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:51,040
his question yeah i'm gonna engage with his question on on literal terms um i don't really

1343
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:55,840
believe in intelligence as like a metric like some people are just more or less like it's not that's

1344
02:04:55,840 --> 02:05:02,000
simple uh people just have people are on different wavelengths people's people's you know thoughts

1345
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,200
occupy different uh different like different vectors right people think along different

1346
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:13,760
vectors and trajectories and sometimes they either they either do or don't match up uh so i don't

1347
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,920
really think yeah yeah i don't think that's such a thing as like being too smart or too dumb yeah

1348
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:23,440
for for to engage with someone it's just do your thought patterns like are they are they compatible

1349
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:29,360
with each other i basically agree with that um do they map to one another yeah oh yeah like i

1350
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:34,240
this reminds me of like the comic the xkcd of all the people in the train all having the same

1351
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:40,720
thought of uh all these people are just sheep only i am like the true deep one uh but i know i know

1352
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:44,720
that you're kind of joking they're they're all just unthinking you know like what i would say is

1353
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:50,400
that like they're all just i think most people come across just inherently as more like like if you

1354
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:56,960
don't know someone and then they just say a sentence you could like be like wow this is what this person

1355
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,400
thinks and nothing else how embarrassing that's simple meanwhile yeah you know like they probably

1356
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:07,520
have a lot more going on they have they have their own internal life that is not being shown to you

1357
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:12,400
just like you have that's not being shown yeah and also also there's always there's always the

1358
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:18,400
possibility that one of them who is engaging in normie topics or whatever um is doing so because

1359
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:23,120
they have nerdy topics but the normie ones are the only way they can make friends so like yeah if you

1360
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:29,280
just say out loud like i love anime like a couple people like oh the guy loves anime i love anime

1361
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:33,040
would perk up at that or something you know but not that that's necessarily the best way to do it

1362
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:38,720
but the point oh it is the best way to do it because it's very funny walk into walk in a class this is

1363
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:43,440
what these are for walk in a class wearing one of those big t-shirts that have all the um all the

1364
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:47,600
shit what's it called the the like orgasming girl faces on it you know just like all over

1365
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:53,040
hey go from hentai hey go what are those called you know a ha ha hey go a hego faces i've been

1366
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:58,800
saying can you hear me or what sorry maybe it was low jeez i said it like three times i had going

1367
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:03,920
this whole time okay so walk in a walk in a class uh no we'd be wearing a hoodie all right be wearing

1368
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,320
a hoodie and then this is like that scene in american history x where the guy walks into the

1369
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:13,200
the courtyard he takes off his shirt and there's a big nazi sign on it you'll be doing similarly

1370
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:17,520
only you take off your hoodie and you've got this shirt covered in a hego faces and everyone will

1371
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:22,880
be like it's it's putting up a flag dude you're making friends instantly by making this alternatively

1372
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,160
you could buy a pcp shirt on red bubble and get the same effect this is okay unironically this is

1373
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:34,800
kind of why i wore so many anime shirts uh like my whole life because i'm i'm putting up flags to see

1374
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:39,680
who wants to talk to me about anime guys please someone do it yeah this is like a real psychological

1375
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:44,720
thing like this is what people do they look for like i have like a waking up podcast shirt like

1376
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:49,920
why do i wear that uh one because i like sam harris and i'm happy to like you know supply

1377
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:54,000
with money and shit for his shirt but also because like i would sure like it if other people who like

1378
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,400
the same thing i like come up to me and talk to me about it uh you know that's why everybody needs to

1379
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:04,880
go to i am games and i am games t-shirt we have we have multiple designs now if you if you want to

1380
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:10,320
rep your doomer pride get a doomer t-shirt we also have a new shirt based on an old digi video

1381
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:17,520
of a pixelated ken of uh of uh of mountain dew ice also i am a fucking alicorn princess you know

1382
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:24,320
that is we should put that on that on there for posterity's sake you should yeah yeah yeah

1383
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:28,480
no this new shirt's great because it's just a pixelated can of of uh mountain dew ice and

1384
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:33,040
then under just says it's a sprite because you know it's a sprite is like my favorite videos

1385
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:38,000
did you made well we have a shirt for it now and it's a sprite of a can so it's a double meaning

1386
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,480
it's i haven't seen it i haven't seen it's a sprite google did you know is that like the pipe

1387
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:46,720
watch that video it's like a minute long it's great i highly recommend it's a good video it's

1388
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:51,840
like 24 seconds i watched it again a few days ago it's i really love that video i got it i gotta

1389
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:58,400
get that boy 24 seconds of ad revenue but just to the guy's point like obviously we're i'm not

1390
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,960
saying wear on an anime shirt like so you can talk to other anime fans like solve your problems

1391
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:07,280
but like you you probably got to break through some people's barriers to like actually get to

1392
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:11,840
know who they really are like so i don't know work on just like talking to people and not being

1393
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:17,360
weird and creepy and join join a fucking club or something be a social extracurricular activities

1394
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:21,920
are a good way he's right yes because like when you're in school everyone's like in zombie mode

1395
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:25,840
you gotta like get there yeah you're gonna have you're gonna have you're gonna have superficial

1396
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:30,400
interactions and like following following people on instagram is another superficial

1397
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:35,040
interaction you've got to engage with people on a deeper level and an extracurricular activity

1398
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:40,320
is probably a good way to get something like that good idea it's a damn good idea yeah all right

1399
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:46,080
well there you go uh moving on guys guys what do you do when you leave school there are no extracurricular

1400
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:53,200
activities they're recorded that's what i want to know www.meetup.com there's um i got that app but

1401
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:59,520
none of it's tender tender um i actually i was looking into this when i moved to Cincinnati a

1402
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,840
little while ago and like i joined excuse me i still get messages even though i want them to all go

1403
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:08,640
away there's just like it's like meetup.com and then you can just like people have clubs around

1404
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:12,800
they put them up there you just like go and you know there's people doing fun things you can go

1405
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:18,800
hang out with them and i would love to go to a game dip. I uh unironically enjoyed a bunch of like uh

1406
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:25,680
like Ohio free thinkers which is like the atheist group because i really i really like the fucking

1407
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:30,720
uh what is it called uh it's not the wake of the podcast there's there's this podcast out of Austin

1408
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:34,880
with Matt Dillahunty that i can't remember the name of that i've always wanted to be on oh the

1409
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:40,640
atheist experience and i wanted to be in a group like that of just super intellectual gods who know

1410
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:48,880
that god is just a fucking joke but you are you're in the pcp uh what you're right sometimes i need

1411
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:55,840
a bit more sick all right post christianity podcast exactly okay we got we got another one here from

1412
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:01,600
puny philosophy i don't know what that means i think there's that indian for vagina uh whatever

1413
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:07,200
no that's yoni okay i believe hey guys i see you're looking for the multiculturalism well here i am

1414
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:12,880
all the way from india yeah i hope it was all that you hoped for but uh get to my point uh can you

1415
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:18,400
guys please get digi to never talk about nihilism or subjectivity ever again yeah yes it's all an

1416
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:24,320
interesting position every dumb philosophy undergrad has to be weaned off of this everything is subjective

1417
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:28,400
nonsense this is really good also read a fucking book digi

1418
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:35,600
he should probably read a book you know what i mean indian comrades what a great what a great rib

1419
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:42,800
from from uh yeah that was a fully fully bone fully boned rib on that one uh yeah so the thing

1420
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:50,160
about digi's nihilism thing is that he's not incorrect but like you can go a lot further like

1421
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:55,440
like i feel that i have gone a few steps further i recognize that there truly is no subjective

1422
02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:02,800
reality but we can if you want we just make some assumptions and i'll listen what sorry what if you

1423
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:08,480
want peak nihilism you go to the amazing atheist youtube channel that's the biggest nihilist of

1424
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:15,920
all times am i am i right is this is this money did digi like go to like one semester of college

1425
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:21,280
take like i think it took like one philosophy class and like dropped out before it was finished i mean

1426
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:25,440
i or something like that i think there was something along those lines i don't know i'm not trying to

1427
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:31,600
rag i mean i actually i remember his mom was doing photography uh i remember his mom was doing

1428
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:36,800
photography yeah he went like with his mom that photography is not philosophy give well they sound

1429
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:42,720
yeah they're so similar are you sure they're not the same uh anyway okay good good good good philosophy

1430
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:47,840
is just photography but for the mind you take pictures of that's my subjective opinion yeah and

1431
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:54,080
you can't disprove it um so you know there there it is okay all right next mail uh here we go this

1432
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:57,840
way we've got uh three more you know if did you know if did you would show up to episodes more often

you fool but lo and behold it is not here my friends for we have to wait wait until our

1450
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:05,680
seven shitty overlords decide to get off their ass press a fucking button

1452
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:19,120
the shekels for heckles that was happening as you made this all right but that was some hardcore

1453
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:26,640
ribbing to ben for sure yeah well deserved all right yeah that sigh at the beginning was truly

1454
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:33,120
earth shattering um the weight of his mistake was instantly known to bet he the sin i'm really

1455
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:39,840
feeling the sins crawling on my back right now speaking of which um our last voicemail is from

1456
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:46,880
better ben better ben impossible let's see uh end us on a strong note

1457
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:51,520
bad things are about this is known

1458
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:58,160
fucking okay so my rabbit died and that really sucked it made me really depressed

1459
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:05,120
then the same fucking day i got stood up on a date and then the hypocrite channel the hypocrite

1460
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:10,400
channel is gone yeah that's sad but not that sad because reviews are fucking gay

1461
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:14,320
reviews are so gay and stupid and no one should do that

1462
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:22,880
fucking end uh look yeah they're bad they're so bad and they're so terrible sounds like he's not

1463
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:28,960
that sad about it actually yeah about that i agree i guess he's comforting himself with this thought

1464
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:33,920
bad things happen yeah but some of those bad things weren't that bad and yeah i think it's

1465
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:37,680
i think it's just sour grapes talking i think now now that he can't have it he has to say

1466
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:42,720
ugh reviews are stupid anyway hypocrite was dumb didn't even want it

1467
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:52,720
maybe this guy's just also named ben but he thinks he's better yeah that's my guess that's my guess

1468
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:59,520
well he's wrong he's wrong of course well i need some proof before uh extraordinary claims require

1469
02:16:59,520 --> 02:17:05,040
